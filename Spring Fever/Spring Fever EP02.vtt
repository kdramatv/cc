00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.031
Bom.

2
00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:22.124
What did you just say?

3
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.211
- Bom.
- "Bom"?

4
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:27.379
Isn't that how your friends call you?

5
00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.298
"Bom."

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.481
{\an8}EPISODE 2

7
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:48.818
{\an8}Hey.

8
00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:54.865
{\an8}We're not exactly on speaking terms.

9
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:57.910
{\an8}You know what?

10
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.957
{\an8}When you're in a rush,
you just spew out words without thinking.

11
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.292
{\an8}But Han-gyul's parents aren't coming.

12
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:06.418
{\an8}That's because...

13
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.131
{\an8}I'm sorry about last time.

14
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.263
{\an8}- Give me your phone.
- What?

15
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.690
From now on, if you have a problem,
talk to me directly.

16
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.276
If you do that in front of others,

17
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.653
it'll put them in a fix.

18
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.664
I'd rather he cussed me out.

19
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.876
He keeps acting cool. Geez.

20
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.589
Sun Han-gyul.

21
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.257
No.

22
00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:55.551
Evil Han-gyul.

23
00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:04.935
{\an8}Now, sophists

24
00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.605
{\an8}posit that there are
no universal moral standards,

25
00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.149
in other words, moral relativism.

26
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.275
On the other hand,

27
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.486
someone claimed there are
absolute, universal moral principles.

28
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.406
- Who is it?
- Sun Jae-gyu!

29
00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.827
Ma'am, could you please
move this "Sun Jae-gyu" away?

30
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.121
I can't see anything on the board

31
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.040
because of this darn pot.

32
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:29.543
No way. Thanks to this "Sun Jae-gyu,"
I can't see your face,

33
00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:31.003
and my eyes feel so happy.

34
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.547
Quiet.

35
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.718
But how do you know the name
of the person who gave this?

36
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.683
{\an8}SUN JAE-GYU

37
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:07.039
What the heck?

38
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.001
- One, two.
- One, two.

39
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.672
This isn't a gift.
It's more like a punishment.

40
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.049
Sir, can't we just keep it at school?

41
00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.133
We can't.

42
00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:20.844
I love little, cute things.

43
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:26.141
Come on. The bus stop is right over there,
so let's hang in there.

44
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.782
Hello, everyone.

45
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.910
I'm sorry,
but could you take this pot back?

46
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.831
We don't know what to do with it,
and it's so heavy that the teachers…

47
00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:54.920
Is he even human?

48
00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:05.139
Get in.

49
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.060
You can't just throw out a gift.

50
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.795
- Why are you peeking at me?
<i>- Am I busted?</i>

51
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.339
- I wasn't.
- You were.

52
00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:40.424
<i>I'm busted.</i>

53
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.886
I did look...

54
00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.263
but I was looking at the GPS.

55
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.390
I thought you remembered me.

56
00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:50.142
Remember you?

57
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.935
Haven't we met somewhere?

58
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.936
We haven't.

59
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.855
- I'm sure we have.
- I don't think so.

60
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.398
Then I must be mistaken.

61
00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.610
<i>Where on earth have we met?</i>

62
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.696
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>we were romantically involved.</i>

63
00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.491
<i>Did I take out a private loan?</i>

64
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.284
<i>Did I get kidnapped?</i>

65
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.495
<i>Or did I get robbed by him?</i>

66
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:10.496
What is it?

67
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.540
Do you want to remember me so badly?

68
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.504
I tried to remember you because you asked.

69
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.881
It's not like I want to remember you.

70
00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.007
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

71
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.844
What did you just say?

72
00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:28.347
What?

73
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.015
You just said my name.

74
00:06:31.183 --> 00:06:33.310
- "Mr. Sun Jae-gyu"?
- Yes, Ms. Bom.

75
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.315
Let's call each other by our names now.

76
00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.633
- Over there.
- Okay.

77
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.227
SUN JAE-GYU

78
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.188
Why do you show your name?

79
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.401
Do you have a problem with it?

80
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.611
I know your name,

81
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:27.322
so you don't have to keep reminding me--

82
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:31.535
Now that you know my name,
make sure to use it.

83
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:36.290
Gosh, what a killer view you've got here.

84
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.416
An ocean view.

85
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:04.067
<i>Stop looking, Bom.</i>

86
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.612
<i>Why do you keep checking him out?</i>

87
00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:10.657
Can I get a cup of coffee? Iced coffee.

88
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.495
I carried it all the way here,
and I don't get coffee?

89
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.041
Is this how
Seoul people treat their guests?

90
00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.086
I'm sorry,
but I happen to be out of coffee.

91
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.005
Then let's do it next time.

92
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.590
Sure, next time.

93
00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:27.966
When are you free?

94
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.304
On second thought, now would be better.

95
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.309
You must be dying to have coffee with me.

96
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.518
Right?

97
00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:39.937
Okay. I got it.

98
00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:47.277
What? Is he leaving?

99
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.156
He's so weird, seriously.

100
00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:00.999
TEACHER HONG JUNG-PYO

101
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.209
Hey, Ms. Bom.

102
00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:05.837
You know the environmental club
I'm in charge of, right?

103
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:09.508
I'm thinking of
putting you in charge of that.

104
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.262
<i>But you're the science teacher,</i>
<i>so why should I?</i>

105
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.390
<i>Well, I know I'm in charge of science,</i>

106
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.934
<i>but I'm overloaded</i>
<i>with head teacher duties.</i>

107
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.979
The principal also approved it,
so that's that.

108
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:22.980
Bye, then.

109
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.273
Wait. Mr. Hong!

110
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:25.857
Hey!

111
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.321
Since I've been quiet,
he must think I'm a pushover.

112
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:36.326
I don't know anything about green energy.
How can I be in charge of it?

113
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.080
Hello?

114
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:41.581
<i>Bom?</i>

115
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.253
<i>You answered my call.</i>

116
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:50.215
<i>Bom, can you at least hear me out?</i>

117
00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:53.802
<i>I regretted so much</i>
<i>after you left like that.</i>

118
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.722
<i>Whatever the reason,</i>

119
00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.851
<i>I shouldn't have said that to you</i>
<i>as a father.</i>

120
00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:02.769
<i>Bom.</i>

121
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:07.065
<i>Can you tell me where you are</i>
<i>so I can come explain myself?</i>

122
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.943
<i>I miss you so much, my daughter.</i>

123
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.820
<i>And I love you so much.</i>

124
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.240
<i>Bom, are you listening?</i>

125
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.409
<i>Bom.</i>

126
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.088
Who is it?

127
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.768
You said you were out of coffee. Take it.

128
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.396
You really didn't have to…

129
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.401
INSTANT COFFEE MIX

130
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.487
Were you crying?

131
00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.046
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

132
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.262
Bye, then.

133
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:29.773
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

134
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.027
<i>I've heard this voice before.</i>

135
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:37.614
ACTRESS JEONG NAN-HEE
GREENROOM

136
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:47.707
Jerk.

137
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.128
After you made a fancafe for me
and made it flourish…

138
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.964
How could your love ever change?

139
00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:56.883
Change?

140
00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:57.884
If I could,

141
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.471
I'd freeze you from back then
and keep you for myself.

142
00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:06.268
But you can't do me a favor
and find someone for me?

143
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.146
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

144
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.149
As the founding president
of The Chronicles of Nan-hee,

145
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.776
I'd run to you even at night
if you call me,

146
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.070
but I'm not a detective.

147
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.073
You said you know how to find people.

148
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:23.076
You yourself are looking
for your archenemy or something.

149
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.830
Are you trying to get me disbarred?

150
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:33.086
I'm asking this favor
at the risk of losing you, my biggest fan.

151
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.551
Who is it?

152
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.389
Who are you looking for?

153
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.603
My daughter.

154
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.148
Your daughter?

155
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:58.320
THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER DEBUT

156
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.989
2022 FAN MEETING IN SEOUL
JEONG NAN-HEE

157
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.454
Mom.

158
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:11.833
<i>You know.</i>

159
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.962
<i>You've seen her once.</i>

160
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.926
<i>You said she looked just like me</i>
<i>when I debuted.</i>

161
00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.014
- Right?
- Well…

162
00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.267
But she's not a kid.

163
00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.353
Where did she go?

164
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.147
I'm asking you to find her
because I don't know.

165
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.984
I don't know who she takes after,
but she's so hot-tempered.

166
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.070
I said something harsh,

167
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.781
and she disappeared.
I haven't heard from her ever since.

168
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.533
What on earth did you say?

169
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:49.955
Just find her.

170
00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:52.582
If you don't, I'll unfollow you

171
00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.459
and take revenge on you.

172
00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.130
Yes, Secretary Oh.

173
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.511
If you don't find her,

174
00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.514
I'll replace you as the fancafe president.

175
00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:10.892
Yes.

176
00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.311
Brat.

177
00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.897
Gosh, what do we do?

178
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:17.941
The court hasn't ordered to correct it.

179
00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.152
Geez. I thought
I'd be able to go find him today,

180
00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.282
so I washed my car twice
and even got my hair done in Cheongdam.

181
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.868
<i>I'm sure we'll get it by Monday,</i>
<i>so let's wait.</i>

182
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.830
Then we will find out
if Sun Jae-gyu is alive

183
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.791
<i>and where he lives.</i>

184
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.214
How have you been, guys?

185
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:42.299
Hey, Officer Lee.

186
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:44.884
Goodness.

187
00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.595
You've rearranged the desks.

188
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.222
And changed the posters.

189
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.517
And these new LED lights
are nice and bright.

190
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.228
Where did the pot go?

191
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:56.855
Is it dead again?

192
00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.775
I told you,
you shouldn't water stuckyi often.

193
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.110
Enough. Take a seat.

194
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.450
Name.

195
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.076
Sun Jae-gyu.

196
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.994
Age.

197
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:12.829
Thirty-six.

198
00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.875
You know why you're here, right?

199
00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.252
Yes, I know very well.

200
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.589
Why did you touch it?

201
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.466
Geez.

202
00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:25.884
Listen.

203
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.386
I didn't really mean to touch it.

204
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.682
- I had no choice--
- You see, there are a lot of witnesses.

205
00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:37.729
Sir, why don't we have a snack
before we keep going?

206
00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.230
Good?

207
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.446
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure.

208
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.864
Come on.

209
00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:56.539
Try it.

210
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.291
It's so sweet.

211
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.891
<i>When you feel down,</i>
<i>sweets are the best cure.</i>

212
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.727
I've definitely heard that before.

213
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.817
{\an8}SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS
ENERGY REVOLUTION

214
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.574
I've heard it before.

215
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.833
What's going on? Was there a gang fight?

216
00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.292
He's coming out!

217
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.711
In your positions!

218
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.256
Goodness.

219
00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:49.759
Welcome back!

220
00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:50.885
- Boss!
- Boss!

221
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.098
Boss. First…

222
00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:57.684
Have some of this.

223
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.315
Oh, my goodness.

224
00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:05.608
What on earth does he do

225
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.611
to eat tofu outside a police station
this early in the morning?

226
00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.999
<i>If petroleum disappears all of a sudden,</i>

227
00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.751
<i>what will happen to the world?</i>

228
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.920
<i>Most of our cars, planes, and trains</i>

229
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.547
<i>will stop running.</i>

230
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.382
<i>Shops will be empty,</i>

231
00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.010
<i>and there will be nothing left</i>
<i>for us to buy.</i>

232
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:37.390
<i>Most of the machines that make ballpoint</i>
<i>pens, bags, plates, and appliances</i>

233
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.684
<i>run on petroleum products.</i>

234
00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:43.855
<i>In fact, fossil fuel reserves</i>
<i>are finite and limited.</i>

235
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.191
<i>And we don't know when they will run out.</i>

236
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.193
<i>Let's not even try to remember.</i>

237
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.237
<i>Wherever I saw him,</i>
<i>it couldn't have been good.</i>

238
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:55.116
{\an8}<i>We have learned</i>
<i>about sustainable, eco-friendly energy,</i>

239
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.951
{\an8}<i>new renewable energy.</i>

240
00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.328
ENERGY CLUB
GREEN NARAE

241
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.458
We have roughly gone through
energy types and functions first.

242
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.417
Ma'am.

243
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.504
Are we going to stay
in the classroom all the time?

244
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.548
I hear the drone club goes on field trips.

245
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.092
Field trips, my foot.

246
00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.386
What? You don't like field trips?

247
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.514
It's not that.

248
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.141
She's an exchange teacher.

249
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.061
I doubt she's passionate enough
to do that for a club.

250
00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:24.896
Exchange teacher?

251
00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.649
Then are you going back to Seoul?

252
00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:28.858
When?

253
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.822
Regardless of when I go back,
while I'm here, I'm your club advisor

254
00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:36.616
and will do my best to guide you, so…

255
00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:37.534
Ma'am.

256
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:41.955
There's a power plant I know.
Can we go on a field trip there?

257
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.582
You know a power plant?

258
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.043
My uncle works at the power plant.

259
00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.464
Your uncle has a job?

260
00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.722
Yes, he does.

261
00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.436
Well, I mean,
he always goes around during the day

262
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.146
and hangs with scary-looking guys.

263
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.107
And I saw him
in front of a police station.

264
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.568
Plus, I thought
he liked spicy chicken skewers,

265
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.027
but he enjoys tofu too.

266
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.281
Which power plant?

267
00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.449
The one you see on Bus 23.

268
00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.786
The one with pinwheels
that look pretty at sunset?

269
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.996
Let's go there, then.

270
00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.664
I've wanted to visit that place.

271
00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.377
Well… No.

272
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.671
I'll look into another power plant.

273
00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:34.340
Now, "new renewable energy"

274
00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:39.095
is a combination of the words
"new energy" and "renewable energy."

275
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.391
You all know that fossil fuels cause
environmental damage, right?

276
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:48.062
<i>To prevent that,</i>
<i>existing fossil fuels are reused</i>

277
00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.148
<i>or converted to renewable energy</i>

278
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.525
<i>to make it eco-friendly energy.</i>

279
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.154
<i>And there are various types</i>
<i>such as solar, wind and biomass.</i>

280
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.120
Hey, don't push. Darn it.

281
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.163
Can you go faster?

282
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:40.740
Give it to me.

283
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:48.831
Goodness. When are we going
to finish at this rate? Move.

284
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.167
No, hold on. Stop.

285
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.085
Boss.

286
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:56.965
Should I explain to you what caused
the Donghak Peasant Revolution?

287
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:01.803
I know you don't smoke,
but go take a smoke break, please.

288
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:03.888
Fine.

289
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.432
This will do, right?

290
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:15.775
Hey.

291
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.986
Black Belt, this is White.

292
00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.862
Are you free to talk?

293
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:23.116
What?

294
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.328
Got it.

295
00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.206
Wrap it up without me. I'll be back.

296
00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:31.916
Sorry?

297
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:42.427
You scared me.

298
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.556
Did you oppose
Green Narae visiting my workplace?

299
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.850
Do you have CCTV cameras in school?

300
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.644
How do you know what happened
in school 145 minutes ago?

301
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:54.689
Give me a justifiable reason
why my company's out.

302
00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:56.733
<i>I can't let him get to me.</i>

303
00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.360
It's up to the teacher
to choose the place. Bye.

304
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.446
If you leave my company out,

305
00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.282
Palryongpo Suho Energy is 27 km away,

306
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.868
and Seomigot Doseong Solar is 35 km away.

307
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.953
It's not like the school has a car.

308
00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:11.247
How will you take the kids to one of them?

309
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:16.627
But there's no justifiable reason
why we should go to your company either.

310
00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:18.004
There is.

311
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:19.422
What is it?

312
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:23.384
They refused to give Han-gyul
the Filial Piety Award.

313
00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:25.053
But I'm his parent.

314
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.638
I'd like to use this chance
to show his friends

315
00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.599
how his uncle works.

316
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.351
<i>I can't let him get to me, but…</i>

317
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.524
I'll think about it.

318
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.277
If you're not sure about my company...

319
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.530
we can go check it out this weekend.

320
00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:47.075
- Just you and me?
- Is that what you want?

321
00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:48.576
Of course not.

322
00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:51.954
Why would I when there's Han-gyul?
The three of us can go.

323
00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.332
You said you'll go.

324
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:56.626
<i>What? He got me.</i>

325
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.420
This Saturday at 12:00 p.m.
I'll pick you up at your place.

326
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:11.974
Darn it.

327
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.858
REPORT CARD

328
00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:24.779
Korean, second place.
Overall, second place.

329
00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.988
Grade 2.

330
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:28.950
Everything is two!

331
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.330
Remember what you said?

332
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:37.458
You said you'd be the top student
at Shinsu High.

333
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.752
You said you'd get Grade 1.

334
00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:40.753
Did I?

335
00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.631
I didn't say that.
You said that's what I should do.

336
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:44.841
You must.

337
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:48.678
Don't you know we're all stuck
in this countryside to get you Grade 1?

338
00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.222
Keep this in mind.

339
00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:54.475
You have to keep getting
the best grades until you graduate

340
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.644
to barely end up with Grade 1.

341
00:23:58.396 --> 00:23:59.730
Am I beef?

342
00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:02.108
You always go on about Grade 1
when you see me.

343
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:04.610
Hey. If you want grade-one beef,

344
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:06.696
you can buy it for 99,000 won, at least.

345
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.909
I shouldn't eat it,
since its grade is higher than mine.

346
00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:12.827
Geez.

347
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:16.539
That brat. If only you studied
as hard as you talk back.

348
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.457
- That little…
- Goodness.

349
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:29.760
Darn it. They're so frustrating!

350
00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:31.387
I hate them!

{\an8}<i>Can I stay at your place this weekend?</i>

355
00:24:53.409 --> 00:24:55.328
Han-gyul, I'm home.

356
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.996
Hey.

357
00:24:58.831 --> 00:24:59.665
Here.

358
00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.294
It's hot.

359
00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:06.797
Right. I heard Dong-pyo called you again.

360
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:07.924
What did he say?

361
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.968
Did you meet my teacher and argue again?

362
00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:12.762
Argue? Please.

363
00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:15.097
We settled amicably.

364
00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:19.185
She agreed to decide
after checking out the place.

365
00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:20.353
Really?

366
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:21.312
Of course.

367
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:23.272
Don't you know your uncle?

368
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:28.319
But the guys said she wouldn't bother
since she's an exchange teacher.

369
00:25:29.403 --> 00:25:31.447
Exchange teacher? What's that?

370
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.241
She's going back to Seoul.

371
00:25:33.324 --> 00:25:34.158
What?

372
00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.494
- When? Why?
- I don't know.

373
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:40.748
But I wonder why
she came all the way down here.

374
00:25:42.124 --> 00:25:44.543
I think her family
and friends are all in Seoul.

375
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:09.193
Sun Jae-gyu.

376
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:13.406
{\an8}If I let you get to me again today,

377
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:15.283
I'm not human, I'm a squid.

378
00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:17.159
I'm a freaking dried radish.

379
00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:25.209
All right.
Time to start another gloomy day.

380
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.503
Don't smile.

381
00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:29.463
Don't have fun.

382
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:31.966
Don't be happy.

383
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.011
You've got this.

384
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:36.721
Ninety-six.

385
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:38.306
Ninety-seven.

386
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:39.807
Ninety-eight.

387
00:26:40.433 --> 00:26:42.059
Ninety-nine.

388
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.481
Gosh, the weather's so nice today.

389
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.192
What about Han-gyul?

390
00:26:51.902 --> 00:26:52.778
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

391
00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:55.156
I'll sit in the back--

392
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:57.700
Get in.

393
00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:07.710
Now, put on your seat belt.

394
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:19.680
Let's get going.

395
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:36.697
Do you have plans after this?

396
00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:38.783
I don't.

397
00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:41.827
I thought you were going to a funeral.

398
00:27:43.454 --> 00:27:46.707
You always wear dark clothes,
as if you're in mourning.

399
00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:53.172
Did you just criticize my outfit?

400
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.966
What about you?
Why are you always dressed like that?

401
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.095
Have you ever thought about
pursuing fashion, not function?

402
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:03.808
Working clothes
just need to be comfortable.

403
00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:07.061
Look. This is
four-way stretch spandex fabric.

404
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.980
It's really comfortable when you work.

405
00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:12.149
Is your nickname "Shadow"?

406
00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:14.151
SE-JIN

407
00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:18.239
Hey.

408
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:21.659
<i>You said to tell you directly</i>
<i>if I had a problem with you.</i>

409
00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:24.495
Where?

410
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.082
Got it.

411
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:31.419
Uncle, let me out.

412
00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:43.597
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.
I'll join you later.

413
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:44.557
Okay, see you.

414
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.309
Han-gyul!

415
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:50.354
What's with you?

416
00:28:50.438 --> 00:28:52.898
You let him out without asking him why?

417
00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:55.276
He can take care of himself. Why worry?

418
00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:57.236
Even so…

419
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.905
So? Should we go without him?

420
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:02.700
Of course, we should go with him.

421
00:29:03.617 --> 00:29:04.827
Then we'll wait.

422
00:29:07.872 --> 00:29:09.039
Want to go watch a movie?

423
00:29:09.623 --> 00:29:11.584
Why would I do that with a parent?

424
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:13.711
Then…

425
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:16.630
There's a quiet, secluded walking trail
over the underpass.

426
00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:17.756
How about going there?

427
00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:20.885
No. I don't like quiet, secluded places.

428
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:24.805
Let's go to a loud and crowded place.

429
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:26.807
Sure.

430
00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:37.151
SHINSU TERMINAL

431
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:46.952
Choi Se-jin!

432
00:29:52.208 --> 00:29:53.125
What the heck?

433
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.420
Did you come to find me?

434
00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:59.590
What were you talking about?
Run away because of me?

435
00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:03.969
I'm always in second place because of you.

436
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:08.265
Unless you vanish,
I'm going to end up in second place.

437
00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:11.894
But unfortunately, I'm someone
who must be in first place.

438
00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:15.856
So I'm leaving for a place without you.

439
00:30:25.282 --> 00:30:27.159
ARE YOU STAYING AT MY PLACE TONIGHT?

440
00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:28.661
YES. I'M LEAVING NOW.

441
00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:30.496
"Jjun"?

442
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.289
Who is that?

443
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:37.670
Someone who'd love me
even if I'm in second place.

444
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.587
Is it a man?

445
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:40.172
Would it be a woman?

446
00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:43.217
Are you getting in?

447
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.385
Coming.

448
00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:46.512
Hey.

449
00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:48.847
Take care, Grade 1.

450
00:30:56.146 --> 00:30:58.857
NO STOPOVERS
SHINSU TO SEOUL

451
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:05.489
Sir!

452
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:22.047
{\an8}SUN JAE-GYU
I AM IN AWE

453
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:24.133
{\an8}Is there a celebrity named Sun Jae-gyu?

454
00:31:24.842 --> 00:31:27.928
Hey, there's an autograph
of someone named Sun Jae-gyu…

455
00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:28.929
That's me.

456
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:32.266
Why do you write your name everywhere?

457
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:40.566
Don't bother looking at the menu.

458
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:42.484
The only thing we should order

459
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:43.986
is o<i>sam bulgogi.</i>

460
00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:50.993
LACQUER CHICKEN SOUP AVAILABLE

461
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.538
<i>- It's good.</i>
<i>- Really?</i>

462
00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.040
<i>Want some more?</i>

463
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.627
You have to get better soon.

464
00:32:00.878 --> 00:32:02.004
Open up.

465
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:18.062
Two o<i>sam bulgogis, </i>please.

466
00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:19.355
Lacquer chicken soup.

467
00:32:20.689 --> 00:32:22.107
Large or medium?

468
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:23.651
Medium, please.

469
00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:25.944
Damn it.

470
00:32:26.528 --> 00:32:30.240
I'll take you to a bathhouse
and boil you in the hottest tub.

471
00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:33.702
Before I make your freaking waist
look like an hourglass,

472
00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:34.870
order the large one.

473
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:35.954
Understood?

474
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.707
Answer me!

475
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:39.708
Okay!

476
00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:41.669
Large, please.

477
00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:43.087
Large. Yes.

478
00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.343
She still looks healthy.

479
00:33:21.417 --> 00:33:22.793
You don't have an appetite?

480
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:27.840
You see...

481
00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:33.679
I've lost money, friends,
and even the will to live,

482
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:37.474
but I've never lost
my appetite in my life.

483
00:33:38.976 --> 00:33:40.644
Then you must be a picky eater.

484
00:33:43.564 --> 00:33:47.693
I've never produced any food waste
except for watermelon rinds.

485
00:33:48.444 --> 00:33:49.278
I see.

486
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.872
<i>Wait, the way he eats,</i>

487
00:34:00.581 --> 00:34:02.332
<i>I think I've seen it before.</i>

488
00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:08.964
What is it?

489
00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:11.383
Oh, nothing.

490
00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:13.802
Not long ago, I think I saw

491
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:16.722
someone similar to you
in front of a police station.

492
00:34:19.308 --> 00:34:20.184
Did you see that?

493
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.189
I ended up there
because I did something to a woman.

494
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:29.318
What did you do to that woman?

495
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:53.425
- What?
- Come on!

496
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.844
You damn punk.

497
00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:58.222
How dare you touch my car?

498
00:34:58.305 --> 00:34:59.515
Are you insane?

499
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:01.642
This is a brand-new car
I got her yesterday.

500
00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:02.935
I didn't really touch it.

501
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.103
Hello? Is this the police?

502
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:09.191
- I want to report someone.
- Tell them to come and get this crazy guy.

503
00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.819
- My goodness!
- Report or sue me, do that later.

504
00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:12.736
Move aside.

505
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.655
Get out of the way, now.

506
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:21.203
- I should take a picture.
- Come on!

507
00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:23.956
Look carefully.

508
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:25.123
Move aside.

509
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.673
<i>I hardly even touched it.</i>

510
00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:34.633
<i>"Touched it"?</i>

511
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.760
And her husband had to be there.

512
00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:38.011
<i>In front of her husband?</i>

513
00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:42.224
This kind of thing happens often.
It's okay. Don't worry.

514
00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:47.187
By any chance,

515
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.525
the scar on Mr. Hong's palm…

516
00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:54.319
Was it your doing?

517
00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:09.334
What the hell is a teacher doing here?

518
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.760
<i>Maybe he didn't want</i>
<i>to give Han-gyul the award</i>

519
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.012
<i>- because of that.</i>
- My hand.

520
00:36:36.987 --> 00:36:38.572
Han-gyul is running late.

521
00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:40.699
I think we should go home for today.

522
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.081
Mr. Sun, your face…

523
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:50.375
Your face is…

524
00:37:05.307 --> 00:37:08.435
Geez, a man shouldn't get
hives on his face

525
00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:09.728
over some food.

526
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:16.777
How could you be so foolish?

527
00:37:17.903 --> 00:37:21.531
I recover really fast,
so it'll all be gone in an hour, okay?

528
00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:26.161
If you had an allergy,
you should've let me eat it alone.

529
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:28.497
Come on.

530
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.833
You wouldn't have enjoyed it, then.

531
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:34.586
Food tastes best when you eat it together.

532
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.671
Aren't I right?

533
00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:46.390
Are you laughing?

534
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:02.990
<i>Don't smile.</i>

535
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:05.784
<i>Don't have fun.</i>

536
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:08.537
<i>Don't be happy.</i>

537
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:19.548
Let me see your face.

538
00:39:17.314 --> 00:39:18.356
Oh, no!

539
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:31.870
Look. Don't ever

540
00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:34.539
touch my body again. Okay?

541
00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:56.728
Hey, Han-gyul.

542
00:39:58.855 --> 00:39:59.773
Okay.

543
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:01.483
With who?

544
00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:04.653
Where?

545
00:40:05.779 --> 00:40:07.030
What's going on?

546
00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:09.950
Do you have money?

547
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:12.828
I understand.

548
00:40:13.495 --> 00:40:16.540
Buy her a meal as soon as you arrive,
and take care of her.

549
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:19.584
Text me where you are later,
and I'll go get you.

550
00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:22.462
Okay, bye.

551
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.340
I'm afraid I have to go.

552
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.342
Why? Where's Han-gyul?

553
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:28.677
Who is he with?

554
00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:32.597
Well…

555
00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:36.601
His classmate named Choi Se-jin
ran away from home.

556
00:40:36.685 --> 00:40:37.811
And he followed her.

557
00:40:37.894 --> 00:40:39.688
- Se-jin?
- Yes.

558
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:41.731
I can't give you a ride. Get home safe.

559
00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:45.610
"Get home safe"?

560
00:40:46.695 --> 00:40:49.447
I'm their homeroom teacher,
not you, Mr. Sun.

561
00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:56.121
Where do we go?

562
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.334
To Seoul.

563
00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:11.887
PARENT-TEACHER MEETING ON EDUCATION

564
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.305
Take good care of my kid.

565
00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:15.348
Sure. Thank you so much for coming.

566
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.101
Hello, ma'am.

567
00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:19.686
I'm A-ram's father.

568
00:41:20.729 --> 00:41:23.565
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy schedule.

569
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:27.277
A-ram must be happy
since she has such a caring dad.

570
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.361
Well, yes.

571
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:30.530
Thank you.

572
00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:41.875
GETS ALONG WITH FRIENDS
AND IS RESPONSIBLE…

573
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.424
OH A-RAM'S FATHER

574
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.635
<i>How was your day? Was it good?</i>

575
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:56.598
<i>If you have a hard time at school,</i>
<i>let me know.</i>

576
00:41:56.681 --> 00:42:00.310
<i>As you said, I'm quite a caring man.</i>

577
00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:04.439
<i>What's the perfume you were wearing</i>
<i>at school? I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

578
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:08.652
<i>Why aren't you replying? I miss you.</i>

579
00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:12.739
<i>Where are you? Can we meet for a moment?</i>

580
00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:24.251
I'm so disappointed.

581
00:42:26.336 --> 00:42:27.420
Is it true?

582
00:42:27.504 --> 00:42:29.631
No way. Ms. Bom would never do that.

583
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:30.882
They have proof.

584
00:42:30.966 --> 00:42:33.551
If they didn't,
why would A-ram's mom do that?

585
00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:36.930
She pretended to be all ethical,
but she was having an affair.

586
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:40.183
Gosh, she's disgusting.
She makes me throw up.

587
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:48.608
What's wrong?

588
00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:55.073
Never mind.

589
00:42:58.285 --> 00:42:59.286
Let's go…

590
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:03.206
to Seoul.

591
00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:38.533
Hey, Evil Han-gyul.

592
00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:40.493
"Evil Han-gyul"?

593
00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:43.413
This is why I call you Evil Han-gyul.

594
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:45.623
I ran away from home because of you.

595
00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:47.959
I ran away to get away from you,

596
00:43:48.043 --> 00:43:50.503
so why are you following me
and bothering me?

597
00:43:51.212 --> 00:43:52.339
Aren't you hungry?

598
00:43:53.298 --> 00:43:54.883
Let's go eat by the Hangang River.

599
00:43:56.843 --> 00:43:59.095
Why would a runaway
do such a romantic thing?

600
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.974
I didn't run all the way here
to do normal things like that.

601
00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:05.602
This is my first time in Seoul.

602
00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:07.020
What?

603
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:10.273
You've never been to places
like Seoul World Tower?

604
00:44:10.357 --> 00:44:11.858
I've only seen them online.

605
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:17.447
Since it's my first time here,
I should do something before I go back.

606
00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:21.326
And we skipped lunch
because we took a bus.

607
00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:26.081
Whether you run away or do whatever,

608
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.249
do it after you eat.

609
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.335
Let's go.

610
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:33.213
Follow me.

611
00:44:44.808 --> 00:44:46.810
How does it feel to be overly talented?

612
00:44:50.939 --> 00:44:53.817
I'm never talented enough.

613
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:57.487
I failed to get into a better school,

614
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.280
and I'm always in second place.

615
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:03.576
And you get Grade 1
when you're not going to college.

616
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.329
And you're always in first place.

617
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:08.748
Are you jealous?

618
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:11.334
I'm frustrated.

619
00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:14.879
Can I ask you something?

620
00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:17.966
How does it feel to have parents?

621
00:45:19.092 --> 00:45:20.718
It really sucks.

622
00:45:21.261 --> 00:45:23.555
It sucks even more not to have parents.

623
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:27.267
Now I can't live with my dad
even for a day.

624
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.644
I wish I could live with my dad for a day.

625
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.563
And I don't want to talk to my mom.

626
00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:33.690
I wish I could talk to my mom
for a second.

627
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.568
You have such a good uncle.

628
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.446
No matter how good, he's still not my mom.

629
00:45:41.156 --> 00:45:42.699
Hong Jung-pyo told me

630
00:45:43.408 --> 00:45:45.785
I have no parents,
so I can't get the Filial Award.

631
00:45:46.578 --> 00:45:49.831
I wasn't angry because he said
he wouldn't give me the award.

632
00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:53.084
It was because I felt like he was right...

633
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:57.589
Sometimes, being good to my uncle

634
00:45:57.672 --> 00:46:00.675
feels like I'm just repaying him
for what he did for me.

635
00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:07.891
Evil Han-gyul.

636
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.227
You never fail to beat me.

637
00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:14.022
In this situation,

638
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:16.900
you pull the "no-parents" card?

639
00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:19.277
You're just making me look bad.

640
00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:32.165
MEET ME AT HANGANG RIVER STATION AT 8

641
00:46:36.753 --> 00:46:39.756
I hope you've made
pleasant memories in Seoul.

642
00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:41.674
I enjoyed talking to you.

643
00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:44.093
Where are you going?

644
00:46:45.762 --> 00:46:46.596
Se-jin!

645
00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:48.348
Hey!

646
00:46:55.188 --> 00:46:56.272
What are you doing?

647
00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:59.567
My back hurts so much
because of that stupid pot.

648
00:47:00.944 --> 00:47:03.821
This is bad.
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday.

649
00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:05.907
My wrists hurt too,

650
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.327
and my neck feels so stiff.
I'm not feeling well.

651
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.246
If it were ten years ago,

652
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.790
when Sun Jae-gyu came into the office,

653
00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:16.876
I would've had him
in a headlock and choked him.

654
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.919
Right?

655
00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:19.921
By the way,

656
00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:23.716
it's the sports festival tomorrow,
but our PE teacher's in bad shape.

657
00:47:24.717 --> 00:47:26.177
You heard the principal, right?

658
00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:29.180
Our school's sports festival
is basically Shinsu's Olympics.

659
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:30.682
He's putting in so much effort.

660
00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:33.017
Speaking of which,

661
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:35.770
why don't we work out together?

662
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.313
- Work out?
- Yes.

663
00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:38.982
Let's do it. I'm in.

664
00:47:39.065 --> 00:47:41.109
But what would be good?

665
00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:43.695
If we want to learn skills fast,

666
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:45.947
- we should do boxing.
- Oh, boxing.

667
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.157
Learn fast? I'll end up hurting my knees.

668
00:47:48.241 --> 00:47:51.619
Then, how about we begin
with something light like soccer?

669
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:55.415
I'm quite introverted,
so I can't play with strangers.

670
00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:56.874
Then how about climbing?

671
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:58.585
That's best for muscle strengthening.

672
00:47:58.668 --> 00:48:00.837
Don't you know I have a fear of heights?

673
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.089
You say no to everything!
What should we do then?

674
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.257
I don't know.

675
00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:07.302
I got it.

676
00:48:07.969 --> 00:48:11.306
It won't hurt your knees.
It's okay even if you're an introvert

677
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.850
or have a fear of heights.
It's perfect for us.

678
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:15.935
What is it?

679
00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.876
Mr. Hong said he'd come,
but he's not here.

680
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:41.252
Why are you here instead?

681
00:48:41.878 --> 00:48:44.213
I want to become like Han-gyul's uncle.

682
00:48:44.297 --> 00:48:45.131
What?

683
00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:48.301
Listen, ma'am.

684
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:51.929
Have you ever heard the saying that
you can't grow teeth at the age of 80?

685
00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:55.642
Snails may cross the ocean
and boiled beans may sprout,

686
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:59.854
but how can a woman become like him
when even men can't?

687
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.065
That's exactly why I'm doing this!

688
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:05.526
You male teachers
look down on women like this,

689
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.404
so of course, the male students
never listen to women!

690
00:49:08.488 --> 00:49:10.698
They say teachers' authority
has hit rock bottom.

691
00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:13.117
But do you know
where female teachers' authority lies?

692
00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:15.078
It's underground!

693
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.998
- Hello.
- Hello.

694
00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:20.708
Hello.

695
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.589
I'm glad you came.

696
00:49:26.673 --> 00:49:27.507
Master.

697
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:31.469
I really want to learn the skills
as fast as possible.

698
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:32.804
How long will it take?

699
00:49:32.887 --> 00:49:35.765
Well, it depends on the person,

700
00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:38.810
but I can guarantee
that trainees at my dojo learn

701
00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:41.187
twice as fast as those at other dojos.

702
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:45.483
You must have some kind of secret method.

703
00:49:48.027 --> 00:49:51.864
You see, there's a legendary black belt
at this dojo.

704
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.545
He's one of the 700 great masters
in Korea.

705
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:18.015
He's an elite who went from a white belt
to a black belt in seven years.

706
00:50:22.103 --> 00:50:25.606
<i>He even perfectly mastered</i>
<i>the legendary Imanari Roll.</i>

707
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.150
<i>He's the pride of our dojo.</i>

708
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:32.572
If you spar with him,
your skills and stamina will...

709
00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:34.574
get better fast.

710
00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:38.327
When is that great person coming?

711
00:50:39.412 --> 00:50:42.206
He usually shows up around this time.

712
00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:46.169
I wonder what happened. He's late today.

713
00:51:01.726 --> 00:51:02.977
Are you sure he's here?

714
00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:06.397
He texted me he was here five minutes ago.

715
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.234
I guess he can't answer
because he's with her.

716
00:51:13.279 --> 00:51:16.073
Let's split up.
You go right, and I'll go left.

717
00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:17.575
Okay.

718
00:51:18.993 --> 00:51:20.703
Where did this punk go? Darn it.

719
00:51:49.065 --> 00:51:49.899
Jjun!

720
00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.903
I missed you so much!

721
00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:57.740
I lost my way. Seoul is so far.

722
00:51:57.824 --> 00:52:00.618
I'm so hungry.
Buy me something delicious, please?

723
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.168
- Uncle!
- Hey.

724
00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:11.879
Why are you alone?

725
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.840
What about Choi Se-jin?

726
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:16.425
- I lost her.
- You lost her?

727
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.847
To tell the truth, I didn't tell you
because you'd worry,

728
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:22.849
but she kept texting some guy.

729
00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:25.852
And the guy told her to stay the night...

730
00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:29.146
at his place.

731
00:52:29.856 --> 00:52:31.107
At his place?

732
00:52:32.024 --> 00:52:36.737
<i>The Inner Circle train toward Hangang Naru</i>
<i>is now approaching.</i>

733
00:52:41.826 --> 00:52:43.536
Se-jin!

734
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:46.998
Darn it.

735
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:55.965
Hello?

736
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.884
I found her.

737
00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:01.512
We just got on the train,
but she's with some guy.

738
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:03.139
I'm coming.

739
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:07.268
We don't know who he is.
Who knows what he'll do to you?

740
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:08.352
Wait right there.

741
00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.857
I can't. The train's leaving now.

742
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.942
Then let's meet at the next station.

743
00:53:15.026 --> 00:53:16.152
The next station?

744
00:53:16.986 --> 00:53:18.070
How will we…

745
00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:19.906
Hello?

746
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:21.157
Take the next train.

747
00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:25.328
No way.

748
00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:05.201
{\an8}YOUR CURRENT SPEED

749
00:54:10.122 --> 00:54:12.208
{\an8}SLOW DOWN

750
00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:12.309
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

751
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.979
We've got this!

752
00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:20.192
- Let's go!
- What the heck?

753
00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:24.822
<i>I'm coming.</i>

754
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:26.824
<i>Just wait for me.</i>

755
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:33.789
<i>This stop is Hangang Naru Station.</i>

756
00:55:33.873 --> 00:55:34.874
<i>The doors…</i>

757
00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:39.378
PROTECT THE EARTH!
NO EARTH, NO US

758
00:56:18.918 --> 00:56:19.835
I knew it.

759
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:28.594
What?

760
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.222
Choi Se-jin!

761
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:34.642
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Coming through.

762
00:56:35.976 --> 00:56:37.394
Get out of the way!

763
00:56:39.522 --> 00:56:40.689
Move.

764
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:45.820
Mr. Sun?

765
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:43.127
<i>Now I remember</i>

766
00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:44.879
<i>this man.</i>

767
00:58:57.493 --> 00:58:58.661
{\an8}Mister.

768
00:58:58.744 --> 00:59:00.621
{\an8}<i>Sun Jae-gyu?</i>

769
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:04.333
{\an8}<i>I wanted to forgive him,</i>
<i>but I want to take revenge now.</i>

770
00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:05.960
{\an8}Didn't you lose your other half?

771
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:09.505
{\an8}Can you treat it?

772
00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:11.215
{\an8}You've fallen for him.

773
00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:14.843
{\an8}<i>What's a guy like Sun Jae-gyu</i>
<i>doing with a woman like that?</i>

774
00:59:14.927 --> 00:59:17.429
{\an8}<i>She was crying her eyes out.</i>

775
00:59:18.097 --> 00:59:19.890
{\an8}<i>Look carefully from now on.</i>

776
00:59:20.432 --> 00:59:22.184
<i>It's definitely an approval.</i>

777
00:59:22.268 --> 00:59:23.310
<i>Jae-gyu!</i>

778
