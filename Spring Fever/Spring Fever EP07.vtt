﻿1
00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.660
Sun Han-gyul.

2
00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.331
That's his name.

3
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.296
I'll come back for you.

4
00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.757
I'll come for you two.

5
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.185
{\an8}EPISODE 7

6
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:46.023
{\an8}<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.</i>
<i>Please leave a voicemail after the beep.</i>

7
00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:49.151
{\an8}I told you clearly.

8
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.404
{\an8}If I don't hear from you today...

9
00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:54.990
{\an8}you're dead to me.

10
00:01:57.243 --> 00:01:58.452
{\an8}From now on,

11
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.163
{\an8}you're nobody to me.

12
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.375
{\an8}I'm erasing your name,
your face, everything.

13
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:08.546
{\an8}EDIT - DELETE

14
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.505
{\an8}DELETE?
YES

15
00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:21.392
YES
NO

16
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.018
BIG SIS

17
00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:32.862
THAT WOMAN

18
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.493
<i>I...</i>

19
00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.079
<i>I haven't even touched</i>
<i>your fingernail, but...</i>

20
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:44.582
But you had...

21
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.585
coffee with her...

22
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:50.754
and held hands with her.

23
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.551
So…

24
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.264
you were mad at me because of that?

25
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:04.727
You told me to trust you,
and you did that with another woman.

26
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.271
You're right, Ms. Bom.

27
00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.191
What?

28
00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.236
I, Sun Jae-gyu...

29
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:17.740
don't keep my word.

30
00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.075
I'm not as strong as I look,

31
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:26.081
and I'm not intelligent, cultured,
refined or patient.

32
00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.588
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.258
I can't wait any longer.

34
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.456
Ms. Bom.

35
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:51.083
Ms. Bom.

36
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.460
Ms. Bom!

37
00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.466
Ms. Bom.

38
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.303
I'm not normally like this.

39
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:07.683
Why are you so impatient?

40
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.102
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:14.398
A man's fiery heart
can only take so much. Gosh.

42
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.399
Well,

43
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.028
the one who started the fire
is partly responsible.

44
00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:23.282
Let's not talk about this anymore.

45
00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:26.577
But...

46
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:33.167
you've got to tell me who she is.

47
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.172
Who is she? An ex?

48
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.383
A female friend? Or...

49
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:43.802
your current girlfriend?

50
00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:46.055
Absolutely not.

51
00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:47.181
Then who is she?

52
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.771
She's actually...

53
00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.234
- from insurance.
- From insurance?

54
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.404
Who gets that close
with an insurance agent?

55
00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:04.364
Which type of insurance?

56
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.658
What type of coverage is it?

57
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.536
Well...

58
00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.039
What was it called?

59
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.334
Actual expense health insurance.

60
00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:18.629
She said people live to be 100 these days,

61
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.547
so I can't go without health insurance.

62
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.467
Apparently, she's known as

63
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.886
the Doberman of the insurance world.

64
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.679
Once she bites, she never lets go.

65
00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:29.598
So, did she bite you?

66
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.809
Come on, Ms. Bom.

67
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.604
I'm the kind of guy
who's basically insurance himself.

68
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.482
I never get sick,
so why bother with insurance?

69
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:39.775
Then she'll come back.

70
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.444
That won't happen.

71
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:45.864
If that woman comes back...

72
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:50.911
I told you clearly.

73
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.873
I erased your name, your face, everything.

74
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.378
If you show up around here again...

75
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.841
you're dead.

76
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:08.804
All right, I understand.

77
00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:15.435
So, we're good now?

78
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:22.901
I just need to wait two years
as we promised.

79
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.113
Yes, two years.

80
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:30.200
Right, two years.

81
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.163
You should go.

82
00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:37.291
Sure. I'm off, then.

83
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.051
- By the way...
- Yes, what is it?

84
00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:52.306
Don't we get a vacation or something?

85
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.725
- A vacation?
- Yes.

86
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:56.894
What's a vacation for?

87
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.062
Well, you see,

88
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:01.899
vacations are meant to
improve productivity, right?

89
00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:02.858
So...

90
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:08.113
if I could just spend a day with you,

91
00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:10.199
eat some good food, and go on a date,

92
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:15.495
I think I could patiently wait
for two years.

93
00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:22.461
Or maybe not?

94
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:27.132
Just for a day, right?

95
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.717
Yes.

96
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.388
Just one day after Green Narae wraps up?

97
00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:35.849
You got it! Just one day.

98
00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.315
Are you really going to Shinsu?

99
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.275
What do you mean, "stop"?

100
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:48.779
My daughter, whom I haven't heard from
in over a year, called me at 7:48 a.m.

101
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.739
asking for tickets
to Song Ga-in's concert.

102
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.491
How could I stop? I should go for it.

103
00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:56.787
You got the wrong signal,
so back up first.

104
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.958
What's going on?

105
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:05.420
I thought Bom's sudden change of heart
was all part of your big picture.

106
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.012
You said earlier,

107
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.850
that if anything came up,
I should make sure to hire you.

108
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:24.690
Unfortunately, I did...

109
00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:26.483
say that.

110
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:31.446
I'd like to officially hire you
to handle the settlement...

111
00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.158
for Sun Jae-gyu's assault case.

112
00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:42.874
<i>I was trying to draw the big picture,</i>

113
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.585
but my pencil slipped for a moment.

114
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.089
How distracted were you
for your pencil to slip?

115
00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:51.967
There's no need to rush.

116
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.594
If you can't do it,
just give me the address.

117
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.471
I've already packed up,

118
00:09:56.555 --> 00:10:00.100
so I'll go myself
and finish this face to face.

119
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.729
Are you saying you can't trust me?

120
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.481
Do you want a monthly report or something?

121
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.154
Do you actually have a plan?

122
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.866
So the thief

123
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.952
got caught red-handed
in Jjang-gu's chili field?

124
00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:20.120
Who was it?

125
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.581
Who took it all,
the <i>meju </i>and the gold medal?

126
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.082
- A deer.
- A deer?

127
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.293
There was a deer in the field...

128
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.961
- Yeah.
- ...and its neck was shining.

129
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.379
- My goodness.
- It turns out

130
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:31.882
it was wearing
Dong-pyo's grandma's gold medal.

131
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.300
My goodness.

132
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.845
We blamed the wrong person.

133
00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.221
That could've been bad.

134
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.142
My goodness. Look at that.

135
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.560
Isn't that Mr. Evil Thoughts?

136
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:07.542
Oh, dear. That's terrifying.

137
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.839
It's such a beautiful day today!

138
00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:19.262
He plowed the field in the scorching sun.
Did the sun fry his brain?

139
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.391
He's smiling like an idiot.
Where's he going?

140
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:38.657
He graduated top of his class
in law at Hanguk University.

141
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.660
He also finished
the 47th Judicial Training Institute

142
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.995
at the top of his class.

143
00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:49.709
He was recognized for his exceptional
talent as a junior lawyer

144
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.879
at Law Firm Sujun,

145
00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:56.216
winning the Outstanding New Lawyer Award.

146
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.596
There's still a lot left.

147
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.807
If you're going to go over
my whole résumé,

148
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.017
your voice might give out, Mr. Hong.

149
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.531
"Meet a successful professional."

150
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:23.076
What do you all think success is?

151
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:26.997
Here's what I think success really is.

152
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.792
SOMEONE ON MY SIDE

153
00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:37.549
"Someone on my side"?

154
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.763
Having someone fully on your side,

155
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.641
is there anything
more successful than that?

156
00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.353
When I meet a client for the first time,

157
00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.606
I always start with this promise.

158
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.401
"I'll be on your side."

159
00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.582
We all face unfair situations at times.

160
00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:14.836
Sometimes, people you trusted
turn their backs on you,

161
00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.381
and it feels like no one's on your side.

162
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.844
Don't.

163
00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.056
Completely being on your side.

164
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:30.393
That's what being a lawyer is all about.

165
00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:47.619
Uncle.

166
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.916
I need a small favor.

167
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:57.045
Could you order some nice <i>galbi</i>
for the Green Narae field trip?

168
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.386
Come on!

169
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.056
What? Why?

170
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.766
Did you lose some muscle in your jaw?

171
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.977
You've been going around
with that grin lately.

172
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.438
Why? Everyone keeps saying
something's off about me.

173
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:20.735
See for yourself.

174
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.120
Why on earth
are you walking around like that?

175
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.041
The truth is,

176
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.960
after this field trip,

177
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.130
I'm going on a date for one day
with Ms. Bom.

178
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.551
Just imagine going on a date with Se-jin.

179
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.177
Could you stop smiling?

180
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.388
Well, I get that.

181
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.434
Ms. Bom might be turned off
if you act like this.

182
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.144
Why would she get turned off?

183
00:14:57.314 --> 00:15:01.192
Se-jin's brother came to school today,
all dressed up in a suit.

184
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.614
Even with all those people watching,
he stayed composed and spoke perfectly.

185
00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:08.908
Everyone in the auditorium was so moved
that they gave him a standing ovation.

186
00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:11.995
I have no plans for college,
yet I almost wanted to be a lawyer.

187
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.163
What about Ms. Bom?

188
00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.248
Did she give a standing ovation too?

189
00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:16.833
She clapped the most.

190
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.633
To be honest,

191
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.179
you won't be an official couple
for another two years.

192
00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.182
Until then, she's free to date anyone.

193
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:36.853
So stop acting silly
and tone down the grin.

194
00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.563
Got it?

195
00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.150
Got it.

196
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.738
So your teacher gave a standing ovation
to Choi I-jun?

197
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.491
Watch closely on this field trip.

198
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.660
See how your teacher reacts.

199
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.745
- Got it?
- Got it.

200
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.589
Enjoy.

201
00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:11.096
You know Choi I-jun, the lawyer?

202
00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:13.848
He pointed right at me

203
00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.518
and said, "I'll be on your side."

204
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.689
Suddenly, I could barely breathe,
and my heart started racing like crazy.

205
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:25.068
I heard he and Sun Jae-gyu
are the same age.

206
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.278
And yet, they're completely different.

207
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.614
- Right? The other day...
- Yes.

208
00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:32.909
...did you see Sun Jae-gyu
acting out in handcuffs?

209
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.620
How could women flock to that thief?

210
00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:36.955
I just don't get it.

211
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.045
I should set a few things straight.

212
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.132
Mr. Sun isn't a thief.

213
00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.717
He was trying to catch the thief.

214
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.179
The woman you saw
isn't Mr. Sun's girlfriend.

215
00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.389
She's an insurance agent.

216
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.933
An insurance agent?

217
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.227
Come on, that's ridiculous.

218
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.478
Mr. Wi, you saw them.

219
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.231
The way they were looking at each other,

220
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.109
did that look like an insurance agent
and a client to you?

221
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.862
If I had to describe the look in her eyes,

222
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.781
it was like she was looking
at a priceless treasure.

223
00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.199
Good observation.

224
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:17.495
Once she sets her mind on a client,
there is no letting go.

225
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.123
So she's known as
the Doberman of the insurance world.

226
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.333
Is that so?

227
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.335
That's great.

228
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:27.756
My gums have been acting up,
so I was going to get dental insurance.

229
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.133
When's that insurance agent coming again?

230
00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.470
I hate to break it to you,
but there's no way

231
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.430
she'll ever be back in this area.

232
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.475
By the way, Ms. Bom,

233
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.144
how did you know all that?

234
00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.205
Look at the time.

235
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.917
I have a field trip, so I better go.

236
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.253
- Answer before you go.
- She knows everything.

237
00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.508
Ms. Bom, we'll go ahead.

238
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:12.717
- Okay.
- See you in a bit.

239
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:13.968
- See you soon.
- Okay.

240
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.305
Ms. Bom!

241
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.183
Ms. Bom.

242
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.602
Something's going on
with you and Sun Jae-gyu, right?

243
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.437
Nothing's going on.

244
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.231
My twins saw you the other day.

245
00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.441
<i>Bom-sik!</i>

246
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.784
<i>They saw him entering your place.</i>

247
00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.414
I thought he was just a thug
with a dragon tattoo on his arm.

248
00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.834
But seeing him at the sports fest
and catching the thief,

249
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.335
he's competitive and righteous.

250
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.004
I realized he's not just a dumb guy.

251
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:53.424
The more you're around him,
the more you want to stay close to him,

252
00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.051
am I right?

253
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.262
He didn't come to my place
to get close to me.

254
00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:01.266
Well, the dog I adopted
was rescued by him.

255
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.684
So he came by to check in.

256
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.521
You've been looking really pretty lately.

257
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.400
You totally have that dating glow.

258
00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:16.656
I hear you're going on a field trip
to where Han-gyul's uncle works.

259
00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:18.741
Ms. Seo.

260
00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:24.455
The purpose of our visit is strictly
for the Energy Club field trip...

261
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.002
Oh, the bus is here.

262
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:29.919
Well then...

263
00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.967
There's something going on.

264
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.097
<i>What if the students hear that at school?</i>

265
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.349
<i>Pull yourself together, Yoon Bom.</i>

266
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.227
<i>If the students find out, you're done for.</i>

267
00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.314
<i>When you see Mr. Sun today,</i>
<i>you need to be completely hostile</i>

268
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.899
<i>and as cold as possible.</i>

269
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:54.569
<i>Remember that feeling when</i>
<i>you first saw him with the chicken skewer.</i>

270
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.450
- Wow.
- Wow, it's so refreshing.

271
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:03.703
I wish this land was mine.

272
00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.371
It's gigantic.

273
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.540
Why is it so big?

274
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.209
Wow, this place is insane.

275
00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.379
I don't see Mr. Sun here today.

276
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.548
Oh, right.

277
00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:17.592
Him?

278
00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.599
This is Philip. Can you hear me?

279
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.601
Current wind speed is fine.

280
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.013
The nacelle's hooked up.
Rope's going down!

281
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:26.721
All right.

282
00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.060
Welcome to our plant, Green Narae!

283
00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:37.231
Uncle, let me tell you something.
It was perfect.

284
00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:40.443
Master, I thought
I was watching an action film.

285
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:41.986
What you just saw wasn't a movie.

286
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.114
These wind turbines make wind energy,

287
00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:50.036
and the blades are prone to damage
from airborne objects or birds.

288
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:54.373
That's why our plant constantly monitors
and maintains the turbines

289
00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:56.042
both on the ground and in the air.

290
00:22:58.002 --> 00:23:00.838
Ms. Bom,
I've got a new dream starting today.

291
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:03.966
It's not to marry an idol,
it's to join JQ Energy.

292
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.141
What do you think, Ms. Bom?

293
00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:13.851
Do you like the size of the company?

294
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:14.894
Well...

295
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.146
It's tall.

296
00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:21.025
"Tall..."

297
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:24.821
Is that it?

298
00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:27.073
We can see the solar plant too, right?

299
00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:29.534
Sure.

300
00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:34.413
- Director Gu, escort them.
- Sure.

301
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.207
- Follow me.
- Let's go.

302
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.042
- This way.
- Go on.

303
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:51.556
Shinsu Power Plant covers roughly
1,058,000 square meters.

304
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:54.058
We have 82,000 modules here alone,

305
00:23:54.142 --> 00:23:58.146
and it generates
around 47 gigawatts per year.

306
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:00.022
Currently, we own three power plants,

307
00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.233
including ones in Ulsan and Dangjin,

308
00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:05.319
and we're planning a wind farm in Taebaek.

309
00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:11.367
We're aiming to go public on KOSDAQ
within three years.

310
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.744
No matter how big it is,

311
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:15.496
the business model itself is limited,

312
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.915
so it'd be hard to go public
without a unique factor.

313
00:24:20.418 --> 00:24:21.252
Choi Se-jin.

314
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:24.964
That's a great question.

315
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.841
To address those issues,

316
00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:30.469
our company invests
24% of our annual revenue in R&D

317
00:24:30.553 --> 00:24:34.765
and is developing technology to prevent
performance drops caused by pollution.

318
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:37.560
Uncle, don't you need another nephew?

319
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.812
If you want to adopt a kid, I'll cut ties

320
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:41.355
with my twin brother right away.

321
00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:43.858
I'll pass.

322
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:45.776
What do you think, Ms. Bom?

323
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.112
Do you like the company's vision?

324
00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:52.533
Well...

325
00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:54.952
It's fine.

326
00:24:57.788 --> 00:24:59.999
Could we meet the CEO today?

327
00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:04.503
Se-jin wants to learn more
about running a power plant.

328
00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:07.924
Director Gu!

329
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:09.133
Escort them.

330
00:25:09.217 --> 00:25:10.801
Sure. Everyone, come this way.

331
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.179
- Okay.
- Let's go.

332
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.736
CEO'S OFFICE

333
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:30.947
Sir, we're coming in.

334
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.222
Hello.

335
00:25:56.806 --> 00:26:00.101
We're from the Green Narae Energy Club
at Shinsu High.

336
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.275
CEO SUN JAE-GYU

337
00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:51.986
Hello.

338
00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:56.574
I'm Sun Jae-gyu, CEO of JQ Energy.

339
00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:00.494
Your uncle is...

340
00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:03.831
a CEO?

341
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:08.377
That's right.

342
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:11.964
The "J" stands for Jae,
and the "Q" stands for Gyu.

343
00:27:12.048 --> 00:27:15.843
I, Sun Jae-gyu, am the CEO of JQ Energy.

344
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:19.847
Master, you totally look like
a <i>Forbes </i>cover model.

345
00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:23.184
Do you guys know what this fabric is?

346
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:27.605
Perfect husband material!

347
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.568
Honestly, my uncle
is the best husband material.

348
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:35.613
He's strong, influential,

349
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.656
- and rich.
- Oh, stop it.

350
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:42.411
Well, what do you think, Ms. Bom?

351
00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:45.331
Do you like the CEO of this company?

352
00:27:46.624 --> 00:27:48.250
Why do you keep asking me?

353
00:27:52.129 --> 00:27:53.714
Well...

354
00:27:54.757 --> 00:27:58.803
it seems you were quite shocked to hear
that I'm the CEO of this company.

355
00:27:58.886 --> 00:28:01.097
Yes, I was surprised. I did get surprised.

356
00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:04.809
That said, since Han-gyul's uncle
runs the company,

357
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:08.312
I think we can ask more freely
about how the plant is run.

358
00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:09.605
Isn't that right, Se-jin?

359
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:13.651
Ms. Bom, why do you keep
dragging me into this?

360
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:17.530
The kids must be hungry.
When do we get dinner?

361
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:22.159
Director Gu.

362
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.829
Escort them.

363
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.623
Sure. Please, come this way.

364
00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:52.565
- Let's go!
- You scared me!

365
00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:56.193
Today, I'll do a live demo
of the armbar transition

366
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:57.361
from knee-on-belly.

367
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.577
Why are you putting lipstick on
when you're heading to work out?

368
00:29:05.453 --> 00:29:06.704
I'm not going to the dojo.

369
00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:10.958
You said watching me
was more fun than TV shows.

370
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:11.959
Who are you meeting?

371
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.588
Where are you off to in this nightgown?

372
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:17.089
What's wrong with you?

373
00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:22.678
Is it that guy?

374
00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:26.015
That jerk who got divorced, right?

375
00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:29.727
Why are you calling someone
you barely know "that jerk"?

376
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:34.273
So he talks all smooth
in a Seoul accent while smiling at you.

377
00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:36.859
You think that means
he's into you or something?

378
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.488
Men like that are so predictable.

379
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:43.824
He's lonely away from home
and wants a woman to fool around with.

380
00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:45.117
That works out.

381
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:49.371
I'm lonely too, so that works.

382
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.084
This isn't it.

383
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:57.213
Geez, what's wrong with her?

384
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:03.052
<i>I heard they're going</i>
<i>to an amusement park this weekend.</i>

385
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.553
An amusement park?

386
00:30:04.637 --> 00:30:05.638
Yes.

387
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:11.477
Ms. Seo wouldn't fall for that, would she?

388
00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:13.854
A romance scam.

389
00:30:14.772 --> 00:30:15.814
What cam?

390
00:30:15.898 --> 00:30:17.525
Didn't you see on the news?

391
00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:20.152
They act interested
and pretend to love you

392
00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:22.947
just to get your personal info,
take your money, and then vanish.

393
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.950
It's a scam that preys on lonely people.

394
00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:38.420
{\an8}Anchovy spicy paste.

395
00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:41.048
POCHEON-STYLE MARINATED GALBI

396
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:43.467
Han-gyul, here's the <i>galbi </i>you mentioned.

397
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.390
The meat looks really good.

398
00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:51.058
The color's great. Bring it over.

399
00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:04.405
Hey, Han-gyul.

400
00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:06.615
Was the field trip underwhelming today?

401
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:09.118
Not at all. It was amazing.

402
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:16.333
But why has your teacher
been cold and distant all day?

403
00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:24.008
Go on, hurry.

404
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:26.927
Where's she going?

405
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:29.597
Philip.

406
00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:58.417
What?

407
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:00.085
What are you doing?

408
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:01.462
We want some too.

409
00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:03.547
Why are you giving
all the <i>galbi </i>to Se-jin?

410
00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:07.301
That's...

411
00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:18.812
because it's the best cut, so I gave it
to the person I care about the most.

412
00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:26.737
Eat up.

413
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.782
I meant to give you a gift myself.

414
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.336
I don't think I need your help anymore.

415
00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.088
I've found an amazing tutor.

416
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:49.218
I'll pass on this too.

417
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.803
I'm on a diet.

418
00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:54.556
Eat up.

419
00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:02.564
Wow, see how juicy it is?

420
00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:03.649
It's incredible.

421
00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:06.276
How come Se-jin won't eat
something this tasty?

422
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.070
Guys, she gave it to me.

423
00:33:09.363 --> 00:33:10.322
This is amazing.

424
00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:12.908
You can eat it too. Go ahead and eat.

425
00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:19.456
What's wrong with you, Yoon Bom?

426
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.043
You should be hostile.
Why can't you take your eyes off him?

427
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.173
Wait, I didn't look because I wanted to.

428
00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:30.801
How can I ignore those veins
popping under his shirt?

429
00:33:31.427 --> 00:33:34.346
How could anyone ignore
his forearms flexing while grilling?

430
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.848
- Ms. Bom.
- What?

431
00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:40.018
Why did you come here?

432
00:33:41.395 --> 00:33:43.939
Did something bother you today?

433
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:44.898
No, that's not it.

434
00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:47.693
Earlier today,

435
00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:51.447
Ms. Seo asked me about our relationship.
Did you know that?

436
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.200
Han-gyul seems
to have noticed something too.

437
00:33:55.284 --> 00:33:57.327
And the twins talked
about husband material.

438
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:59.830
Who cares what the twins say?

439
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:01.915
The kids are simply enjoying the meat.

440
00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:04.835
This isn't going to work.

441
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:10.007
Let's just call off our date.

442
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:15.429
Ms. Bom.

443
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:21.393
Do you realize how cruel
what you just said is to me?

444
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.688
I've been waiting for that day,

445
00:34:24.772 --> 00:34:28.525
trying not to smile every day.
I feel like my face is going to cramp up.

446
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:30.778
What are we going to do if we get caught?

447
00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:35.783
I'll do my best to plan the route
so you don't have to worry.

448
00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.034
Even so--

449
00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:39.453
I'll find the perfect spot
so we don't run into anyone

450
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.371
and no one gets suspicious.

451
00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:43.207
- Mr. Sun.
- Ms. Bom.

452
00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:45.083
You trust me, right?

453
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.004
Tomorrow,
I'll go pick you up at your place.

454
00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:57.304
Gosh, I almost got butterflies again.

455
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:03.227
Were you that excited
to be late for tutoring?

456
00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:08.607
When a guy gives a woman meat,
isn't that basically a proposal?

457
00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:11.944
- What kind of meat?
- Pocheon <i>galbi.</i>

458
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:15.405
What will you name your grandson?

459
00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:21.078
Seriously, he's a player.

460
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:23.372
If he doesn't like me,
why's he being so nice?

461
00:35:24.248 --> 00:35:25.415
Who's so nice to you?

462
00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:31.255
Jjun, I'm not the type to fall for a guy
just because he's popular

463
00:35:31.338 --> 00:35:33.006
with all the girls.

464
00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:35.634
I'm not the type to be swayed
by cheap niceties

465
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:37.970
or bribed with meat.

466
00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:40.681
Is this the crush denial period?

467
00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:43.559
Me?

468
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.310
I'm Choi Se-jin, though.

469
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.145
Se-jin.

470
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.482
I'm fine with anyone you date,

471
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.484
but before that,

472
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.945
let's beat Sun Han-gyul first.

473
00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:58.574
Sorry, but I'm a bit confused right now.

474
00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:01.076
So maybe you should take down
Han-gyul's uncle first.

475
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:03.912
You should forget about that boy's face

476
00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:05.998
and just picture Sun Han-gyul.

477
00:36:07.207 --> 00:36:08.959
I'll make sure you get a Grade 1

478
00:36:09.543 --> 00:36:13.088
on your report card this final.

479
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.634
Let's go to page 136.

480
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:21.138
You need to use the first term
and the common difference.

481
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:25.851
But it's a lot faster and easier
if you use the arithmetic mean.

482
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:27.853
Ms. Bom!

483
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:29.938
Ms. Bom!

484
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:38.989
Get in.

485
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.325
What time is it?

486
00:36:41.909 --> 00:36:42.743
It's 4:30 a.m.

487
00:36:44.036 --> 00:36:45.078
It's 4:30 a.m.?

488
00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:47.122
After midnight,
it counts as that day, right?

489
00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:50.626
Even so, the sun hasn't risen,

490
00:36:51.251 --> 00:36:52.753
and I haven't even washed up yet.

491
00:36:57.883 --> 00:36:58.759
Really?

492
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.847
You're this pretty without washing up.
If you do, I'll need to go plow again.

493
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.478
Where are we going this early?

494
00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:13.857
The first thing on our schedule...

495
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.156
is the sunrise.

496
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.577
I picked a time and place
where we won't run into anyone,

497
00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:27.579
so you don't have to worry.

498
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:29.915
You're right.

499
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:31.959
There's no one around.

500
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:34.127
I told you to trust me.

501
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:37.172
Here, I've packed some food.

502
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.632
Help yourself if you're hungry.

503
00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:40.801
Cover up with this if you're cold.

504
00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:43.887
So chilly. Gosh, it's chilly.

505
00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:26.638
- One, two.
- One, two.

506
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.725
Dong-pyo. Mr. Wi.

507
00:38:29.808 --> 00:38:30.726
Mr. Wi?

508
00:38:31.268 --> 00:38:34.062
- One, two.
- One, two.

509
00:38:34.146 --> 00:38:35.814
Oh, that's Master.

510
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.693
- One, two.
- One, two.

511
00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:41.486
- One, two.
- One, two.

512
00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.197
Master. What are you doing here alone?

513
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.199
Hey.

514
00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:48.994
- I came to see the sunrise.
- By yourself?

515
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:52.372
Don't you know I'm an introvert?

516
00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:54.624
Come on, let's run together.

517
00:38:54.708 --> 00:38:57.002
I'll pass.
I need some time alone to think.

518
00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.046
You guys go on.

519
00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:00.797
Okay, then, turn around!

520
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:04.217
- One, two.
- One, two.

521
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.721
They're gone.

522
00:39:09.306 --> 00:39:10.932
- Come on out.
- Are they gone?

523
00:39:11.016 --> 00:39:13.185
- One, two.
- Turn around!

524
00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:15.228
- One, two.
- But they're coming back.

525
00:39:15.312 --> 00:39:18.273
- One, two.
- One, two.

526
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.483
Master!

527
00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:21.276
Why are you coming here? Go!

528
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.444
Take a break!

529
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.655
We thought you might be lonely,

530
00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:29.451
so we decided to stop running
and watch the sunrise with you.

531
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:33.080
Why are you guys...

532
00:39:34.623 --> 00:39:36.208
so awfully thoughtful?

533
00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:41.546
Goodness, my legs.

534
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.139
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

535
00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:52.891
It's nothing.

536
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:56.520
I didn't sleep well last night,
so my breathing is a little unsteady.

537
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.692
By the way,

538
00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:05.362
what's this?

539
00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:09.032
- Isn't this food?
- No, it's not.

540
00:40:09.116 --> 00:40:11.868
I've been feeling hungry. Can I try one?

541
00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:12.911
There's no food!

542
00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:14.746
- Open it.
- No, it's not!

543
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.705
Open it.

544
00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:21.169
- Let's eat.
- Yeah.

545
00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:23.880
It's to die for.

546
00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:26.133
It's so good.

547
00:40:27.634 --> 00:40:28.677
I...

548
00:40:30.387 --> 00:40:32.556
stayed up all night
cooking and preparing this.

549
00:40:39.312 --> 00:40:40.313
Sorry about this.

550
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:50.740
What do I do?

551
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:52.993
Sorry I made you go through that.

552
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:55.704
Are you sure no one saw me?

553
00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.873
They didn't see anything but the blanket.

554
00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:03.378
By the way,
they ate up all the food I packed for you.

555
00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:06.339
Who cares about food right now?

556
00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:07.257
I do.

557
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:10.218
It's our first date,
so you've got to eat well.

558
00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:12.762
Hop in.

559
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:19.394
<i>Watch your step.</i>

560
00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:21.605
<i>What restaurant could be out</i>
<i>in these mountains?</i>

561
00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:27.319
This <i>gukbap </i>place
is a hidden gem I found recently.

562
00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:30.697
I've never once run into
anyone from Shinsu here.

563
00:41:31.323 --> 00:41:33.074
Let's head in.

564
00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:34.034
Watch your step.

565
00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:37.245
This is Shinsu's Michelin-rated place.

566
00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:39.664
I've never run into
a single person from Shinsu--

567
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:41.958
Ms. Bom.

568
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:45.086
Principal!

569
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.594
Did you two come together?

570
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.513
Oh, my. Han-gyul's uncle.

571
00:41:56.223 --> 00:41:57.057
Ms. Bom.

572
00:41:57.641 --> 00:41:58.850
What brings you here?

573
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:02.479
I guess you like <i>gukbap.</i>

574
00:42:03.063 --> 00:42:06.858
Yes, they call me
"the Minister of <i>Gukbap."</i>

575
00:42:06.942 --> 00:42:10.237
<i>Gukbap </i>has been with me
throughout my life.

576
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:11.821
It's my comfort food.

577
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:15.575
I see.

578
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.204
Principal, what are you doing here
at this hour?

579
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.248
What? Oh, yes.

580
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:24.960
It's our anniversary today.

581
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.756
Wait, <i>gukbap </i>on your anniversary,

582
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.716
especially at 7:20 in the morning?

583
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.885
We're morning people.

584
00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:38.890
On top of that, this place
is a hidden gem only we know.

585
00:42:38.974 --> 00:42:43.395
It's where we had our first date
32 years ago.

586
00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:44.896
I see.

587
00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:51.444
So this place has been
a hidden gem for 32 years?

588
00:42:51.987 --> 00:42:54.614
Happy anniversary to you both.

589
00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:57.367
Oh, thank you very much.

590
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.910
Can I get <i>gukbap </i>here?

591
00:42:58.994 --> 00:42:59.911
Sure.

592
00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:15.677
That was so scary, right?

593
00:43:18.513 --> 00:43:19.681
Do I look okay?

594
00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:22.267
Of course. You look beautiful.

595
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.476
Wait, Hye-suk, your hair.

596
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.187
- Let's go.
- Geez.

597
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:28.648
Look at her flirting in that skirt.

598
00:43:28.732 --> 00:43:29.774
This is so fun.

599
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.527
She's having the time of her life.

600
00:43:34.112 --> 00:43:35.447
- Hye-suk.
- Yes?

601
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.866
It's hot. Shall we get some ice cream?

602
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:38.908
- Shall we?
- Yes.

603
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:41.244
I'll have chocolate.

604
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.665
Right, hello.

605
00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:48.626
Two chocolates in cups, please.

606
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.671
Why are you so quick to pay?
Have some manners.

607
00:43:51.755 --> 00:43:54.466
Mr. Jeong, what are you doing here?

608
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:55.717
You, take out your wallet.

609
00:43:56.509 --> 00:43:57.552
What's wrong with you?

610
00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:59.095
I said, take out your wallet.

611
00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.138
Unbelievable.

612
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:02.766
Here.

613
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.479
Geez, what the hell?

614
00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.737
What is wrong with him?

615
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.158
Don't they sell anything sharper
than cotton candy here?

616
00:44:21.034 --> 00:44:22.619
I swear, I'm going to kill him.

617
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:24.537
Ms. Seo!

618
00:44:29.334 --> 00:44:30.585
Why'd you come to this town?

619
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.630
I'm here for work, obviously.

620
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:36.257
Then just do your job and leave.

621
00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:38.176
Why are you hitting on a single mom?

622
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:39.886
Hitting on her?

623
00:44:39.969 --> 00:44:42.555
In Seoul,
this is what we call a "situationship."

624
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.392
A "situationship"?

625
00:44:45.475 --> 00:44:46.976
Darn it.

626
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.436
Why are you doing this?

627
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.105
You better not be lying,

628
00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:53.108
or this will turn into
a whole different "situation."

629
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.526
Understand? Believe it or not,

630
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.488
I'm the one and only PE teacher
at Shinsu High.

631
00:44:59.155 --> 00:45:01.074
Hye-suk!

632
00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:02.742
- Hye-suk!
- Keep it down.

633
00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:07.664
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.
What's gotten into him?

634
00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:19.884
Maybe it's the nice weather.

635
00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:21.678
It's unusually crowded here today.

636
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:24.973
This won't do, let's go somewhere else.

637
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:29.769
What's going on today?

638
00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:44.200
You see,

639
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:48.455
wouldn't it be safer
to be surrounded by a crowd

640
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:51.082
than a restaurant
with just a few tables like before?

641
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.084
And finals are coming up soon,

642
00:45:53.168 --> 00:45:55.420
so there's no way students
or teachers would come.

643
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:17.066
What the heck?

644
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:19.319
Wait, where did they go?

645
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:21.863
Gosh, I'm still holding her purse.
Darn it.

646
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:30.121
Do we have to try this?

647
00:46:31.748 --> 00:46:34.751
Ms. Bom.
Let's just do this one thing and leave.

648
00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:35.710
You know what?

649
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:39.172
I've always wanted to go
to an amusement park with my boyfriend...

650
00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:40.715
Let's go in there.

651
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:41.841
Let's go...

652
00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:44.052
Hye-suk.

653
00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:48.014
Ms. Seo. There's Ms. Seo!

654
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:52.936
Busted.

655
00:46:57.774 --> 00:46:58.900
Hye-suk.

656
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.110
I can't handle this with my weak heart.

657
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:04.697
Wait, Hye-suk! Can't we not go in here?

658
00:47:07.492 --> 00:47:08.576
Darn it.

659
00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:19.212
What do we do? There...

660
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:22.715
Release my grudges!

661
00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:23.925
No.

662
00:47:33.226 --> 00:47:34.185
Get out of the way.

663
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.195
- Come in here.
- What?

664
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:47.031
We should hide from Ms. Seo. Hurry.

665
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.335
Ms. Bom.

666
00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:02.589
I know you're in here. I already saw you.

667
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:04.757
- Where are you?
- Hye-suk.

668
00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.135
I don't think we should go here.

669
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:16.019
Ms. Bom.

670
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:18.104
Ms. Bom, where are you?

671
00:48:18.187 --> 00:48:20.064
Hye-suk, why are you looking for Ms. Bom?

672
00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:32.160
Ms. Bom.

673
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:34.245
I know you're in here.

674
00:48:44.631 --> 00:48:46.049
Ms. Bom.

675
00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:51.429
Who are you?

676
00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:52.805
Release my grudges!

677
00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:55.975
Yes, right in there. Ms. Bom!

678
00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:57.226
Ms. Bom!

679
00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:45.692
Sun Han-gyul?

680
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:10.550
I think we've done plenty for a date.

681
00:50:11.843 --> 00:50:13.177
Shall we head home now?

682
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:16.848
Still, it's our first date.

683
00:50:17.807 --> 00:50:21.310
We didn't catch the sunrise
or enjoy a good restaurant.

684
00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:26.149
It's not like it was totally unexpected.

685
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.114
I do wish we'd had
that amusement park date, just a little.

686
00:50:36.409 --> 00:50:38.035
You really wanted to go on the rides?

687
00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:45.793
I just wanted a normal,
typical date like everyone else.

688
00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:51.466
If that's what you want, we should do it.

689
00:50:53.426 --> 00:50:55.052
Yeah, come with me.

690
00:51:04.437 --> 00:51:06.022
Hop out.

691
00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:12.570
Welcome to Jae-gyu Land!

692
00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:14.363
What is this place?

693
00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:16.073
It's a closed-down elementary school.

694
00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:17.658
The playground's seen better days.

695
00:51:19.494 --> 00:51:22.413
Anyone who wants to go
on the Viking, come over here.

696
00:51:22.497 --> 00:51:23.331
Hey, you there.

697
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:26.459
Hey, beautiful lady.
Aren't you going to ride the Viking?

698
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:28.169
- Come on, quick.
- Okay.

699
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.588
It's free.

700
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:33.007
All right.

701
00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:35.927
Hold on to the safety bar.

702
00:51:37.512 --> 00:51:38.429
Here we go.

703
00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:51.567
Want me to go a little slower?

704
00:51:52.235 --> 00:51:53.402
No, go faster!

705
00:51:53.486 --> 00:51:54.862
- Faster?
- Yes.

706
00:51:54.946 --> 00:51:56.989
Okay! Hey, lady.

707
00:51:57.073 --> 00:51:58.491
There's no one around here.

708
00:51:58.574 --> 00:51:59.867
If you felt frustrated today,

709
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:02.203
scream as much as you want, okay?

710
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:03.120
Okay.

711
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:04.622
Here we go!

712
00:52:28.896 --> 00:52:31.649
Hold on tight, or you'll fly off.

713
00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:32.859
Here we go!

714
00:53:10.813 --> 00:53:12.356
It's closing time.

715
00:53:12.857 --> 00:53:13.691
No way.

716
00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:18.613
Has it gotten this late already?

717
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:21.949
Let's say goodbye here.

718
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.037
Here, now?

719
00:53:31.584 --> 00:53:33.961
I have one last thing
I want to say to you.

720
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:36.339
Can I just tell you three things?

721
00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:39.425
You see,
I don't care for getting all romantic--

722
00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:41.302
An average woman's BMR is 1,300 calories.

723
00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:44.472
Make sure to balance
your carbs, protein, and fat

724
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:48.517
in a 5-3-2 ratio
based on your total calorie intake.

725
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.689
Once it's past midnight,
you won't see me for two years.

726
00:53:53.773 --> 00:53:55.650
You're talking
about carbs, protein, and fat?

727
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:58.736
I'm saying, eat well
even when you're alone.

728
00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:02.448
Take care of yourself
until the day we meet again.

729
00:54:04.325 --> 00:54:05.576
What about the second thing?

730
00:54:07.078 --> 00:54:10.456
There's bound to be at least one person
you feel like you want to kill.

731
00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:12.124
When that happens,

732
00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:15.336
just text me their name.

733
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:16.629
Are you going to kill them?

734
00:54:16.712 --> 00:54:18.464
I'll scare them half to death.

735
00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:20.883
Whoever gives you a hard time,

736
00:54:20.967 --> 00:54:23.302
don't forget that
I won't let them get away with it.

737
00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:27.556
Hold your head high
and don't let anyone intimidate you.

738
00:54:29.225 --> 00:54:30.810
What's the last thing?

739
00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:39.527
Here.

740
00:54:44.907 --> 00:54:47.159
If one day, out of the blue,

741
00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:52.081
you ever find yourself really missing me,
open it then.

742
00:54:56.168 --> 00:54:57.253
I will.

743
00:54:59.672 --> 00:55:02.299
Is there anything you want to tell me?

744
00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:06.637
I'll say three things too.

745
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.474
First,

746
00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:14.270
learn to be a little more cowardly.

747
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:17.314
Don't jump into others' troubles
and end up in handcuffs.

748
00:55:17.857 --> 00:55:19.483
When you see injustice, hold back.

749
00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:21.068
Hold your tongue.

750
00:55:21.736 --> 00:55:22.570
Okay?

751
00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:25.072
I'll keep that in mind.

752
00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:28.784
For the second one...

753
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:38.544
Don't wear a suit in front of other women.

754
00:55:40.046 --> 00:55:41.255
Why a suit...

755
00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:46.761
I won't.

756
00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:51.223
I'll put my suit in the closet
until the day I see you again,

757
00:55:51.932 --> 00:55:53.142
and then I'll wear it.

758
00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:56.729
What's the last one?

759
00:56:01.484 --> 00:56:02.526
Nothing.

760
00:56:03.944 --> 00:56:04.779
There isn't one?

761
00:56:06.739 --> 00:56:09.075
The last one is pointless anyway.

762
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:13.621
I'll go, then.

763
00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:17.500
Are we really... saying goodbye here?

764
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.836
Goodbye.

765
00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:24.757
Okay. Take care, Ms. Bom.

766
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:27.343
No.

767
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:30.805
I guess I need to change
how I address you now, right?

768
00:56:35.101 --> 00:56:38.604
Well then, goodbye, Ms. Yoon Bom.

769
00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:42.024
Take care,

770
00:56:43.526 --> 00:56:44.652
Han-gyul's uncle.

771
00:57:21.689 --> 00:57:22.731
Mr. Sun.

772
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.734
Yes, Ms. Bom.

773
00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:28.237
There's still 20 seconds left.

774
00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:31.907
Can I say what I couldn't earlier?

775
00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:34.160
Sure.

776
00:57:35.161 --> 00:57:36.120
What is it?

777
00:57:38.164 --> 00:57:39.331
Can you...

778
00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:41.792
give me...

779
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.673
one last hug?

780
00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:05.608
DANGER
KEEP OUT

781
00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:55.009
{\an8}Are you crying, Mr. Sun?

782
00:59:55.092 --> 00:59:58.012
{\an8}<i>Now that you know I'm okay, stop crying.</i>

783
00:59:58.095 --> 00:59:59.888
{\an8}Is there someone you're into?

784
01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:04.226
{\an8}<i>His uncle... got knocked down?</i>

785
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.186
{\an8}<i>Did Jae-gyu say I came to sell insurance?</i>

786
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.563
{\an8}That's impressive.

787
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.607
{\an8}I just ran into that woman,
so tell me the truth.

788
01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:12.735
{\an8}- Were you with Ms. Bom?
- She came to my office.

789
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.987
{\an8}<i>Forget that. Where is she right now?</i>

790
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.155
{\an8}Ms. Bom!

791
01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:18.240
{\an8}<i>Ms. Bom!</i>

792
