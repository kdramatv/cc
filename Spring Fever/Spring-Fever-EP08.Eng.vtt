00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.066
{\an8}Sun Han-gyul?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.984
{\an8}EPISODE 8

3
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.284
{\an8}Who… are you?

4
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.535
{\an8}Who am I?

5
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.581
{\an8}Well… I…

6
00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:27.546
{\an8}Well, I…

7
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:29.423
{\an8}I'm just…

8
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.180
{\an8}Don't tell your uncle, okay?

9
00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:40.100
{\an8}What? I can't…

10
00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:52.613
Didn't she say watching me work out
was more fun than watching drama shows?

11
00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:54.698
Gosh, this foolish woman.

12
00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:57.576
What should I do
to make her come to her senses?

13
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.994
This is crazy.

14
00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:02.998
What the hell?

15
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:04.625
Everywhere I go, people are…

16
00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:08.212
What?

17
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:12.132
Wait...

18
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.388
My goodness!

19
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.686
Geez, what's all this?

20
00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:26.647
Darn sand.

21
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:36.574
So, Ms. Bom and Mr. Sun, you two are…

22
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.867
Right?

23
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.578
Generous and merciful Mr. Jeong,

24
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:44.748
if you could turn a blind eye
to what you just saw,

25
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:47.126
we'll be indebted to you until we die…

26
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.044
No, even after we die.

27
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:50.296
No.

28
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:51.839
Stay out of it.

29
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:53.883
Let me handle it.

30
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.681
What? What are you going to do?

31
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.182
What are you doing?

32
00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:13.110
You scared me there.

33
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.742
I wish you a long life
and peace for your family.

34
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.368
Always.

35
00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:27.291
We both practice martial arts.
If you turn a blind eye,

36
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.585
whatever you want, Mr. Jeong,

37
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.421
I'll do it for you. Please?

38
00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.174
- Whatever?
- Yes, whatever you want.

39
00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.683
Well, since you're asking so desperately,

40
00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.853
it'd be terrible of me
not to do you a favor.

41
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:51.774
- First, Ms. Bom.
- Yes, Mr. Jeong.

42
00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.489
You're close with the lawyer,
Se-jin's brother, aren't you?

43
00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:02.326
I want you to get information
on his paralegal.

44
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.286
The paralegal?

45
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.414
- Is that really all you want?
- Yes.

46
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.584
And, you.

47
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.086
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:14.254
Gosh, this is heavy.

49
00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:16.173
Oh, give it to me.

50
00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:19.593
Come here.

51
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:23.806
- Come with me.
- Okay.

52
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.603
You've got strong trap muscles.

53
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.878
<i>Don't tell your uncle, okay?</i>

54
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.638
- Uncle, I…
- But still,

55
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:07.516
how could he ask me to do that?
This is crazy.

56
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.394
Geez.

57
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:21.655
Hello.

58
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:36.879
Ms. Bom.

59
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:39.631
Did you see me on the weekend?

60
00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:42.259
See you? When? What do you mean?

61
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.929
Why do I feel like I saw you?

62
00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:51.477
I think I saw you with someone
at an amusement park.

63
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:53.896
Goodness!

64
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.731
It was me.

65
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:56.982
What do you mean?

66
00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:01.070
Some middle-aged woman ran off
to have fun, leaving her purse behind.

67
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.241
Then I ran into Ms. Bom.
So we went around together.

68
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.118
Is that a problem?

69
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:14.041
Then are you saying Ms. Bom went
to the amusement park by herself?

70
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.460
People go out to eat
or drink alone these days,

71
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.045
so why not go to an amusement park?

72
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:19.838
I couldn't agree more.

73
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.634
Look, stop suspecting her
for no good reason

74
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.177
and just check your purse.

75
00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:31.183
Ms. Bom.

76
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.983
These are the questions.
Get back to me as soon as possible.

77
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.740
By the way,
what did you ask Mr. Sun to do?

78
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:51.537
You didn't ask him
to kill someone for you, did you?

79
00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.587
SPORTS CENTER

80
00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:03.966
I shouldn't have signed up for six months.

81
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.678
I'm not sure if they'll give me a refund.

82
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.523
Mr. Jeong?

83
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.151
Han-gyul's uncle...

84
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.487
got knocked down?

85
00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.408
Have you ever lost in your life?

86
00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:18.582
That's like asking
if I've ever died before.

87
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.835
That's never happened
and will never happen…

88
00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.128
On Monday,

89
00:08:24.588 --> 00:08:29.343
the mighty Sun Jae-gyu
will lose to me, Jeong Jin-hyeok.

90
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:33.472
My eyes must be getting old.
I must be seeing things.

91
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.141
The man on the ground
truly isn't Mr. Jeong,

92
00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:38.185
but Han-gyul's uncle?

93
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.771
Oh, you're here, Ms. Seo.

94
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.191
All my hard work paid off.

95
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.777
Anyway, why is he still
lying on the ground?

96
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.279
Maybe he's hurt somewhere?

97
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.703
Mr. Sun, it's done. You can get up now.

98
00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.832
I'll stay like this for a while.
You can go.

99
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:09.383
You're no match for me. I ought to…

100
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.974
Gosh, I'm so impressed.

101
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.101
You've improved so much.

102
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.770
Seeing that you're back
after a long break,

103
00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.273
I guess you'll start training again.

104
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:27.901
Well, that's not it.

105
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.238
I'm so busy these days,
so I came to get a refund…

106
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.244
Go and get changed.

107
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:43.458
Today, I'll be nice and teach you
my secret skills to beat Sun Jae-gyu.

108
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:47.921
You mean I can beat him like that too?

109
00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:51.717
See that?

110
00:09:52.301 --> 00:09:55.429
He still can't even get up. Can't you see?

111
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.889
Go get changed quickly.

112
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.017
Okay, I will.

113
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.644
Goodness, that's so impressive.

114
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.031
<i>I wonder what he's doing right now.</i>

115
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.376
Here.

116
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.547
If one day, out of the blue,

117
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.467
you ever find yourself really missing me,
open it then.

118
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.763
I think I miss him a little.

119
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:42.059
How much do I have to miss him
to open this?

120
00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.533
No. It hasn't been that long.

121
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.077
This isn't right.

122
00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:27.062
What could be in the box?

123
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.816
Perfume?

124
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.818
A handwritten letter?

125
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.447
Or… maybe a ring?

126
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.963
- I'm sorry!
- Goodness!

127
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.259
Bom-sik, are you okay? Are you okay?

128
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.054
I'm sorry.

129
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.271
<i>It's that woman.</i>

130
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:17.904
<i>It's that woman.</i>

131
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.208
My purse.

132
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.085
Oh, right.

133
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.633
It must be a Holly bag.

134
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:41.678
You know it?

135
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.557
Well, I only carry big ones
from that brand,

136
00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.268
so I didn't know
they made such small ones.

137
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.563
But what you're carrying right now…

138
00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.525
I mean, I have them at home. Big ones.

139
00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.528
Right, at home. I see.

140
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.365
I really have them at home.

141
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.242
I bought them at the department store.

142
00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:07.454
- No discount.
- Anyway, what is that smell?

143
00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.706
Oh, my God!

144
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.750
Goodness. Why are you barking at me?

145
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.877
Bom-sik, you shouldn't bark.

146
00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:16.213
<i>Bark at her!</i>

147
00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:17.839
<i>Good.</i>

148
00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:19.466
No, stop barking.

149
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.554
Oh, no. He doesn't usually bark
at just anyone.

150
00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.016
Maybe he knows you're not welcome here.

151
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.188
What did you just say?

152
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.981
If you're offended, I'm glad…

153
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.319
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:44.282
But when it comes to insurance,
you can recommend it to those who need it,

155
00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.077
but it's not right
to push it on people repeatedly...

156
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.622
Is that what Jae-gyu said?
Did he say I came to sell insurance?

157
00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.290
"Jae-gyu"?

158
00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:54.209
That's impressive.

159
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.670
He can lie to women now.

160
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:03.510
Then you're not here because of insurance?

161
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.979
As for the relationship
between him and me,

162
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.190
you should hear about it
from Jae-gyu himself.

163
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:19.943
Well, then.

164
00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.529
What… Wait.

165
00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:29.911
What then?

166
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:34.708
She's not an insurance agent?

167
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.407
Hey…

168
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.881
"A gift for a crush"?

169
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.466
Is there someone you're into?

170
00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.509
- No.
- Where are you going?

171
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.387
- Come here.
- Oh, my goodness.

172
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:31.723
Han-gyul.

173
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.391
When you confess your feelings,

174
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.435
- a gift is not what matters.
- That's right.

175
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:36.770
When I was in middle school,

176
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:40.982
I stole my mom's credit card
and bought a Korean beef bouquet.

177
00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.818
Then I cleared off the table
during lunch and told her,

178
00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.738
"We're going out if you take this."

179
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.742
Everyone in the cafeteria went wild,
like they were at a concert.

180
00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.828
So how did it go? Did it work?

181
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.330
She transferred.

182
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.918
She was so embarrassed
that she cried her eyes out

183
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.878
for four whole days.

184
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.256
After that, she was never seen
in Shinsu again.

185
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.509
- You little--
- It's true anyway.

186
00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:10.637
Quiet.

187
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.100
Quiet.

188
00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.770
Finals begin tomorrow.

189
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.314
You should compete with exam results.

190
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.607
Sir.

191
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.111
It's Dae-han's turn
to be the bottom in the finals this time.

192
00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.825
What? If we count the mock exam,
it's your turn now.

193
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:33.993
Quiet.

194
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.833
Everyone is only curious
about who comes last in this school.

195
00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:46.131
But then again, the top student
has never changed.

196
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:49.300
Come on, sir. You only dote on Han-gyul.

197
00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.301
Quiet.

198
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.143
I got it.

199
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:00.395
Got what?

200
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.480
The gift.

201
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.068
<i>The gift that will make her happy.</i>

202
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.032
<i>I think I finally got it.</i>

203
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:40.769
INHERITANCE PROPERTY DIVISION AGREEMENT

204
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:43.480
After I warned her so much
not to come here…

205
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.275
What was that?

206
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.444
That sounds like Bom-sik.

207
00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.372
Bom… No. Ms. Bom.

208
00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.920
Today's not the day I see Bom-sik.
Why are you here?

209
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.595
You should keep your promise.

210
00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:20.058
If you already miss me so much,
how are you going to wait for two years?

211
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.476
My goodness.

212
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.687
She's not an insurance agent.

213
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.983
I just ran into her.

214
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:29.943
Tell me the truth.

215
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.241
If you lie to me again,
forget the two years. We're through.

216
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.165
CO-INHERITOR: SUN HEE-YEON

217
00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.291
{\an8}<i>Sun Hee-yeon!</i>

218
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.962
Stop it, Dad!

219
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.840
Are you out of your mind?

220
00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.342
We don't even know who the father is.

221
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.678
How dare you bring the kid home?

222
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.848
You're right!
I'm crazy for coming here again.

223
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.476
I knew you'd beat me like this.
Still, he's your grandchild,

224
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.603
so I thought you should see him.

225
00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:10.191
You left home because you hate me,
and now you say he's my grandchild?

226
00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:14.153
I'm going to kill you today, you brat.

227
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.197
Hee-yeon.

228
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.369
- Jae-gyu!
- Go!

229
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.413
Take the kid and go!

230
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.522
Jae-gyu. Are you okay?

231
00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.400
Are you out of your mind?

232
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.153
How could you bring the kid here?

233
00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.114
How can I be in my right mind?

234
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.577
Every time he comes back from fishing,
he drinks and smashes everything.

235
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.874
Jae-gyu, do you still believe
Mom died in a car accident?

236
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.711
I don't.

237
00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:14.297
I believe she was trying
to get away from him--

238
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.590
That's enough!

239
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.513
You left after he kept beating you.
You should've known better.

240
00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.391
How will you raise the kid by yourself?

241
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.893
Do you have money to feed him?

242
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.519
Speaking of which,

243
00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:33.691
if I'm going to raise him,
I should go to Seoul and earn money.

244
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.494
Sun Han-gyul.

245
00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.289
That's his name.

246
00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:51.292
You saw it too, right?

247
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.963
He's a horrible man,
but he won't touch the baby.

248
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.049
While you take care of Han-gyul,

249
00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.386
I'll go earn enough money
for you, me, and Han-gyul

250
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.596
to live comfortably, no matter what.

251
00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:09.894
After that, the three of us
will live far away from him.

252
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.233
Somewhere he'll never find us again.

253
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:20.697
I'll come back for you.

254
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.074
I'll come for you two.

255
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:29.789
<i>Since she disappeared like that,</i>
<i>I haven't heard from her once.</i>

256
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.377
I'm sorry I lied to you,

257
00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:39.757
but I haven't even told Han-gyul yet,
so I couldn't tell you.

258
00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:43.970
Does that mean

259
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:49.267
Han-gyul doesn't know
that his mother is alive?

260
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:54.981
That woman... is dead to me.

261
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:01.070
Han-gyul thinks
his parents died in a fire,

262
00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:05.033
so don't say anything to him about it.

263
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.368
I understand how you feel.

264
00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:11.789
But I still think you should tell him
his mom is alive--

265
00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:14.000
She doesn't deserve to be his mom.

266
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:21.215
She may not,
but a child still misses their mom.

267
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.510
They hate their mom but still miss her.

268
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:28.389
Do you know
how it feels like to live like that?

269
00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.061
If I were Han-gyul,

270
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:38.775
I'd want to know where I came from
and who my parents are.

271
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.153
I'd want to know that all my life.

272
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:49.452
He has the right
to know who his parents are.

273
00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:52.246
Bom-sik.

274
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:55.708
Hey.

275
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.210
Hey.

276
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:58.836
You must be tired.

277
00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:01.839
Is it already our day with Bom-sik?

278
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:03.925
Yes.

279
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.932
- Right, here.
- Okay.

280
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.188
Then take good care of Bom-sik
until the day I take him back.

281
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.816
And what I told you as Han-gyul's teacher…

282
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.861
I hope you think about it.

283
00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.696
Bye, then.

284
00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:36.332
Let's go. Come here.

285
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:38.543
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

286
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:46.467
Bom-sik, come here.

287
00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:52.056
<i>A child who went missing 31 years ago</i>
<i>came back to their family recently.</i>

288
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.892
<i>In 1995, they went missing</i>

289
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.187
<i>during an outing in Seoul,</i>
<i>and their fate remained unclear for years.</i>

290
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:02.483
<i>However, advances in DNA analysis</i>
<i>have now confirmed their identity.</i>

291
00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:04.485
Han-gyul, is everything okay?

292
00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:06.487
Yes.

293
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:09.115
If you need anything, tell me.

294
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:10.867
You know,

295
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.328
if you wanted, I'd be willing to give you
my liver or gallbladder.

296
00:24:14.996 --> 00:24:16.622
Even a kidney.

297
00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.376
You draw the line at a kidney?

298
00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:25.131
For me, if you needed it,
I'd even be willing to give you my heart.

299
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.135
You're my mom and my dad,
the only family I got.

300
00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:33.556
So what if I can't breathe?
What if my blood can't circulate?

301
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:47.486
Why'd you say that all of a sudden?

302
00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:50.489
Is something wrong?

303
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.366
Of course not.

304
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.619
You have your finals tomorrow.
Go to bed early.

305
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.336

Han-gyul, are you finished already?

313
00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:02.937
It's only been ten minutes.

314
00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:05.523
Yes.

315
00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:07.775
That's Sun Han-gyul for you.

316
00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:09.777
No wonder he's the top student.

317
00:26:13.322 --> 00:26:14.156
Quiet.

318
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:28.254
Today I took the math, ethics
and bioscience exams.

319
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:31.048
English, literature
and world history are tomorrow.

320
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:36.554
And Dong-pyo wants to discuss
his grandma's 70th birthday with you.

SUN JAE-GYU

324
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.245
Think about it rationally, Jae-gyu.

325
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.540
Dad…

326
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.627
What did Dad ever do for us?

327
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:13.007
The only thing he left us
is that piece of land that won't sell.

328
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:16.344
If a resort is built there…

329
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:22.183
I hoped you'd say
you came to see Han-gyul.

330
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:26.020
I carried the crying kid on my back,

331
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:30.107
and waited for you to come back every day.

332
00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:33.361
"Han-gyul, your mom…

333
00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.281
will come back for us no matter what."

334
00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:40.451
"Let's wait one more day."

335
00:27:41.035 --> 00:27:42.787
"Let's wait two more days."

336
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.919
I'll vanish like you want.

337
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:55.508
I won't come to see you…

338
00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:01.430
or run into Han-gyul ever again.

339
00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:04.642
If you sign here--

340
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:15.319
Hey, Dong-pyo.

341
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.279
What?

342
00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:25.329
All right. I'll come pick you up now,
so don't worry. Look after your grandma.

343
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:27.206
Okay.

344
00:28:28.249 --> 00:28:30.084
What is it? What's wrong?

345
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:32.211
The power went out in the neighborhood.

346
00:28:34.797 --> 00:28:36.590
EMERGENCY ALERT

347
00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:37.550
Right.

348
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:40.136
I guess our house is okay
thanks to the solar panels.

349
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:43.556
Dong-pyo's grandma needs electricity,
so I'll go get her.

350
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:47.518
You tell other neighbors to come here
if they need electricity too. Okay?

351
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:48.978
Wait. Then…

352
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:51.897
Can Se-jin and her brother come too?

353
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:53.732
Why would you bring I-jun here?

354
00:28:53.816 --> 00:28:57.653
Se-jin needs to study for tomorrow too.
She must be so frustrated right now.

355
00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:01.031
But it's pouring.
I can't tell her to come alone.

356
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.034
As you wish. I'll be back.

357
00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:15.337
Did you pee?

358
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.800
- Give it back now!
- I won't.

359
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:24.805
Ms. Seo. Let me tell you
about the way of a true educator.

360
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:28.267
It was back when I was 26 years old.

361
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.145
When I started out as a teacher...

362
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:32.897
They all took the offer and came.

363
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.442
Stop running!

364
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:37.610
Hey!

365
00:29:41.238 --> 00:29:43.699
Bottom of the ninth. Two outs,

366
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.160
two strikes, two balls.
It's a crucial moment.

367
00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:49.163
The tension is building.
Here comes the pitch!

368
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:50.706
The batter makes contact!

369
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.416
- It's big.
- It's going over.

370
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.585
- It's going over.
- It's going over!

371
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:56.045
- It's going.
- Home run!

372
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:59.632
A home run in the bottom
of the ninth. Unbelievable!

373
00:30:01.217 --> 00:30:04.053
Hey! Who ran off
after clogging the toilet?

374
00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.679
Min-guk took a big dump.

375
00:30:05.763 --> 00:30:07.640
I needed to make space in my stomach.

376
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:09.683
What are you, a pooping machine?

377
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:12.811
I can't believe this.

378
00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:14.980
It was their birthday party and…

379
00:30:21.654 --> 00:30:24.490
Out! It's out!
They're going into extra innings.

380
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:25.991
Uncle!

381
00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:27.618
My goodness.

382
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:31.038
Why on earth is everyone here?

383
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:35.709
- Here.
- Okay.

384
00:30:38.087 --> 00:30:39.713
Hey! Keep it down, brats!

385
00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:41.298
Stop that and stay quiet.

386
00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:45.135
Everyone, quiet!

387
00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:53.769
Order is most crucial
when you're in a group.

388
00:30:54.436 --> 00:30:56.522
It seems like you all need
to stay the night here,

389
00:30:56.605 --> 00:31:01.068
so from now on,
you will have to do as I say.

390
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:02.069
Do you understand?

391
00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:03.654
- Yes, Master!
- Yes!

392
00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:06.073
First, Ms. Seo and Mr. Jeong.

393
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.784
Please find some ingredients
in the fridge and cook.

394
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:12.955
Well, all right.

395
00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:14.748
Mr. Wi.

396
00:31:15.332 --> 00:31:18.127
If there are more coming,
pick them up with Phillip.

397
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.004
- Yes, sir.
- Han-gyul.

398
00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:22.089
You assign the rooms
and prepare their beds.

399
00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:24.300
- Dong-pyo.
- Yes.

400
00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:25.426
Clean and organize shoes.

401
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:27.428
Uncle, what about us?

402
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:29.013
Right. You two…

403
00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:32.057
Do nothing. That's more helpful.

404
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.104
If you're done with assigning tasks,

405
00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:39.565
- we'll get back to the game.
- Mr. Hong.

406
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.985
You need to take on
the most important task.

407
00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:49.533
Well, since I'm the head teacher
at school,

408
00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:51.285
I'll supervise.

409
00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:53.787
Unclog the toilet, please.

410
00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:57.666
The toilet?

411
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.834
It's clogged.

412
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.795
The toilet usually
has to deal with just two people,

413
00:32:01.879 --> 00:32:04.632
but now there are ten people.
It must've been hard on it.

414
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:06.508
Okay? Okay.

415
00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:10.012
All right. If you don't like the task
I've assigned you,

416
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:12.056
you can leave here now.

417
00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.224
For your information,
in this neighborhood,

418
00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:18.437
the only place you can watch TV
during a blackout and a typhoon

419
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.772
is this house.

420
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.733
Now, to your positions!

421
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.151
To positions!

422
00:32:25.653 --> 00:32:26.904
Let's get moving!

423
00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:32.993
Uncle.

424
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:35.204
I can't reach Ms. Bom.

425
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:36.664
Ms. Bom?

426
00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:38.457
She hasn't been answering my calls.

427
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.170
Ms. Bom was with Se-jin's brother.

428
00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:46.173
I talked to her an hour ago.

429
00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:54.348
Were you with Ms. Bom?

430
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.518
Did you hear? Well,

431
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.562
she wanted to thank me
for the special lecture,

432
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:02.022
so she came to my office.

433
00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:04.191
Forget that. Where is she right now?

434
00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:09.988
While we were talking, she got a call
from Mr. Jeong and left in a hurry.

435
00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:10.948
Why do you ask?

436
00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:13.492
She's not here?

437
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:18.038
I heard that the lower areas got flooded.

438
00:33:19.623 --> 00:33:22.209
Han-gyul, take good care of them.

439
00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:34.304
Ms. Bom!

440
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:37.975
Ms. Bom!

441
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.241
Ms. Bom!

442
00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.495
Ms. Bom!

443
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.540
Ms. Bom!

444
00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:13.093
Goodness. What a brat.

445
00:34:13.177 --> 00:34:15.429
Following around some singer.

446
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:18.307
I don't believe you.

447
00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:20.684
Were you worried about me, Seong-tae?

448
00:34:21.602 --> 00:34:22.478
Ms. Bom?

449
00:34:22.561 --> 00:34:25.022
Han-gyul's uncle went to find her.

450
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:26.315
Don't worry.

451
00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:29.443
How's Seoul? Is it raining a lot?

452
00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:34.907
All right. So, does he have any kids?

453
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.991
Kids?

454
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.076
He's never been married. What kids?

455
00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.496
No, he's divorced.

456
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.916
He said he went to family court
to file for divorce in 2017.

457
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.459
I doubt that.

458
00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:47.669
Mr. Choi came down here with Mr. Oh

459
00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:51.632
because all of their colleagues
were married except for him.

460
00:34:51.715 --> 00:34:52.674
What?

461
00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.261
I heard you.

462
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.431
I'll call you before I go to sleep.

463
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:02.601
Bye, Seong-tae.

464
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:06.522
He's so sweet.

465
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:07.439
Goodness.

466
00:35:07.523 --> 00:35:09.525
- Can we talk for a bit?
- Why?

467
00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:11.693
Let's talk.

468
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.029
- What is it?
- Just follow me.

469
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:17.616
Come on.

470
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:20.202
What's with him?

471
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:27.960
What? What is it?

472
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:33.131
That Seong-tae guy or whatever,

473
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:35.008
how much do you know about him?

474
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.139
He has his own apartment
in Suro-dong, Seoul.

475
00:35:41.223 --> 00:35:42.391
And in 2017…

476
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:46.311
Why do I have to tell you this?

477
00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:48.313
Did he ask you for money?

478
00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:50.190
What on earth are you getting at?

479
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:51.775
Romance scams.

480
00:35:52.568 --> 00:35:53.402
What?

481
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:57.990
They're con men that act interested
and pretend to love you

482
00:35:58.073 --> 00:35:59.867
just to get money out of you.

483
00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:05.122
Are you saying
Seong-tae approached me for money?

484
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:09.167
I guess I look quite rich.
Thanks for thinking of me that way.

485
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:17.009
Look. Don't be shocked.

486
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.511
Okay? Listen to me carefully.

487
00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:21.638
That guy's...

488
00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:24.349
never been married.

489
00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:27.686
- Never married?
- Yes.

490
00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:29.730
Like you?

491
00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:34.526
He says he's divorced!

492
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:38.739
Why on earth would a bachelor
pretend to be a divorcee?

493
00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:41.909
Enough. Stop talking nonsense
and go eat your dinner.

494
00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:44.870
If you can't believe it,
go ask him yourself.

495
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:46.914
It's what Se-jin's brother said!

496
00:36:49.082 --> 00:36:51.001
Gosh, it's impossible to talk to her.

497
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.878
She never listens.

498
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:15.817
God, how could you do this?

499
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.405
I mean, on top of heavy rain, a blackout?

500
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:24.117
It definitely went this way.

501
00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:29.206
Where on earth is it?

502
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:36.463
Ms. Bom!

503
00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:39.675
- Ms. Bom!
- What?

504
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:42.302
I'm even hearing things now.

505
00:37:46.974 --> 00:37:49.476
Please be here. Please. Darn it.

506
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:52.062
There.

507
00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:55.399
SHINSU BATHHOUSE

508
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.610
I found it!

509
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.518
Darn it.

510
00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:35.480
I came to watch baseball.
Why am I doing this?

511
00:38:35.564 --> 00:38:38.066
And Dong-pyo's grandma
took the remote control.

512
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.155
Anyway, I'm quite impressed
by Han-gyul's uncle.

513
00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:47.659
The power went out,
and he brought all of us to his house,

514
00:38:47.743 --> 00:38:49.619
fed us and is letting us sleep here.

515
00:38:49.703 --> 00:38:51.496
It's not an easy thing to do.

516
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.706
Quiet.

517
00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:56.376
Mr. Toilet, is it not done yet?

518
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.253
I really need to go.

519
00:38:58.336 --> 00:38:59.838
- Use the other one!
- Okay.

520
00:39:01.006 --> 00:39:03.467
Sir, the toilet
in the master bedroom just died too.

521
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.718
Please unclog that one too.

522
00:39:04.801 --> 00:39:07.721
Stop pooping already! You're killing me!

523
00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:09.848
Please don't yell. Hold on.

524
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:10.932
I ought to…

525
00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:15.979
Hey, what are the others doing?

526
00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:18.899
I'm coming at you. I'm coming.

527
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:20.150
Bring it on.

528
00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:22.819
{\an8}Now, jump! And one, two, three!

529
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:26.448
Evil Han-gyul.

530
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.326
He should be studying for tomorrow.

531
00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:30.869
He's playing games?

532
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.121
Finishing moves. One, two, three.

533
00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:34.581
- Take this!
- What are you doing?

534
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.086
I crushed you!

535
00:39:39.169 --> 00:39:43.965
The top student in Shinsu High
has been beaten by Oh Dong-pyo!

536
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:48.011
Pick another game. I'll go do the laundry.

537
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.014
Which game should I crush you at?

538
00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:30.720
Oh, my.

539
00:40:35.142 --> 00:40:37.310
No. I can explain…

540
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:20.228
What are you doing here?

541
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:23.481
What do you think?

542
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:25.108
I was snooping.

543
00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:26.902
- Snooping?
- Yes.

544
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:30.488
I'm more honest than I may look,
so I'll be straight with you.

545
00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:33.158
I came here to find out something.

546
00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:35.827
How you solved
all the questions in ten minutes

547
00:41:35.911 --> 00:41:37.871
and how you always top the exams.

548
00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:39.706
Why are you looking for that answer here?

549
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.625
Then where should I?

550
00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:45.170
Follow me.

551
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:52.719
This is the on-off switch.

552
00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.471
Adjust the brightness with this.

553
00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:58.975
And for online lectures, use this.

554
00:42:00.894 --> 00:42:03.605
I'll make sure
no one comes in here from now on,

555
00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:05.232
so study as much as you want.

556
00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:07.776
I changed the pillow cover and comforter.

557
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:12.656
If I sleep here, what about you?

558
00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:15.659
We have an expensive couch.

559
00:42:28.255 --> 00:42:29.756
I've read this one.

560
00:42:32.259 --> 00:42:33.510
And this one too.

561
00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:37.764
These are the notes he lent me.

562
00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:41.101
Darn it.

563
00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:43.603
There's nothing special here.

564
00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:57.909
So this is Han-gyul's room.

565
00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:32.152
Ms. Bom, can you hear me?

566
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:40.618
Mr. Choi?

567
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.330
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

568
00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:46.750
What happened?

569
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:49.085
The sign was swaying because of the wind.

570
00:43:49.586 --> 00:43:51.338
I think you got frightened and fainted.

571
00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.091
You left the office long ago.

572
00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:57.594
What have you been doing all this time?

573
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.724
I had to do something.

574
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:04.768
Thank you.

575
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:09.022
Let's talk inside. Can you walk?

576
00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:23.870
Come in.

577
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:28.833
This is the only place
we can use electricity right now.

578
00:44:31.378 --> 00:44:32.545
ACTRESS JEONG NAN-HEE

579
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:38.218
You should go take a shower first
so you don't catch a cold.

580
00:44:38.301 --> 00:44:41.971
- I'm going to take this call.
- Okay.

581
00:44:44.307 --> 00:44:45.141
Hello?

582
00:44:55.068 --> 00:44:56.403
You're home.

583
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.201
Well, Mr. Choi said
this is the only place with electricity.

584
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:07.914
What were you doing outside
in this weather?

585
00:45:08.498 --> 00:45:11.960
Well, I was looking for something.

586
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:14.546
Where's your common sense?

587
00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:18.258
Who goes out to do that in this rain?

588
00:45:18.341 --> 00:45:19.259
Look.

589
00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:23.430
Don't you think
I must've had my reasons to do that?

590
00:45:23.513 --> 00:45:25.890
You may have, but you're being a nuisance.

591
00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:31.396
"Are you hurt? Are you okay?" Shouldn't
you ask something like that first?

592
00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:33.064
Those kinds of questions...

593
00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:35.817
are for people with common sense

594
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:44.701
I came to wash up with lights on,

595
00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:47.203
but I should just shower at my place.

596
00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:51.166
Since I only use expensive shower gels
from department stores.

597
00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:02.302
Common sense? A nuisance?

598
00:46:02.886 --> 00:46:05.513
When was I a nuisance to him?

599
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:12.979
Why did you follow me out?

600
00:46:14.147 --> 00:46:17.192
Shower gels from supermarkets
or department stores are all the same.

601
00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:18.735
Why is it so important

602
00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:21.571
that you're going
to your place with no electricity?

603
00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:25.074
You clearly don't know
what I was implying.

604
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:28.077
Do you really think
it's because of shower gel?

605
00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:32.499
I'm soaking wet, and you went on
about common sense out of the blue.

606
00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:36.503
Since you've only lived
in an apartment in Seoul,

607
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:42.091
you might find rain romantic,
watching it from high up in your room.

608
00:46:42.592 --> 00:46:43.593
But it's different here.

609
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:46.596
Here, when a typhoon comes,

610
00:46:47.889 --> 00:46:52.352
it's common sense
to abandon your house or boat to survive.

611
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:56.981
What's more important than your life
that you went out in a typhoon?

612
00:47:01.778 --> 00:47:02.737
Happy now?

613
00:47:10.203 --> 00:47:13.414
You know, I care about my life so much.

614
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:17.752
Look. I have such a nice body.
How can I not cherish my life?

615
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.087
But that's…

616
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.757
your first gift for me.

617
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:27.637
So,

618
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:32.809
you couldn't go home in this weather
because of this stupid thing?

619
00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:35.353
It could be something expensive.

620
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:36.563
Like jewels or gold.

621
00:47:37.146 --> 00:47:40.400
If it's something like that,
it would've been such a waste.

622
00:47:41.568 --> 00:47:42.485
And if…

623
00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:45.071
If it's…

624
00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:47.907
an engagement ring,

625
00:47:49.117 --> 00:47:52.870
I would've ended up
turning away your sincere feelings.

626
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.542
I should've kept it at home.

627
00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:02.338
Why did I have to carry it
in my bag and lose it?

628
00:48:02.839 --> 00:48:07.427
Ms. Bom. I could buy it for you
a thousand times over,

629
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.806
so don't ever put yourself in danger
for something like that.

630
00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:15.435
What if the sign really hit you?

631
00:48:16.978 --> 00:48:18.104
How did you know?

632
00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:21.816
What?

633
00:48:23.026 --> 00:48:25.612
How did you know
I almost got hit by a sign?

634
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:33.161
Ms. Bom!

635
00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:35.580
Ms. Bom!

636
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:37.582
Ms. Bom!

637
00:49:30.176 --> 00:49:32.553
What about Ms. Bom? Is she okay?

638
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.931
I think she fainted from shock.

639
00:49:37.684 --> 00:49:38.518
What about you?

640
00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:43.940
I'm fine.

641
00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:45.692
So hurry up and take her home.

642
00:49:45.775 --> 00:49:47.735
Don't worry, and go get it treated now!

643
00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:58.538
I treated it and got changed quickly
so you wouldn't find out.

644
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:06.421
But still,
I think I was too harsh earlier.

645
00:50:08.673 --> 00:50:10.717
The thought that the sign nearly hit you

646
00:50:11.217 --> 00:50:14.429
made me mad. I felt a surge of anger.

647
00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:20.017
Are you crying, Mr. Sun?

648
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:21.310
Am I?

649
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:23.563
It's not rain?

650
00:50:23.646 --> 00:50:24.689
No, you're crying.

651
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:29.235
Ms. Bom. Let me tell you about me.

652
00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:33.322
I don't think I've ever cried
except when I was born.

653
00:50:36.451 --> 00:50:37.910
Look. They're tears.

654
00:50:38.536 --> 00:50:39.412
What?

655
00:50:44.167 --> 00:50:45.501
What's wrong with me?

656
00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:49.380
Now that you know I'm okay, stop crying.

657
00:50:49.464 --> 00:50:50.298
Stop.

658
00:50:56.095 --> 00:50:57.180
I can't stop.

659
00:50:57.764 --> 00:50:58.598
What?

660
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:04.645
I've never cried before,
so I don't know how to stop.

661
00:51:07.774 --> 00:51:10.735
Then try reciting
the multiplication table.

662
00:51:10.818 --> 00:51:12.278
The multiplication table?

663
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:16.949
I read somewhere that you cry
when your right brain is active.

664
00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:20.411
So if you use your left brain,
it might make the right one inactive.

665
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:22.288
The multiplication table?

666
00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:26.626
One times two is two.
Two times two is four.

667
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.711
Two times three is six.
Two times four is eight.

668
00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:31.672
It's not working.

669
00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:34.842
Then how about this?

670
00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:41.098
I'm not ticklish.

671
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:45.853
Nothing logical or physical works.
What should I do?

672
00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:51.776
Then how about
something romantic, like this?

673
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:08.543
I think it's working.

674
00:52:11.254 --> 00:52:12.255
That's a relief.

675
00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:13.589
Let's go, then.

676
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:17.426
Well…

677
00:52:19.428 --> 00:52:23.641
I think
to make it stop completely, you know…

678
00:53:42.428 --> 00:53:46.849
Since the power's back on,
I should go home…

679
00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:50.269
Just... stay the night here.

680
00:53:51.187 --> 00:53:53.397
I can't let you be alone.
I'll be too worried.

681
00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:57.193
Han-gyul likes <i>gaengsigi </i>porridge,

682
00:53:57.276 --> 00:54:00.446
so I bought some bean sprouts.
Let's eat together in the morning.

683
00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:03.783
By the way, Han-gyul still…

684
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:07.244
doesn't know, does he?

685
00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:14.669
Ms. Bom.

686
00:54:17.338 --> 00:54:18.589
I'm…

687
00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:22.802
more scared…

688
00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:28.683
of Han-gyul finding out
his mom abandoned him...

689
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:36.565
than him finding out that I lied to him.

690
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:42.154
That scares me more.

691
00:55:21.777 --> 00:55:24.530
Why did you come out?
Do you want some water too?

692
00:55:25.156 --> 00:55:27.867
No. I felt a bit cold.

693
00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:32.872
The comforters here are all we got.

694
00:55:34.582 --> 00:55:37.626
Wait here. I'm sure
there's a heating mat in my uncle's room.

695
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:04.695
COURT OF KOREA

696
00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:19.960
"Inheritance Property Division Agreement"?

697
00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:31.639
"Sun Hee-yeon"?

698
00:56:34.934 --> 00:56:38.437
Why is the seal
of a dead person stamped here?

699
00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:43.818
<i>Sun Han-gyul?</i>

700
00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:48.447
Who… are you?

701
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.074
Who am I?

702
00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:54.036
Well… I…

703
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:02.253
Hey. Evil Han-gyul.

704
00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:07.133
<i>I haven't forgiven her yet.</i>

705
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:11.762
<i>But you said he has the right</i>
<i>to know who his parents are.</i>

706
00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:15.391
What you said...

707
00:57:17.476 --> 00:57:19.353
has been stuck in my head.

708
00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:26.944
I'll think more about
what will be better for Han-gyul.

709
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:35.661
Uncle.

710
00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:39.456
Yes.

711
00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:58.934
"Sun Hee-yeon."

712
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:05.566
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

713
00:58:15.868 --> 00:58:16.785
Is she alive?

714
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:12.883
{\an8}Uncle! Han-gyul went to Seoul.

715
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:14.969
{\an8}<i>I'm glad you came, Han-gyul.</i>

716
00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:19.390
{\an8}Because your uncle
wouldn't let me see you.

717
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:21.392
{\an8}Can I call you Mom?

718
00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:23.811
{\an8}<i>Because I was heartbroken.</i>

719
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:27.564
{\an8}<i>You haven't been there for Han-gyul</i>
<i>until now, so make it up to him.</i>

720
00:59:27.648 --> 00:59:31.193
{\an8}<i>Today, let's be confident</i>
<i>and have as much fun as we want.</i>

721
00:59:31.277 --> 00:59:32.152
<i>Let's do that.</i>

722
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:41.203
