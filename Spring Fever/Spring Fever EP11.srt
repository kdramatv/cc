EPISODE 11

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,328
Can you please

3
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,373
not smoke around Han-gyul?

4
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,375
You brat.

5
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,378
How dare you glare at your dad like that?

6
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,759
Bring me the booze, now!

7
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:34,970
Darn it.

8
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,096
Okay.

9
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,098
I'll go get it.

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,044
Darn it, what's taking him so long?

11
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,450
Han-gyul.

12
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,385
Han-gyul.

13
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:20,784
Jae-gyu.

14
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,500
Jae-gyu.

15
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,555
Stop it, Dad!

16
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,017
You ungrateful little bastard,
how dare you talk back to me?

17
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:46,602
You little jerk!

18
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,106
Just looking at you

19
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,734
makes my blood boil.

20
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,319
You brat.

21
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,864
Jae-gyu.

22
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,056
Jae-gyu.

23
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,563
I could've saved him. Actually...

24
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,858
I should've saved him.

25
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,569
But I...

26
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,534
just walked away and left him there.

27
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:50,040
It's unfortunate you couldn't save him,
but you can't blame yourself.

28
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,837
I guess God left me this scar...

29
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,924
so I wouldn't think that way.

30
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,104
So I wouldn't forget my sin.

31
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,650
This right here is the proof.

32
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,780
Listen, Ms. Bom.

33
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,700
I didn't hide this scar because it's ugly.

34
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,413
Every time I see it,

35
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,170
I remember the look in my father's eyes...

36
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,925
It reminds me of that moment...

37
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,555
so I couldn't bring myself to show it.

38
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,766
Jae-gyu.

39
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,772
As I ran out of the house
holding Han-gyul,

40
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,940
it hit me.

41
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,235
One day...

42
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,158
I'd eventually pay for it.

43
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,042
I kept living on edge,

44
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,920
wondering when that day would come.

45
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,506
And of all times, it's now...

46
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,471
when I'm happiest with you.

47
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,147
Even I can't forgive myself.

48
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,399
Who could possibly forgive me?

49
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,571
Even if you can't forgive me...

50
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,700
I won't resent you.

51
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,329
That too...

52
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,332
is my burden to bear.

53
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,446
HBM CHARITY CONCERT

54
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,199
-That day...
-That day...

55
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,746
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
I got too worked up that day

57
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,376
and spoke out of turn.

58
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,753
I was the one who was too harsh.

59
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,423
But I went all the way down to Shinsu

60
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,967
just to see my daughter's face,
and hearing that

61
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,552
really threw me off.

62
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,512
I totally understand.

63
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,558
If it were me and I found out the guy
my daughter was seeing was like that--

64
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,477
Say nothing.

65
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,189
Ms. Jeong. How have you been?

66
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,941
I feel like
we keep running into each other lately.

67
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,361
Because the places I go are TV stations,
premieres, all that.

68
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,406
I heard you're starting a new project
with Director Bong Chan-ho.

69
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,742
You've got eyes and ears everywhere.

70
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,828
I'll be looking forward to some good news.

71
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,996
Well then, see you later.

72
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,588
Why? Who's that?

73
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,717
The one who asked me about Bom
at the press conference.

74
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,927
Reporter Park from Disfact.

75
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,563
Strangely enough,
I see him everywhere I go lately.

76
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,108
As if he's following me everywhere.

77
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,116
Shinsu.

78
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,625
-Comfort him?
-Yes.

79
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,670
But I can't figure out how.

80
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,799
If I get too serious, he'll feel hurt.

81
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,218
If I make a big deal of it,
he'll put his guard up.

82
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,972
Why do you need to comfort him?
Did he get sued again?

83
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,683
That's not it.

84
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,893
Han-gyul got into trouble, didn't he?

85
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,020
He's not the type to get into trouble.

86
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,857
Ms. Bom, come over here quickly.

87
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,193
What's going on?

88
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,989
It's the finals.
The answer sheets are out.

89
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,450
Han-gyul marked number three
on every single Korean history question.

90
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,202
There must be some mistake.

91
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,662
Take a look.

92
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,540
Has he lost his mind?

93
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,790
What the heck is going on?

94
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,629
Han-gyul marked all threes for math too.

95
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,590
Life science is all threes as well.

96
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,675
Why would he do that?

97
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,267
Han-gyul, are you finished already?

98
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,894
It's only been ten minutes.

99
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,688
Yes.

100
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,155
I'll talk to him.

101
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,533
What was he thinking?

102
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,879
Can you tell me what happened?

103
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,722
I thought it was unfair.

104
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,474
What?

105
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,560
Ms. Bom.

106
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,064
Se-jin studies really hard.

107
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,277
She always works harder than me,
so why is it always me who comes first?

108
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,030
Shouldn't the one who works harder win?

109
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,867
Besides, I'm not even planning
to go to college

110
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,869
and I don't need to do well on exams.

111
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,455
Han-gyul.

112
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,582
Well...

113
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,296
I get that you care about your friend,

114
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,841
but fairness isn't
about cutting yourself short.

115
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:19,054
You both should do your best
and respect the results.

116
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,224
On top of that,
if someone as gifted as you

117
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,184
wants to make things fair,

118
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,186
it's not by holding yourself back.

119
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,605
You need to help others to catch up.

120
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,240
I should let your uncle know
as your homeroom teacher.

121
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,075
Wait, let me tell him.

122
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,788
I wasn't thinking straight.

123
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,998
Please give me a chance

124
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,960
to speak to my uncle myself this time.

125
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,801
Han-gyul.

126
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,569
When did mealtime get so quiet
in this house?

127
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,200
Han-gyul, isn't your uncle
acting weird these days?

128
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,828
He used to say
family should look at each other

129
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,955
instead of staring
at their phones at the table.

130
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,583
For days, he keeps looking
at his phone at the table.

131
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,126
Eat up.

132
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,545
Don't you think Han-gyul's acting weird?

133
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,672
He jumps at just hearing his name

134
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,591
and looks anxious
like he's hiding something.

135
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,510
Han-gyul, you got something to say?

136
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,264
No, nothing.

137
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:46,766
Thanks for the meal.

138
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,310
Hey.

139
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,188
Eat some more.

140
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,657
THAT WOMAN

141
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,246
I sent all the paperwork. What now?

142
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,752
Where?

143
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,842
Why did you want to see me here?

144
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,471
You couldn't stand being here
even for a second,

145
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,890
so you just left.

146
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,146
Yes, I hate this place.

147
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,194
Every time I come here,
I remember getting beaten

148
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,531
and how poor we were.

149
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,495
And thinking about our father
being part of this place

150
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,415
makes me sick.
I can't stand a single thing about it.

151
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,965
That woman came by.

152
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,301
Who?

153
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,845
Yoon Bom.

154
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,937
I'm sorry for dropping by out of the blue.

155
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,733
I asked Han-gyul
and found out where you are.

156
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,027
I see...

157
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,489
Is that so?

158
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,659
Why did you come to see me?

159
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,746
Recently, Mr. Sun told me

160
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,876
about your father.

161
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,091
I have nothing to say about that.

162
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,427
Don't come back over something like that.

163
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,104
He said,

164
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,358
"I can't even forgive myself.
Who would forgive me?"

165
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,903
Then who

166
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,865
would be able to forgive him?

167
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,910
Are you saying that's me?

168
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,582
Mr. Sun is still locking himself up
in his own guilt.

169
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,209
I think someone needs to forgive him

170
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,587
so he can be free of that memory.

171
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,880
And that's something

172
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,050
only someone
who's been through the same pain

173
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,886
can do.

174
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:32,891
Listen.

175
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,271
I'm the kind of person who ditched my kid,
only thinking about myself.

176
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,941
The poverty? I was so sick of it.

177
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,860
Getting beaten?

178
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,738
That pushed me over the edge.

179
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,158
I dumped all the responsibility and guilt
onto Jae-gyu

180
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,827
and ran off without looking back.

181
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,206
The pain?

182
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,917
Forgiveness?

183
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,839
Do you think I didn't say it to Jae-gyu

184
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,592
all this time
just because I never had the chance?

185
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,510
No.

186
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,305
It's because I felt so shameful.

187
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,144
All the more reason not to run away again.

188
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,606
Please, I'm begging you.

189
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,777
You're such a fool.

190
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,115
You're pathetic.

191
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,535
So helpless.

192
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,624
I ran off leaving my child
and my past behind

193
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,584
and I live with my head held high.

194
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,630
And you're punishing yourself
when you did nothing wrong?

195
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,259
You killed who?

196
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,636
No.

197
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,349
It wasn't you

198
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,853
who killed our father. It was God's doing.

199
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,113
Jae-gyu.

200
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,907
The scar on your arm...

201
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,288
isn't proof
that you couldn't save our father.

202
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,709
It's proof that you saved Han-gyul.

203
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:35,847
Hee-yeon.

204
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,310
If I hadn't hesitated back then...

205
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,107
maybe Dad...

206
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,028
-and all three of us--
-Would've all died.

207
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,030
Dad, you...

208
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,575
and Han-gyul.

209
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,623
And I would've died too.

210
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,876
Had anything bad happened
to the kid I abandoned,

211
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,836
I wouldn't have been able
to live with myself.

212
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,465
So let go of the guilt now.

213
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,224
Han-gyul grew up so well.

214
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,228
Thank you for saving

215
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,272
and raising him.

216
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,411
I'm so sorry.

217
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,290
It took me 18 years

218
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,418
to finally say this.

219
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,471
Bom-sik! No, stop.

220
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,557
Bom-sik, no.

221
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,901
He must have met with her.

222
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,406
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

223
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,491
Did I make things harder?

224
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:37,927
You're here?

225
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,432
I nodded off watching TV.

226
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,982
Why are you just standing there?
Do you want to come in?

227
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,067
I've got coffee today

228
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,904
and I can make some ramyeon
if you're hungry.

229
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,659
I just met my sister.

230
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,538
What did she want?
Did she ask you to sign some more papers?

231
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,582
Or did she show off her bag?

232
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,501
She said you came by.

233
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,338
Gosh, I told her not to tell you.

234
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,214
I knew she couldn't keep stuff to herself.

235
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,427
Bom, you see...

236
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,601
I said it was my burden to bear,

237
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,731
but inside, I was completely overwhelmed.

238
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,319
I said you didn't have to forgive me,

239
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,697
but inside, I was scared.

240
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,117
Terrified, actually.

241
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,331
I'm sorry,

242
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,167
and thank you...

243
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,338
for understanding someone like me.

244
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,302
Thank you

245
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,806
for coming back to your old self.

246
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,147
You know what?

247
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,193
I know the perfect way to wrap things up

248
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,987
when things get this awkward and cheesy.

249
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:20,822
How?

250
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,830
I'm totally up for it.

251
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,339
No, not here today.

252
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,014
Here.

253
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,844
Mr. Choi!

254
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,096
This is serious.

255
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,683
I've been dealing with so much lately
that most things seem minor.

256
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,479
Are you sure it's serious enough
to make such a fuss?

257
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,022
Unfortunately,

258
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,442
yes, I'm sure.

259
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,485
DISFACT

260
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,451
I need to talk to Hye-suk
when that PE teacher isn't around.

261
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,204
Geez, just where is she?

262
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,874
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hi.

263
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,876
Are you a teacher at this school?

264
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,962
Well...

265
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,007
I'm pretty involved with a teacher here.

266
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,467
Who are you?

267
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,510
I see.

268
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,804
So, the thing is... I'm...

269
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,936
PARK JAE-YEONG, REPORTER
DISFACT

270
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,356
It's a good thing I happened
to meet that guy first.

271
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,400
He didn't interview anyone else?

272
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:23,820
I think he's met someone.

273
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,155
He knew Ms. Bom was dating a parent

274
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,575
and that she came here
because of an affair.

275
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,743
But...

276
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,579
does anyone at school know about that?

277
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:39,085
Do you know
why she came down here from Seoul?

278
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,879
There is one.

279
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,589
Who?

280
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,800
So what did you tell the reporter?

281
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,218
Oh, come on.

282
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,137
I've been working with you for years now.

283
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,596
I just said,

284
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,516
"I know someone who has decisive evidence
of Ms. Bom's affair."

285
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,643
"But too many people are watching here,

286
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,104
so let's go to Seoul and talk in private."

287
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,188
Then I sent him off.

288
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,359
Mr. Oh.

289
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,237
Have I ever said that I love you?

290
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,740
It wasn't you I wanted to hug.

291
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,953
First, please draft
a fact-confirmation statement

292
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,872
based on your conversation
with the reporter.

293
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:16,789
Sure.

294
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,464
Please prepare a draft of this
and email it to me.

295
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,465
Okay.

296
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:31,012
I'll ask Ms. Bom
to sign a power of attorney.

297
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,972
So have the audio recordings
and transcripts

298
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,516
related to the affair notarized
to preserve the evidence.

299
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,393
On it.

300
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,230
All right.

301
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,817
Ms. Jeong.

302
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,569
What?

303
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,696
Who showed up where?

304
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,657
Why? What is it this time?

305
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,202
I'll go to Seoul
to speak with the reporter first.

306
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,078
Make sure to let the agency know,

307
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,581
and just in case,
it'd be best to prepare a counter-article

308
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,374
or an official statement in advance.

309
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,463
Honey!

310
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,422
Are you okay?

311
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,675
Gosh, this is bad.

312
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,887
-Seon-woong.
-Yes?

313
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,058
-Your grades improved a lot.
-Thank you.

314
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,192
Sun Han-gyul.

315
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,123
-Sol.
-Yes?

316
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,001
Good job.

317
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,172
Se-jin.

318
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,928
Good job.

319
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,100
-Min-guk.
-Yes?

320
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,188
What?

321
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,773
GRADE - RANK - SUBJECT AVERAGE

322
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,778
Is Se-jin actually smiling
at her report card?

323
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,239
Hey, Se-jin is in first place!

324
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,865
-What?
-Really?

325
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:15,866
For real?

326
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,160
That's crazy. Did she flip the whole game?

327
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,505
Congratulations.

328
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,600
What?

329
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,897
Well, you know...

330
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,232
Seriously...

331
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,026
You know what? Well...

332
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,903
You got a mosquito bite?
Why are you scratching?

333
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,407
What are you doing the day after tomorrow?

334
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,576
Saturday?

335
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,786
If you're not busy,
we could grab a meal together.

336
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,414
Why would I have a meal with you?

337
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,459
Why can't we have a meal together?

338
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,799
I'll text you the address,

339
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,760
so come if you want. If not, don't.

340
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,553
I'll just wait a bit

341
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,847
and if you don't show up,
I'll manage. Do as you like.

342
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,143
It's steak, by the way.

343
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,024
ATTORNEY CHOI I-JUN

344
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,197
Gosh, who keeps calling nonstop?

345
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:38,783
What?

346
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,203
-Hello...
-Ms. Bom.

347
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,455
I have something urgent to tell you.

348
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,414
What?

349
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,042
TEACHERS' OFFICE

350
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,470
Ms. Bom, take this call.

351
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,055
I didn't mean to listen in,

352
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,974
but he's talking about some actress
and reporter. What's going on?

353
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,060
Hello?

354
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,818
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

355
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,738
Reporters might come for you, Ms. Bom,

356
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,535
so don't go anywhere today
and go straight home after school.

357
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,246
Set your phone
to automatically record every call.

358
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,540
Yes.

359
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,834
Ignore calls from unknown numbers.

360
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,043
Let me know right away.

361
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,505
I'll meet the reporter in Seoul
and get back to you.

362
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:36,966
Hey.

363
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,718
What are you talking about? What reporter?

364
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,313
Ms. Bom!

365
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:52,898
Dong-pyo?

366
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,527
You're here.

367
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,781
Master told us to keep an eye
on your house,

368
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:01,991
no questions asked.

369
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,618
He said we should make sure
you can rest easy with no worries

370
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:05,995
while he's away in Seoul.

371
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,831
Han-gyul's uncle is... going where?

372
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,294
You barged into the car,
so I'm taking you with me.

373
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,795
But remember.

374
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,006
Don't cause a scene or raise your voice

375
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,675
unless you want to get charged
with interfering with my job.

376
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,303
If you break stuff,
that's property damage.

377
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,554
Hitting someone is assault.

378
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,015
That's enough.
Let's stop by somewhere real quick.

379
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,309
Where?

380
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,187
It's rude to go empty-handed
on our first visit.

381
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,022
I should get dressed properly.

382
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,026
He told me to tell you not to worry
since he'll take care of it

383
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,778
and to give you this.

384
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,673
ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

385
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,343
The headline's catchy,

386
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:06,764
but you need at least a photo
to get clicks.

387
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,016
This has zero visual appeal, geez.

388
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,186
I heard someone's got the evidence.

389
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,938
-Really?
-Yes.

390
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,116
REPORTER PARK JAE-YEONG

391
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,794
Hello, everyone!

392
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,756
Who's that?

393
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,719
I'm here to see Reporter Park Jae-yeong.

394
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,304
Did you use a private loan?

395
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,847
-Or co-sign for someone?
-What?

396
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,141
Did you have an affair?

397
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,102
Where's the Entertainment Department?

398
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,104
"Politics."

399
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,313
"Business."

400
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,566
Where's Reporter Park Jae-yeong?

401
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,234
"Society."

402
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:04,989
Where is he?

403
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,116
Oh, "Sports."

404
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,117
Hide for now.

405
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,868
I'll step out for a second.

406
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,036
Just hide.

407
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,751
"Entertainment Department." There it is.

408
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,467
Hi there.

409
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,469
I'm the department head.
What can I do for you?

410
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,848
I wish nothing but happiness and peace
in everything you do.

411
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,266
SUN JAE-GYU

412
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,435
Sun Jae-gyu?

413
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,978
Who's Sun Jae-gyu?

414
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,396
That'd be me.

415
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,817
I'm here to speak
with Reporter Park Jae-yeong.

416
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,194
Oh, shoot.

417
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,698
He had to leave early
for personal reasons.

418
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,952
Then I can just wait until tomorrow.

419
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,663
I've got plenty of time.

420
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:02,796
You see, I'm the one in charge,
so you can speak with me.

421
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,550
So you're the one in charge, huh?

422
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,054
I heard that Reporter Park

423
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,640
is doing a piece
on Ms. Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

424
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,975
I heard he came all the way
to Shinsu for the story.

425
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,102
I figured I'd offer a little help.

426
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,858
So you're the one
with the decisive evidence?

427
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,447
I nearly got the wrong idea.

428
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,742
We were planning to break it tomorrow.

429
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,118
So, what did you bring?

430
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,161
What is it, a call?

431
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,288
A text?

432
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,291
Or even better,
photos or videos of the affair?

433
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,923
The affair...

434
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,675
The affair?

435
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,802
I brought the evidence
that there was no affair.

436
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,682
Gosh, I can't believe this.

437
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,767
Hey, look.

438
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,186
Who cares about an article
proving it wasn't an affair?

439
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,148
People click when it appears
like it happened.

440
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,694
Then just don't run the story.

441
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,989
Who are you?

442
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,408
Me?

443
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,704
I'm a parent at the school
where Ms. Yoon works

444
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:17,996
and I'm seeing her.

445
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,460
How did you get in here?

446
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,754
I want to prove what's written here

447
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,922
is not true,

448
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,173
so let me do an interview.

449
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:29,675
Get out.

450
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,136
I'm not interested. Just leave.

451
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,767
I went through the articles
on my way here.

452
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,145
You've written
a lot of entertaining pieces, huh?

453
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,523
You put question marks on every title,

454
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,025
throw in words
like "suspicion" or "allegedly"

455
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,195
and make rumors sound like facts.

456
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,780
Unbelievable.

457
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,116
Security? This is the entertainment desk.

458
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,201
Yes, this is the Entertainment Department.

459
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,537
You're supposed to cover celebrities.

460
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,957
Why are you doing stories
on a non-celebrity family member?

461
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,876
Reporter Park, you're back?

462
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,713
What do you think you're doing?
Give it back.

463
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,714
Hey.

464
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,800
SELECT AUDIO FILE
DELETE

465
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,389
Wait.

466
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,601
Did you just delete the recording?

467
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,562
You think we've never dealt
with this before?

468
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,274
You ignorant fool.
I guess you've seen stuff somewhere.

469
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,860
Now that the recording's off,
what did you say?

470
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,196
You said we run stories
that aren't even true?

471
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,489
Listen.

472
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,867
We never publish things
that aren't factual.

473
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,411
We avoid making definite claims,
hint at things,

474
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,916
and craft the story vaguely and subtly,

475
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,417
based only on facts.

476
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,128
Look, we never said she had an affair.

477
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,297
We only write "There's a suspicion"

478
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,716
or "This tip came in."

479
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,594
Reporters only go this far.

480
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,139
How it's interpreted is up to the reader.

481
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,314
No wonder you're a department head.
You're quite the speaker.

482
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,943
Oh, I almost forgot.

483
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,904
Yeah.

484
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,073
Hey, Phillip.

485
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,116
You still haven't hung up?

486
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,036
What? The call was recorded?

487
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,875
What he said about crafting the story
vaguely and subtly was recorded.

488
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,878
Wow, what he said about
hinting at things was recorded?

489
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,088
-Did you just--
-Yes.

490
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,756
Right.

491
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,635
Like the department head said,
I'm an ignorant fool.

492
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,720
I forgot to hang up
while carrying the flowerpot.

493
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,889
Keep that recording handy.

494
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,307
Jae-gyu.

495
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,018
Hey, Attorney Choi.
You had something to say on legal grounds?

496
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,019
Come over here.

497
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,312
Yes, my phone.

498
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,480
Hey, come over here.

499
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,858
-Here.
-Oh.

500
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,610
Hello.

501
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,113
I'm Choi I-jun, the legal counsel
for Ms. Jeong Nan-hee

502
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,032
and Ms. Yoon Bom,
and the head of Choi I-jun Law Office.

503
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,833
Regarding malicious reporting
on Ms. Yoon Bom,

504
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,461
we submitted a request
for a preliminary injunction.

505
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,631
Hey, make sure to submit
the call recording as evidence.

506
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,720
If any report is released
before the court reaches a decision,

507
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,180
we'll file a petition
with the Press Mediation Committee

508
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,891
to pursue all legal measures,

509
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,560
including corrections, rebuttals
and claims for damage.

510
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,565
If the report contains false information,

511
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,276
we'll consider filing
a criminal complaint for defamation

512
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,819
under relevant laws.

513
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,786
Seems like you're busy,
so let's just leave it at that.

514
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,205
Attention. Say bye.

515
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,501
Good work.

516
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,712
Good work. Bye.

517
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,388
They're gone. Come out.

518
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,061
Man, talk about bad luck.

519
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,147
Some thug and a smug know-it-all
show up as a package deal.

520
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,273
What do we do?

521
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,526
At this point, we've got two choices.

522
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,363
Either keep it quiet and move on,

523
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,075
or go all out
and turn it into a full-blown mess.

524
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,634
How did it go?

525
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:45,180
I met with the reporter
and put in a preliminary injunction.

526
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,975
That means we can stop the article, right?

527
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:52,896
A preliminary injunction
is a court request to stop the article,

528
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,150
but it doesn't guarantee
the story won't come out.

529
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,653
What kind of law works like that?

530
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,488
So if the article gets out,

531
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,824
the victim is supposed to
sit there and take it?

532
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,284
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

533
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:07,828
Who was that?

534
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,664
Sun Jae-gyu?

535
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,878
Jae-gyu put in a lot of effort today.

536
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:23,385
If the article doesn't come out
or this situation is resolved well,

537
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,429
it'll all be thanks to him.

538
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,473
Just so you know. I'll be in touch later.

539
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,437
Why? What did Attorney Choi say?

540
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,816
Say something already.

541
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,663
Hey, there you go.

542
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,623
You can do it if you put in the effort.

543
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,542
Just keep it up like this, okay?

544
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,628
I seriously worked hard for this test.

545
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,338
The kid who's always top of your class,

546
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,966
I bet he's crying his eyes out right now,

547
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,302
since you finally beat him
for the first time.

548
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,013
Come on, who cares about him
on such a great day?

549
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,765
Hey, Grade 1 student.

550
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,478
Today, I'm buying premium ribeye for you!

551
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,692
-Mom.
-Yes?

552
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,569
I'm stepping out for a moment.

553
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,113
Aren't you going to have beef?
Where are you going?

554
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,907
Hey, Grade 1 student!

555
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,288
Two steak and cheese subs, please.

556
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,999
Make that with low-sugar onion sauce.

557
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,584
Sure, coming right up.

558
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:45,967
Why?

559
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,762
You lost your appetite after losing to me?

560
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,224
That's not it.

561
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,393
I passed on premium Korean beef
to grab a sandwich with you.

562
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,313
What did you say last time?

563
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,650
"Studying is a stamina game."

564
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,236
"If you just sit here upset,
how are you going to beat me?"

565
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,700
Are you happy getting first place?

566
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,996
Honestly, I love it,

567
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,874
minus feeling bad toward you.

568
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,337
It feels great being praised
by my mom and dad,

569
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,133
and it's thrilling
to see my classmates jealous.

570
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,929
But the best part?

571
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,143
Realizing hard work pays off.

572
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,356
It feels like the world notices it.

573
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,448
Se-jin.

574
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,618
-Listen...
-What?

575
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,749
Never mind.

576
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,627
You look really pretty when you smile.

577
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,297
Come on.

578
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,758
I'm pretty whether I'm smiling or not.

579
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,386
What are you doing? Have some.

580
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,263
The sauce is really good.

581
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,389
Okay.

582
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:24,900
It's good.

583
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,819
Geez, you ran just ten minutes.

584
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,281
No wonder you guys come in last
with stamina like that.

585
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,408
Mr. Jeong, I'm 24th.

586
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,534
Kim Min-guk came in last.

587
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:39,414
All right, listen. What we need right now
isn't training, it's refueling.

588
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,874
Let's eat up.

589
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,585
My goodness,

590
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,339
your mom's wrists got worn out
from changing your diapers, but for what?

591
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:51,635
Her back got bent
from carrying you around, but for what?

592
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,094
Wait, stop.

593
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,596
Why are you bringing up our mom?

594
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,141
I'm saying this because your grades
are worse than Han-gyul's,

595
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,976
who marked number three on every question.

596
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,021
He marked three for every question?

597
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,066
Then he's the one
who should be in trouble.

598
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,235
-Why are we getting scolded?
-Exactly.

599
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,280
You little brats,
where do you think you're going?

600
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,867
Let's go together!

601
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,414
What was that about?

602
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,876
Sun Han-gyul.

603
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,047
Did you mark only number three
on the tests?

604
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:34,970
Is that true?

605
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:37,973
Se-jin.

606
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,726
The thing is...

607
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,771
-Let me explain why--
-Was it because of me?

608
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,567
I said, was it because of me?

609
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,003
If you're asleep, fine.

610
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,588
If not, just listen.

611
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:13,967
Regarding Ms. Bom,

612
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,222
I'll take care of all the legal matters,
so don't worry.

613
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,932
And about what I said

614
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,520
in front of Ms. Jeong before...

615
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,192
I didn't really mean that.

616
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,040
To someone like you, friendship

617
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,917
probably means nothing,
like the air you barely notice.

618
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:50,045
But...

619
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,506
to me,

620
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:56,843
you were...

621
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,723
my only friend.

622
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,434
The only way I could come to terms

623
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,187
with my one and only friend
running off with my money

624
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,316
was to convince myself

625
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,363
that you were the one
who set that house on fire.

626
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,784
That was the only way I could hate you,
and the only way...

627
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:26,247
your betrayal would make sense to me.

628
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,879
Did you say "betrayal"?

629
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,256
You weren't sleeping?

630
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,969
I didn't betray you. You did.

631
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:42,847
Me?

632
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,143
That night...

633
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,070
as I ran out of the burning house...

634
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,867
I went straight to you.

635
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,790
Everything went blank,
and all I could think of was you.

636
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,377
Sun Jae-gyu?

637
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,088
You've been coming home late every day.

638
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,132
I heard you've been hanging out
with that kid.

639
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,884
His dad's an alcoholic,

640
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:24,139
and his only sister
has a child with no father.

641
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,141
Geez.

642
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,769
Now that I think about it,
you said before you didn't need a car...

643
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,896
He's not my friend.

644
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,607
Why would I hang out with a kid like that?

645
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,025
That'd be beneath me.

646
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,903
I just felt a little pity for him,

647
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,448
that's all.

648
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,741
-Right?
-Of course.

649
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,493
To make life at school easier,

650
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,287
I've got to make friends with those kids.

651
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,290
He isn't my friend,

652
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,042
so don't worry.

653
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,339
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

654
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,021
He's not my friend.

655
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,524
I just felt a little pity for him.

656
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,568
That's all.

657
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,864
I put the money I stole to good use.

658
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,533
I got a place to stay

659
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,578
and took Han-gyul to the hospital
when he was sick.

660
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,163
I worked like crazy

661
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,624
so I wouldn't look pathetic.

662
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,211
And so you'd never run your mouth
like that again

663
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,754
if we ever crossed paths,

664
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,424
I kept my distance from everyone
and focused on Han-gyul,

665
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,594
doing nothing but making money.

666
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:45,929
Wow.

667
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,098
Feels like I finally got an apology.

668
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,728
What?

669
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,525
Then that means I was your friend too,

670
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:03,780
if it hurt you that much to hear
we weren't friends that you ran away.

671
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,575
Does that matter right now?

672
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:09,994
It does.

673
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:14,624
Whether you used the money
to go to college or to raise Han-gyul,

674
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,001
I was okay
as long as you figured out a way to live.

675
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:21,172
I had saved that money for you
in the first place,

676
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,843
but back then, I didn't really have
a choice to get the money from my father.

677
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,889
As long as I could get that money,

678
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,849
bad-mouthing you to my dad?

679
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:33,935
I would've done it...

680
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,190
a hundred times, a thousand times,
without hesitation.

681
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,163
The boss is here.

682
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,000
Attention, salute!

683
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,418
Victory!

684
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,420
At ease!

685
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,755
All clear while on duty!

686
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,133
-Welcome back!
-Boss!

687
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,926
At ease!

688
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,052
Why here?

689
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,891
Stay with her.

690
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,979
Tonight isn't going to be easy

691
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:20,857
for Ms. Bom.

692
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:26,029
-What about you?
-I need to go check on someone

693
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,406
who'd probably be having a hard time
without me tonight.

694
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,577
My favorite actor, Jeong Nan-hee.

695
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,786
Whatever.

696
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,122
Here, keep this.

697
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,000
Bye.

698
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,216
Will this size fit me?

699
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,656
My little baby.

700
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,700
Bom-sik, did you wait for me?

701
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,250
Was everything all right?

702
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,210
Well...

703
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,296
I was fine
with the jiu jitsu people around.

704
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,800
Was everything all right for you too?

705
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,010
Oh, man.

706
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:33,429
I've only been in the countryside.
I'm kind of clueless.

707
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,891
We went to the company
and talked to the reporter.

708
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,768
But apparently,

709
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,562
stopping an article legally
is pretty hard.

710
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,111
Thank you for making the effort.

711
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,573
Well, it's possible

712
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,493
the article will come out tomorrow.

713
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,547
Perfect.

714
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:12,009
Let's stay up all night and have fun,
the three of us.

715
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,141
Let's leave tomorrow for tomorrow.

716
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,521
Let's do the stuff we didn't get to do,
eat whatever we want,

717
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,856
and just have fun, okay?

718
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,240
Sure.

719
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,702
Bom-sik, where should we go?

720
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,462
Bom-sik's so adorable.

721
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,089
Bom-sik's got long legs.

722
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,924
"Bom-sik's got long legs."

723
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,926
Wow, you're good.

724
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,596
Bom-sik's a tough guy.

725
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,269
Moisture check, perfect.

726
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:06,898
Digestion's great. He's healthy.

727
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,233
You're good.

728
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,361
-Bom-sik, can you turn?
-There you go.

729
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,572
-Good boy.
-Wow, good job.

730
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,032
Bom-sik, did you turn?

731
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,826
You're a genius, Bom-sik.

732
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,286
Look, it's right there.

733
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,412
Oh, boy.

734
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,706
Oh, my gosh! Our Bom-sik is a genius.

735
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,624
My gosh, good boy.

736
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,459
You love it?

737
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,712
Bom-sik.

738
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,341
Slice it right down the middle.

739
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:36,761
Wow.

740
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,471
Now, in it goes.

741
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,388
Okay.

742
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:42,892
In the preheated pan,
put some cooking oil.

743
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,270
Give it two clockwise circles.

744
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,939
Now toss the green onions in.

745
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:50,858
In they go.

746
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:54,529
Let them crisp up a little.

747
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,658
Mix them together
so they're combined well.

748
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,703
Let me try.

749
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,080
-What?
-I want to give it a try.

750
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,833
Hang on.

751
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,339
Let me try one more time. Again.

752
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,007
Hold on.

753
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,052
Geez, no way.

754
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:22,515
Now, have a seat.
Sitting still makes things easier.

755
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,850
Here you go.

756
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,270
Thanks for the food.

757
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:30,648
How is it?

758
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,316
It tastes just like yukgaejang, right?

759
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,864
This hits the spot. It's way better
than the store-bought ones.

760
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,615
Yes, eat up.

761
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,921
This is spot-on.

762
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,514
Bom-sik, there you go.

763
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,058
You want to keep playing?

764
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,275
What are you thinking about?

765
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,362
Mom.

766
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,174
MOM

767
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:47,892
Hello?

768
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,518
Don't hang up, just listen.

769
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,564
Turn off your phone now.

770
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,401
Don't search, don't text,
don't read any comments.

771
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,112
It'll feel way more unfair

772
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,616
than you imagine.

773
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,704
One insult will cut deeper

774
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,500
than a hundred words of support. And...

775
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,503
that one insult

776
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:19,090
will eat away at your heart.

777
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,677
Even so, brace your core
and stand up tall.

778
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,846
Don't skip meals
because you don't have an appetite.

779
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,224
Even if you feel sick or nauseous,
chew something.

780
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:33,354
Tonight, you probably
won't get a wink of sleep.

781
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:41,612
In moments like this,
having someone around helps you stay sane.

782
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,572
Tell that Sun Jae-gyu guy or whoever

783
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,410
to stay with you if you need him to.

784
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,792
If only you'd been born
into an ordinary family.

785
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,632
Of all people, you ended up
with a mom like me.

786
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,513
I'm hanging up now.

787
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,239
Now I see...

788
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,661
Mom must've had nights
like this all the time.

789
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,335
Oh, man, I can't fall asleep.

790
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,296
I'll just keep playing with Bom-sik.

791
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,844
Ms. Bom, try to get some sleep
like your mother said.

792
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,554
Tomorrow,

793
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,308
it might become a long day.

794
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,332
Grandma.

795
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,042
Look at this.

796
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,047
What the heck does it say?

797
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,593
So it says when Ms. Bom was in Seoul...

798
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,678
-Did Ms. Bom get involved in this?
-Really?

799
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,855
"An affair with a parent"?

800
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,193
His wife stormed in during class
and even slapped her?

801
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,695
Oh, my goodness.

802
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:47,696
Why? What's going on?

803
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,828
She's actress Jeong Nan-hee's daughter?

804
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,162
Jeong Nan-hee?

805
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:57,289
You mean that famous lady on TV?

806
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:58,791
I don't think I can see her face.

807
00:56:58,874 --> 00:56:59,708
What is it?

808
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,920
Have you guys seen Ms. Bom today?

809
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,839
No, I haven't.

810
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:05,798
I haven't.

811
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,750
Ms. Bom.

812
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,924
Bom...

813
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,289
And as a teacher, I feel so ashamed.

814
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,875
Even if you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do.

815
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:05,960
But I hope you do.

816
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,213
I'm sorry, Mom.
Please listen to me this time.

817
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,715
Both Ms. Bom and I will be going to Seoul.

818
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:12,800
Is it time already?

819
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,885
What you're doing right now
is very dangerous.

820
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,429
It's our last night.
So why not be a little dangerous?

821
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:18,514
Something sparkly.

822
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,140
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

823
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,059
Mr. Sun?

824
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,435
You're here, Ms. Bom?

825
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,945
