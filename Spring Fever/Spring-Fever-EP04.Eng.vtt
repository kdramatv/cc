{\an8}EPISODE 4

2
00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:11.822
{\an8}You're right.

3
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.624
{\an8}I finally…

4
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.171
{\an8}remembered you.

5
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.013
{\an8}Remembered me?

6
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:37.848
{\an8}The <i>dakgalbi </i>place.

7
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.104
1 YEAR AGO

8
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.276
Eat up!

9
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.820
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, sir!

10
00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:52.822
Thank you for the food!

11
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:54.865
Sir.

12
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.035
A bottle of soju, please.

13
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.703
Sure, just a second.

14
00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:00.746
Okay.

15
00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:04.333
Here you go.

16
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:07.586
I've never seen her before.

17
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.547
Maybe she's broken-hearted.

18
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.290
Geez.

19
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.502
Who eats <i>dakgalbi</i>
with their head down like that?

20
00:02:49.712 --> 00:02:51.672
You shouldn't eat it like that.

21
00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:55.134
You should sit up straight like this,

22
00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:57.511
place this on your palm,

23
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:05.936
and top it with a slice of radish,
two pieces of meat,

24
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.063
and a piece of garlic on top.

25
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:10.733
Here.

26
00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:12.693
Have it.

27
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.573
You country people are so nosy.

28
00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:24.622
You're not from here, right?

29
00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:26.957
Where are you from?

30
00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.043
What's your name?

31
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.508
My name might not exist as of tomorrow.

32
00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.558
"Beauty."

33
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.606
Then is that why you asked me to meet you?

34
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.155
Come to think of it,
the clothes you're wearing…

35
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.909
Yes, I was wearing this that day.

36
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.464
You're right. They're the same clothes.

37
00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:17.967
I was actually thinking

38
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.428
you probably asked to see me
because you remembered.

39
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.138
Yes.

40
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.976
So that's why you wanted to see me.

41
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:32.231
To be honest,
I wanted to pretend not to remember.

42
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.902
Because you're my student's uncle
and I was embarrassed you had to see that.

43
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.196
But…

44
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:45.786
I thought about
why I kept letting you get to me.

45
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.038
And I realized

46
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:52.251
that I felt indebted to you
on a subconscious level.

47
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.256
And that might be the reason.

48
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.721
So, I wanted to settle that debt today.

49
00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:16.734
And lastly…

50
00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:19.611
Here.

51
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.382
Now I finally feel like I've repaid you.

52
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.969
I'm sorry I pretended not to remember.

53
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.182
And thank you

54
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.393
so much for that day.

55
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.105
Bye, then.

56
00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:05.407
Were you trying to die,
or was it just an accident?

57
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.887
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure. Okay?

58
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.650
What happened in Seoul?

59
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.154
Can you tell me about it?

60
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.994
Why would I tell you about me?

61
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.206
Who do you think you are?

62
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.125
Bom.

63
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:30.219
After spending some time with me,
you must think we're friends now.

64
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:32.763
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

65
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.724
We're nothing like that.

66
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.647
So don't try to meddle in my business.

67
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.862
And just treat me
as your nephew's teacher.

68
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.574
Goodbye, then.

69
00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.081
Ms. Bom.

70
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.833
Ms. Bom. Yoon…

71
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.630
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL
SUN JAE-GYU

72
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:50.716
<i>What happened in Seoul?</i>

73
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.718
Can you tell me about it?

74
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.764
That was why
I wanted to pay my debt and end it.

75
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.466
There's nothing sweet
in this house, so go.

76
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.844
Just go. You won't?

77
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:44.436
What the heck? What's wrong with it?

78
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:02.913
Hide.

79
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.315
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

80
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.568
But what brought you to my place?

81
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.029
Oh. Well…

82
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:40.909
I dreamed of the perfect crime,
but it wasn't easy for a first-timer.

83
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:46.206
You went through a lot
because of my sister that day, so…

84
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.667
No, I just did my job as her teacher.

85
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.378
{\an8}Still, I should thank you as her brother.

86
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.088
{\an8}Thank me with luxury goods?

87
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.632
{\an8}No, it's just a shopping bag
for the brand.

88
00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:04.474
Well, these are the only shopping bags
I have at my place.

89
00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:15.318
Is it <i>baeksuk?</i>

90
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.159
You'll need my number.

91
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.538
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

92
00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.434
BOM, I SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDDLED…

93
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:50.020
I apologize.

94
00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.368
Is it the same girl?

95
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.913
Wow, you're texting each other now?

96
00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:10.582
Any plans to get a new job?

97
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.963
I plan to work here
for the rest of my life.

98
00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.048
Okay.

99
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:19.758
Wrap it up.

100
00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:22.636
What? Where are you going?
You need to move these.

101
00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:26.306
I feel so weak today,
I can't even lift a sheet of paper. Bye.

102
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.265
Why do you feel…

103
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.061
I plan to work here until I die!

104
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.647
SPORTS CENTER

105
00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:49.871
The Shinsu High PE teacher
sure is different!

106
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:55.544
What is this? You veterans
can't even beat a newbie?

107
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.337
No one else?

108
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.674
Are there any more guys
who want to spar with me?

109
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:32.706
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

110
00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:48.430
We're here to learn how to beat him
but might end up learning from him.

111
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.517
They say there's a bully at school.

112
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:53.727
No.

113
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.769
- Just be quiet.
- No.

114
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.897
He comes to the school,
acts rudely, and threatens them.

115
00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.858
- Don't.
- They must've suffered so much

116
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:00.942
that they came here.

117
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.613
Ms. Seo, didn't you say
we had to go somewhere?

118
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.449
Well… Oh, right.

119
00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.451
Someone we know is about to die.

120
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.495
- We should go to the funeral hall.
- Yes, we should hurry.

121
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.623
Still, you should spar with him.

122
00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.710
The teachers have been waiting so long
to spar with you.

123
00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.632
He treats his kid's teachers like that?

124
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.801
It's only right
to pull out his arm with an armbar

125
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:31.973
and finish him off
with the North-south choke.

126
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.481
But today I came to clear my head
because I feel off.

127
00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.733
I'm sorry, but let's spar next time.

128
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.737
Goodness. That's too bad,
but we should take a rain check.

129
00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.491
Let's do it.

130
00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:56.164
What's gotten into him?
Why is he acting up so much today?

131
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.732
You're pretty good, huh?

132
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.946
Hey, do you know
a good burial spot for him?

133
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.281
May he rest in peace.

134
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.585
I got you. You punk.

135
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.171
Your arm will break. Tap out!

136
00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.175
He's usually so strong.
Why is he so weak today?

137
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.052
- Punk.
- I know, right?

138
00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.221
Hey, surrender. You'll break your arm.

139
00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.852
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

140
00:16:58.935 --> 00:16:59.811
YOON BOM

141
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.482
What… Why is Ms. Bom calling at this hour?

142
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.782
Where are you going, punk?

143
00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:19.706
Answer it.

144
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:24.711
Hi, Ms. Bom.

145
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.553
You didn't disclose the major flaws
of the house. That's deceiving.

146
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:37.974
You see, I let it slide
when grubs broke out in the yard.

147
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.852
This time, there are a lot wasps

148
00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.855
flying around lately.
I can't live like this.

149
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.315
Wasps?

150
00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:46.983
Wasps?

151
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.945
Well, if you want to get rid of wasps,

152
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:54.240
I think you should look
for an expert online.

153
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:05.543
We will draw lots to decide on teams
for the Shinsu High Sports Festival!

154
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.545
In this competition,

155
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:12.550
medals will be given to everyone
on the winning team. Yes or no?

156
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.219
- Yes!
- That's right.

157
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.845
Yes!

158
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.849
Now, second-year students,
please come up and draw lots.

159
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.059
Come on up!

160
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.979
GOOD AT EVERYTHING
SUN HAN-GYUL

161
00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.356

162
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.989
Team White!

163
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.407
SO HANDSOME, SUN HAN-GYUL

164
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.205
{\an8}Team White!

165
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:50.088
Team Blue!

166
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.012
Team Blue!

167
00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.017
Team White!

168
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:07.188
Ms. Bom, I was looking into some app
because of the wasps

169
00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.274
and found someone really good.

170
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.441
Here, have a read.

171
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.193
Team Blue!

172
00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.403
What is that?

173
00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.823
"Hello. I'm the Song Joong-ki of Shinsu,

174
00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.158
the youngest son of a rich family."

175
00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:21.077
"I'd like to introduce myself briefly."

176
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:25.540
<i>"When I was a baby, I learned to crawl</i>
<i>watching cockroaches crawling."</i>

177
00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.459
<i>"Battling ants over my meals</i>

178
00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.378
<i>and waging bloody wars with mosquitoes</i>

179
00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:34.215
<i>turned me into something</i>
<i>of an insecticide expert,</i>

180
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:38.511
<i>especially when it comes</i>
<i>to dealing with wasps."</i>

181
00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:42.557
<i>"I've never been able</i>
<i>to stand nectar-sucking insects,</i>

182
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.184
<i>so I took out wasps whenever I saw them."</i>

183
00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:48.521
<i>"People even joked,</i>
<i>'Is he from a beekeeper family or what?'"</i>

184
00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:51.107
<i>"'Why is he so good</i>
<i>at getting rid of wasps?'"</i>

185
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.944
<i>"Hence, I ended up earning the title</i>
<i>'The Heir of the Wasp Family.'"</i>

186
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.572
<i>"Is there a wasp nest at your house?"</i>

187
00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.741
<i>"Did you get stung by a wasp today?"</i>

188
00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.535
"If so, please contact me,
the Heir of the Wasp Family."

189
00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:03.953
"For just 20,000 won,

190
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:08.166
I will take care of everything."
"No sticky hands guaranteed"?

191
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.500
What do you think?

192
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.462
Doesn't he sound legit?

193
00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.547
- He's the real deal.
- "An heir."

194
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.257
Next up are Ms. Seo Hye-suk

195
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.259
and Ms. Yoon Bom. Please come up.

196
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.137
All right. What will they draw?

197
00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.140
Let's go.

198
00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.268
Team Blue!

199
00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.438
Next, Ms. Yoon Bom.

200
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.401
Team White!

201
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.655
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

202
00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.117
Take a look.
It looks like a Korean food buffet.

203
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:47.580
Team Blue only has overly fermented
green onion kimchi and pickles.

204
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:53.378
<i>Bom, don't listen to him.</i>
<i>Don't say anything or get angry.</i>

205
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.921
Pickles?

206
00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:59.425
You're the one who's wrinkly like
dried fish. Who are you calling pickles?

207
00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.177
I wasn't talking about you.

208
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.345
That doesn't matter.

209
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.429
Calm down.

210
00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:07.767
The Superintendent of Education
and the governor might come that day.

211
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.853
I think Mr. Hong's making a fuss
because he'd look bad to them.

212
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.023
<i>Put up with injustice.</i>

213
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.900
Come on, don't be like that.

214
00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:19.404
To make it fair,
let us swap team members, just one.

215
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.907
<i>Restrain yourself</i>
<i>from saying what's right.</i>

216
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.286
Well, I don't know.
I can't just tell them to swap teams.

217
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.664
Unless someone wants to switch teams.

218
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.582
Ms. Bom.

219
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.876
You volunteer to switch teams.

220
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.462
What are you saying?

221
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:38.923
Why would I…

222
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:41.843
Wait, Mr. Hong.

223
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.349
YOON BOM

224
00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:53.730
Mr. Hong.

225
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:54.981
YOON

226
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.491
Where on earth did the white ball go?

227
00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.494
How could he change the decision
like that?

228
00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:11.831
Why not change the World Cup
draw results while he's at it?

229
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.295
How should I take revenge on him?

230
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:20.506
Do I have to join Team Blue
if you tell me to?

231
00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:51.079
Open up.

232
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.626
- It's good.
- Really?

233
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:00.546
Get better after eating this, okay?

234
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:27.406
Congrats on passing
the teacher certification exam.

235
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.665
Your <i>baeksuk </i>is the best.

236
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:36.916
Yay!

237
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.107
How does it taste the same
as my dad's <i>baeksuk?</i>

238
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:09.115
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

239
00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:16.330
{\an8}LAWYER CHOI I-JUN

240
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.007
Right.

241
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:35.474
Coming.

242
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:47.612
The Heir of the Wasp Family, right?

243
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:07.924
This way, please.

244
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.570
See the tree with "Sun Jae-gyu" on it?

245
00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:31.489
I think that's the cause.

246
00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:34.909
You see, I've never watered it properly.

247
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:38.371
Because I don't really care
whether it lives or dies.

248
00:25:38.955 --> 00:25:41.040
But it's so resilient.

249
00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:44.710
Every time I see it, it's grown.
Just like the person who gave it.

250
00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:51.092
I saw on the Internet that people usually
use gasoline or lacquer spray.

251
00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:53.386
How will you get rid of it with an axe?

252
00:25:55.972 --> 00:26:01.269
If you're worried about the tree,
I don't care if it breaks or gets hurt.

253
00:26:01.352 --> 00:26:02.520
So don't worry.

254
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.490
Is it done already?

255
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.244
I'll go get my wallet.
It's 20,000 won, right?

256
00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.665
I'm not that kind of person.

257
00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:07.543
I'm sure you've suffered
because of insects all your life.

258
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.295
Of course I should pay you.

259
00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:17.428
By any chance,

260
00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:20.848
could you take care of that one as well?

261
00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:24.060
I think it'll be infested with bugs soon,

262
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:26.687
so I'd like to deal with it
if the price is right.

263
00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:32.193
You mean 20,000 won?

264
00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:34.612
Please do it right away.

265
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:01.305
Sir, take a break and have this.

266
00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.641
How many grains are in it?

267
00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:17.363
What a good worker.

268
00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:23.035
If I'd known there was

269
00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:26.122
such a good worker who works so quietly,

270
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.082
I would've called for help sooner.

271
00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:33.629
It's him.

272
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:36.632
Mr. Choi I-jun.

273
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:39.051
Thank you for the <i>baeksuk.</i>

274
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:41.804
I couldn't help but call you,
like you said.

275
00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:44.557
It tastes exactly
like what I was looking for.

276
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.893
Especially the bittersweet aftertaste.

277
00:28:47.977 --> 00:28:51.230
No restaurant has recreated that taste.

278
00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:56.986
Seriously? You'll give me
the secret recipe?

279
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.573
Okay. Then, at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th,

280
00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:02.616
I'll see you at Two Cups of Coffee.

281
00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:52.416
Heave-ho!

282
00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:03.344
"Heave-ho"?

283
00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:09.016
So…

284
00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:16.649
His uncle is...
the Heir of the Wasp Family?

285
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.742
Did you finish it?
Anything you don't understand?

286
00:31:09.577 --> 00:31:10.411
There is.

287
00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:12.079
Why won't you ask me?

288
00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.374
Because I wouldn't teach you
if I were you.

289
00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:18.335
You got me wrong.

290
00:31:18.836 --> 00:31:21.797
I wouldn't lose to you
even if I taught you a little.

291
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.300
Is that so?

292
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.469
Then teach me.

293
00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:33.434
Let's not calculate them one by one
and just list them.

294
00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:37.229
Sigma k from one to ten…

295
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.606
K cubed equals…

296
00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:40.858
Two-tenths…

297
00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:47.364
It's 3,025.

298
00:32:10.179 --> 00:32:11.055
I knew it.

299
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:13.140
What are you doing?

300
00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:16.101
I knew you weren't athletic.

301
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:19.688
Team White's captain, Evil Han-gyul.

302
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.734
Have you ever seen me laugh?

303
00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:28.614
You'll see it at the sports festival.

304
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:32.534
Because I will crush you.

305
00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:37.790
Let's take a photo together that day.

306
00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:42.461
I want to capture
my victorious smile next to a loser.

307
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:57.434
It was so hot.

308
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:01.480
Well,

309
00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:05.567
I disguised myself perfectly.
How did you know?

310
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.698
Who would have dragon tattoos on their arm
except for you, Mr. Sun Jae-gyu?

311
00:33:13.242 --> 00:33:16.412
I happened to overhear Ms. Seo
talking to you on the phone.

312
00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.622
I thought you needed help.

313
00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:22.126
I told you to stay out of my business.

314
00:33:22.751 --> 00:33:24.044
Are you a stalker?

315
00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:27.715
Stalkers follow people around
to hurt them.

316
00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:29.925
I wanted to help you.

317
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.094
Look.

318
00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:35.848
I got rid of the wasps and chopped down
the tree. Is that so wrong?

319
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.766
An unwanted approach is rude.

320
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.976
I…

321
00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:45.899
I thought I made you upset,
so I wanted to make you feel better.

322
00:33:45.983 --> 00:33:48.569
Unwanted help is just a pain.

323
00:33:51.488 --> 00:33:52.614
"A pain"?

324
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:57.161
Did you just say "a pain"?

325
00:33:59.413 --> 00:34:00.414
It's 40,000 won, right?

326
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.502
The way out is that way.

327
00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:15.387
I was actually going to leave soon, okay?

328
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:18.515
There are so many people
asking for my services.

329
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:20.976
Goodness.

330
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.270
I really might end up being rich!

331
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.358
She has no idea how I feel.

332
00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:17.908
He knocked someone down yesterday.

333
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:21.161
Who's he going to beat up today?

334
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:25.332
He should've understood when I told him.

335
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:26.959
Why did he come here again?

336
00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:32.256
Draw the line, Bom.

337
00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:35.175
He's your student's uncle.

338
00:35:50.232 --> 00:35:51.567
I really enjoyed it.

339
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.820
I know it's bad manners
to give the container back empty,

340
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:56.488
but I have nothing to give you.

341
00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:57.865
The coffee's on me.

342
00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:06.874
This café's identity is…

343
00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:12.671
Coffee, <i>ssanghwa </i>tea and pumpkin porridge.

344
00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:17.551
It's like a combination
of traditional music and hip-hop.

345
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.513
I like coffee with acidity,
like Ethiopian Sidamo

346
00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:23.140
or Kenya AA.

347
00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:26.727
But every café in this area uses Robusta.

348
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.772
If you like coffee with acidity,
there's Camil Coffee on Rodeo Street.

349
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:32.983
What? That's my favorite coffee shop.

350
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:35.235
Have you tried their signature?

351
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:36.862
Orange Einspänner.

352
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.785
Here's your pumpkin porridge.

353
00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:50.792
You didn't even try this. This place's
signature is pumpkin porridge.

354
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.636
By the way,
you're not asking the question.

355
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:02.346
Sorry?

356
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.222
What question?

357
00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:08.435
Well, there's this question
everyone here asks me.

358
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:10.812
"Why did you come down here?"

359
00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:12.606
"What happened in Seoul?"

360
00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:14.316
Because some things

361
00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:17.277
are painful just to bring up.

362
00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:21.657
Country people,

363
00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:25.661
they always cross the line.
They have no sense of boundaries.

364
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:30.958
They meddle when they show interest
and interrogate when they ask questions.

365
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.462
I feel like the thoughts in my head

366
00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:37.923
just came out of your mouth.

367
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:42.803
What people like us need most
is graceful indifference.

368
00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:17.004
I'm so pathetic.

369
00:38:18.714 --> 00:38:20.757
Why did I even go there to listen to them?

370
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:25.303
But, son...

371
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.515
I'm old-fashioned,

372
00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:30.851
so if I like someone, I show it,

373
00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:34.187
and if they need help, I help them.
That's all I know.

374
00:38:35.397 --> 00:38:39.693
This line that Seoul people talk about,
I have no idea where it lies.

375
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:42.237
Bom-sik, what about you?

376
00:38:44.031 --> 00:38:47.200
Do you know what graceful indifference is?

377
00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:48.869
Do you know

378
00:38:48.952 --> 00:38:52.581
any way to make up with your mom
without crossing the line?

379
00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:58.420
Say something, Bom-sik.

380
00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:26.740
Seriously, did Bom finish it all?

381
00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:30.077
Now that the delivery's complete,
please tell me.

382
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:34.790
How did you
lose contact with your daughter?

383
00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:43.882
I'll sue them.

384
00:39:44.758 --> 00:39:48.595
The parents are in the wrong.
Why did I have to be humiliated like that?

385
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:50.305
Don't.

386
00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:54.768
Mom.

387
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:58.188
What did you... just say?

388
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:02.067
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

389
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:06.822
"The adulterous teacher is Jeong Nan-hee's
daughter." "A scandal with a married man."

390
00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:10.158
If such articles get published,
who will take the blow?

391
00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:13.120
Mom, you're only thinking
about yourself in this situation?

392
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.082
Right now, this is
the only way to prove my innocence.

393
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:20.001
You think people are interested
in your innocence?

394
00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:23.296
What they're interested in
is not the truth, it's gossip.

395
00:40:29.511 --> 00:40:30.595
Dad.

396
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.851
What needs to be done needs to be done.

397
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.895
I don't want to bury this.

398
00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:41.106
Once it's buried, it's tough to dig it up.

399
00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:46.653
I'll end up… living as a teacher
who had an affair with a parent.

400
00:40:46.736 --> 00:40:47.571
Please?

401
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:50.365
Bom.

402
00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:53.285
Is it…

403
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:57.289
really not true?

404
00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:05.338
<i>I didn't say that just for my sake.</i>

405
00:41:05.422 --> 00:41:07.174
It would've been worse for Bom.

406
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:10.677
Because she is the daughter
of celebrity, Jeong Nan-hee,

407
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.555
it would've been
exaggerated and distorted.

408
00:41:15.223 --> 00:41:17.642
Even still, she's your daughter.

409
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.770
I shouldn't have done that
to Bom back then.

410
00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:24.566
Speaking of which…

411
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:32.240
What is all this?

412
00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:36.661
The evidence Bom gathered
to file a lawsuit.

413
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:43.084
{\an8}Now that we've found Bom,

414
00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:46.004
{\an8}I want to move ahead
with the lawsuit again.

415
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:50.008
{\an8}I believe it's the only way
for us to make up with her.

416
00:41:50.759 --> 00:41:54.971
Attorney Choi, can you help us this once?

417
00:42:01.436 --> 00:42:02.312
TEAM BLUE'S PARENTS

418
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.483
TEAM WHITE'S PARENTS

419
00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:10.904
PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

420
00:42:10.987 --> 00:42:15.367
You know that the teachers and students
are divided into two teams, right?

421
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.618
- Yes.
- Yes.

422
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:17.869
Principal.

423
00:42:18.495 --> 00:42:21.248
I think there's someone here
who's not an official member.

424
00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:22.374
Pardon?

425
00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:25.293
I think it's me.

426
00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:34.552
I'm Choi I-jun, the older brother
of Choi Se-jin, a second-year student.

427
00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:38.765
It would've been appropriate
for my parents to come,

428
00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:41.017
but they're busy with the inauguration,

429
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.104
so I came on their behalf.

430
00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:47.941
"On their behalf"?
This isn't some neighborhood meeting.

431
00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:56.491
I've reviewed
the parent-teacher meeting regulations,

432
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.576
and this doesn't violate any legally.

433
00:42:59.077 --> 00:42:59.995
As it happens,

434
00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.413
{\an8}SCHOOL RULES AND POLICIES

435
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:03.498
I'm a lawyer.

436
00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.255
First thing,

437
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:14.175
is there a volunteer to be the leader
of the parents on Team White?

438
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.226
Bom-sik, Mom's here.

439
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.644
- Hello.
- Hello.

440
00:43:24.728 --> 00:43:26.021
You came.

441
00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:27.147
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

442
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.858
Bom-sik.

443
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.033
What?

444
00:43:39.326 --> 00:43:41.911
Gosh, it was here.

445
00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:44.164
I must've left it here last time.

446
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:46.958
Bom-sik, this is the ball I drew.

447
00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:48.460
Do you want it?

448
00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:49.711
- Do you?
- Team White.

449
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:55.258
You see, Mommy came up with a plan
to win for sure at the sports festival.

450
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:07.187
Okay. Then I'll win at all costs
and get the medal for you, Bom-sik.

451
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.396
You trust me, right?

452
00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:14.277
<i>I'll do it.</i>

453
00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:18.865
Any objections?

454
00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:25.038
All right. The leader for Team White
has now been decided.

455
00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:28.208
What about Team Blue?
Who will be the leader?

456
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:34.672
I'll do it.

457
00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:38.385
Se-jin told me that you're on Team Blue.

458
00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:40.512
I am on Team Blue, but…

459
00:44:41.096 --> 00:44:44.474
Se-jin seemed so determined
to win this sports festival.

460
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.601
I'm as determined as she is.

461
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:50.605
The medal will be around my neck
when it ends, no matter what.

462
00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:00.240
Oh, my. It's been decided so quickly.

463
00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:02.200
Okay, that's final.

464
00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:03.535
Now, you two,

465
00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:06.788
why don't you come forward
and shake hands?

466
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.003
Come closer.

467
00:45:46.286 --> 00:45:49.038
All right. Exercising is
all about stamina.

468
00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:51.166
At this sports festival,

469
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:54.210
the tug-of-war will draw
the most attention,

470
00:45:54.294 --> 00:45:56.463
and stamina will determine the winner.

471
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.757
Make sure everyone's ready, okay?

472
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:00.925
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

473
00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:01.926
INSTRUCTOR

474
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.178
Uncle.

475
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.596
Do we have to go this far?

476
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.097
Yes, we do.

477
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:08.308
I mean, we're supposed to enjoy the day.

478
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:09.893
Must we do this to win?

479
00:46:09.976 --> 00:46:11.978
Yes. All right.

480
00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:18.359
Competition might be painful,
but it brings you great achievements.

481
00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:21.029
And through this sports festival,

482
00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:23.156
all of you will learn that lesson.

483
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.575
Who wants to learn that here?

484
00:46:26.326 --> 00:46:27.869
Can't you see they're sleepy?

485
00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:36.628
Are you sleepy?

486
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:38.046
No, sir!

487
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:39.923
All right, everyone open your eyes!

488
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.258
You can sleep when you're dead.

489
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.763
Now, everyone grab the rope
in front of you.

490
00:46:49.265 --> 00:46:50.642
Move faster!

491
00:46:51.893 --> 00:46:55.522
After the training,
I'll check your breath.

492
00:46:56.105 --> 00:47:00.527
If I smell toothpaste from your mouth,
it means you haven't trained properly.

493
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.738
From now on,
until your breath smells like anchovies,

494
00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:05.698
pull the rope. Understood?

495
00:47:05.782 --> 00:47:07.158
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

496
00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:10.245
Pull!

497
00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:11.829
Pull!

498
00:47:12.914 --> 00:47:13.748
Hey, pull!

499
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:15.416
Pull!

500
00:47:18.461 --> 00:47:20.171
Pull!

501
00:47:26.094 --> 00:47:27.428
Pull!

502
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.604
Pull harder! Team White!

503
00:47:36.688 --> 00:47:39.107
{\an8}Let's say their weight is 1,000 kg

504
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:42.569
{\an8}and our weight is 900 kg.

505
00:47:43.278 --> 00:47:45.280
If they stand in a single line...

506
00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:48.324
and we stand in two lines,

507
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:52.161
since their 1,000 kg force
will be pulled diagonally--

508
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.079
Sir.

509
00:47:54.247 --> 00:47:56.457
Why do we have to know this?

510
00:47:58.543 --> 00:48:00.587
General Kang Kam-chan once said

511
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.632
that force is always defeated by wisdom.

512
00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:08.845
You and the general must not know this
since you've never lost in your life.

513
00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:10.847
If you give up, your life gets easier.

514
00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:14.100
I'm sure you're all hungry.
Let's just go eat.

515
00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:17.395
Mattis Donuts!

516
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.701
Aren't those the Mattis Donuts
that went viral on Instar?

517
00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:33.786
They're hard to get, even in Seoul.

518
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.705
How long will you eat nothing but rice?

519
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:50.345
This rich cream and soft, fluffy pastry.

520
00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:53.681
Behold. This is the taste of Seoul.

521
00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:02.440
Students who attend the strategy meeting

522
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:04.984
will be provided
with a different dessert every time.

523
00:49:05.068 --> 00:49:06.694
And if Team Blue wins,

524
00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:12.158
the best salt bread
from Eclani in Seonggu-dong

525
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:13.534
will be given to you.

526
00:49:13.618 --> 00:49:15.286
Hooray for Team Blue!

527
00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:17.997
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

528
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:20.416
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

529
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.044
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

530
00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.587
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

531
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.947
Did you get the tissues ready?

532
00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:55.118
You'll end up weeping and sniffling.
You'll need boxes of them.

533
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.079
Prepare wet wipes if possible.

534
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:02.291
Blowing your nose with tissues
will make your nose chafe.

535
00:50:10.842 --> 00:50:11.676
Me?

536
00:50:18.057 --> 00:50:18.933
Hey.

537
00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:21.102
Did you encourage him?

538
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:22.437
What do you mean?

539
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.023
Because I said I'd beat you,
you dragged your uncle into this.

540
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:29.819
My uncle and I have never talked
about the sports festival.

541
00:50:29.902 --> 00:50:32.447
Then why is your uncle
so passionate about it?

542
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.324
I mean,

543
00:50:36.117 --> 00:50:40.121
isn't it unfair for your uncle
to participate in the sports festival?

544
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:43.916
It's like a professional Go player
competing against an amateur

545
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.085
or a pop star
competing against an amateur.

546
00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:48.004
I admit that,

547
00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:51.424
but my uncle doesn't change his mind
once he decides on something.

548
00:50:52.008 --> 00:50:54.135
I tried to stop him many times today,

549
00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:55.511
but it didn't work at all.

550
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:58.473
- You tried to stop him?
- I did.

551
00:51:06.314 --> 00:51:07.273
You know...

552
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:10.067
You have a way of confusing me.

553
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:16.282
Sometimes it feels like
you're trying to screw me over,

554
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:19.327
and sometimes like
you're trying to help me.

555
00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:24.582
Which one is it?

556
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.085
Good or evil?

557
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.969
Bom-sik. Good dog.

558
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:39.430
Bom-sik, let's play.

559
00:51:47.814 --> 00:51:49.023
Good dog.

560
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:50.566
Yes! Good dog!

561
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.026
Gosh, you're like a person.

562
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:53.611
You're human now.

563
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:57.031
Good job.
Bom-sik, you're a genius, aren't you?

564
00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.908
Good job, my baby.

565
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.963
Bom-sik, Mommy's busy
with preparations for the sports festival,

566
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:14.632
so I'll get going. Tell him that for me.

567
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:19.262
Can you ask her
if she sees any more wasps?

568
00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:23.432
Well, I don't see any now.

569
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.019
And ask her what happened
to the grubs in the yard.

570
00:52:27.103 --> 00:52:28.771
They're gone too.

571
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:36.404
Your dad may lack sensibility
and be tacky in some ways,

572
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:40.074
but when he does something,
he gets it done. Tell her that.

573
00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:45.454
Ask him if he wants me
to say thank you, then.

574
00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:47.957
I'm not saying I want to hear that,

575
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:51.502
but I don't want her to get me wrong.
Tell her that.

576
00:53:00.887 --> 00:53:01.721
Here.

577
00:53:02.388 --> 00:53:03.472
This is

578
00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:06.809
the money your dad earned
working part-time. It's for you.

579
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:12.064
Seoul people may feel comfortable
with setting the bill so accurately,

580
00:53:12.148 --> 00:53:16.110
but people here
feel so uncomfortable with it.

581
00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.529
Bom-sik, use it for your snacks.

582
00:53:25.286 --> 00:53:28.247
Your dad is the leader
of the parents on Team White.

583
00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:32.418
I will win at all costs
and get you the medal, Bom-sik.

584
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:33.836
You can look forward to it.

585
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.504
Okay?

586
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:41.677
I'm off.

587
00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:18.756
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS FESTIVAL

588
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:21.801
{\an8}FIGHT AND WIN!
TEAM WHITE! LET'S GO!

589
00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:23.469
TEAM WHITE
TEAM BLUE

590
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:25.680
PERFECT LIKE A GOD!
SUN HAN-GYUL!

591
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:27.848
OUR HERO!
SUN HAN-GYUL, LET'S GO!

592
00:54:56.711 --> 00:54:57.586
What is it?

593
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:02.883
- Uncle.
- What?

594
00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:06.846
What is it?

595
00:55:12.685 --> 00:55:14.437
Do you want something from me?

596
00:55:15.104 --> 00:55:16.397
You want more allowance?

597
00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:19.650
Can you not come to...

598
00:55:20.901 --> 00:55:21.777
the sports festival?

599
00:55:25.364 --> 00:55:26.198
What?

600
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:31.620
You've been acting strange.

601
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:34.582
Why do you keep complaining
about the sports fest?

602
00:55:35.499 --> 00:55:38.753
And you? Why are you so desperate to win?
You even trained the kids.

603
00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:44.216
Isn't it such a good opportunity?

604
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.428
Kids these days don't move much
since they study all the time.

605
00:55:48.304 --> 00:55:52.433
They get to improve their stamina
and learn to work as a team, and…

606
00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:53.434
And?

607
00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:55.811
And, you know…

608
00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.648
Your homeroom teacher wants to win.

609
00:55:59.732 --> 00:56:00.775
What?

610
00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:04.945
If she wins, she'll feel good.

611
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:07.323
If she feels good, she'll teach you better

612
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:10.659
and take better care
of you and your classmates.

613
00:56:10.743 --> 00:56:13.454
If you want her to win,
you shouldn't participate.

614
00:56:14.497 --> 00:56:15.498
What do you mean?

615
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:18.375
She's... on Team Blue.

616
00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:19.418
Gosh.

617
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:21.378
She's on Team White.

618
00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:22.421
She's on Team Blue.

619
00:56:22.505 --> 00:56:24.131
She's on Team White, you punk.

620
00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:27.510
I saw her holding a white ball
with my own eyes.

621
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.428
But it changed.

622
00:56:31.472 --> 00:56:32.348
What changed?

623
00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:34.391
Se-jin saw it in the teachers' office.

624
00:56:35.184 --> 00:56:38.562
Hong Jung-pyo put her on his team,
saying his team was too weak.

625
00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:42.149
Because both Ms. Bom and Se-jin
are on Team Blue,

626
00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:43.734
Se-jin's brother's making a fuss.

627
00:56:49.198 --> 00:56:50.032
Uncle.

628
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:54.829
I don't care whether we win
the stupid sports festival or not,

629
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.247
so don't participate.

630
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.624
So that she can win. Okay?

631
00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:02.294
You won't, right? Right?

632
00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.880
- Let go of me.
- Why?

633
00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:21.730
Sir! We gathered
and pulled the tire again yesterday.

634
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:24.859
Do you want to smell my breath?
It's brutal.

635
00:57:29.864 --> 00:57:30.865
Good job.

636
00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:34.285
Everyone, keep your eyes open!

637
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.121
You can sleep when you're dead.

638
00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:45.129
Well, you know, sufficient sleep

639
00:57:45.713 --> 00:57:48.757
is essential for students
who are still growing.

640
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:54.346
Excessive competition
is what ails this era,

641
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:58.517
and participation
is more important than winning.

642
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:03.147
So don't be obsessed with winning,

643
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.273
and just enjoy it.

644
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:06.817
Okay? Good.

645
00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:07.735
Master.

646
00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:09.987
I think your pep talk has changed a bit.

647
00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:13.782
Why aren't you wearing our team T-shirt?

648
00:58:34.595 --> 00:58:36.972
ONE HEART SPORTS FESTIVAL

649
00:58:46.815 --> 00:58:47.650
Choi I-jun.

650
00:58:49.485 --> 00:58:52.655
In tug-of-war,
you should use your legs, not your arms.

651
00:58:52.738 --> 00:58:53.781
Okay?

652
00:58:55.324 --> 00:58:57.952
Embrace your core until the match ends,

653
00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.372
and pull with all your might
with your hip and thigh muscles.

654
00:59:01.455 --> 00:59:02.581
Understand?

655
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:08.712
What do you think?

656
00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:11.048
What do you mean?

657
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:16.136
Isn't this place nice and quiet
for us to take a picture later?

658
00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:19.932
That's if I win.

659
00:59:21.642 --> 00:59:23.018
You asked me last time

660
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:28.148
if my intentions were good or evil.

661
00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:29.858
So?

662
00:59:29.942 --> 00:59:34.697
Once the sports festival ends,
you'll know the answer.

663
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.326
I won't participate.

664
00:59:41.787 --> 00:59:43.247
Don't be ridiculous.

665
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.959
If I participate,
I'll join the military again.

666
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:50.629
I'll only eat vegetables
at barbecue places,

667
00:59:51.338 --> 00:59:53.799
and I'll call you "honey"
for the rest of my life.

668
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:54.925
Believe me now?

669
00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:56.802
Why the sudden change of heart?

670
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.725
So win no matter what, okay?

671
01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:04.768
Team Blue.

672
01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:06.228
Good luck.

673
01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.108
The homeroom teacher's here!

674
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.176
Why would I…

675
01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.268
Gosh, it was here.

676
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.192
I am on Team Blue, but…

677
01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:16.799
Team White?

678
01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:18.592
Team White?

679
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.141
Team White, are you ready to win?

680
01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.601
Let's go!

681
01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.518
{\an8}Use your legs!

682
01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.146
{\an8}<i>I need you, Mr. Sun.</i>

683
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.313
{\an8}Please?

684
01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.107
{\an8}<i>I'm just as upset.</i>

685
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:17.443
{\an8}Who are you?

686
01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:19.945
{\an8}I'm here to see Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

687
01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.531
{\an8}Her smile. That's all I want to see.

688
01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.324
{\an8}It's the same for me.

689
01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:28.162
It's all done, Bom-sik's house.

690
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.455
<i>I love you.</i>

691
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.252
