SUN HEE-YEON

00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:36,847
Sun Hee-yeon?

5
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,187
Why is the seal
of a dead person stamped here?

6
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,109
<i>Sun Han-gyul?</i>

7
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,531
Who… are you?

8
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,282
Who am I?

9
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,868
Well…

10
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,912
<i>"Sun Hee-yeon."</i>

11
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,961
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

12
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,512
Han-gyul.

13
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,725
How did a dead person's seal
end up on here?

14
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,438
I'll explain everything, so calm down.

15
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,691
- People are sleeping inside--
- Is she alive?

16
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,989
I said, is she alive?

17
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,540
What is it? What's going on?

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,380
No, it's nothing.

19
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,594
It doesn't look like nothing to me.

20
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,936
Go inside. I'll get you a heated blanket.

00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,371
{\an8}Eat up, Han-gyul.

23
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,458
{\an8}Your uncle made <i>gaengsigi </i>porridge

{\an8}Han-gyul.

25
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,973
{\an8}- I'm off to school.
- Wait.

26
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,601
{\an8}I need to give you an invite
to my grandma's 70th birthday.

27
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,853
{\an8}You're going to school? It's too early.

28
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,315
{\an8}Hey.

29
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,985
Evil Han-gyul.

30
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:58,906
Why?

31
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,701
<i>"Sun Hee-yeon."</i>

32
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,956
It's my mom's name,
who you said died in a fire.

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,833
Is she alive?

34
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,170
I said, is she alive?

35
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,093
I'll pay for the stay.

36
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,553
- There's no need for that.
- I need to take care of it.

37
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,266
I can't stand owing favors,
so this situation's uncomfortable for me.

38
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,519
Let's call it even on this day.

39
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,355
I'll buy you ice cream or something,

40
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,273
so hit me up when you come.

WORLD HISTORY

42
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,679
Hey.

43
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:05,973
I'm home.

44
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,183
Han-gyul.

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,231
Your mind's all over the place,
I bet it was hard to focus on the exam.

46
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:20,362
Whatever you're wondering,
don't keep it inside, just ask me.

47
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,575
I'll answer as best as I can, okay?

48
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,078
<i>What could I possibly expect from you,</i>
<i>who lied to me for 18 years?</i>

49
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:28,996
Han-gyul.

50
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,585
Dong-pyo asked me
to help with the party tomorrow.

51
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,379
I have to head out at dawn.
I'll go to bed early.

52
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,218
Okay, get some rest.

53
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,471
We'll talk after the party tomorrow, okay?

54
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,932
Ask me anything
you're curious about, all right?

55
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,620
I'm not going to ask you, Uncle.

56
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,289
I'll ask her directly.

57
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,922
"Seocho-gu, 33-5 Balpo-dong."

58
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,391
What's this?

59
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,896
It's a new marketing trick
from a small-town lawyer with no clients.

60
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,736
LEGAL BRIEFS

61
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,074
COURT RULINGS ON TEACHER ASSAULT

62
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,827
You mentioned
a colleague of your colleague

63
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,621
who got assaulted by a parent.

64
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,546
I put together the legal briefs
and court rulings from cases I worked on.

65
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,841
I thought they might be useful
for that colleague.

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,510
I appreciate it...

67
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:12,141
but I think that colleague
would rather bury it and move on.

68
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,569
Nothing in the world
should just be buried.

69
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,201
Once you bury something,
it's even harder to dig back up.

70
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,957
Then pass along this message.

71
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,793
I'll deal with the mess myself.

72
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,378
Don't forget,

73
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,423
Attorney Choi I-jun...

74
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,259
is always on your side.

75
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,620
Did Sun Jae-gyu make all of this
by himself?

76
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,579
No way.

77
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,541
At first, he seemed like
a total disaster as a bachelor,

78
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,044
but it turns out
he's the perfect husband material.

79
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,674
Thanks.

80
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,552
First of all,

81
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:35,015
I sincerely congratulate Mrs. Yang Bok-hee
on her wonderful 70th birthday.

82
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,523
Knowing that many elders would be here,

83
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:48,070
I focused on balancing
both health and taste.

84
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,031
If you look here,
for the marinated flounder,

85
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,077
I used pear juice instead of sugar
to be mindful of blood sugar levels.

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,578
As for the <i>jeon,</i>

87
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,498
I used half soybean oil
and half perilla oil

88
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,334
to keep the smoke point down
and bring out the flavor.

89
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,295
Make yourself at home,
there's plenty of food.

90
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,672
Enjoy as much as you like.

91
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,715
One more thing.

92
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,551
I'll grill the ribs on the spot.

93
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:22,396
LA <i>galbi. </i>Next person. Hope you enjoy.

94
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,772
Next in line.

95
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,650
What's going on?
You haven't answered my texts.

96
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,196
As you can see, I've got my hands full
with all the food prep.

97
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,117
I've been meaning
to discuss something about Han-gyul.

98
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,124
Okay.

99
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,669
How about <i>yukhoe?</i>

100
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,797
Here, grill it yourself.

101
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,799
Ms. Bom, come over for a second.

102
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,098
Did something happen with Han-gyul?

103
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,433
That's the strange thing.

104
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,184
He hasn't asked about his mom at all.

105
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,562
It's a party, so noodles are a must.

106
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,523
Yes, sure.

107
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
Here you go, enjoy.

108
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,609
Thanks.

109
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,070
- It's self-serve from here on.
- Sorry?

110
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,872
Geez, there are so many people here.
There's no time to talk.

111
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,915
So, where's Han-gyul?

112
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,169
Is he not here?

113
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,129
He headed out at dawn to help Dong-pyo.

114
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,380
I haven't seen him.

115
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,716
Then where is he?

116
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,675
Look at you two!

117
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,180
Standing side by side like this.

118
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,639
You two look wonderful together.

119
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:41,975
How is everything?

120
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,353
- Everything okay between you?
- Auntie!

121
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,397
Ma'am.

122
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
Saying things like that
could get us in trouble.

123
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,944
Wait!

124
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,405
Isn't that tuna?

125
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,742
There's only one tuna.

126
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,036
Only the fastest will get a taste.

127
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,537
- Really?
- Where is it?

128
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,213
So, have you guys started
working on having a kid?

129
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,508
Ma'am, I'll explain everything later,

130
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,926
so please keep it down.

131
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,887
There's nothing embarrassing
about trying to have a baby.

132
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,765
You're the man of the house,
so you need to work a little harder.

133
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,809
You said you were hoping for a daughter.

134
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,064
Did you just say...

135
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,321
"daughter"?

136
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,199
Mr. Choi, that's not it.

137
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,119
Hey, Bom-sik's mom and dad,
I didn't know you were here.

138
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,832
They come to the clinic together
and are inseparable,

139
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,709
and today's no exception.

140
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,714
All the people
at the market have been talking.

141
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:59,469
When she buys a pot,
he's there carrying it for her.

142
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,887
What a gentleman.

143
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,139
No, I didn't...

144
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,057
See? I knew it.

145
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,809
What's the point of me staying quiet?

146
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,311
You guys went around
basically telling everyone in town.

147
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,271
Mr. Jeong!

148
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,398
Don't.

149
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,691
You can't break your word--

150
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,485
Han-gyul's uncle,
let's make this absolutely clear.

151
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,945
I, Jeong Jin-hyeok,

152
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,322
swear I never told anyone

153
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,743
that you two were hugging in private.

154
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,829
I've never mentioned the fact

155
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,332
that you got down on your knees,
begging me to keep it a secret.

156
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,210
All the others here
have given their account.

157
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,550
Han-gyul's uncle is...

158
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,137
dating Ms. Bom?

159
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,394
What's taking him so long?

160
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,022
He hasn't called, what the heck?

161
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,399
Se-jin.

162
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,526
Why are you still out here?

163
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,487
The buffet's all set up inside.

164
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,072
Dong-pyo, haven't you seen Evil Han-gyul?

165
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,782
He went to Seoul.

166
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,368
Seoul?

167
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,454
He said he had to meet someone in Seoul.

168
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,832
He couldn't make it today, but he left
a gift for Grandma early this morning.

169
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,962
Right, he told me not to tell anyone.

170
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,906
Uncle! Han-gyul's uncle.

171
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,077
You see, Han-gyul...

172
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,454
Well, he...

173
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,667
What about him?

174
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,922
Sun Han-gyul went to Seoul.

175
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,736
<i>Who is it?</i>

176
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,043
Is that you, Han-gyul?

177
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,020
I'm glad you came.

178
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,397
I'm glad you came, Han-gyul.

179
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,489
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

180
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,909
Can I ask?

181
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:59,459
You were alive and well.
So why did you make me live with Uncle?

182
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,639
Back then,

183
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,726
I was...

184
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,563
I was just too young.

185
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,360
I had no idea
what I was doing when I had you,

186
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,030
and I had to raise you alone.

187
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,119
I couldn't earn enough
to even afford formula,

188
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,414
so I left you with your uncle

189
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,999
and went to work to make money.

190
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,462
By the time I came back for you,

191
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,924
the house had already burned down,

192
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,762
and your uncle had left with you.

193
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,143
You seriously call that an excuse?

194
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,395
With a few phone calls,

195
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,023
you would've been able to find out
where I went or where I lived.

196
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:09,112
Are you saying you haven't contacted me
all this time because you couldn't?

197
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,698
Your uncle

198
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,868
wouldn't let me see you.

199
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,753
I know it was hard for you
growing up without a mom.

200
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,966
But all those years I lived without you
were a nightmare for me too.

201
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,264
But Jae-gyu must've thought

202
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,353
that if I wanted to start a new family,

203
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,524
I had to hide the fact

204
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,320
that you existed.

205
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,033
He thought it was what's best
for both you and me.

206
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,786
How's that supposed to be
what's best for me?

207
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:02,957
You know what?

208
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,878
I wasn't happy at all,
even when I came in first at school.

209
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,924
Others might have envied my report card.

210
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,471
But I... envied the kids
who were worried they would get yelled at

211
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,014
by their moms for bad grades.

212
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,230
All those award certificates and medals,

213
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,900
maybe Uncle was proud of them,

214
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,236
but I wasn't.

215
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,865
I could see I was using
those things to try and cover up

216
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,700
my insecurity of not having a mom.

217
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,957
May I take your order?

218
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,378
Han-gyul, let's eat something first.

219
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,172
You came all the way to Seoul
and haven't eaten anything, right?

220
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,551
I'll have the truffle oil gnocchi.

221
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,603
The same for him, please.

222
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,567
Is that all right, son?

223
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,032
What on earth is going on, Mr. Choi?

224
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:22,036
I acted like I was divorced so things
would work out between you and Ms. Bom.

225
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,330
I just gave Ms. Jeong an update

226
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,791
that everything's going well
between you two.

227
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,709
Mr. Oh.

228
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,338
I want to be alone and quiet
like a rock on a hill.

229
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,885
Could you please
go have some tuna belly or something?

230
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,978
Ms. Hye-suk,
why are you looking at me like that?

231
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,107
Seong-tae, have you never been married?

232
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,108
Sorry?

233
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,613
- It's true.
- Well...

234
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,241
Hye-suk, please hear me out.
Let me explain why I did that.

235
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,953
It's because of Ms. Bom.

236
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,375
So, Mr. Choi is interested in Ms. Bom.

237
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,877
I didn't have a way to help.

238
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,881
Then I heard
you're the one closest to her.

239
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:20,011
So basically, you didn't have
any feelings for me.

240
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,472
Well...

241
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,058
But...

242
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,561
Hye-suk.

243
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,772
Hye-suk!

244
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,862
This is driving me crazy.

245
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,213
I wish we could talk more,

246
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,799
but you didn't tell your uncle
you came here,

247
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,592
so I'm a little worried.

248
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,180
If he finds out you came here,
he might not let you come see me again.

249
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:06,975
Does that mean...

250
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,645
it's okay for me to come again?

251
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,646
Of course.

252
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,816
Can I really come by?

253
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,988
Is it okay if I give you a call?

254
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,739
Sure.

255
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,742
You have your family around.
Are you really sure it's okay?

256
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,706
You're my family too.

257
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,335
Let me ask you one more thing.

258
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,549
Can I call you "Mom"?

259
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,321
Right.

260
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:04,907
Her number.

261
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,845
I did what you told me to do.

262
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,682
I swear I did.

263
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,479
I told him I didn't leave him,
and that you wouldn't let me see him.

264
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,482
I told him I did try to find him,
but I just couldn't.

265
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,650
I also said he's my family too

266
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,694
and he can come anytime he wants.

267
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,449
I said exactly what you told me,
every single word.

268
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,078
Your uncle had left with you.

269
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,996
He wouldn't let me see you.

270
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,791
You're my family too.

271
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:05,176
<i>If you hurt Han-gyul,</i>
<i>even a tiny bit, I won't forgive you.</i>

272
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,221
From now on, whenever Han-gyul comes by,

273
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,223
you smile no matter what.

274
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,226
Whenever he calls,
you answer no matter what.

275
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,439
You haven't been there for Han-gyul
until now, so make it up to him.

276
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,946
Don't ever mention
that you abandoned Han-gyul.

277
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,200
And if he asks...

278
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,579
you blame me, no matter what.

279
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,167
That's the condition for me
to sign the agreement.

280
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,253
You understand?

281
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,171
<i>Yes, I got it.</i>

282
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,048
So that's a promise, okay?

283
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,467
I'm so relieved.

284
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,219
Yes, thanks so much.

285
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:53,015
Well, Han-gyul just left,
so he should be on the train soon.

286
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:53,975
One moment.

287
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,479
I've got to go pick up my kid.

288
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:02,692
So, shall we decide
when we'll sign the papers?

289
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,111
Are you coming to Seoul?

290
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,322
No, it's fine, I can go there. I'll go.

291
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,737
EVIL HAN-GYUL

292
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,905
What?

293
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,242
Wait, why's Han-gyul calling you?

294
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,412
Hey.

295
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,247
Yes.

296
00:24:58,998 --> 00:24:59,874
What?

297
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,293
Yeah.

298
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,005
Okay, bye.

299
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,345
Jjun, give me a ride to Seoul.

300
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:14,972
Hold on.

301
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,684
So you want to go see Sun Han-gyul?

302
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,769
All the way to Seoul?

303
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,355
I'll tell you everything on the way.

304
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,566
Didn't you say you wanted to beat him?

305
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,111
You said you'd do anything
if I helped you crush Han-gyul.

306
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,990
But he needs me.

307
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:39,330
Yes, I do want to win against him
and I do want to crush him.

308
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,708
But for now, I have to go see him.

309
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,044
So please, take me there, okay?

310
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,712
Hurry up. Let's go now.

311
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,091
Wow, the bubbles are coming out nicely.

312
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,512
They're floating really far.

313
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,348
Try again.

314
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,904
Here, eat this.

315
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,533
Just sitting here won't solve anything.

316
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,829
Han-gyul used to be that small too.

317
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,292
Have I ever told you?

318
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,879
About Han-gyul
during his school performance.

319
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,050
SHINSU KINDERGARTEN TALENT SHOW

320
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,470
<i>Ding-dong, the bell rings</i>

321
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,807
<i>I ran to open the door</i>

322
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,228
<i>And there was my dad I'd been waiting for</i>

323
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:48,482
<i>Standing in front of the door</i>

324
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,902
<i>I was so happy that I smiled</i>

325
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:55,489
<i>And called out, "Daddy"</i>

326
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,493
<i>But his face looked</i>

327
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:03,456
<i>A little sad today</i>

328
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,585
<i>Did something happen?</i>

329
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:11,088
<i>Is something worrying you?</i>

330
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,758
<i>Did something...</i>

331
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:14,925
Han-gyul, I'm here.

332
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,013
<i>Go wrong today?</i>

333
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,391
<i>- Cheer up, Daddy.</i>
<i>- Cheer up, Uncle.</i>

334
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:26,395
<i>I'm here for you</i>

335
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,982
<i>- Cheer up, Daddy</i>
<i>- Cheer up, Uncle</i>

336
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:34,153
<i>I'm here for you</i>

337
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,865
<i>Cheer up</i>

338
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,040
Uncle!

339
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,004
<i>People probably thought I was crying</i>
<i>because I was so moved,</i>

340
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,299
<i>but that wasn't why.</i>

341
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,511
<i>I cried because I was heartbroken.</i>

342
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,475
<i>He was growing up</i>
<i>not knowing what his parents looked like.</i>

343
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,437
It broke my heart.

344
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,819
Sorry.

345
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,365
Everything with Han-gyul was so crazy,
I didn't even think about how you'd feel.

346
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:26,622
Now that people have found out,
you can't be feeling great either.

347
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,794
Laozi once said,

348
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,381
"When life gets overwhelming
and complicated, think simple."

349
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,718
For now, let's just think about Han-gyul.

350
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,433
You should eat.

351
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,352
It'll give you some energy.

352
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,398
Okay, I'll eat.

353
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,983
I should eat.

354
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,449
It's good.

355
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,075
- It's so good.
- Really?

356
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,178
I'm not in the mood to take your call.
Hang up.

357
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,223
What?

358
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,728
- Why you?
<i>- That's exactly my point.</i>

359
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,439
Why do I have to drive all the way
to Seoul to get your nephew?

360
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:40,696
Ever since he was tiny,
I'd comfort him, carry him, feed him,

361
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,657
and now he's making
my dear little sister go to Seoul?

362
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,367
Even so,

363
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,329
I'm letting you know
since I should update you

364
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,246
as his guardian.

365
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,540
So no need to worry, you punk.

366
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,794
Jjun.

367
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:04,803
Since when did you start
having feelings for Han-gyul?

368
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,225
Jjun... No, I-jun, I mean, dear brother.

369
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,061
I didn't mean to lie to you.

370
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,648
You and Han-gyul's uncle
already don't get along.

371
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:21,070
I was afraid talking about Han-gyul
might make you feel even worse.

372
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,797
I'll be around having some coffee.

373
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,966
Call me when you're done.

374
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,384
Will do.

375
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,429
I'll carry this gratitude
with me to the grave.

376
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,389
I promise.

377
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,725
Go on, someone's waiting for you.

378
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,795
This is where you wanted to come?

379
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,048
You really came?

380
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,718
"You really came"?

381
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,388
What are you doing?
Can't you see how hot this is?

382
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:30,889
Right.

383
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:33,892
Sorry.

384
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,085
- Is it good?
- Yes.

385
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,594
That darn jerk.

386
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,347
I should've known

387
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,058
from the moment he started sweet-talking
with his smug grin.

388
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,769
You knucklehead.

389
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,145
Ms. Seo.

390
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,273
Hey, Mr. Jeong!

391
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,734
It's you, Mr. Jeong.

392
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,445
Have a seat.

393
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,947
Mr. Jeong.

394
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:35,245
Mr. Jeong, where did you hear
about that slick jerk?

395
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,581
Well, of course I'd find out,

396
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,833
since I cared.

397
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,588
You were completely head over heels
for him. Why's that?

398
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,924
He's not even good-looking,

399
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,385
just boring and plain,
like a half-chewed rice cake.

400
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
My name.

401
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,808
What, your name?

402
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,147
He just looked at me quietly...

403
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,567
and then called my name.

404
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,737
He said, "Hye-suk."

405
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,615
Unbelievable.

406
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,368
Of all things,
I can't believe you fell for that.

407
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,079
When you get past 50,

408
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,749
everything starts to feel blurry.

409
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,921
Life doesn't feel vivid anymore.

410
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,136
But when he called my name,

411
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:38,267
everything suddenly felt so vivid,
like I was truly myself again.

412
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,147
My senses felt sharp,
like I'd put on a pair of glasses.

413
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,816
My instincts felt alive again.

414
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:53,741
And just like that,
I totally fell for him.

415
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,997
Never mind what I was rambling about.

416
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,377
Still, thanks for letting me know

417
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,006
and for coming here.

418
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,050
I'm a little drunk.

419
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,137
See you at school tomorrow.

420
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,221
My goodness.

421
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,641
Don't forget your bag again.
You always forget.

422
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,310
Thank you.

423
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,936
I'll get you a taxi. Let's go.

424
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,855
I'm dizzy.
Take care of the check with that.

425
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,899
I got this. How much do I owe?

426
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,778
When I found out my mom was still alive,

427
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,449
I just knew that she had abandoned me.

428
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:42,080
But... I couldn't bring myself
to accept it.

429
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,544
So I wanted to meet her
in person to see for myself.

430
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,883
It must've been the worst day ever.

431
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,428
Do you know what was even worse?

432
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,433
I'm not hurt because she abandoned me.

433
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:03,477
Then why?

434
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,438
Because we grew apart.

435
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,277
I only got to see her once,

436
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,198
and now it feels like
I'll never see her again.

437
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,042
Hey, Sun Han-gyul.

438
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,965
You're someone everyone loves.

439
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,678
She's just one person
out of eight billion people on Earth.

440
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,807
Can't you just accept
that there could be just one person

441
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,016
who might not love you?

442
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,981
It's not just... one person.

443
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,567
Geez, who else doesn't like you?

444
00:35:58,782 --> 00:35:59,658
Me?

445
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,288
Hey.

446
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,125
Do you seriously think I came
all the way here to pay for my stay?

447
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:14,172
Can't you see my outfit?
Can't you see my shoes?

448
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,924
Can't you see my lip tint?

449
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,927
I was afraid it'd look too obvious
if it was too red,

450
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,221
so I patted it on with my fingers.

451
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,557
I tied my hair as if I didn't care,

452
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,144
but I actually followed a video
and redid it three times.

453
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,106
And if I didn't like you,

454
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,318
would I have begged my brother
to drive 400 km to see you?

455
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:39,740
Are you saying you actually like me?

456
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,159
Wait.

457
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,912
Am I being set up to confess here?

458
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,125
Sun Han-gyul.

459
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,503
I want to beat you.

460
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,091
I want to crush you and take you down.

461
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:04,973
But I keep finding myself drawn to you,
and it's driving me crazy.

462
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,188
And what really drives me crazy is

463
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,233
that I'm just one
of eight billion people who like you.

464
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,322
It's pretty humiliating
and incredibly unpleasant.

465
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:24,576
Still, I...

466
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,079
Well...

467
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,705
I like you.

468
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:36,546
I'm saying I like you.

469
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:42,761
Hold on.

470
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,681
Did Sun Han-gyul just confess to me?

471
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,644
Thank you...

472
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,399
for saving me from the worst day.

473
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,123
What? Don't look at me like that.

474
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,040
Why?

475
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,837
What?

476
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,080
I'm back.

477
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,124
Hey.

478
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,587
You must be tired. Go get some sleep.

479
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,048
Uncle.

480
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,469
What is it?

481
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,430
Is there something to eat?

482
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,526
You know, like those restaurants
you see on TV?

483
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,403
Is it called a "chandelier"?

484
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,906
There was something sparkling
hanging from the ceiling.

485
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,618
The server was wearing a suit
and asked, "May I take your order?"

486
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,827
Wow.

487
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,707
Looks like your mom took you
to the fanciest place.

488
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,003
I couldn't tell what was what on the menu.

489
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,173
She said, "Give my son what I'm having."

490
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,133
So I got a thing called "gnocchi."

491
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,304
It was this small,
kind of like a dumpling.

492
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,933
It came in a creamy sauce
and was soft and rich.

493
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,726
It slid down my throat smoothly--

494
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,019
I'm sorry.

495
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:03,110
If I knew you'd be this happy,
I should've let you see your mom sooner.

496
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:08,073
She told you to call her again
and come see her again, right?

497
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,746
She wouldn't stop telling me to come by

498
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,791
and call her again.

499
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,001
Good.

500
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,255
Go see her often from now on, okay?

501
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,007
I won't.

502
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,510
Why not?

503
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,804
It's too far.

504
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,931
It's not too far.

505
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,267
Just say when.
I'll take you there anytime.

506
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,227
It's not really my thing.

507
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,396
I just tried the gnocchi out of curiosity.

508
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,191
I prefer something spicy,
like <i>gaengsigi </i>porridge.

509
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,575
You got some more?

510
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,576
Of course!

511
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,203
I grabbed some fresh bean sprouts
at the market

512
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,955
and cooked up a big pot.

513
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,541
All right.

514
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,806
- Uncle.
- What?

515
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,559
I'm going out with Se-jin now.

516
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,520
For real?

517
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:23,231
Turns out, she had feelings for me too.

518
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,816
Hey.

519
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,902
Congratulations, Han-gyul.

520
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,653
Who could possibly not like you?

521
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,780
So, did you confess?

522
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,282
Did she say yes right away?

523
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,952
- We had <i>ramyeon </i>at the Hangang River.
- Look at you!

524
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,537
You're just like me.

525
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,706
- Well done. Congrats!
- Knock it off.

526
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:40,665
Eat up.

527
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,918
So, you officially became a couple today?

528
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,004
When's your anniversary?
When is your 100-day anniversary?

529
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,255
I don't know.

530
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,181
How could a teacher
who's supposed to teach students

531
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,807
date a parent?

532
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,476
Does this make sense?

533
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,269
It doesn't make any sense.

534
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:05,232
From a moral and ethical standpoint,
this is unacceptable, isn't it?

535
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,652
Principal, wouldn't you agree?

536
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:12,822
Well, the school needs to be cautious
about these matters,

537
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,409
but Ms. Bom isn't the type
to do anything wrong.

538
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:17,535
Yes, I agree.

539
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,372
And Han-gyul's uncle
may have looked rough at first,

540
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,832
but don't we all know
what he's really like now?

541
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,502
Yes, he's raising Han-gyul well

542
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,212
and taking good care of the elders.

543
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,381
Plus, the CEO of JQ Energy
is Sun Jae-gyu, right?

544
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,757
Snap out of it!

545
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,719
Look at this.
Didn't I tell you how I got this scar?

546
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,680
You've all lost your minds.

547
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,350
How can you possibly fall for that thug
and take sides with him?

548
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,353
I swear, just hearing his name
makes my blood boil.

549
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,729
I feel sick to my stomach.

550
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:49,484
He's tall as a beanpole,
and he looks full of lust.

551
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,488
Yoon Bom.

552
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,991
You've been through worse in Seoul.

553
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,786
All you'll get are bruises.

554
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,122
Stand up tall.

555
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:03,748
Brace your core.

556
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,476
Ms. Bom.

557
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,605
Do you know why
we have to maintain distance from parents?

558
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:31,735
Once you start
getting personally involved with parents,

559
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,154
you end up favoring one child,

560
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:38,867
and the damage inevitably falls
on the other students. That's my point.

561
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,410
Do you understand?

562
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,456
But you favor Choi Se-jin so much,
Mr. Hong.

563
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,501
What are you talking about?

564
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,922
When have I ever favored her?

565
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:53,840
Don't you remember?

566
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,594
You helped Choi Se-jin's dad
with his election,

567
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,970
emceed campaign events,

568
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,599
and threw yourself
into whatever the governor's doing.

569
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,436
Doesn't that count as getting
personally involved with parents?

570
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,064
No, that's not the same thing.

571
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:13,485
I was simply lending a small hand
to public service.

572
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,320
You're taking it the wrong way.

573
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,947
In a backwater town like this,

574
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,825
where you can barely find anyone under 50,

575
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,496
if two young people start dating,
you should quietly be happy for them.

576
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,999
Why are you making such a fuss
like it's some huge scandal?

577
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,168
Did Ms. Bom have an affair?

578
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,420
Did she cheat on someone?

579
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,389
Ms. Bom.

580
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,351
If there's someone you like, go for it.

581
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,312
If you want to be with someone,
don't hold back and be with him.

582
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,734
Spring may seem like it'll last forever,

583
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,069
but it's gone in a blink.

584
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,826
Live your life in full bloom, okay?

585
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,959
Thank you, Ms. Seo.

586
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,255
And...

587
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,884
I'm sorry for any concern
I've caused, teachers.

588
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,430
I'm fully aware of the concerns you have.

589
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:26,266
However, I will never do anything shameful
in front of the students

590
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,436
or neglect my responsibilities
as an educator.

591
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,771
I assure you that such a thing
will never happen.

592
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,400
I promise that, under any circumstances,

593
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,735
I will not cause any trouble
for the school.

594
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,657
So please trust me this once
and give me a chance.

595
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,827
I'd appreciate your support.

596
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,431
Ms. Bom.

597
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:11,394
Have you been waiting for me?
What if someone saw you?

598
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,104
Most people have already seen us.

599
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,274
Right.

600
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,318
We've already been busted.

601
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,613
I was waiting for you
since I was so anxious.

602
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,115
How was it at school? Was everything okay?

603
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,951
I did my best to explain.

604
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:31,623
Now I have to brace myself
for whatever comes next.

605
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,666
You don't need
to brace yourself for anything.

606
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,544
If anything were to happen to you,

607
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:40,256
I'll do whatever it takes to handle it.

608
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,425
So don't worry about anything at all.

609
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,928
Just stay calm and relaxed, okay?

610
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,097
Cover your ears, close your eyes,

611
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:49,933
and just keep smiling, all right?

612
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,143
That's all, okay?

613
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,737
The whole town knows about us now anyway.
Who cares?

614
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,405
Today, let's...

615
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:05,949
Don't smile.

616
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,283
...smile as much as we can.

617
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,660
Don't have fun.

618
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,495
Let's have fun, like crazy.

619
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,955
Don't be happy.

620
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,581
Let's be as happy as we can

621
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,876
and go to places we wanted to go
but couldn't before,

622
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,796
without holding back, okay?

623
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,263
Let's go.

624
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,545
BOM LOVES JAE-GYU

625
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,309
<i>Ready? Smile.</i>

626
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,937
One, two, three.

627
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:35,538
- One, two.
- One, two.

628
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,874
- One, two.
- Hi.

629
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,508
SASHIMI AND KING CRAB

630
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,392
Here, Ms. Bom. Open up.

631
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,897
How is it?

632
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,027
This is absolutely mouthwatering.
Try some.

633
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:15,870
How is it?

634
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,997
It's so plump and sweet.

635
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:18,915
Right?

636
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,917
My tongue is crying tears of joy.

637
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,877
Good grief, I can't watch this.

638
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,254
What on earth are they doing
with each hand?

639
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,465
Diving straight into the shell.

640
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,509
It looks so good.

641
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,929
I guess their other hands are busy
doing something else.

642
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,890
Get in there.

643
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,726
It's so plump. Wow.

644
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,270
<i>What? With a parent?</i>

645
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,233
Hasn't she still come to her senses

646
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,568
or is she deliberately
trying to drive me crazy?

647
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,278
After going through that mess here,

648
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,948
how could she go there
and get involved with a parent again?

649
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,658
I have no excuse.

650
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,993
I should have watched more closely.

651
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,334
Who is this guy anyway? What does he do?

652
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,964
It just so happens I know him...

653
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,804
Could it be
that jerk you've been looking for?

654
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:19,934
That dumb thug who's all muscle
and ran off with your money?

655
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,067
Honey, my meds.

656
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,736
Yes, sure.

657
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,000
Manager, cancel my entire schedule
for next week.

658
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,378
You're not seriously going, are you?

659
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,630
Ms. Jeong, calm down.

660
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,884
Doing this could backfire on Ms. Bom.

661
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,803
This whole mess is your fault,
and you're telling me to calm down?

662
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,937
I should've gone down to Shinsu
to talk to Bom myself back then.

663
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,775
Whether I go there and drag her back
or cut ties for good,

664
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,943
I'm settling this once and for all.

665
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:13,321
So both of you, stay out of it.

666
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,157
From here on out, I'll handle it.

667
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,848
You should go now.

668
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,518
Okay, go on inside.

669
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,605
I think I can only go if you let go.

670
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:50,483
I should let go.

671
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,568
Yes, let go.

672
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,366
Why won't my hand let go?

673
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,617
I know.

674
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,786
Strangely, it's stuck.

675
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:04,664
Then I have no choice.

676
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,708
I'll walk you to the front door
and then go.

677
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,187
What's going on?

678
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,856
It's still stuck.

679
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,609
Did we hold on for too long?

680
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:35,945
In that case,

681
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:40,741
I'll just walk you to your bedroom door,
and then I'll leave for real.

682
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,251
You didn't just walk me to the door.

683
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,505
You brought me inside the room.

684
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,843
I don't think there's anywhere else to go.

685
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,055
Right.

686
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:10,146
I let go. It came off.

687
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,065
We managed to let go, didn't we?

688
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:14,942
Right.

689
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:16,569
We let go.

690
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,864
Don't step out, it's late.
I'll go by myself.

691
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,334
Ms. Bom.

692
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,379
Did you just stop me from leaving?

693
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:36,964
Me? When?

694
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,218
Maybe you got caught on the doorknob.

695
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:47,224
There's no doorknob here.

696
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,103
Then was it a nail? Or maybe a hanger?

697
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,529
I thought maybe
you didn't want me to leave.

698
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,239
Who? Me?

699
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:08,162
So, are you saying you want me to leave?

700
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,957
Why would you say that?

701
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,378
I'm just saying that your clothes
probably got caught on something.

702
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,339
It doesn't mean I wanted you to leave.

703
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:23,010
So, you mean you wanted me to stay?

704
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,138
Well, it's not like
I specifically wanted you to stay.

705
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,099
I see.

706
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,268
But...

707
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:38,609
on second thought,
maybe staying isn't such a bad idea.

708
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,445
Maybe you should go today.

709
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,115
I see.

710
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,494
What I mean is...

711
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,206
I want to be with you,

712
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,875
but at the same time,
I feel like we shouldn't.

713
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,961
It's not like I want you to leave,

714
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,046
but maybe leaving is the right thing,
you know...

715
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:05,553
If you can't decide, I will.

716
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,354
Han-gyul.

717
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,024
I can't come home tonight.

718
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,761
BOM-SIK'S HOUSE

719
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,285
Did you sleep well?

720
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:40,040
Yes. I think I slept well.

721
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,339
Glad to hear it. I slept well too.

722
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,512
Why is that vase there?

723
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:54,430
Wait.

724
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,308
Stay in bed a little more. I'll clean up.

725
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,983
44-5 HAEEUN-GIL, SHINSU-EUP, JUAN-GUN,
GYEONGSANGBUK-DO

726
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,834
{\an8}<i>I'll find out what kind of person</i>
<i>that Sun Jae-gyu guy really is.</i>

727
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,169
{\an8}Jae-gyu. Oh, my!

728
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,297
{\an8}Why are you here, Mom?

729
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,798
{\an8}- You have a kid.
- He's my nephew.

730
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,092
{\an8}How could you meet a guy like this
in a nowhere town?

731
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,303
{\an8}Ms. Jeong.

732
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,682
{\an8}<i>Ms. Bom, listen carefully</i>
<i>to what I'm about to say.</i>

733
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,267
{\an8}<i>Who are you, following me like this?</i>

734
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:05,269
<i>Ms. Bom!</i>

735
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,939
<i>Han-gyul's uncle got hit by a car</i>
<i>and has been taken to the hospital.</i>
