EPISODE 6

2
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,943
What is it, then?

3
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,363
If it's not because
I might cross the line,

4
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,574
what made you that angry?

5
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,458
Ten seconds.

6
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,629
Nine seconds.

7
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,887
I was afraid I might cross the line.

8
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,878
So, what you mean is…

9
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,508
that you want to cross the line with me?

10
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,717
No.

11
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,805
I mean that I will not cross the line

12
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:19,849
with you.

13
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,521
Goodness, you Seoul people have
such a strange way of talking.

14
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,651
Why do you not want to cross the line

15
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,279
with me?

16
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:58,846
Hello?

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,807
I'm in front of your place.
Come out for a bit.

18
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,979
Why won't you answer my texts?

19
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,110
That makes me miss you more.

20
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,988
How on earth did you know where I live?

21
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,449
Don't do this ever again.

22
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,744
Or I will report it.

23
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,203
Report it?

24
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,165
But…

25
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,209
you're the one

26
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,047
who hit on me first, no?

27
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,133
You said you liked me first.

28
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,927
I mean,

29
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,473
you said you liked a caring guy like me!

30
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:43,974
Ms. Yoon!

31
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,984
I made two promises to myself
when I came to Shinsu.

32
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,487
First,

33
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,824
"I will not get involved
with a parent again."

34
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,701
Second,

35
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:07,247
"I will never get involved with a parent."

36
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,167
So,

37
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,588
nothing can happen between us
because I'm your student's parent?

38
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,214
Yes.

39
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,257
What if I'm not a parent?

40
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,056
If I weren't Han-gyul's uncle,
would you cross the line with me?

41
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,559
-No.
-Yes.

42
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,186
"Yes"?

43
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,855
-No.
-Yes.

44
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,441
-"Yes"?
-Oh, no.

45
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,528
You see, my brain clearly meant to say no,

46
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,532
but this darn mouth
keeps saying anything it wants.

47
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,577
I think my neurotransmission system
is seriously malfunctioning.

48
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,246
I'll wait, then.

49
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,665
What?

50
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,377
But there are still two years left
until Han-gyul graduates.

51
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,339
Two years will go by fast.

52
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,967
In days, from today,

53
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,261
it's 620 days.

54
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,932
In hours, it's 14,880 hours.

55
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,351
And in minutes… How many?

56
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,564
It's 892,800 minutes.

57
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,275
It's long.

58
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,444
It is long, but--

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,779
It's like waiting for a soldier
to be discharged.

60
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,699
You think
waiting for two years would be easy?

61
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,992
Of course not.

62
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,871
Well, if I did what I usually do,

63
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,042
we'd have coffee
and go to the movies together.

64
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,047
We'd celebrate our special days,

65
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,299
and I'd hold your hand and hug you.

66
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,637
But if you don't want, I'll never do it.

67
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,850
I've been waiting for Yoon Bom
for 36 years,

68
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,478
so what's two more years?

69
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,857
So...

70
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,693
trust me.

71
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,823
But the day Han-gyul graduates,

72
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,034
let's meet here again.

73
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,037
That's the day
Sun Jae-gyu and Yoon Bom become

74
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,622
a couple.

75
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,248
Okay?

76
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,228
Who are you fighting with?

77
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,229
The air?

78
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,983
Sun Jae-gyu's nowhere to be seen,
and all the others have left.

79
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,528
Why are you working so hard alone?

80
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,823
What's a single guy to do at home
except play video games?

81
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,744
What about you?
Why are you still here at this hour?

82
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,539
Those drama shows aren't that fun anymore.

83
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,292
Watching this live here is much better.

84
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,508
Well, suit yourself.

85
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,393
Excuse me?

86
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,230
Are you a new student?
It's closed for today.

87
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,898
Oh, hello.

88
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,652
We just opened an office upstairs,
so I brought some rice cakes.

89
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,988
It's Choi I-jun Law Office.

90
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,742
Isn't Choi I-jun
Choi Se-jin's older brother?

91
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,536
Yes, that's right.

92
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,662
Goodness.

93
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,707
Thank you.

94
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,508
I'm Oh Seong-tae, a paralegal.

95
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm Seo Hye-suk.

96
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,345
-Have a seat, please.
-Okay.

97
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,140
Legal counseling
on criminal and civil cases.

98
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,683
Family lawsuits and divorce cases
are also welcome.

99
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,563
I think when it comes to divorce,
she's better than you.

100
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,481
What are you doing?

101
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,110
Why are you humiliating me
in front of a stranger?

102
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,737
Why is divorce...

103
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:08,906
a humiliation?

104
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,241
Sorry?

105
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,744
Actually, I'm divorced too.

106
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,204
Really?

107
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,248
I mean, since you're fashionable
and smell good,

108
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,584
I thought you were a bachelor.
Are you divorced?

109
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,046
Yes. I thought you were a bachelorette
at first too, Hye-suk.

110
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,634
Oh, my goodness.
He's calling me Hye-suk. Oh, my.

111
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,011
By the way, when did you get divorced?

112
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,513
In 2017.

113
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,558
March 2017 for me.

114
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,559
May for me.

115
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,020
Settlement? Lawsuit?

116
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,438
-Lawsuit.
-Me too.

117
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,651
My goodness. We divorced the same way!

118
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,778
I think we're on the same wavelength.

119
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,820
Yes!

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,783
Where is this rice cake from?
It's so tough.

121
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,328
Of course rice cake is tough.
What, should it be crispy?

122
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,413
Aren't you going home?

123
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,873
Go ahead if you're busy.

124
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,041
Let's go.

125
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,794
I'm going to talk more
with my friend here. You go first.

126
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,757
Hye-suk, what do you do on weekends?

127
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,635
On weekends,
I usually catch up on laundry and…

128
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,513
Nothing special.

129
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,224
I'm new here,
so I don't know my way around yet.

130
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,017
Then should I give you a tour?

131
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,270
Really? Is that okay with you?

132
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,729
I have a lot of free time.

133
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,985
Then I'm going to trust you.

134
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,862
But you can never show it
in front of others,

135
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,449
especially in front of
students and teachers.

136
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,620
Six hundred and twenty days.

137
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,333
From today on,

138
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,169
Yoon Bom is nothing more
than Han-gyul's teacher.

139
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,756
Don't be kind to her. Don't smile at her.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,384
And never do anything personal
for her. Okay?

141
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,811
THAT WOMAN

142
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,950
What are you guys looking at?

143
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,288
Hurry and take a look.
There. Look at that.

144
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,128
That…

145
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,674
That's the woman I told you
I saw with him last time.

146
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,093
She's so beautiful.

147
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,512
I think she was born
to delight all of mankind.

148
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,431
Isn't it unbelievable?

149
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,727
Why is that punk Sun Jae-gyu so lucky
to meet such a pretty woman?

150
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,687
I just don't understand.

151
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,114
Did you see that, Ms. Bom?

152
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,871
I've been waiting for Yoon Bom
for 36 years,

153
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,915
so what's two more years?

154
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,375
Trust me.

155
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,294
That's mine.

156
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,516
Whoever a parent meets
is none of your business.

157
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,727
As educators shaping this country's
future, if you have free time,

158
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,731
I recommend that you use it
on your teaching aids and student records.

159
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,982
Well, then.

160
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,402
What's she saying?

161
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,611
What's with her?

162
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,283
What, he said he'd wait two years,
and he's two-timing me?

163
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,621
Or as Ms. Seo said, does he just fall for
every pretty woman he sees?

164
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,333
She's so beautiful.

165
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,669
I think she was born
to delight all mankind.

166
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,387
Well,

167
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,183
I look like I was born to represent
the bleak future of mankind.

168
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll show you what happens in Shinsu

169
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,109
when I decide to make myself attractive.

170
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,862
I'm Yoon Bom. Brace yourself, mankind.

171
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,531
Should I wear my hair up?

172
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,994
I'm mankind's goddess from now on.

173
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,982
What happened with her?

174
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,027
It's over.

175
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,863
What's over?

176
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,366
Sun Han-gyul.

177
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,369
Do you...

178
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,623
like me?

179
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,463
I saw the sports festival video earlier,

180
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,008
and you were smiling when I won.

181
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,970
But I just don't get it.

182
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,097
How could you smile?

183
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,143
A thriller suits us better than a romance.

184
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,729
A thriller?

185
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,733
Have you ever heard of Salieri
and Mozart congratulating each other?

186
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,446
Shouldn't we snarl at each other forever
and only smile at the other's funeral?

187
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,618
You mean you can only smile when I die?

188
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,620
-Is that it?
-Right.

189
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,288
Actually, no.

190
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,667
I can't smile if you die.

191
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,128
Without you, I wouldn't get Grade 1
because of the grade ratio.

192
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,556
Sure, it's a thriller.

193
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,266
It is?

194
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,270
Didn't you see at the sports fest?

195
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,147
All the girls at our school
are crazy about me.

196
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,483
Why would I like a girl like you?

197
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,946
You gave it your all
when it wouldn't even affect our grades.

198
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,364
I was laughing at you.

199
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,202
Goodness, why did you do that?

200
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,038
When she suddenly went on
about a thriller,

201
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,417
I got upset and said things I didn't mean.

202
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,962
I couldn't tell her how I feel anyway,

203
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,089
so I'll just bury it and move on.

204
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,800
Men should be straightforward.
Just tell her.

205
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,643
Now that you have feelings for her,

206
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,729
it's too late

207
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,065
to escape that fate.

208
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,236
If you're done, go to school. It's late.

209
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,447
Did things work out with Ms. Bom?

210
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,744
Your uncle manned up and--

211
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,829
-Are you seeing her?
-Two years.

212
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,166
I'm waiting for her.

213
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,292
For two years?

214
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,171
Two years is long enough
for the Earth's temperature to rise 2°C

215
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,465
and for newly joined soldiers
to be discharged.

216
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,841
How will you wait that long?

217
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,053
If the one I like says so,
I do it no matter what.

218
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,220
You know?

219
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,432
Come on, Uncle. Just go already.

220
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,143
It's heavy.
Let me go up to the front gate.

221
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,314
Wow, she's shining.

222
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,608
She looks like a celebrity.

223
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,734
She's so pretty.

224
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,781
What's going on?

225
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,911
What's happening?

226
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,747
It feels like spring.

227
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,000
I love you!

228
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,210
She's a goddess!

229
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,964
Hey. Hi, Han-gyul.

230
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,646
She's pretty.

231
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,373
She's so pretty.

232
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,377
Mr. Sun, I have a question for you.

233
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,600
What? Is he avoiding me?

234
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,854
Where is he going in such a hurry?

235
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,035
-Hey.
-Yes?

236
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,329
Why is he plowing the field like crazy?

237
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,165
Remember what I said?

238
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,917
It seems like he needs something
to distract himself

239
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,171
from all the evil thoughts in his head.

240
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,383
I don't know
if his head is full of evil thoughts,

241
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,969
but I do know
what my artificial joints are saying.

242
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,012
What's that?

243
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,225
They want his head to be
full of evil thoughts every day.

244
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,854
Goodness.

245
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,481
I love him.

246
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,109
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

247
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,320
I will wait.

248
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,449
I'm the uncle Han-gyul is proud of!

249
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,174
Why is it acting up again?

250
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,638
I'm sorry, Bom-sik.
I'll hurry and come in soon. Sorry.

251
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,015
Darn it.

252
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:20,975
Gosh.

253
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,448
Hey.

254
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,503
Are you coming from the skewer place?

255
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,260
You left in such a hurry earlier,
so I couldn't ask.

256
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,224
Let's talk after we open the door.

257
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,684
The key is acting up again.

258
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,354
Could you go over the wall
and open it for me like last time?

259
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,734
Mr. Sun?

260
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,133
What on earth?

261
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,594
Wait, Mr. Sun! Hey!

262
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,013
You cowardly jerk!

263
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,180
Darn it.

264
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,145
Han-gyul.

265
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,897
Are you back, Uncle?

266
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,024
Here.

267
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:56,988
What?

268
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,741
You must've run like crazy.
It's still steaming.

269
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,076
Do you want to drop out of school
and get your GED?

270
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,870
Why would I do that?

271
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:04,871
You don't want to?

272
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,539
-I don't.
-Got it.

273
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,876
Time machines won't be invented
anytime soon, right?

274
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,586
No.

275
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,755
-According to the theory of relativity--
-Don't.

276
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,883
What are the scientists doing?
They should work harder.

277
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,062
Bom-sik.

278
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,441
He's definitely doing that on purpose.

279
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,319
He doesn't even look me in the eye
or answer me.

280
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,823
You'd open the door for a dog
if it's locked out.

281
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,128
"Tread softly on me as you go."

282
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,476
Thank you.

283
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,979
I did hear from Ms. Seo
that you opened an office,

284
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,689
but I didn't know you take this path.

285
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,237
In Seoul, I used to run
in Hangang River Park every day,

286
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,698
but I don't know
anywhere good to run here.

287
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:27,620
So I'm trying to find
a good running route in Shinsu.

288
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,292
Actually, I have something
to talk about with you.

289
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,713
Do you have time this weekend?

290
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,677
Thoughts come to you
when you let your guard down,

291
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,098
and make you feel low from time to time.

292
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,601
Don't be a slave to your thoughts.

293
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:56,941
And don't regard
those thoughts as your true self.

294
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,944
Thoughts are just thoughts.

295
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,743
In order to breathe smoothly,
sit straight.

296
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,052
CERTIFIED LETTER

297
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:28,598
"Certified Letter."

298
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,600
Wow, it looks good.

299
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,061
"In 2025,
during the Shinsu High sports festival,

300
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,230
-you made the promises listed below."
-Yes.

301
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,148
"One."

302
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,651
If I participate,
I'll join the military again.

303
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,153
"Join the military again."

304
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,406
"Two. At barbecue places…"

305
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,324
Only vegetables.

306
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,284
"...you'll only eat vegetables."

307
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,453
"Three. For the rest of your life…"

308
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,746
I'll call you "honey."

309
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,374
"...you'll call the sender 'honey.'"

310
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,834
Hey, honey.

311
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,098
I actually called
the Ministry of Defense about it,

312
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,642
but they say I can't serve
in the military twice.

313
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,644
But...

314
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,189
as for the other promises written here,

315
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,734
I promise to fulfill them faithfully.

316
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,530
Honey.

317
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,290
On second thought,
I think I can let the last clause go.

318
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,543
No, no. A promise is a promise.

319
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,003
If you're done, can I go now, honey?

320
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:41,921
I'll get going.

321
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,181
Was the rumor true?

322
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,645
At that house,

323
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,022
did you do that…

324
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,985
to your father?

325
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,778
This is why we can't be friends.

326
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:10,366
You see, friends aren't
supposed to believe rumors.

327
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,702
They're supposed to trust each other.

328
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,958
Come if you need my help.

329
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,005
I… opened an office in Shinsu.

330
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:29,760
Well,

331
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,514
you have the right to choose
where you live in Korea,

332
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,308
so you can live wherever you want.

333
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,769
But even if I commit a crime
and end up in jail,

334
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,022
I will never go to you for help.

335
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,318
So you can throw this out for me.
Okay, honey?

336
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,282
Yes, Ms. Bom.

337
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,035
Coffee?

338
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:56,996
I'd love that.

339
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,665
Then I'll see you there soon.

340
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,923
Why would Ms. Bom call you?

341
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,968
"Honey."

342
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,055
Why would Ms. Bom call you, honey?

343
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:18,601
Gosh, at this rate, I'll end up
plowing all of Dong-pyo's grandma's field.

344
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,561
I should buy a field for myself.

345
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,065
She doesn't know how I feel.
She keeps confusing me.

346
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,442
What's with her?

347
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,818
Darn it!

348
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,865
There are no CCTV cameras around here.

349
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,117
Then where were you last night, ma'am?

350
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,786
-What is it?
-Dong-pyo, what is it?

351
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,080
Ms. Seo, our house was robbed last night.

352
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,706
-Oh, my.
-Robbed?

353
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:46,420
This damn thief
took my medal from the sports festival,

354
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,422
the meju I hung in the yard,

355
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,259
and the dried bracken. They took them all.

356
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,718
My goodness.

357
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,720
The thief must be a gourmet.

358
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,515
How did they know
how good your doenjang is

359
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,267
and take all of it?

360
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,519
There are no CCTVs
around your place too, right?

361
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,271
Make sure to lock your doors.

362
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,274
Oh, my. I should warn her.

363
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,668
"Meet a successful professional."

364
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,169
You're treating me to coffee

365
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,880
and even a nice meal at a good restaurant

366
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,799
because of this.

367
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,593
My school is in such a remote area,

368
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:37,555
so the students can't meet
people from various professions.

369
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,597
MS. SEO HYE-SUK

370
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,691
So we hold a public lecture
for the students every year.

371
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,527
I didn't know my first job in Shinsu

372
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,196
would be a lecture instead of a lawsuit.

373
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,701
I was actually wondering,
why did you open your business here?

374
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,914
November 2020,

375
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,627
a teacher's teeth were damaged
after an attack by a parent.

376
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,923
Because they felt the teacher
failed to stop students from fighting.

377
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,177
And in 2023,

378
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,473
because a teacher gave zero points
to students who cheated on an exam,

379
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,600
one of the students' parents

380
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,186
assaulted the teacher
in front of students.

381
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,647
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

382
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,276
I'm bragging.

383
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,280
Those lawsuits, I won them all.

384
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,162
People get wronged everywhere,

385
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,581
and I'm the only lawyer in Shinsu.

386
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,376
Wow, I've got a monopoly here.

387
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,089
You see, words like "the only one,"
"unrivaled," and "unprecedented"

388
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,384
get me more excited than money.

389
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,054
So if something unfair happens to you,

390
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,098
make sure to hire me.

391
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:06,685
If it's about you,
I'll take the case, no questions asked.

392
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,901
It looks good.

393
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,914
You told me
about the teachers' lawsuits earlier.

394
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,624
Yes.

395
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:34,797
This is about what happened
to my colleague's colleague's colleague.

396
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,258
Go ahead.

397
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,179
During class,

398
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,934
one of the students' parents
barged into the classroom.

399
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,687
And…

400
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,774
they slapped the teacher's face…

401
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,954
What? That's my place.

402
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,333
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

403
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:15,045
-He's in there.
-Hurry!

404
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,466
Ms. Yoon, where have you been?

405
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:19,508
What happened?

406
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,637
We were passing by, and some guy was
trying to break into your house.

407
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,889
So we called the police.

408
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,348
What?

409
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,322
Yes, you have the right
to remain silent and…

410
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,448
Stay still!

411
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,409
Anything you say
can and will be used against you…

412
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,370
Why is this punk so strong? Stay still!

413
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,289
I live here.

414
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,083
Did you catch the thief?

415
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,510
His uncle is... a thief?

416
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,428
Ms. Bom!

417
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,309
Even I would think I'm a thief, but…

418
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,977
Do you know him?

419
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,813
I know him,
but I can't say he's not a thief.

420
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,899
Wait, why would you…

421
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,359
Why did you cuff me?

422
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,196
Ms. Bom, today is the day I visit Bom-sik.

423
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,614
I came to pick him up and…

424
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,952
He's the one! The thief is here!

425
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,662
Where are you going? Stop there.

426
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,790
You little punks, get out of the way.

427
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,708
-You go.
-You punks, I'll…

428
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,253
Uncle, he's the thief.

429
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,174
You're dead today.

430
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:43,717
Come here.

431
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,681
Come here.

432
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,870
No, no! Get in!

433
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,707
What? We're busy.

434
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,627
In this day and age,
we shouldn't use our legs.

435
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,006
We should use our brains.

436
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,800
It's this guy! Catch him!

437
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,218
This guy in the red shirt.

438
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,553
What?

439
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:37,896
I have important materials in my phone,
so I'm using a GPS tracking app.

440
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,523
Look here.

441
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,569
The location of my phone
is the thief's location.

442
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,245
That crazy jerk.
Why does he keep following me?

443
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,749
Stop!

444
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,430
Warm sunlight and a gentle breeze.

445
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,643
Doesn't Shinsu feel so peaceful
for the first time in a while?

446
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:01,230
Yes, but I don't think
that's really the case.

447
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,940
-What?
-Look.

448
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,735
Get out of the way!

449
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,036
Get out of the way!

450
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,579
Get out of the way! Move…

451
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,212
You…

452
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,090
I'm not a bad guy. I'm…

453
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,302
Isn't that Han-gyul's uncle?

454
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:33,387
Yes.

455
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,765
What kind of trouble did he cause
that got him handcuffed?

456
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,271
Put it down.

457
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,022
Who are you?

458
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,108
Don't move!

459
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,755
It doesn't make sense.

460
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,632
Why am I an assailant? Why?

461
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,177
Officer.

462
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,721
You can never let him go, okay?

463
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,182
Well, don't worry.
Your registration number?

464
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,726
Hey. What happened?

465
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,938
This woman told me to do it.

466
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,023
What?

467
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,737
3 HOURS AGO

468
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,117
Gosh, I don't have time to wait.
I'm fully booked today.

469
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,287
Gosh, why won't she pick up?

470
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,499
With the door lock in this state,
she might get robbed at night.

471
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,626
What should I do? Change it or not?

472
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,130
It's better to come back
when she's home, right?

473
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,633
Then I'll have to charge you
another trip fee.

474
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,346
Fine, just do it.

475
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,058
I'll just replace it and give her
the passcode. That'll be fine.

476
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,059
Right?

477
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,144
Yes, I should do it
since I'm already here.

478
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,479
That saves me another trip.

479
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,149
I have a lot of reservations,
so it's hard to book me.

480
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,611
I was just changing the door lock
like the owner told me to.

481
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,490
Save, my foot.

482
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,454
What's the number for the police?

483
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,666
Hello? Is this the police?

484
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,335
This is Kim Min-guk,
a future brave citizen.

485
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,840
This won't do. I should go get a crowbar.

486
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,095
Bom-sik.

487
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,680
Bom…

488
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,516
What?

489
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,310
Why is it open?

490
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,812
You see,

491
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,900
the door was open, so I was worried
there was a thief, so I went in.

492
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:39,489
But I thought there could be
a misunderstanding from the start.

493
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,950
Because the door lock

494
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,579
was so beautifully removed.

495
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,249
Gosh. Then you should've said
you were a locksmith right away.

496
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,919
Why did you run away?
Everyone got you wrong.

497
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,963
Look at the look in his eyes.

498
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,094
He was running toward me,
saying, "You're dead today!"

499
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,847
My knees started to tremble, you know?

500
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,349
I was petrified.

501
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,103
-I couldn't say anything, okay?
-This is crazy.

502
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,690
Lock this punk up if necessary.

503
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,526
And his twin brother, lock him up too.

504
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,444
Why me?

505
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,528
Calm down.

506
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,365
There was a bit of a misunderstanding,

507
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,034
but no one's hurt, so let's settle this…

508
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,370
Officer, wait. I feel weird.

509
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,246
I'm not feeling well.

510
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,917
I think when I fell down, I hurt my hips.

511
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,211
All of a sudden? Why are you…

512
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,128
Do you want to die?

513
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,382
Hey, be quiet!

514
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,633
Let go, you brats!

515
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,928
Goodness, I don't think
I can squat in this state.

516
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,932
If I can't squat, I can't do my job.

517
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,226
What do I do? My wife and kids…

518
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,814
How will I provide for my wife and kids?
Oh, no.

519
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,525
Ms. Bom.

520
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,904
I'm okay. What about you? Are you hurt?

521
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,658
Why are you so reckless?

522
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,079
Reckless?

523
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,041
The police officers were there. Why did
you have to butt in and make this mess?

524
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,378
Don't you know when to jump in
and when to step back?

525
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,383
Ms. Bom. You know what?

526
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,762
If it's about you, I'm always jumping in.
I'll never step back.

527
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,265
If the same situation happened again,

528
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,727
and there were even a 1% chance
that guy was the thief,

529
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,895
I'd go after him. That is…

530
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,690
the Sun Jae-gyu way.

531
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,942
And that's being reckless.

532
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,361
Look at Mr. Choi.

533
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,239
Didn't you see
how he found where the guy was?

534
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,784
Can you please stop using your muscles

535
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,287
and start using your brain?

536
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,873
Hold on.

537
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:57,127
Why do you keep
comparing me to Choi I-jun?

538
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,088
Because you two are so different.

539
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,215
I wasn't going to be petty and say this,

540
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:08,930
but what did you even do today,
forgetting about Bom-sik?

541
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,850
Do you think I didn't know you went

542
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,685
to have coffee with I-jun?

543
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,442
You're turning this on me?

544
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,277
This is ridiculous.

545
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,614
What about you?

546
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,868
You mean I can't…

547
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,495
What?

548
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,538
I can't do the same?

549
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,790
What do you mean?

550
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,753
What will you do?

551
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,297
The current situation.

552
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,675
The victim flatly refused to settle.

553
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,639
And the only lawyer in Shinsu

554
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,599
is me, Choi I-jun.

555
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,398
Why aren't you taking it?

556
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,326
I, Sun Jae-gyu, never go back on my word.

557
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,872
Five hours ago,
I told him I'd never take help from him...

558
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,085
even if I ended up in jail.

559
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,470
Ms. Bom…

560
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,477
That little… Darn it.

561
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,654
He's always so reckless. No wonder
there are strange rumors about him.

562
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,615
What? End up in jail?

563
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,078
If you go to jail...

564
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,124
then what about me?

565
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,302
I tried so hard to keep the promise,

566
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,346
but she goes and has coffee
with another guy?

567
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,517
All right.

568
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,354
This place is comfortable. It's better.

569
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,731
It's nice and spacious.

570
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,653
This is nice.

571
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,217
Bom-sik, let's go to sleep.

572
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,698
Let's sleep.

573
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,951
Let's sleep.

574
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,787
Let's sleep now, okay?

575
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,199
Sun Jae-gyu, out.

576
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:19,472
CHOI I-JUN LAW OFFICE

577
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,267
"With this settlement, the victim

578
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,353
agrees not to raise objections,
both civil and criminal."

579
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,732
"If the assailant doesn't carry out
the agreement,

580
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,735
he is liable to compensate
for all the damages

581
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,445
caused by it."

582
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,489
Let's make it clear.

583
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,409
I didn't hire you to do this.

584
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,161
You asked me to do it.

585
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,042
SETTLEMENT

586
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,887
But why are you helping me
all of a sudden?

587
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,222
And that guy refused to settle yesterday.

588
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,308
Why did he suddenly agree to settle?

589
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,521
In Seoul, my hourly rate was 400,000 won.

590
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,066
If you're willing to pay me,

591
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,861
I will kindly explain it to you, sir.

592
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,830
No.

593
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,248
What now?

594
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,212
First things first, right?

595
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,925
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

596
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,718
Is he away?

597
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:41,304
SHINSU LOCKSMITH

598
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,478
Gosh, I wanted to talk to him.

599
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,440
No.

600
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,610
If I want to apologize,
I shouldn't come empty-handed.

601
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,040
Hi, auntie. The sikhye looks good.

602
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,668
Hi.

603
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,804
Well, I…

604
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,021
She's not even curious
about how I got out?

605
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,571
Hold on, miss.

606
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,323
Give this a try.

607
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,329
I made it with the pumpkins I grew myself.

608
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,165
It's really good. Try it.

609
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,377
-It's good.
-Right?

610
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,713
I'll take five bottles of this.

611
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:57,881
Five bottles?

612
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,552
Goodness. It'll be so heavy.
How will she carry them?

613
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:06,139
You see, ma'am, so many upsetting things
have happened lately.

614
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,892
So I need to drink this much
to feel better.

615
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,479
-Give me five bottles.
-Okay. Thank you.

616
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,903
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?

617
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,404
Did I sleep funny?

618
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,200
Geez.

619
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,244
She might end up hurting her back.

620
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:31,289
Goodness.

621
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,582
Oh, right.

622
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:33,708
Ma'am.

623
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:37,795
I'm looking for a pot for repotting.

624
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,006
This wide

625
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,051
and this tall.
Do you have a pot like that?

626
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,471
Over there.

627
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,440
Sun Jae-gyu.

628
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:03,112
Why is that darn tree growing so well
when I don't even water it?

629
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,628
I don't need your help. Just go.

630
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:19,546
No.

631
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,341
Do you think I'm doing this to help you?

632
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,678
My Jae-gyu pot
isn't being watered properly.

633
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,638
I want it to be in this big pot.

634
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,181
Let's go.

635
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:31,849
I'll leave after repotting it.

636
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,926
Gosh, it's too late to ask now.

637
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:10,513
If I ask him about the woman
he met last week,

638
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,309
will I not look nonchalant anymore?

639
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,443
Why did you lay out your comforter?

640
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,154
It's nothing.

641
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,365
Do you have something to tell me?

642
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,034
Well, no.

643
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:35,371
I was just wondering
what you did last weekend.

644
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,792
I washed Han-gyul's uniform

645
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,503
and made some jangjorim with beef.

646
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,756
Oh, is that so?

647
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,677
He'll never tell me first.

648
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:51,596
Anyway, Ms. Bom,

649
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,349
do you know that you've changed a bit?

650
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,810
The way you talk is cold as a freezer,

651
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,647
and you make those weird faces.

652
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,399
Unlike the Ms. Bom I knew.

653
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,488
Who are you to talk?

654
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:13,701
You see,
I thought you were a man of his word.

655
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,454
How could you say that?

656
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,873
Because of you, I got freckles,

657
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,501
and I say a Buddhist mantra every morning.

658
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,835
What are you saying?

659
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,630
Even though I get sunburned,

660
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,882
I'm trying so hard to be loyal to you.

661
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:32,845
"Loyal"?

662
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,099
Am I someone you try to be loyal to?

663
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,892
Why would you put it that way?

664
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,353
I'm just saying it's that hard for me.

665
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,438
If it's that hard, then break it.

666
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,567
Wait.

667
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,363
What did you just say?

668
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,825
You mean, break the promise?

669
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,913
If you're waiting for me out of loyalty,
then I don't want it.

670
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,790
You know,

671
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,126
I…

672
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,254
What I want is…

673
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:16,848
All right.

674
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,643
I told you.

675
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,063
I'll never do
what you don't want me to do.

676
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:28,359
If what you want is to break the promise,
then I suppose we should.

677
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,822
Then take care,
and I wish your family peace.

678
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,658
And I hope all your efforts go well.

679
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,369
Bom-sik.

680
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,206
Daddy's leaving now, okay? Take care.

681
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:43,958
Don't cry.

682
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,837
Wait…

683
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,598
I guess she doesn't like me.

684
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:03,144
I was such a fool,
making a fuss over keeping the promise.

685
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:07,774
SHINSU LOCKSMITH

686
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:12,945
What?

687
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,871
I wasn't sure,

688
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,499
but something must be going on
with that woman.

689
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,294
That's why he left
without even looking back.

690
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,716
I had no idea and…

691
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:03,663
Sir.

692
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:07,166
He may look scary,
but he's not a bad person.

693
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,669
We'll compensate for your injury, so--

694
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:13,464
Gosh, stop it. Why are you bothering me
so early in the morning?

695
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:16,884
No settlement. I was very clear.

696
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,101
What's wrong with you, seriously?

697
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,270
Oh, no. They bent automatically again.

698
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,565
Sir, I think there's some sensor
embedded in my knees.

699
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,317
They automatically bend
when I need to apologize.

700
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,653
And since I'm already kneeling,

701
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,738
I'll ask you once more.

702
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:41,284
If you show mercy just this once…

703
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:44,245
You want to add obstruction of business
to the assault charge?

704
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,881
Is she gone?

705
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:58,676
Come on!

706
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:03,306
From here to there.

707
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,933
I'm here as a customer.

708
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,019
All of the door locks here,

709
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,730
I'll buy them. Here.

710
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,608
What, you got 100 doors at your house?

711
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,360
What are you buying so many for?

712
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,987
My neighbor's house was robbed.

713
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,656
So if they change all their door locks,

714
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,617
it'll be safer. Just do it.

715
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,371
Geez, you think I'd settle
if you buy so many door locks?

716
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,749
Goodness. Not a chance.

717
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,292
Let's see.

718
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:38,132
LOVELY SONG GA-IN

719
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,636
You must be a big fan of Song Ga-in.

720
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,222
Gosh, who in Korea
doesn't like Song Ga-in?

721
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:49,769
I wanted to go to her concert today,
but the tickets sold out so fast.

722
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:57,860
Sir, you know what?

723
00:53:58,736 --> 00:53:59,695
Darn it.

724
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,366
I know Song Ga-in a little.

725
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,077
-For real?
-Yes.

726
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:10,122
I was very close with someone
who is very close

727
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,416
with her.

728
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,586
She's close with someone
you were close with?

729
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,714
Are you saying
you're close with her or not?

730
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,095
Don't.

731
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,057
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

732
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,726
You think people are interested
in your innocence?

733
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,771
What they're interested in
is not the truth, it's gossip.

734
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:39,652
Look at that. I knew it.

735
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,862
How can you be close with Song Ga-in?

736
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,364
That's just absurd.

737
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,743
You're obviously lying.
If that's true, I'm her brother.

738
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,248
She wouldn't make friends
with just anybody.

739
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,961
MOM

740
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,099
DAUGHTER

741
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,186
I barely fell asleep.

742
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:18,524
Who calls so early in the morning?
Darn it.

743
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,283
Honey.

744
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,871
What? Who is it?

745
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:37,877
Answer it.

746
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,587
Now.

747
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,929
Is that you, Bom?

748
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,390
How have you been…

749
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,436
Yes.

750
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,271
Yes.

751
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,899
What? Who?

752
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:05,446
No, I'm not saying I can't…

753
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:10,076
Okay. I'll do that.

754
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:10,993
You…

755
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,496
Bom.

756
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:15,081
Bom? Yoon Bom?

757
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,667
She hung up.

758
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,421
What did she say? What's going on?

759
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,884
You know Ga-in. Song Ga-in.

760
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,762
The trot singer at your company?

761
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:34,809
She asked for a ticket for her concert.

762
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,727
What?

763
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,521
That's how

764
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:42,483
I closed my shop
and went to her concert today!

765
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,071
Check this out.
Have you ever seen anything like this?

766
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:52,743
You see, I got this autograph
from Song Ga-in in person.

767
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,124
"May your business prosper,
Shinsu Locksmith. From Song Ga-in."

768
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,501
I bet you have nothing like this.

769
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,920
Of course you don't.

770
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:30,865
Mr. Sun?

771
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:37,329
You left saying "take care."
Why are you here?

772
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,750
Why did you do that?

773
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,586
What do you mean?

774
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,964
I just heard all about it
from the locksmith.

775
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:53,304
I did it because it happened at my place,
so don't read too much into it.

776
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,347
Even if it happened at their house,

777
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,641
who would buy that many door locks?

778
00:57:58,267 --> 00:57:59,935
Who would kneel down for me?

779
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,897
Who would even get him a concert ticket?

780
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,862
Why are you being like this?

781
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,866
You do so much for me without me knowing,

782
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,660
but why do you act so cold in front of me?

783
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:35,512
What…

784
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,733
Why are you crying suddenly?

785
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,155
You met up with another woman.

786
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,618
Last weekend, I saw you

787
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,912
with another woman.

788
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:03,707
She was pretty.

789
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,584
So pretty.

790
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,839
I haven't even touched
your fingernail, but…

791
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,217
But you had...

792
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,220
coffee with her...

793
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,306
and held hands with her.

794
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,270
So…

795
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,066
you were mad at me because of that?

796
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,861
You told me to trust you,
and you did that with another woman.

797
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:36,740
You're right, Ms. Bom.

798
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,286
What?

799
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,246
I, Sun Jae-gyu...

800
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,708
don't keep my word.

801
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,252
I'm not as strong as I look,

802
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:53,966
and I'm not intelligent, cultured,
refined or patient.

803
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,556
I'm sorry.

804
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,143
I can't wait any longer.

805
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:09,017
Welcome to our plant, Green Narae!

806
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,771
Something's going on
between you and Jae-gyu? The twins saw it.

807
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:17,359
He's the best husband material.
He's strong, influential, and rich.

808
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,360
Do you like it?

809
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,028
Why do you keep asking?

810
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:23,449
-What if we get caught?
-I'll find the perfect place.

811
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,618
-No one's here.
-I told you to trust me.

812
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,621
-Mr. Sun.
-Yes, Ms. Bom.

813
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:31,665
Can I say what I couldn't earlier?

814
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:37,713
