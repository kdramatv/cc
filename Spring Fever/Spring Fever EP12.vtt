{\an8}SCHOOL BULLETIN BOARD

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.865
{\an8}HELLO, I'M YOON BOM, THE ETHICS TEACHER

4
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.083
Don't hide, don't avoid anything,
and don't run.

5
00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.377
Let's go.

6
00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.930
Han-gyul, did you see this?

7
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.893
BULLETIN BOARD

8
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.354
HELLO, I'M YOON BOM, THE ETHICS TEACHER

9
00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:50.481
What's this?

10
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.335
Ms. Bom.

11
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.717
Bom...

12
00:04:32.982 --> 00:04:34.608
<i>Hello.</i>

13
00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:37.194
<i>I'm Yoon Bom, the ethics teacher.</i>

14
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:48.580
<i>I'm sure many of you have been curious</i>
<i>about why I came down to this town.</i>

15
00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:59.800
<i>Despite the countless rumors,</i>

16
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.594
<i>I have been silent about it</i>

17
00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:04.888
<i>because I was</i>

18
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:09.727
<i>in a situation where I needed to be silent</i>
<i>instead of explaining myself at the time.</i>

19
00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:15.441
<i>I believed that everyone would be happy</i>
<i>as long as I kept silent,</i>

20
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.488
<i>and I believed that my wounded heart</i>
<i>would heal with time.</i>

21
00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.491
<i>But I've realized</i>

22
00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:30.539
<i>the truth can only be protected</i>
<i>with courage, not with time.</i>

23
00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.333
<i>So now,</i>

24
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:37.421
<i>I'm bringing myself to tell all of you</i>
<i>what I went through.</i>

25
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:07.618
Mom.

26
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.080
Actually, I…

27
00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.671
I almost had a heart attack.

28
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.381
Who's that now?

29
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.802
Could it be a reporter?

30
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:25.761
What?

31
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.973
I'm sure it isn't. I'll go check.

32
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.232
I'm sorry if you're offended.

33
00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:42.820
But, as you said,
getting first place is pointless for me.

34
00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:46.907
I don't need good grades
since I'm not going to college.

35
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.076
And I don't have parents fussing about it.

36
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:54.081
It must've been fun.

37
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.836
I had no idea
and said studying was a stamina game

38
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.588
and that it felt like
the world noticed my effort.

39
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.676
Watching me think I really beat you
must've been fun.

40
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.595
I wanted to give you first place
as a present.

41
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.514
That's all.

42
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.142
Do you seriously think that's a present?

43
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:18.313
Giving someone what they want the most,
isn't that what a present is?

44
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:23.986
Don't contact me for a while.

45
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:24.987
What?

46
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.282
I'll stop seeing you now
and focus on my studies.

47
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.368
But, Se-jin, we just started going out.

48
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.995
Coming first on my own terms…

49
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.624
That's the present I want the most.

50
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.509
Hello.

51
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.137
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

52
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:52.431
I told him to come.

53
00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.894
Jae-gyu told me
he had something to discuss with you.

54
00:07:57.728 --> 00:07:59.646
We were gathering here anyway,

55
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.983
and I thought it'd be better
to discuss it together.

56
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:08.238
I met the department head at <i>Disfact</i>
before coming here.

57
00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:09.781
What?

58
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:19.041
Can you can delete all the copies
of the conversation you recorded here?

59
00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:28.050
I mean, it's so easy
to make copies these days.

60
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.093
So I need to be sure.

61
00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.349
Look. I need you

62
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.478
to delete the original and copies
from your hard drive

63
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.356
and cloud drive in front of me.
All of them.

64
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.485
And drop the request
for a preliminary injunction.

65
00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:53.992
You see,

66
00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.874
I have a bad habit of getting things done
at all costs once I set my mind to it.

67
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:05.295
If I delete the recording
and you publish the article,

68
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.130
there will be no more settlement.

69
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.590
And I'll take legal action

70
00:09:08.674 --> 00:09:11.176
against everything
including this agreement.

71
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.388
You will…

72
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.101
pay for your mistake.

73
00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:25.649
He promised not to publish the article.

74
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.152
I can finally breathe again.

75
00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:32.823
It feels like I've been
dragged out of my coffin.

76
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:37.452
I'll meet the reporter
and take care of legal matters tomorrow.

77
00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:38.453
Bom.

78
00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.248
You should be relieved too.

79
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:43.542
It's all over now.

80
00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:47.462
It's not over for me yet.

81
00:09:57.723 --> 00:09:59.891
I'm sorry, Mom. I…

82
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.898
I posted it on the school bulletin board.

83
00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.692
Post what?

84
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.695
About why I came to the town

85
00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.073
and what I'd gone through.

86
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.368
Everything.

87
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.705
You foolish brat!

88
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.873
Honey.

89
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.250
You're too good for your own good.

90
00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:29.004
The reporter was about to quit,
so why would you reveal it first?

91
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:31.590
Mom.

92
00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:35.302
I still have nightmares every night.

93
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.597
About the woman slapping me
in front of the students

94
00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:42.601
and about the man
being in front of my place.

95
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.900
If the world forgot about it,

96
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.196
I thought it would
be erased from my mind too.

97
00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:55.739
But, no.

98
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.033
Even if the world might have,

99
00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:01.370
I can't forget about it.

100
00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:14.007
I did as you said back then,

101
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.094
so please listen to me this time.

102
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.389
Please.

103
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.048
Will you really be all right?

104
00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.301
Of course not.

105
00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:02.681
Then how about doing it tomorrow,
not today?

106
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.891
Or do you want me to go in with you?

107
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.226
No.

108
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.646
I'm scared and nervous,
and I want to hide,

109
00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.067
but I have to sort this out myself.

110
00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.280
All right.

111
00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.992
Then good luck with it.
I'll be waiting here until you're done.

112
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.553
All of you have read what I posted, right?

113
00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.898
I've always told you that
what needs to be done needs to be done.

114
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:57.736
However, I myself have been
putting off what I needed to do.

115
00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.905
And as a teacher,

116
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.992
especially as someone teaching you ethics,

117
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.829
I feel so ashamed.

118
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.627
Even if you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do.

119
00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:15.670
But still…

120
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:20.383
I hope you do.

121
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:30.310
And now,
there's not much time left between us.

122
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.854
Putting aside what happened today,

123
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:37.609
I'm going to do my best
to teach you until the end.

124
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.194
Any questions?

125
00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:41.947
Yes, Se-jin.

126
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:47.369
Ma'am, is our school going to
open the special class for the mock exam?

127
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.417
I'll talk to the principal about that.

128
00:13:55.502 --> 00:14:00.298
Or, how about our class does
self-study sessions during the break?

129
00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:04.261
Geez… Choi Se-jin,
stop making such a fuss.

130
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.055
- Why would we do that during the break?
- Exactly.

131
00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.186
Quiet.

132
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.897
I know finals are over,
but don't hang around,

133
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:17.399
and go straight home, okay?

134
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:18.692
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:19.651
Get home safe.

136
00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.403
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

137
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.951
Ms. Bom just dismissed her class.

138
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:28.994
She'll be here soon.

139
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.414
When she comes,
no one says anything, okay?

140
00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:35.333
But we should ask her
about the bulletin board.

141
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.503
She's been suffering because of it
since yesterday.

142
00:14:38.587 --> 00:14:41.047
How do you think she must've felt
to post it herself?

143
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.717
Since she posted herself,
we should ask her

144
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.136
whether she really had an affair or not.

145
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.429
For God's sake.

146
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.433
I already got the answer to that,
so ask me what you want to know.

147
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:55.353
I heard it from Attorney Choi I-jun
that you like so much.

148
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.315
Attorney Choi?

149
00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:02.694
Oh, she's here.

150
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:10.702
Well, should I have soju with chicken feet
or beer with fried chicken?

151
00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.579
How about soju with pork belly?

152
00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.039
Sounds great.

153
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:14.956
Ms. Bom.

154
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.043
We need to conduct a survey
regarding summer break classes,

155
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.170
so please draw up the letter to parents.

156
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.341
Ms. Bom.

157
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.551
The principal's talking to you.

158
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.556
Sure. I'll finish it
and give it you tomorrow.

159
00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:33.516
Okay.

160
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.542
Mr. Park, this is Hong Jung-pyo.

161
00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.295
What happened?

162
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.298
You told me it would make headlines,

163
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.926
so I even told you
about her dating the thug.

164
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.136
What?

165
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:12.263
You pulled it?

166
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.396
What are you…

167
00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.193
Hey, I-jun.

168
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.113
I caught the one who tipped them off.

169
00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:29.989
Who?

170
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.077
Well, the one who did it is…

171
00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:39.040
Hello? Mr. Choi, this is Hong Jung-pyo.

172
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:40.875
It wasn't me.

173
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:45.505
The reporter already knew about
the affair when he came to me.

174
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.425
All I did was just humor him a little.

175
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.178
Something like this won't happen again.

176
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:56.474
So please don't tell the governor.

177
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.727
Sure. Goodbye.

178
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.897

DELETE

180
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.067
What are you doing?

181
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.653
You said you wouldn't do it again,
so I helped you.

182
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:09.654
Here.

183
00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:23.001
WELCOME TO SHINSU MARKET

184
00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.010
Will you be okay?

185
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.179
This is the most crowded place in town.

186
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:38.016
Now that I've revealed my secret,
I should get used to criticism.

187
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.394
If anyone criticizes you,

188
00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.063
I'll be your shield to protect you.

189
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:49.778
Auntie.

190
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.488
I heard the rumor.

191
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.408
I thought you two were married.

192
00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.868
Well, that's…

193
00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.703
If you're not, marry him already.

194
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.206
Just have three or four kids,

195
00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.292
then he'll raise them really well.

196
00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.504
Geez.

197
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.469
- Ms. Bom.
- Ma'am.

198
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.470
Ma'am.

199
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.097
I heard it from Dong-pyo this morning.

200
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.145
I made some porridge. Come pick it up.

201
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.564
Porridge?

202
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.902
We had a good sesame harvest this year
thanks to Han-gyul's uncle.

203
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.071
Goodness.

204
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:39.994
Dong-pyo was worried sick about you,
so I made a big pot of porridge, okay?

205
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.038
Thank you.

206
00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:44.666
- Bye.
- Bye.

207
00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:55.468
I guess people in Shinsu
aren't that harsh after all.

208
00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.719
They are, actually.

209
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.639
I went through a lot
because of the rumor that I was a thug.

210
00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.684
I can't believe these people.

211
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.269
They treat you so differently.

212
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.187
This is why your impression is important.

213
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:10.692
They were so harsh to me,
while they are all so kind to you.

214
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.152
Let's go. I'll buy you pumpkin <i>sikhye.</i>

215
00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.988
It's the best cure for cooling down.

216
00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.030
This way.

217
00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.074
Goodness.

218
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.409
It's over there.

219
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.749
Han-gyul.

220
00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.545
Why are you out here?

221
00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.883
REPORT CARD

222
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.180
I'm sorry, Uncle.

223
00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.474
I wasn't thinking straight.

224
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.020
You shouldn't apologize to me.

225
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.315
You should apologize to Se-jin.

226
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.859
I know it was wrong.

227
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.614
But I truly did it for Se-jin.

228
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.327
Her parents looked down on her
because she always came second,

229
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.203
so I wanted it to stop.

230
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.164
The one who looked down on her the most

231
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.958
is you, Han-gyul.

232
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.710
It's me?

233
00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:15.924
You decided she had no chance
no matter how hard she tried.

234
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:20.470
That's why you thought you should
just let her come first. Right?

235
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.307
That's not a present.

236
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.685
That's charity.

237
00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.282
Here, have this.

238
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:48.623
Uncle.

239
00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:50.708
What?

240
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.296
Can I go to college?

241
00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:01.219
- Is that also because of Se-jin?
- No.

242
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.932
To tell the truth,
I've wanted to go to college,

243
00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:09.227
but I thought
I couldn't leave you here alone.

244
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.146
So once I graduated,

245
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.232
I was going to work with you
at your company.

246
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.733
I don't need you.

247
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.028
Talk about getting ahead of yourself.

248
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:22.532
Phillip's doing a good job.
And who said I would hire you?

249
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:24.909
You're ridiculous.

250
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.787
Will you really be okay alone?

251
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.290
Both Ms. Bom and I will be going to Seoul.

252
00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:35.712
Ms. Bom?

253
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.506
Her term as an exchange teacher ends soon.

254
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.015
Is it time already?

255
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.689
Then I should start preparing myself.

256
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:02.739
The meat is so good.

257
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.117
I wonder if Ms. Bom's okay.

258
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.580
Geez, woman, stop worrying about her
and try this meat.

259
00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.251
Forget it. I'm leaving.

260
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:18.046
What? Why would you leave
in the middle of eating?

261
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:20.048
Does it not suit your taste?

262
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.091
Or did I make a mistake?

263
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.136
I swear, I'll sew your mouth shut.

264
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.096
Why?

265
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.015
Just call me Ms. Seo instead.

266
00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:33.102
Who'd want to be called "woman"
at a nice restaurant on a Saturday?

267
00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:36.647
Geez, so that was the problem.

268
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.858
All right, fine. I got it.

269
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:44.572
If I called you
"old man," would you like it?

270
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:47.950
If I don't call you "woman,"

271
00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:49.410
what should I call you?

272
00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:53.498
- Hey, you.
- "Hey, you"?

273
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.208
- Look.
- "Look"?

274
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.542
Hey.

275
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.378
Forget it. What did I expect?

276
00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:00.755
- I'm off.
- Don't go.

277
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:01.923
Hye…

278
00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:07.970
Hye…

279
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.723
Hye…

280
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:14.352
Hye-suk.

281
00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:31.077
Hye-suk.

282
00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.166
I like that.

283
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:39.210
Let's sit.

284
00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:41.045
Hye-suk, sit.

285
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:43.548
Don't do that. Just sit.

286
00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:53.975
COURAGE TO BE HATED

287
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:08.072
<i>I think I now know why you're so mad.</i>

288
00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:12.285
<i>Se-jin, you can hate me.</i>

289
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.330
{\an8}<i>Hate me all you want</i>
<i>until you don't feel angry anymore.</i>

290
00:24:16.414 --> 00:24:18.875
{\an8}<i>And when the hatred is gone,</i>

291
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:21.043
{\an8}<i>I want you to come back.</i>

292
00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:00.791
All right.

293
00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:04.921
Ta-da.

294
00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:07.840
This is spicy sauce.

295
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.968
This is <i>kkakdugi.</i>

296
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.014
And this is beef brisket soup.

297
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:17.934
Why did you bring so many?

298
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:21.020
Well, I was going
to teach you how to cook,

299
00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:24.315
but I think you have no talent for it.

300
00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:28.945
These days, deliveries take just a day,
so why bother?

301
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:30.780
All right.

302
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:49.215
It's good.

303
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:55.763
This is what I'm talking about.

304
00:25:57.265 --> 00:25:59.350
But why the sudden side dish delivery?

305
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:06.983
You know, you're going back to Seoul soon.

306
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.861
It's already time.

307
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:14.532
Right now, if you call me,
I can run over in ten minutes.

308
00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:18.995
But when you're in Seoul, I can't.

309
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.873
So, before you leave,

310
00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:26.544
I'm going to teach you
everything you need one by one.

311
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:29.547
So I can be prepared for us
to be separated?

312
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:30.715
Come on.

313
00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:33.634
The diameter of the Earth
is about 13,000 km.

314
00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:35.928
But we're within just 400 km.

315
00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:38.306
We won't be "separated."

316
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:39.974
We will be still "connected."

317
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.185
We may be far from each other,

318
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:45.938
but my heart will be there
wherever you are.

319
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:49.317
So don't cry
when you're out of side dishes.

320
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.485
Don't starve, and call me anytime.

321
00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:55.906
Then I'll send nutrient-balanced
side dishes to your place right away.

322
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:02.705
It has so much meat.

323
00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.540
- I'll boil it for you.
- Okay.

324
00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:20.264
Now, seat belt on.

325
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.726
What am I preparing for?

326
00:27:24.727 --> 00:27:26.562
If you say you miss me,

327
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.981
I can throw everything aside
and run to you.

328
00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:33.361
But some days,
you might miss me out of the blue.

329
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:35.446
You should know how to drive for that.

330
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:38.908
I understand your intention,

331
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:41.118
but I haven't had an accident
in ten years.

332
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:45.289
That's because
you haven't driven in ten years.

333
00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:47.750
All right, turn the left blinker on.

334
00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:53.339
No. Here.

335
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:56.801
Now, put it into drive.

336
00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:58.803
Gently step on the accelerator.

337
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:02.473
Was it the right one or the left one?

338
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.311
I'm sorry,
but let's just cancel this project.

339
00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:09.230
Come on, I was kidding.

340
00:28:09.313 --> 00:28:11.190
Did you really think I didn't know?

341
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:14.944
- It's the left one, right?
- The right one!

342
00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:17.405
No, the left one! The brake!

343
00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:18.614
- The right one.
- The brake!

344
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.491
- The right one.
- The left one!

345
00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:22.743
- I'm not doing this!
- Don't you know left?

346
00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:24.537
- Left…
- No, the right one!

347
00:28:28.082 --> 00:28:28.958
Ms. Bom.

348
00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:35.548
What? What's going on?

349
00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:38.342
Weren't we going to practice driving?

350
00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:42.138
Well, I don't think
that's good for either of us.

351
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:45.808
So, how about we do
something else starting today?

352
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:52.106
Come to think of it,
we haven't taken many photos together.

353
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:56.735
So I thought it'd be nice to record
our fond memories together with pictures.

354
00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:00.739
Then, wherever we are,
we'll feel like we're together.

355
00:29:01.949 --> 00:29:03.325
I'd love that.

356
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:05.453
Right. I know where to go first.

357
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.037
Where?

358
00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:09.123
Just follow me. Okay?

359
00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:38.319
They look beautiful.

360
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:43.991
It looks good.

361
00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.250
Thank you.

362
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.211
- Now, look at the camera.
- Camera.

363
00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:56.754
One, two, three.

364
00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:58.255
- Team White, let's go!
- Let's go!

365
00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.884
BOM-SIK'S HOUSE

366
00:30:03.844 --> 00:30:05.304
Looking good!

367
00:30:11.477 --> 00:30:12.978
Now, prepare to choke.

368
00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:14.480
Ready.

369
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:15.648
Look there.

370
00:30:36.794 --> 00:30:39.922
If you did your best this time,
you must be first place.

371
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.341
But it's okay if I lose now.

372
00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:45.427
Because I gave it my all,

373
00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:49.848
and if it wasn't enough,
then I should accept that.

374
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:54.061
I won't hate you or myself.

375
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:55.062
I won't either.

376
00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:59.400
I won't hate myself if I win,
and I won't hate you if I lose.

377
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:03.654
All right.

378
00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:07.283
- Ladies first. I'll open mine first.
- Okay.

379
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:10.369
REPORT CARD

380
00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:15.165
What?

381
00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:16.750
First place for everything?

382
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.213
Did you mark number three
for every question again?

383
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:27.177
You really did that again.

384
00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:29.138
Otherwise, why am I in first place?

385
00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:33.851
Second place?

386
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.187
Second place?

387
00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.982
You did your best this time, didn't you?

388
00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:45.529
I want to go to college now, and…

389
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:49.241
Choi Se-jin, you…

390
00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:51.076
Don't contact me for a while.

391
00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:54.997
What? You said
you wouldn't hate me for it.

392
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.290
You said it yourself.

393
00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:58.876
I'm going to focus on my studies now.

394
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.836
- Get out of my way.
- What?

395
00:32:01.462 --> 00:32:03.756
You really are angry. Are you, babe?

396
00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:05.215
- Hey.
- Hello, ma'am.

397
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:07.843
- Move.
- Hey, you can do it too.

398
00:32:08.344 --> 00:32:10.095
Should I solve the questions for you?

399
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.727
Wow, it's finished.

400
00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:20.731
It's so pretty.

401
00:32:23.734 --> 00:32:25.319
You're really leaving tomorrow.

402
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.697
Gosh, I am.

403
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.075
Don't overwork at the new school.

404
00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:33.744
- I won't.
- Take medicine if you feel unwell.

405
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:35.412
Okay.

406
00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:36.914
You remember the skills?

407
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.249
If anyone harasses you, don't be scared.

408
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:40.376
Just take them down and--

409
00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:45.923
Tomorrow, we'll be 400 km apart.
Are you going to just talk?

410
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:50.344
Is there anything else to do?

411
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.766
Anything else? Like what?

412
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:56.892
Well…

413
00:32:58.102 --> 00:32:59.561
For instance…

414
00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:13.158
What you're doing right now,
it's very dangerous.

415
00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:16.328
It's our last night, so why not…

416
00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:19.373
be a little dangerous?

417
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.044
Then I'll do…

418
00:33:25.421 --> 00:33:27.047
something dangerous starting now.

419
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.243
Let's go!

420
00:34:10.132 --> 00:34:11.842
1 YEAR LATER

421
00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:14.470
SEOUL MYEONGSEONG HIGH SCHOOL

422
00:34:29.777 --> 00:34:33.655
HAPPINESS

423
00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:36.742
Happiness.

424
00:34:37.951 --> 00:34:41.747
If you're asked why you want to be happy,

425
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.457
how can you answer?

426
00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:47.211
Aristotle said,

427
00:34:47.294 --> 00:34:50.923
"The ultimate aim
of all human actions is happiness."

428
00:34:51.006 --> 00:34:53.342
Unlike Plato who advocated
for an ideal world,

429
00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:57.638
Aristotle focused
on the real world we live in.

430
00:34:57.721 --> 00:35:00.641
Let's go to page 62
of <i>Ethics and Thoughts.</i>

431
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.277
- My college friend at Munseong High...
- Yes.

432
00:35:12.361 --> 00:35:16.323
...said that she had an affair there.

433
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.492
- Affair?
- Yes.

434
00:35:19.243 --> 00:35:20.661
She's Jeong Nan-hee's daughter?

435
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.247
I knew it.

436
00:35:39.096 --> 00:35:39.930
Ms. Bom.

437
00:35:41.223 --> 00:35:42.766
Hi. How did it go?

438
00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:46.603
This is the ruling.

439
00:35:47.271 --> 00:35:48.355
Read it yourself.

440
00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:50.983
COURT OF KOREA

441
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:04.496
PARTIES' CLAIMS AND FINDINGS

442
00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:12.963
DAMAGES FOR MENTAL DISTRESS

443
00:36:20.304 --> 00:36:25.100
KIM HYEON-JU IS LIABLE
TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ASSAULT

444
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:31.064
You have done well all this time.

445
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:40.657
What is this?

446
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:43.994
It's the ruling for the adultery case
you mentioned.

447
00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:47.497
I'd like you to know
that I was being stalked

448
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:48.832
and spread the word.

449
00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:55.213
Right, and you also talked about me
being Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

450
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:57.257
That one is true.

451
00:36:57.341 --> 00:36:59.384
And that's the secret to my beauty.

452
00:36:59.468 --> 00:37:02.346
Well, then. Have a nice day.

453
00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:15.901
The guest for today's
"Meet the Successful Professional"

454
00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:19.154
was selected by the students' vote.

455
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:22.908
It is also the person who donated
a scholarship fund to our school

456
00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:24.868
to cultivate local talent.

457
00:37:25.494 --> 00:37:28.664
The one that
an overwhelming majority voted for!

458
00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.707
The CEO of JQ Energy,

459
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:35.921
Sun Jae-gyu!

460
00:37:57.818 --> 00:37:59.361
Hello.

461
00:37:59.444 --> 00:38:01.822
I'm the CEO of JQ Energy,

462
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:04.616
but I'm better known
as Sun Han-gyul's uncle.

463
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.993
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

464
00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:24.302
What? Han-gyul's uncle is... that guy?

465
00:38:25.053 --> 00:38:27.514
Right, you were away
as an exchange teacher.

466
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:30.892
God, look at how he's dressed.

467
00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.394
Is he really the CEO?

468
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:36.189
He looks like a thug
that hangs around the market.

469
00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:39.484
That's what we also thought at first.

470
00:38:40.527 --> 00:38:43.739
But I heard a rumor
that he goes around lifting cars.

471
00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:44.948
That's right.

472
00:38:45.032 --> 00:38:47.409
He always sets an example
in the neighborhood.

473
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:52.789
According to rumors,
he also shovels in the mountains at night.

474
00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:55.709
He cares about every life.

475
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:56.793
That's right.

476
00:38:57.419 --> 00:39:00.380
When the typhoon hit,
he took care of everyone.

477
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.674
Right, Hye-suk?

478
00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:03.759
That's right.

479
00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:06.386
What's going on?
Why are you all defending him?

480
00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:08.930
You just wait and see.

481
00:39:09.556 --> 00:39:12.267
You'll see what we're talking about.

482
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.311
But why isn't he saying anything?

483
00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:39.711
Goodness.

484
00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:45.675
First of all, to the students and teachers
who invited me here,

485
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:47.761
I'm truly grateful.

486
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:53.225
Now, let's begin the lecture.

487
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:59.481
JQ Energy is not just a company
that produces electricity.

488
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:02.484
It's a company that reads trends
and designs the future.

489
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:04.236
And today,

490
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:07.948
we'll talk about how the energy industry
is changing in this AI era,

491
00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:12.994
especially what kind of role
renewable energy plays in the change.

492
00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:16.915
BOM BOM BOM

493
00:40:30.387 --> 00:40:31.513
By the way, Mr. Choi,

494
00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:33.974
are you really not moving your office?

495
00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:35.725
Right.

496
00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:38.687
Why are you still there?
There's nothing there.

497
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.105
What do you mean, nothing?

498
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.898
The most important thing is there.

499
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:44.693
What's there?

500
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:47.320
Well…

501
00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:50.282
A friend?

502
00:40:53.994 --> 00:40:55.245
JAE-GYU

503
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.999
- Mr. Sun!
<i>- Ms. Bom!</i>

504
00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:02.752
<i>I couldn't answer your calls</i>
<i>because of the lecture.</i>

505
00:41:03.253 --> 00:41:05.005
It's so noisy here, so I…

506
00:41:05.088 --> 00:41:06.590
It's Ms. Bom!

507
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.425
Han-gyul's uncle

508
00:41:08.508 --> 00:41:13.054
donated a scholarship fund
to our school, so I'm treating him!

509
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:18.560
Goodness.

510
00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:21.438
Being here brings back memories.

511
00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:24.149
Anyway, why did you call so many times?

512
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:25.817
Did you miss me that much?

513
00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:29.404
I got the ruling today.

514
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.281
I wanted to tell you I won.

515
00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:32.282
Really?

516
00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:34.826
See? What did I tell you?

517
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.662
I-jun can be a jerk sometimes,
but he's a good lawyer.

518
00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:38.997
He was a great student.

519
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.250
Who are you calling a jerk, punk?

520
00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:44.294
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>
- Yes, I did.

521
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:49.090
Geez, what are you doing here?

522
00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:53.595
Hang up already and come drink with me.

523
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.933
<i>Leaving bad blood between us behind</i>

524
00:41:58.016 --> 00:42:00.352
There was no bad blood.
Let me talk to her more.

525
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:01.436
Goodness.

526
00:42:02.062 --> 00:42:04.272
<i>- Ms. Bom.</i>
- Mr. Hong, how have you been?

527
00:42:04.356 --> 00:42:06.441
<i>Mr. Sun is pretty drunk.</i>

528
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.568
<i>Call him some other time.</i>

529
00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:10.111
<i>- Let's go.</i>
<i>- Wait. Ms. Bom.</i>

530
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.072
<i>You drive me crazy!</i>

531
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:14.157
- Sun Jae-gyu.
- My shoes…

532
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.619
You've settled in my heart!

533
00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:20.121
No, Mr. Hong. Hold on.

534
00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:23.083
Hello? Mr. Sun! Jae-gyu!

535
00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:24.251
Stop it.

536
00:42:24.334 --> 00:42:25.627
- Stop.
- No, Mom. Hold on.

537
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.754
Yes. We should make a toast too.

538
00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:28.672
All right.

539
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:32.467
Congratulations on Yoon Bom's win.

540
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.679
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

541
00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:37.931
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

542
00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:48.608
I've sold the land,
and the paperwork's all done.

543
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:52.570
Then what is it?

544
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:02.622
I wanted to pay for Han-gyul's tuition.

545
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.877
I don't know if he's quick-witted

546
00:43:08.837 --> 00:43:10.338
or if he's matured early,

547
00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:14.342
but he's never contacted me since then.

548
00:43:17.012 --> 00:43:21.433
I can pay for his tuition too,
so do something I can't do for him.

549
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:23.435
Like what?

550
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.854
A picture.

551
00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:31.818
Whenever he started school,

552
00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:34.404
it was always just me and him
at the entrance ceremony.

553
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:36.990
He didn't say it,

554
00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:39.617
but I could see it in his eyes.

555
00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:44.164
He envied his friends
who were taking photos

556
00:43:44.831 --> 00:43:48.293
with their moms, dads,
and other family members.

557
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.382
Let's do that
at his college entrance ceremony.

558
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:58.386
Let's get him flowers
and take pictures with him.

559
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:02.724
For Han-gyul,

560
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.810
I'm sure that's the best present.

561
00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:31.878
Gosh, I miss him so much!

562
00:44:42.764 --> 00:44:45.308
<i>If one day, out of the blue,</i>

563
00:44:45.392 --> 00:44:48.103
<i>you ever find yourself really missing me,</i>
<i>open it then.</i>

564
00:44:52.232 --> 00:44:53.775
How much do I miss him now?

565
00:44:54.943 --> 00:44:56.861
Beep, beep. It's 100%.

566
00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:00.573
Then I should open it.

567
00:45:01.491 --> 00:45:04.035
Yes, Bom. Let's open it.

568
00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:11.960
I've gained some weight.
What if it doesn't fit?

569
00:45:14.337 --> 00:45:15.422
No.

570
00:45:15.505 --> 00:45:18.007
Sun Jae-gyu is not someone
that predictable.

571
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:20.135
So I'm sure it's not a ring.

572
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:22.512
But it'll be

573
00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:25.723
something sparkly and shiny
that'll make me…

574
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:32.480
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

575
00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:39.529
He thinks this is a gift?

576
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:42.782
I've been holding myself
from opening it for this?

577
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:44.409
Darn it.

578
00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.435
Geez, Ms. Bom.

579
00:46:56.064 --> 00:46:56.940
Ms. Bom…

580
00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:07.784
This darn lawyer…

581
00:47:08.368 --> 00:47:10.870
I thought it was her, darn it.

582
00:47:11.955 --> 00:47:13.122
Gosh, my head.

583
00:47:17.377 --> 00:47:19.254
For crying out loud!

584
00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:23.132
What the...

585
00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:27.011
Goodness, my head.

586
00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.430
You threw me off again?

587
00:47:29.514 --> 00:47:31.432
How many times is this?

588
00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:35.228
You barge in with some pork belly
and sleep here whenever you want.

589
00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:38.106
When did I say it was okay
for you to sleep here?

590
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.733
You ungrateful bastard.

591
00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.570
You got a place to live
and raised Han-gyul with my money.

592
00:47:43.653 --> 00:47:45.029
And you can't do this for me?

593
00:47:45.113 --> 00:47:47.699
Goodness.
I think I've done enough, so leave.

594
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:48.950
I have to go out.

595
00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:50.618
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

596
00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:53.162
Why can't you just stay home?
Where are you going?

597
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.456
Jae-gyu.

598
00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:59.294
Sun Jae-gyu, where are you going?

599
00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:24.152
Ms. Bom, when did you get here?

600
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.069
What…

601
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:27.822
Why are you coming from there?

602
00:48:28.573 --> 00:48:30.617
- Where's Sun Jae-gyu?
- Jae-gyu?

603
00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:36.331
Well, I bet he's having
the hardest time in his life.

604
00:48:41.336 --> 00:48:45.173
Now, the panel consists
of P-type and N-type semiconductors,

605
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:47.925
and electrons and holes
in the photoelectric effect

606
00:48:48.009 --> 00:48:50.595
diffuse towards each other
in a p-n junction.

607
00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:53.681
It causes a potential difference,
and if an external circuit

608
00:48:53.765 --> 00:48:54.974
- is connected…
- Mr. Gu.

609
00:48:55.558 --> 00:48:56.601
It's…

610
00:48:57.644 --> 00:48:58.770
Director Gu. What?

611
00:48:58.853 --> 00:49:00.855
I don't understand anything you say.

612
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.815
Can you translate it into Korean?

613
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:06.736
You've been working part-time for a while.
You still don't understand?

614
00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:09.489
How are you going
to get a job here like this?

615
00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:12.200
Sun Han-gyul,
the crown prince of JQ Energy,

616
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:14.827
is abandoning the company
to go to college.

617
00:49:14.911 --> 00:49:17.205
Who will fill the gap except for us?

618
00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:23.461
Gosh, you guys are
also poor in character, not just in skill.

619
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:27.298
This is why I told the boss
not to hire you so many times.

620
00:49:27.382 --> 00:49:30.176
Forget it. Just move that one. Go!

621
00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:37.517
Am I seeing things because I'm exhausted?

622
00:49:38.434 --> 00:49:39.852
Isn't that Ms. Bom?

623
00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:41.229
- Ms. Bom!
- Ms. Bom!

624
00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.733
- Ms. Bom!
- Ms. Bom!

625
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.110
Guys!

626
00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:50.071
Dae-han and Min-guk,
you're really working part-time here?

627
00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.197
Ms. Yoon.

628
00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:53.658
- Hello.
- Hello.

629
00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.452
You did such a good job.

630
00:49:56.536 --> 00:49:59.706
While teaching these two how to work here,

631
00:49:59.789 --> 00:50:03.626
I realized how hard
it must've been for you.

632
00:50:04.544 --> 00:50:06.170
By the way, what brings you here?

633
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:09.632
Right. I came to see Mr. Sun.

634
00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:12.885
Uncle… No, Mr. Sun went out
to go to the market earlier.

635
00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:14.303
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

636
00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:16.431
Then why won't he pick up?

637
00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:17.598
Oh, right.

638
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:20.393
He left his phone here.

639
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.645
If you see him, give it to him.

640
00:50:29.277 --> 00:50:30.111
Okay.

641
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:35.867
Once the entrance ceremony is over,

642
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.453
we'll go to the salt bread bakery
and wait in line,

643
00:50:38.536 --> 00:50:40.163
then take pictures at Seoul Forest

644
00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:43.249
and move to the cart bar street
in Eulmi-ro in the evening.

645
00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:45.376
We'll have beer with fish cake soup.

646
00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.963
Hey, what kind of date
is so tightly scheduled?

647
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.176
We'll attend the same lectures
in the same college. We'll meet every day.

648
00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:59.807
Since we'll see each other every day,
let's take it slow.

649
00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:01.642
Let's go to Hangang Park again

650
00:51:01.726 --> 00:51:03.436
and go to see Ms. Bom too.

651
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:05.938
Gosh, where is he?

652
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.484
Hey, we can see Ms. Bom right now.

653
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:11.235
Ms. Bom.

654
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:15.198
Guys!

655
00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:16.574
You've gotten so pretty.

656
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.660
- How have you been?
- Good.

657
00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:22.663
We were just talking about
how we'd go see you in Seoul.

658
00:51:22.747 --> 00:51:25.416
Really? When is
your entrance ceremony again?

659
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.418
- Can I go there?
- Of course.

660
00:51:27.502 --> 00:51:29.295
This entrance ceremony will be crowded.

661
00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:32.048
Anyway, what brought you down here?

662
00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:34.258
To see Han-gyul's uncle?

663
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:38.179
Right, I heard your uncle was here.

664
00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:41.516
He was, but he just went to the dojo
with the jiu jitsu people.

665
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:43.017
What?

666
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.566
Hye-suk, next week, let's…

667
00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:52.318
No.

668
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.656
Except for the way you address me,
nothing's changed.

669
00:51:57.281 --> 00:51:59.742
Seafood stew, <i>gamja-tang,</i>
<i>sundae-guk </i>and <i>naengmyeon.</i>

670
00:51:59.826 --> 00:52:01.828
How can you eat Korean food all the time?

671
00:52:02.537 --> 00:52:04.288
That's why we'll go to a hotel…

672
00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:06.499
A hotel?

673
00:52:06.582 --> 00:52:07.875
Don't get the wrong idea.

674
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:11.003
I got a family room
so that we can bring the twins too.

675
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:17.635
The twins can't go.

676
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:19.011
Why not?

677
00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:20.513
Don't ask.

678
00:52:20.596 --> 00:52:23.474
Whether it's a family room
or a honeymoon room,

679
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:25.434
I'll go.

680
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:30.565
People are watching.

681
00:52:32.817 --> 00:52:33.734
Ms. Bom!

682
00:52:33.818 --> 00:52:36.195
- Oh, attention! Hello, ma'am!
- Hello, ma'am!

683
00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:37.280
Hello.

684
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.073
How have you been?

685
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:40.157
Hey, Ms. Bom.

686
00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:41.534
Oh, Ms. Seo!

687
00:52:41.617 --> 00:52:43.619
Ms. Bom, I'm a blue belt now.

688
00:52:43.703 --> 00:52:45.663
Oh, really? Congrats, Dong-pyo!

689
00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:48.666
What? Mr. Hong?

690
00:52:50.376 --> 00:52:51.627
Hi, Ms. Bom.

691
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:54.005
Oh, you work out here too?

692
00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:56.507
Geez, what's the point, though?

693
00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:58.634
He's not getting better at all.

694
00:52:58.718 --> 00:53:02.513
You can't even do an armbar.
How will you win the sports festival?

695
00:53:02.597 --> 00:53:06.017
I'm just pretending.
I'm hiding the skill for the day.

696
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.685
Besides, at the next festival,

697
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:10.354
there won't be Sun Jae-gyu
since Han-gyul 's graduated.

698
00:53:10.438 --> 00:53:11.981
So I stand a chance.

699
00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:13.149
I'm sorry,

700
00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:17.778
but where is the Sun Jae-gyu
you're talking about?

701
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.906
I've been looking for him,

702
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:21.866
and I'm getting tired.

703
00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:25.995
Oh, if you go to the beach,
you'll definitely meet him.

704
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:27.872
Where you had your first date.

705
00:53:54.607 --> 00:53:55.816
Mr. Sun?

706
00:53:57.902 --> 00:53:59.487
You're here, Ms. Bom?

707
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:05.201
Why do you look so handsome…

708
00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:10.331
I mean, why do you look like a model…

709
00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:15.336
I mean, why are you going around so much?

710
00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:18.506
And what's with the suit?
Is today a special day?

711
00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:21.926
Any day, any moment,

712
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:25.763
I thought you might come see me,
so I've been wearing this all the time.

713
00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:28.057
What?

714
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:33.020
30 MINUTES AGO

715
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.856
Are you cuddling or what?
Do it properly. Like this!

716
00:54:37.316 --> 00:54:39.193
Master, my phone's ringing.

717
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.903
- Your phone? Go take it.
- Yes.

718
00:54:41.654 --> 00:54:42.905
Come on.

719
00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.115
Pull it.

720
00:54:45.658 --> 00:54:46.826
Hello?

721
00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:50.788
What? Ms. Bom is here?

722
00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:55.292
What did you say?

723
00:54:56.419 --> 00:54:58.087
Ms. Bom is here?

724
00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:01.799
She's looking everywhere for you
right now.

725
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.302
Han-gyul told her you were here,
so she's on the way.

726
00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:06.804
Here?

727
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.103
But he said she looked furious.

728
00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:17.064
She looked like she'd confront you.

729
00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:19.442
I wonder what's wrong.

730
00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:20.526
Why would she…

731
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:26.323
Oh, right.

732
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:29.827
Hey, I think I know why.

733
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.121
She's on the way. Where are you going?

734
00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:33.372
To the beach.

735
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.083
- The beach?
- Listen, when she comes,

736
00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:38.627
tell her to come to the beach
where we had our first date.

737
00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:39.920
Tell her to take her time.

738
00:55:40.004 --> 00:55:41.338
I'm leaving. Good luck!

739
00:55:41.422 --> 00:55:42.298
Work hard!

740
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:44.467
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

741
00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:51.098
You think I'll be fooled again?

742
00:55:52.725 --> 00:55:53.934
Fooled? I…

743
00:55:54.894 --> 00:55:57.313
You told me not to wear this
around other women,

744
00:55:57.396 --> 00:56:00.483
so I didn't even wear it at the lecture.
I've been saving it.

745
00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:04.278
Then what on earth is this?

746
00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:15.039
I thought it might be
something expensive or romantic,

747
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:16.582
so I didn't let Bom-sik touch it.

748
00:56:16.665 --> 00:56:19.251
I even risked my life for it
during the typhoon.

749
00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:22.588
Whenever I missed you,
I thought of opening it.

750
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:25.216
I hesitated and hesitated,
and I finally opened it.

751
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.470
All that waiting and missing you
was for this gas-station giveaway gift?

752
00:56:32.807 --> 00:56:34.975
Is this funny to you?

753
00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:38.187
Gosh, just as I expected.

754
00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:42.483
I knew you'd come see me
all furious once you opened it.

755
00:56:43.651 --> 00:56:44.735
What?

756
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.113
Ms. Bom.

757
00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:51.200
That arm sleeve is not just a free gift.

758
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:53.577
To me,

759
00:56:55.079 --> 00:56:57.123
it's more special than anything.

760
00:56:58.624 --> 00:57:00.209
Before I met you,

761
00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:04.797
I always tried to cover this scar.

762
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:10.761
I didn't have the courage to look at it,
so I always covered it with that sleeve.

763
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:13.681
But after I met you,

764
00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:18.853
for the first time,
I felt like I didn't have to hide it.

765
00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:24.525
I couldn't do it on my own.
You helped me overcome it.

766
00:57:29.655 --> 00:57:33.701
If that's the case,
I'll keep it safe for you.

767
00:57:36.704 --> 00:57:38.664
What? What are you doing?

768
00:57:39.874 --> 00:57:44.086
Goodness. It's been so hard
carrying this in my pocket every day.

769
00:57:45.171 --> 00:57:47.131
I've been carrying this in my pocket

770
00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:49.133
for the day you'd come see me like this.

771
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.052
And that day has finally come.

772
00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:05.149
My heart was as cold as winter,

773
00:58:05.733 --> 00:58:08.777
and you came to me like warm spring,
my lovely Bom.

774
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:11.113
Whether it's cold or hot,

775
00:58:11.197 --> 00:58:14.241
I'll be your man
who is always there for you.

776
00:58:16.076 --> 00:58:18.662
If that arm sleeve is a symbol
of our memories,

777
00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:21.624
this ring will be a symbol
of our future together…

778
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:26.795
What?

779
00:58:27.463 --> 00:58:29.215
I didn't even say half of my line.

780
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:32.134
Whatever you say,

781
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.345
my answer is yes.

782
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.828
We should get married in spring.

783
00:58:59.912 --> 00:59:01.413
And have three kids.

784
00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:03.540
The snack bar lady said sons are no good.

785
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:04.792
Then three daughters?

786
00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:08.128
Should we get our first home
in Seoul or here?

787
00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:12.466
Wherever it is and whenever it is,

788
00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:14.343
the one beside me...

789
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:17.846
will be you.

790
01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.044
BOM LOVES JAE-GYU

791
01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.980
