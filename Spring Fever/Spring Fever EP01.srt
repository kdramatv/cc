1
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,001
ENDURE
AND YOU'LL SOON REACH THE SKY

2
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,212
WHAT MAKES US TRULY HUMAN

3
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,508
TREATING OTHERS

4
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:35,387
WITH KINDNESS

5
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:40,017
AND CARE

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,984
Why are you here?

7
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,480
Enough already, Yoon Bom.

8
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,193
It's the same dream for over a year.
It's about time I got used to it.

9
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,630
Time to start another gloomy day.

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
Don't smile.

11
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,218
Don't have fun.

12
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,554
Don't be happy.

13
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,140
You've got this.

14
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,188
<i>Just when we thought</i>
<i>spring had arrived, winter returned.</i>

15
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,400
{\an8}<i>Last week was unusually warm,</i>

16
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,028
{\an8}<i>but a late cold snap</i>
<i>is moving in this week.</i>

17
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,906
{\an8}<i>As cold air pushes south</i>
<i>from the northwest,</i>

18
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,408
{\an8}<i>a nationwide cold wave warning</i>
<i>is now in effect.</i>

19
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:23,203
{\an8}<i>Temperatures in most areas are set to drop</i>
<i>over ten degrees from yesterday morning.</i>

20
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,881
{\an8}- Good morning.
- Hello.

21
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,092
{\an8}You know Ms. Bom?

22
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,845
{\an8}She's been here for almost a year,

23
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,513
{\an8}and I've never heard her talk.

24
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,266
{\an8}I just don't get it, I really don't.

25
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,352
{\an8}No matter how much time passes,

26
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,355
{\an8}all she does is nod or sulk all the time.

27
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,400
She's always in those dull, dark clothes.

28
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,485
What's her deal?

29
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,612
I guess she's not much of a talker.

30
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,489
<i>As if.</i>

31
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,991
I never listened to my parents as a kid.

32
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,369
One day, when I was five,
my dad put me in the car

33
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,995
and dropped me off at an empty lot.

34
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:05,913
My goodness.

35
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,958
He said I wasn't his daughter anymore.

36
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,626
So what did you say?

37
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,464
I said, "Mister, drop me off
at the orphanage

38
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,424
instead of here, please."

39
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,930
<i>Every time I spoke,</i>
<i>I totally slayed the audience,</i>

40
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,974
<i>so they called me the Story Slayer.</i>

41
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,577
{\an8}<i>People said seeing the ethics teacher</i>
<i>gave them unethical thoughts,</i>

42
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,539
{\an8}<i>so they called me</i>
<i>the Goddess of Temptation.</i>

43
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,456
ETHICS GODDESS

44
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,543
There's something off about her.

45
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,587
I mean, the teachers here
are trying to leave for Seoul.

46
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,549
Why would she come to this countryside
on her own?

47
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,259
It's clear as day.

48
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,387
If she's here as an exchange teacher,
she's stuck for two years.

49
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,390
She must've caused some major trouble.

50
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,975
You'd know more than us, right?

51
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,686
She at least talks to you sometimes.

52
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,605
Not really. She only talks to me
when she's paying rent.

53
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>Trust me, it's best you don't know</i>
<i>for your own peace of mind.</i>

54
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,653
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

55
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,405
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hello.

56
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,990
- Hey, twins.
- Good morning.

57
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,533
- Good morning.
- Morning.

58
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,578
- Hurry, get going.
- Hi, Ms. Bom.

59
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,464
Han-gyul!

60
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,591
Yeah, thanks.

61
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,926
Every time I see him,

62
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,345
it brings back memories of my school days.

63
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,514
- Right?
- Yeah, right.

64
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,267
He's in the same class as my twins.

65
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,561
How can they be so different?

66
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,937
I can't believe they're mine.

67
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,356
If that's how their mom sees them,

68
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,734
what about their homeroom teacher?

69
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,698
Hold on.

70
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,200
Han-gyul, look at me.

71
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,117
Stop pushing.

72
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,911
Han-gyul, come with me. Han-gyul!

73
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,746
- Good morning.
- Hey, Han-gyul.

74
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,084
I have a question for you, sir.

75
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,044
For me?

76
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,800
Follow me.

77
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,890
Wait, did the front door
lock properly today?

78
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,975
I've got a spare key.

79
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,394
If it acts up again, just let me know.

80
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,700
<i>Let's all thank the teacher.</i>

81
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,119
<i>Thank you for today!</i>

82
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,165
Midterms are already
just around the corner.

83
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,668
Starting tomorrow,

84
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,129
students won't be allowed
in the staff room.

85
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,382
Teachers, please make sure

86
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,467
- the exam papers don't get leaked.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,846
I'm sure you all know

88
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,307
that parent-teacher conferences
happen right after midterms, correct?

89
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,934
Yes, sir.

90
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,855
Homeroom teachers for each grade,
make sure to prepare in advance.

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,776
This Thursday, there's going to be
a midterm training session.

92
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,112
Everyone must attend the meeting

93
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,740
during lunch in the multipurpose room.
Please be on time.

94
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,409
- I'll take attendance.
- What's this?

95
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,244
Is the window open?

96
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,917
During exams,
both teachers and students are busy.

97
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,253
But this is the first written test
of the year.

98
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,214
I ask all teachers
to do their best to ensure

99
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,591
everything goes smoothly--

100
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:50,053
Emergency!

101
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,644
Emergency!

102
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,146
What's going on?

103
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,698
<i>This is a strange feeling</i>
<i>I've never felt before.</i>

104
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,962
He's coming.

105
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,684
What do we do? He'll be here in a minute.

106
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,143
Mr. Hong!

107
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,979
Tell him I'm gone for the day.

108
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,897
Out of the way.

109
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,192
- Mr. Hong!
- Hurry!

110
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
Get out of the way.

111
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,447
Quick, hide.

112
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,160
NO STAFF ROOM ENTRY

113
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,634
Is he here already?

114
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,677
There we go.

115
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,513
Move, get out of the way.

116
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,473
Darn it.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,228
Don't come.

118
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,522
<i>Who could that be?</i>

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,095
<i>The fabric appears</i>

120
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,723
<i>to be 84% polyester and 16% elastane.</i>

121
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:44,644
<i>Despite the snowstorm, his bare skin</i>
<i>doesn't even have goosebumps.</i>

122
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,396
<i>Is he an athlete?</i>

123
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,065
<i>No.</i>

124
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,901
<i>An athlete wouldn't have</i>
<i>a dragon tattoo on his arm.</i>

125
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,945
<i>Then, is he a gangster?</i>

126
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,032
<i>A thug? Or a local lowlife?</i>

127
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,291
Welcome, Han-gyul's uncle.

128
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,506
<i>Is that guy Han-gyul's uncle?</i>

129
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,551
Sorry to bother you.

130
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm here to see Mr. Hong Jung-pyo.

131
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,683
Oh, dear.

132
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,937
I'm afraid Mr. Hong had to take care
of something, so he left early.

133
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,688
Then I'll wait until tomorrow.

134
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,440
I've got plenty of time.

135
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,925
Goodness! Who do we have here?

136
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,886
Isn't this Han-gyul's uncle?

137
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,432
You were there?

138
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,520
I was busy with an urgent memo.
I'm sorry I didn't say hi sooner.

139
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,231
Welcome, Han-gyul's uncle.
I'm glad you're here.

140
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,692
What brings you to the school?

141
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,612
Apparently, Han-gyul

142
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,031
had been chosen
for the Filial Piety Award.

143
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,618
But he heard it was canceled

144
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,538
and asked Mr. Hong why this morning.

145
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,290
This is what Mr. Hong told him.

146
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,628
"A kid with no parents has no business
winning the Filial Piety Award."

147
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,014
So I came to have
a one-on-one talk with him.

148
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,849
Come on,

149
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,477
there's no way he actually said that.

150
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,020
Maybe Han-gyul exaggerated--

151
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,772
He would never say
anything like that to me.

152
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,733
I heard it from someone else.

153
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,985
Please calm down.

154
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,070
Coffee. Let's have some coffee.

155
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,199
Ms. Bom, a cup of coffee here, please?

156
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,458
Do you make
the female teachers fetch coffee?

157
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,503
Well, I feel like
I should offer you something.

158
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,172
I'll get my own coffee.

159
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,297
Beauty.

160
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:23,989
<i>Where are you?</i>

161
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,783
{\an8}<i>I haven't heard from you lately.</i>

162
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,464
You've got a real knack
for getting on my nerves.

163
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,174
Did I scare you?

164
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,511
I've been calling you, but
you didn't hear me and kept texting.

165
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,263
Do we have anything to talk about?

166
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,640
Some of us are having <i>tteokbokki,</i>

167
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,267
let's go together.

168
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,186
What's she saying? Is she coming?

169
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,479
Move your head, will you?

170
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,480
I can't see!

171
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,815
You move yours.

172
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,692
Who gave you permission to cut in line?

173
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,653
She's leaving.

174
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,407
- She's gone.
- I knew it.

175
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,366
I told you.

176
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,792
She said no?

177
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,003
Geez.

178
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:21,880
Hey.

179
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,090
You're a freshman. Why are you here?

180
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,635
Without me,
who else would manage your fan club?

181
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,846
I was hoping to eat with Choi Se-jin
for the first time.

182
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,931
Why didn't she want to come?

183
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,852
My existence.

184
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,480
I prefer eating with someone I like.

185
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,859
I don't want to ruin
my precious meal with your existence.

186
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,444
I hope you understand.

187
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,613
Your existence?

188
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,324
What did I tell you?

189
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,951
It should've been
my existence there from the start.

190
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,037
Anyway, I think
she's the only girl in school

191
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,330
who doesn't like you.

192
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,091
Hey, your uncle's at school.

193
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,926
What?

194
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,555
Han-gyul, I overheard
what Hong Jung-pyo said to you earlier.

195
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,475
I happened to mention
that your Filial Piety Award got canceled.

196
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,685
Gosh, dang it.

197
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,311
Han-gyul!

198
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,860
How about a cigarette instead of coffee?

199
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,654
Why don't we go by the wisterias

200
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,906
and smoke a cigarette? Sound good?

201
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,367
Are you seriously smoking at school?

202
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,535
Sorry?

203
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,913
What the hell?
Smoking where students study?

204
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,503
Oh, my goodness.

205
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,091
I was just joking.

206
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,053
Let me ask you something.

207
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,890
How is the Filial Piety Award decided?

208
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,184
Well, the thing is...

209
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,062
I know Han-gyul is always
a respectful kid and a nephew,

210
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,106
but by the usual definition,

211
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,235
the award is meant for a child
and the parents who raised them.

212
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,611
Pneumococcal vaccines.

213
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,780
How many times do you get them?

214
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,365
Pneumo...

215
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,033
There are four shots.

216
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,786
At two, four, six,

217
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,079
and twelve months old.

218
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,377
On September 30th, 2008,
Han-gyul had his third shot.

219
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,755
After that shot, he ran a high fever.

220
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,340
He burned up to 38.4 degrees Celsius.

221
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,843
The pharmacy was closed,
and I had no one to call.

222
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,470
I carried that tiny kid

223
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,138
and ran the whole 5 km to the ER.

224
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,390
That must've been tough.

225
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,809
When my twins got
their pneumococcal shots...

226
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,983
On December 28th, 2013,
Han-gyul lost his very first tooth.

227
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,320
On October 19th, 2014,
he rode a bike for the first time.

228
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,573
His first day of elementary school
was March 2nd, 2015.

229
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,950
March 4th, 2024,
was his first day of high school.

230
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,079
You all remember he delivered
the entrance oath as student rep, right?

231
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,080
Yes, sir.

232
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,044
So, tell me.

233
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:06,961
Sorry?

234
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,839
If not me, who's Han-gyul's parent?

235
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,385
Who else could it be?

236
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,181
<i>Is that what a gangster looks like</i>
<i>when he has logic?</i>

237
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,830
I can't believe he made that oath

238
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,707
for this stupid school
that treats people unfairly.

239
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,214
You seem busy,
so I'll just leave it at that, okay?

240
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,528
I can't live like this.

241
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,071
I just can't.

242
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,992
Mr. Hong, he left.

243
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,869
You can come out now.

244
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,084
That fool won't quit running his mouth.

245
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,503
I was aware Han-gyul

246
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,797
was living with his uncle
after his parents passed.

247
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,842
How can someone like him
be Han-gyul's uncle?

248
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,176
Is he maternal or paternal?

249
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,637
Are they really related?
Do they have the same genes?

250
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,264
What does he even do?

251
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,601
Wow, you sure know how to talk.

252
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,602
Tell me about it.

253
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,273
<i>What do you think he does?</i>

254
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,942
<i>He's obviously a gangster.</i>

255
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,739
Let's go!

256
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,407
Yes, boss!

257
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,209
<i>He's always surrounded by his gang,</i>

258
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,795
<i>doing who knows what.</i>

259
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,131
<i>What do you mean, "gangster"?</i>

260
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,466
<i>He's just a thug.</i>

261
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,596
<i>One time, I was drinking with some friends</i>
<i>at the local health center,</i>

262
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,431
<i>and he suddenly stormed in.</i>

263
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:27,936
Why are you here?

264
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,692
A whole goat?

265
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,530
I checked it for my kid today,
but the color looked so thin.

266
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,908
It only looks like half to me.

267
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,576
Well, black goat tonic

268
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,120
gets thicker or thinner
depending on the ingredients...

269
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,581
<i>If something rubs him the wrong way,</i>
<i>he smashes things.</i>

270
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,667
<i>That's nothing.</i>

271
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,754
<i>When we came back from hiking last time,</i>

272
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,890
<i>he was digging away that night,</i>

273
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,644
<i>sweating buckets</i>
<i>like he was burying a body.</i>

274
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,613
<i>I saw him too.</i>

275
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,659
<i>I saw my neighbor's car.</i>

276
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,098
He was lifting it up like this.

277
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,601
He lifted the car?

278
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,478
- Yes.
- With his bare hands?

279
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,521
Yes.

280
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,731
Lifting a car is nothing.

281
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,525
When he's mad,
he could even smash the whole world.

282
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,820
<i>I feel humiliated</i>
<i>that I was convinced by his logic</i>

283
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,196
<i>even for a moment.</i>

284
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,243
I heard that Han-gyul lost his parents
when he was little

285
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,037
and was raised by his uncle,

286
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,372
never even knowing
what his parents looked like.

287
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,469
- Is everything okay?
- Hey.

288
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,431
Does this look okay to you?

289
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,561
He's got nothing better to do
than come and wreck school property?

290
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,188
Tell him to stop coming to school!

291
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,814
That's enough.

292
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,740
I didn't tell my uncle
because I knew he'd overreact.

293
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,116
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,535
What needs to be done needs to be done.

295
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,373
Once something's buried,
it's tough to dig it up later.

296
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,422
Everything's fine, so don't worry.

297
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,906
READY-MADE CURRY

298
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,499
<i>Sweetheart, where are you?</i>

299
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,626
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

300
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,131
<i>I made your favorite chicken soup, Bom.</i>

301
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,524
{\an8}<i>I wish</i>

302
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,902
{\an8}<i>I could enjoy it with my daughter.</i>

303
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,113
{\an8}<i>Whatever the reason,</i>

304
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,241
{\an8}<i>I shouldn't have said that to you.</i>

305
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,492
{\an8}<i>Ms. Seo, are you home?</i>

306
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,744
{\an8}<i>I need a spare key.</i>

307
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,209
Yikes.

308
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,222
What's wrong with the streetlights?

309
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:34,885
<i>It's that guy.</i>

310
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,979
<i>What is that?</i>

311
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,236
<i>What do you think he does?</i>

312
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,529
<i>He's obviously a gangster.</i>

313
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,990
<i>He was digging away that night,</i>
<i>sweating buckets...</i>

314
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,076
<i>If something rubs him the wrong way,</i>
<i>he smashes things.</i>

315
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,573
Were you trying to call the cops?

316
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,369
Please don't kill me.

317
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,122
I can't die now.
There's too much left unresolved.

318
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,790
If I had to die, better in Seoul.

319
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,458
At least I'd get a decent funeral.

320
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,545
If I end up dying here
after cutting off my parents and friends,

321
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,713
no one would come to my funeral.

322
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,384
Plus, getting stabbed to death
on a country road?

323
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,845
There would be
a lot of grim talk at the funeral.

324
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,306
What do you mean, stabbed?

325
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,311
- With this?
- Oh, no!

326
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,990
A 30 cm spicy chicken skewer.

327
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,159
Near the dental clinic
at Shinsu Intersection.

328
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,093
I didn't know about your tastes.

329
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,053
I had no idea you were
into chicken skewers.

330
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,891
You were running down an empty street
at night with that in your tattooed arm.

331
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,110
I got it as a gift from the gas station
since I'm a regular.

332
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,362
One shouldn't throw away a gift.

333
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:46,869
I just moved from Seoul,
so I'm not familiar with the area.

334
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,206
Well then, take care.

335
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,169
Is that your place?

336
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,006
Go on inside. It's not safe outside.

337
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,842
No.

338
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,178
You go ahead. The door's kind of broken.

339
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,067
I'll sort it out,
so please don't worry about it.

340
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,402
No.

341
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,071
This isn't my place, it's rented.

342
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,656
I'd have to pay for the damage.

343
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,702
No, don't do it.

344
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,135
Wait, stop!

345
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,381
I heard the sauce is what makes it good.

346
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,226
I'm leaving

347
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,979
before this skewer gets cold.

348
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,941
But you'll definitely

349
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,071
pay for your mistake.

350
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,123
Crap, I'm late.

351
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,921
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD

352
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,301
FILIAL PIETY AWARD

353
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,065
Is Uncle not back yet?

354
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,192
He's not picking up again.

355
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,992
- What took you so long?
- Did you get reported again?

356
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,745
Here. I'm so hot.

357
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,831
I don't need to eat it.

358
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,959
Why'd you run to town
in the middle of the night?

359
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,921
This is it.

360
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,256
My favorite spicy chicken skewer.

361
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,592
Thanks, Uncle.

362
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,054
You like it that much?

363
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,269
Boss,

364
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,522
I'm pretty sure
there isn't a speck of dust.

365
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,941
You wiped it before going
to get the chicken skewer.

366
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,280
"Filial Piety Award, Sun Han-gyul."

367
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,617
"This student is hereby awarded
this certificate

368
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:16,995
for exemplary filial piety and respect
for elders, serving as a role model

369
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,497
for others."

370
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,875
- Phillip.
- Yes?

371
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,295
Out of all these awards,
this one's my favorite.

372
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,673
Have I ever told you?

373
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,634
Ever since he was a kid,
Han-gyul has won tons of awards.

374
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,303
I used small awards
as trivets for hot bowls,

375
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,221
and silver medals--

376
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,807
"To prop up wobbly dressers."

377
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:38,642
Have I told you?

378
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,935
- Yes.
- Yeah.

379
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,396
Sometimes you rephrase it to say

380
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,358
they were used
for wobbly bookshelves or beds.

381
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,070
What was your homeroom teacher's name?

382
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,322
I told you, it's Yoon Bom.

383
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,199
Yoon Bom.

384
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,993
She's from Seoul, right?

385
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,495
Uncle.

386
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,790
Whoever my homeroom teacher is,
don't worry about school stuff.

387
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:02,875
I'll manage it myself.

388
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,003
When you tell me not to worry,
that's when I worry the most.

389
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,256
A kid needs to act up sometimes
to make raising them worthwhile.

390
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,300
If I didn't care about you at all,

391
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,261
how could I even deserve these?

392
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,347
Okay.

393
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,850
From now on,
I'm going to say whatever I want

394
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,310
and ask for whatever I want,

395
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,519
so you have to say yes.

396
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,605
Sure, whatever you want.

397
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,607
I'd bury or stab anyone.

398
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,026
Hell, I'd even kill if you said the word.

399
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,736
Come on, Uncle!

400
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,696
Eat that. I'll go take out the trash.

401
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,656
Let's go, Phillip.

402
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,074
Sure.

403
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,125
Boss.

404
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,087
Did someone report you?

405
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,715
With that car damage incident before,

406
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,091
you can't get reported again.

407
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,635
I didn't get reported,

408
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,013
- but I got ignored.
- Ignored?

409
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,935
She really didn't recognize me.

410
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,114
Beauty.

411
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,038
She made the mistake
of not recognizing me today.

412
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,582
I'll make her pay for that somehow.

413
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,841
What are you looking at?

414
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,300
Phillip.

415
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,053
Cherry blossoms have bloomed.

416
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,306
I guess spring is here.

417
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,851
You've never liked spring.

418
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,062
You said nothing beats
the coolness of winter

419
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,647
and spring just makes you itchy.

420
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:52,860
Let's see

421
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,445
if I start liking spring.

422
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,372
PURE SPIRIT BRIGHT DREAMS
SHINSU HIGH

423
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,041
MOTTO
SWEAT NOW, CRY LESS LATER

424
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,044
- Hey.
- What?

425
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,588
I'm sure you all know

426
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,590
that parent-teacher conferences happen

427
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,927
right after midterms, correct?

428
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,642
<i>Dae-han and Min-guk,</i>
<i>with their parent in the staff room.</i>

429
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,814
TOTAL SCORE, NUMBER OF STUDENTS, GRADE

430
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,318
<i>Se-jin, whose parent is the governor.</i>

431
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,828
<i>And Han-gyul, whose guardian</i>
<i>is out for revenge.</i>

432
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,126
Ms. Yoon, is my little brother
in last place?

433
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,712
We came out of the same womb,
why are you acting older?

434
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,339
Who was last on the last mock test?

435
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,507
Quiet.

436
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,679
You all know
parent-teacher conferences start

437
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,805
right after midterms?

438
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:45,764
Yes, ma'am.

439
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,850
I'll reach out to parents
to set up dates from today.

440
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:49,810
Ms. Yoon.

441
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,479
Parents don't have to attend, right?

442
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,524
What are you talking about? They have to.

443
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,985
But Han-gyul's parents aren't coming.

444
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,780
That's because Han-gyul...

445
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,289
Let's talk about this later, okay?

446
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,634
Ms. Yoon.

447
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,386
Please?

448
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,015
It's not like you don't have parents.

449
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,683
It's basically like not having them.

450
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,519
As you know, my dad

451
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,230
has got his hands full
with his re-election campaign.

452
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,691
- What about your mom?
- She's even busier

453
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,109
because of the campaign work.

454
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,653
In that case,

455
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,657
I'll adjust to your parents' schedule.

456
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,409
All right?

457
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,787
A daughter shouldn't stand
in the way of her parents.

458
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,211
I'm sure you know what it's like

459
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,214
to live under your parents' name.

460
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,929
Push back the meeting by a few days.

461
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:14,728
<i>No, that can't be.</i>

462
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,772
<i>There's no way she'd know.</i>

463
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:21,568
Sure, I'll look up info
on art school applications

464
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,195
and go over it during the meeting.

465
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,198
Sure, 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday.

466
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,325
I'll see you then. Thank you.

467
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,919
{\an8}SUN HAN-GYUL, 2ND YEAR, CLASS 1, NO. 11
GUARDIAN: SUN JAE-GYU, UNCLE

468
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,754
{\an8}<i>You'll definitely</i>

469
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,507
pay for your mistake.

470
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,640
Try to schedule a meeting
with Han-gyul's uncle

471
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,100
for the latest date possible.

472
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,937
Keep dragging it out
and make it through the end of the week.

473
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,606
No way.

474
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,733
Ms. Bom would never do that.

475
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:05,320
She's been in Seoul for six years
and has met all kinds of parents.

476
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,489
Why would she be scared
to put off the meeting?

477
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,406
Am I right?

478
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,326
See? She said I'm right.

479
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,830
Do you know what this is?

480
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,292
This is the scar Sun Jae-gyu gave me.

481
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,337
He slashed me
with a piece of glass this big!

482
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,341
You just don't know what he's capable of.

483
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:30,387
Last time, he let it slide
because the female teachers were watching.

484
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,264
But meeting with him alone?

485
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,642
Who knows what he'll do or how he'll turn?

486
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm staying out of this.
Handle it yourself.

487
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,730
Even a lowlife wouldn't treat

488
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,941
his nephew's homeroom teacher like that.

489
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,694
And it's not like
Ms. Bom made a mistake with him

490
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,821
the way someone else did.

491
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:48,947
Here we go again.

492
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:51,783
Listen.

493
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,662
The more you delay this,
the harder it gets.

494
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,706
Go on, pick up the phone.

495
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,207
Fine, call him.

496
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,585
He's likely picking on people
for money at a market.

497
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,634
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:10,552
Boss.

499
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,981
Who's the owner here?

500
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,942
You can't just show up like this.

501
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,903
We talked on the phone already.

502
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,071
I promised we'd pay you back next month.

503
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,909
Ma'am, we're not that kind of people.

504
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,751
Do you accept groups?

505
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,419
Sorry?

506
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,795
What's the current situation?

507
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,505
How much <i>tteokbokki </i>is left here?

508
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,799
Is there enough for all of us?

509
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,969
Honey, no more customers today.

510
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,054
Yes, we have enough.

511
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,805
Have a seat.

512
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,807
Let's take a seat.

513
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:58,725
Yes, sir.

514
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,861
This is our first meal since last year's
pork bone soup place, right?

515
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,363
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

516
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,281
I did an enema just so I could eat this.

517
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,033
Take your time picking.

518
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:15,951
Yes, ma'am!

519
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,786
Why do you keep following me?

520
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,544
Who's calling at lunchtime?

521
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,090
Well, I'm...

522
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,343
I'm Yoon Bom, Han-gyul's homeroom teacher.

523
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,594
Hey.

524
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:37,973
Is that so?

525
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,016
Yes, it is.

526
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,436
I'm calling to ask
when you'd be available

527
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,315
for the parent-teacher conference.

528
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,734
- I'm on my way now.
- Right now?

529
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,194
He's coming now?

530
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:53,071
Mr. Hong, Ms. Jeong, pack your bags.

531
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,698
If I run, I'll get there soon.

532
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,116
I can eat later.

533
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,369
I'm scared. Let's get out.

534
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,080
No, you can't come right now.

535
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,792
I just called today to schedule a time.

536
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,960
I believe it's best

537
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,421
if I go through what Han-gyul wrote first

538
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,630
and have a meeting later.

539
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,215
I'll have to wait.

540
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,143
Yes, how about 4:00 p.m. next Monday?

541
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,104
What do you like?

542
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:27,731
Sorry?

543
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,691
If there's nothing, I'll bring whatever.

544
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,528
Sure, I'll see you next Monday...

545
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:35,780
Go ahead and order.

546
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,619
Ms. Bom.

547
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,997
Brace yourself.

548
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,541
We're only halfway through the semester.

549
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,377
To manage the whole year,
you've got to hold your ground.

550
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,422
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

551
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,723
Oh, my goodness. This is bad.

552
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,059
So,

553
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:08,980
you got caught trying
to report Han-gyul's uncle?

554
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,192
I have to stay strong.

555
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,737
If something happens at this school too,
I have nowhere to go.

556
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,156
And now I've been told
I'll pay for my mistake.

557
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,075
I knew it.

558
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,119
You got into big trouble in Seoul
and came here, right?

559
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,954
What kind of trouble was it?

560
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,875
How should I deal with him?

561
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,710
Is there a way I can win?

562
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,713
Has anyone ever beaten him?

563
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,049
Who in this town could ever beat him...

564
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:37,926
- Yes, there is.
- Really?

565
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,095
Yes, I've seen it once.

566
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,806
Han-gyul's uncle didn't make a sound

567
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,683
and completely froze
at that person's words.

568
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,397
I'd like to meet that person.

569
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,736
Wow, this is tasty.

570
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,243
Someone here can beat him?

571
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,954
Order first.
I'll have the spicy squid and pork.

572
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,998
One spicy squid and pork
and a soft tofu stew, please.

573
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,960
Please make the tofu stew mild,
and skip the green onions.

574
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,212
And a smaller serving of rice--

575
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,424
Are you seriously
out of your freaking mind?

576
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:20,927
Don't test me,
I'll knock your teeth right out.

577
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,096
I'm working my butt off,
and you pull that crap?

578
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,806
I'll slam that stupid mouth shut.

579
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,142
You take what you get.

580
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,477
Some scrawny little thing
shows up, acting picky

581
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,229
and demanding this and that? Please.

582
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,190
I'll slap your cheeks off your face.

583
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,025
I'm not serving you.

584
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,777
Eat spicy squid and pork

585
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,821
or stop yapping and get lost.

586
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,115
Get lost.

587
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,409
Two spicy squid and pork.

588
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,662
Damn it, today's rough.

589
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,167
Han-gyul's uncle couldn't have
soft tofu stew

590
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,252
and had to eat spicy squid and pork.

591
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,796
You think you can do it? Give it a try.

592
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,469
"Some scrawny little thing
shows up, acting picky

593
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,138
and demanding this and that? Please."

594
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,307
"I'll slam that stupid mouth shut."

595
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,851
What the hell? Are you kidding me?

596
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,229
How are you going to beat him
when you're this soft?

597
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,607
I'm not built for this.
I don't think it'll work.

598
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,526
Maybe we should try a different approach.

599
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:20,403
Then, Ms. Bom.

600
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,907
Let's go back to square one

601
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,118
and revisit what it means to be a teacher.

602
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:33,541
Right now, I'm thinking
of a true educator of our time.

603
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,336
Someone who left
a lasting legacy in education,

604
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,880
earned the nation's admiration,

605
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,884
and carries an unmatched dignity
and presence.

606
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,055
Who could that be...

607
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,016
DAMAGED HAIR TREATMENT MASK

608
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,054
Exactly, this is exactly
how you should look.

609
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:33,893
Ms. Seo, this isn't
the approach I had in mind.

610
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:37,772
I was thinking of something
more strategic, logical, and reasonable...

611
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,690
Ms. Bom.

612
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:42,485
This style commands such authority

613
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,029
that even Gangnam parents
tremble in respect.

614
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,031
Trust me on this one.

615
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:51,619
- Is it too tight?
- Yes.

616
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,705
Loosen it a bit.

617
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,457
I don't think I can do it.

618
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,728
{\an8}MEETING WITH HAN-GYUL'S UNCLE

619
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,063
11TH GRADE

620
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,296
Ms. Yoon, is today your birthday?

621
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,049
You've always worn
bright black, dark black,

622
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,967
dull black, or light black.

623
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,510
Why are you dressed like that?

624
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,806
There's a line in the <i>Art of War by Wuzi.</i>

625
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,977
"Treat righteous forces with respect,

626
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,937
and powerful forces with humility."

627
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,275
In other words,
you treat honorable forces with respect,

628
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,029
but when dealing with bullies
who think strength is everything,

629
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,616
you start by lowering yourself.

630
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:17,789
In other words, I chose to win by losing.

631
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,541
Are you going off to a fight?

632
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,257
<i>Ethics and Philosophy</i>, page 35.

633
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,467
"Humanity is something

634
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,303
that humans..."

635
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,353
Good luck, Ms. Bom.

636
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,897
- Sorry I have to go.
- Prepare yourself.

637
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,774
Are you all leaving already?

638
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,234
Ms. Seo!

639
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,361
You've got this.

640
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,446
Ms. Seo.

641
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,993
Han-gyul, you heard
your uncle's coming today, right?

642
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:57,537
Yes, I did.

643
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,414
Then stay for a little while.

644
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,708
You can go with your uncle
after the meeting.

645
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,002
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

646
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,879
"What needs to be done needs to be done."

647
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,841
Good luck.

648
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,551
Wish me luck.

649
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,988
I'm switching off my ego

650
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,032
starting now.

651
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,996
No matter what happens, stay polite.

652
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,750
No matter what you hear, stay calm.

I'm busy at the moment, so keep it brief.

Actress Jeong Nan-hee.

662
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,537
I may be the head of your fan cafe,

663
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,789
but are you going
to make me work this hard?

664
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:06,749
You need help?

665
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,210
Am I the kind of guy who helps anyone?

666
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,004
One moment.

667
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,511
Thank you.

668
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,310
You do know I'm rude and selfish.

669
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,481
Thank you.

670
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:36,153
I'll meet you out of loyalty.

671
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,321
Let's talk later.

672
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,365
I'm hanging up. Bye.

673
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,325
Attorney Choi.

674
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,872
Mr. Choi, the plaintiff,
has submitted his complaint.

675
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,752
You should've sued that jerk sooner.

676
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,588
Why've you been holding off until now?

677
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,673
There's assault, damages from theft,

678
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,799
and breach of contract.

679
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:58,384
Right.

680
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,094
The defendant's address is unknown.

681
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:06,726
If we submit it like this, the court will
order us to correct the address.

682
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,605
Then we can check it at the local office.

683
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,774
Then we can find out where he lives.

684
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,613
Wait a minute. So are you saying
you filed the complaint

685
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,657
to find out where he lives?

686
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:22,575
Why?

687
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,412
I really didn't want to use this tactic

688
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,581
since it felt underhanded. But...

689
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:34,086
I've been searching for ten years,
ever since I became a lawyer.

690
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,923
I've gone everywhere I could think of

691
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,508
and checked every place he might be.

692
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,605
<i>But he's nowhere.</i>

693
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:54,899
It's like

694
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:58,569
he never even existed to begin with.

695
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,989
There's no trace of him at all.

696
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,494
That's weird.

697
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,829
If he's still nowhere to be found,

698
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,456
could he be dead?

699
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,710
- No, he can't.
- No, he can't.

700
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,380
Do you know why I'm always fully dressed

701
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,590
in a wrinkle-free shirt,

702
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:23,260
spotless dress shoes,
and a silk tie that screams success?

703
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,804
Gosh, I know the answer.

704
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,348
You never know where you'll meet a woman.

705
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:31,435
Because I don't know
when and where I'll run into that jerk.

706
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,898
I'll carve it into his memory.

707
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:37,483
"Look."

708
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,361
"Even after you're gone,
my life is brilliant."

709
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,864
"Feel it. Your life turned out that way

710
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,325
because you betrayed me."

711
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,035
You know what?

712
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,371
I just saw in your eyes

713
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,373
a kind of madness that comes with success.

714
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,418
He has to

715
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:57,378
see it too.

716
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,965
He picked the wrong person to mess with.

717
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,801
{\an8}PLAINTIFF CHOI I-JUN

718
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,679
DEFENDANT SUN JAE-GYU
ADDRESS UNAVAILABLE

719
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,100
<i>So please be alive, Sun Jae-gyu.</i>

720
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,728
<i>Wait until</i>

721
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,063
<i>I find you.</i>

722
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:26,866
SUN JAE-GYU

723
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,512
It's great to meet you properly.

724
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,222
I'm Yoon Bom, Han-gyul's teacher.

725
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:51,891
Hi. Here.

726
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,312
Sorry, but I'm not allowed
to accept gifts.

727
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,189
It's not a gift, it's compensation.

728
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,149
The staff room plant broke because of me.

729
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,067
I see.

730
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,027
No way.

731
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,820
Your hands could break too.

732
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,866
Over there.

733
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,327
- Please put it down over there.
- Sure.

734
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,875
MAY SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL BECOME RICH

735
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,589
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

736
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:31,889
It's too small.

737
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,895
Let's start the meeting.

738
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,399
We should do this face-to-face.

739
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:43,692
No, that's not necessary.

740
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,114
Well...

741
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,783
I saw the counseling form, and it says

742
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,786
Han-gyul doesn't plan on going to college.

743
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:54,995
You're from Seoul, right?

744
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,456
I'm half Seoul-born.

745
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,292
- Half?
- Yes.

746
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,045
My mom's from Seoul.

747
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,881
I grew up hearing the Seoul dialect,
so I can speak it well.

748
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,133
I see.

749
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,929
Hi, I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

750
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,515
Do you want to be my friend?

751
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,854
I sound like someone
straight from Seoul, right?

752
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,856
I speak two languages, bilingual.

753
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,651
I see.

754
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,156
But in my opinion,

755
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,701
given his grades, I just can't understand
why he wouldn't go to college.

756
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,579
If he's not interested in college,
finishing high school will do.

757
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:41,959
As you know, our school's college
admission rate wasn't great last year,

758
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,837
and the school
has high expectations for Han-gyul.

759
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,463
He knows what to do about that.

760
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,049
How's he with his friends?

761
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,302
Does he respect the teachers?

762
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,304
No doubt about it.

763
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,264
His friends and younger students
follow him,

764
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,850
and the girls follow him
a little too much.

765
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:00,227
That's great.

766
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,937
That's all I needed to hear.

767
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:02,855
So,

768
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,150
let's focus on academics
rather than his social interactions.

769
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,109
How old are you?

770
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,574
You keep asking personal questions.

771
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,743
In a parent-teacher meeting,
that kind of...

772
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:16,702
Last name, Yoon?

773
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,163
A one-syllable name?

774
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,583
Yoon is your last name,
and Bom is your first?

775
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,043
Yes.

776
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,846
If you look
at Han-gyul's report card, his grades...

777
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,183
His grades...

778
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:40,893
Here, his grades...

779
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,735
Bom.

780
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,201
{\an8}Boss!

781
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,121
{\an8}<i>Who eats tofu outside a police station</i>
<i>this early in the morning?</i>

782
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,039
{\an8}<i>What a killer view.</i>

783
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:45,833
{\an8}<i>Why are you peeking at me?</i>

784
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,834
{\an8}<i>I'm busted.</i>

785
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,043
{\an8}Wanna go watch a movie?

786
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,795
{\an8}<i>You're dying to have coffee with me.</i>

787
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,964
{\an8}Exchange teacher? What's that?

788
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,424
{\an8}She's going back to Seoul.

789
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:54,925
{\an8}What? When? Why?

790
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,220
{\an8}<i>Where's Han-gyul?</i>

791
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,389
{\an8}<i>- Seoul.</i>
<i>- Are you sure he's here?</i>

792
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,808
<i>I'm on my way. Wait right there.</i>

793
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,942
