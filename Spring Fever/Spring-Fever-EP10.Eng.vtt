{\an8}EPISODE 10

2
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.910
{\an8}<i>Recalculating route.</i>

3
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.828
{\an8}Hey. Hey!

4
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:19.997
{\an8}Darn it.

5
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.794
{\an8}Where on earth does Bom live
that even the GPS is confused?

6
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.766
{\an8}44-5 HAEEUN-GIL, SHINSU-EUP, JUAN-GUN

7
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:43.646
{\an8}Is it that one?

8
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.584
What on earth?

9
00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:07.711
It's so slow.

10
00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:13.592
Gosh.

11
00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:19.390
Why is it going so slow?

12
00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.475
This will take forever.

13
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.865
All right.

14
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.368
Shall we get up?

15
00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.541
Oh, no. What do I do?

16
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.975
This is bad.

17
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.316
That darn brat Yoon Bom!
She'll be the end of me!

18
00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.487
God, please help me.

19
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.823
If you let me live,

20
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.994
I will forgive my daughter and my haters.

21
00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:24.538
If you're too busy to come save me,

22
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.668
please send someone reliable
in your stead.

23
00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:01.742
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

24
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.709
What is your name?

25
00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:20.844
Goodness.

26
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:30.729
Thank you so much for saving me.

27
00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:33.899
By the way,

28
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.112
I'm asking just in case.
Do you know who I…

29
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.699
You're actress Jeong Nan-hee.
What brought you to the countryside?

30
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:42.992
Oh, my.

31
00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:45.786
So you knew.
I thought you might not recognize me.

32
00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:48.998
My high school friend…

33
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.918
Someone I knew was a huge fan of yours.

34
00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:57.297
We were together all the time,
so I watched your movies a lot.

35
00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.342
I thought it'd make you uncomfortable
if I recognized you.

36
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.261
That's why.

37
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.683
You're incredibly strong,
not to mention incredibly thoughtful.

38
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.101
Please.

39
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:13.981
You see, I came here to find someone.

40
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.650
I don't think you can.

41
00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:21.196
The suspension is broken.

42
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.158
My, my.

43
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:26.827
Put these on.

44
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.539
As soon as the car's fixed,
they'll call you.

45
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.166
Please, come in.

46
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.961
I'm not sure
if I should inconvenience you like this.

47
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:39.923
You see, rumors spread faster in Shinsu
than they do on the Internet.

48
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:43.177
Besides, you're a celebrity.
Where would you go?

49
00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.555
- Then I'll accept the offer.
- Sure.

50
00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:54.438
FILIAL PIETY AWARD

51
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.194
Who are you really?

52
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:05.282
You're strong and thoughtful.
And you've raised your son really well.

53
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.287
Han-gyul's received so many awards
since he was little,

54
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.664
I use small awards
as trivets for hot bowls,

55
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:17.169
and silver medals to prop up
wobbly dressers. You know?

56
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.094
I guess you haven't eaten.

57
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:26.637
Right.

58
00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:29.681
I have some <i>gaengsigi </i>porridge.

59
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:34.269
Do you want some <i>jeongguji </i>pancakes
with a side of <i>jaeraegi?</i>

60
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:36.563
That's so rhythmic.

61
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.775
I didn't understand any of that.

62
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.196
But the way you say it is so poetic.

63
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.002
<i>Hello?</i>

64
00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.422
You got home safe, right?

65
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.051
I was wondering
what time you'll come for Bom-sik.

66
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.721
I'm sorry, but I have a guest at home.

67
00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.229
I understand.

68
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.566
Then I'll stop by after school.

69
00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.443
<i>It's delicious.</i>
<i>What's the secret behind the flavor?</i>

70
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.155
Who is that?

71
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.448
It was a woman's voice.

72
00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:37.124
Can you recommend things to do
on a first date?

73
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.544
<i>Wow, a first date. That's so exciting.</i>

74
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.965
<i>How about doing something casual</i>
<i>like going to the movies?</i>

75
00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:49.511
<i>Want to go to the movies?</i>
<i>Is there anything you want to watch?</i>

76
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.013
The movies?

77
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.686
What does it mean if a man asks
to go to the movies on a first date?

78
00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.730
<i>Asking you to go to the movies</i>

79
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.357
<i>may sound like something casual,</i>

80
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:05.277
<i>but he could have other intentions.</i>

81
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.615
<i>For instance, using the dark theater</i>
<i>as an excuse for physical contact.</i>

82
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.492
Physical contact?

83
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.828
<i>How about </i>A Killer's Dinner?

84
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.955
<i>A Killer's Dinner?</i>

85
00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.667
She wants to watch a horror movie.

86
00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:23.587
<i>Wow, that's a good sign.</i>

87
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.423
<i>If she wants to watch a horror movie,</i>
<i>it might mean</i>

88
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.968
<i>she wants to see</i>
<i>if you're reliable and considerate</i>

89
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:32.179
- <i>in a scary situation.</i>
- Considerate?

90
00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.348
Reliable?

91
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.103
<i>I'll buy the tickets. You just come.</i>

92
00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.438
"You just come"?

93
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.317
He sounds so enthusiastic.

94
00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:49.238
What's he thinking of doing
on a first date?

95
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.714
What are you listening to?

96
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:09.424
Oh, nothing.

97
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.224
What? Did the guest leave?

98
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.184
The gate is open.

99
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.773
Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

100
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.859
Let's go.

101
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.289
Bom-sik, how about we surprise Daddy?

102
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.671
Jae-gyu!

103
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:48.964
Oh, my!

104
00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:50.966
Oh, my!

105
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.011
Mom.

106
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.889
What's going on?
Why are you in this house?

107
00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.184
That's what I should ask you.
Why are you here, Mom?

108
00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:04.438
Hold on.

109
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.982
Is that man the one you're seeing?

110
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.608
Did you hire a PI or something?

111
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.112
How on earth did you know
who I'm seeing and where he lives?

112
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.072
God, you're such a terrible daughter.

113
00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:17.284
You may hate me,
but I came all the way here to see you.

114
00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.369
Shouldn't you hold back your anger?

115
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.999
I held back and buried it,

116
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.001
like you told me to.

117
00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:31.923
Since actress Jeong Nan-hee's life
is greater than a teacher's life.

118
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.845
As a lowly daughter, I didn't want to harm
your perfect career as an actress,

119
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.308
so I did as you said,
knowing it would ruin my life.

120
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:47.272
And by doing that, I believe I did
more than enough as a daughter.

121
00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.068
So, please,
let's live our own lives from now on.

122
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.158
This is for the ticket I asked for.

123
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.494
Thank you for your help.

124
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.456
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

125
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.708
My goodness.

126
00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:09.753
I guess I missed a fun sight
while checking on the car.

127
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.381
I see that you two already met.

128
00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.967
The bill's settled, so please leave.

129
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.345
My own daughter's worse than the haters.

130
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.347
Saying that to your mom.

131
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.057
"Mom"?

132
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.477
"Mom"?

133
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:31.316
So are you saying your daughter...

134
00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.986
is Ms. Bom? Is that it?

135
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:37.697
Oh, my goodness.

136
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:41.034
I had no idea. I just helped you
because your car broke down.

137
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:43.787
Let me greet you properly.

138
00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:45.747
I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

139
00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:55.048
How could you meet a guy like this
in a nowhere town?

140
00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:57.217
Ms. Jeong.

141
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.303
Just earlier, you called me your hero,

142
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.055
saying I was a hidden gem

143
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.601
who was well-built, thoughtful,
and poetic in the way I spoke.

144
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.981
That was when you were just a stranger.

145
00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:17.070
Could you tell me
what you don't like about me specifically?

146
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.531
First of all, you have a kid.

147
00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.324
He's my nephew.

148
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.161
You're more dad-like than most.

149
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.330
Plus, your muscles are too big.

150
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.623
I'll lose some of them.

151
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.584
And I can't understand your dialect.

152
00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.503
My mother was from Seoul, so…

153
00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.965
Hello. I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

154
00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.929
I can speak
in a Seoul accent if I want to.

155
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.265
In any case, I don't like your face.

156
00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.517
Your outfit and hairstyle too.

157
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:50.645
I told you to leave.

158
00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.022
Ms. Bom.

159
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.356
I'm going.

160
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.942
Geez.

161
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.199
Now I've paid you for the food
and for letting me sleep here,

162
00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.160
so no malicious comments online. Okay?

163
00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:10.457
Ms. Jeong.

164
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.292
How can I take this?

165
00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.627
If you follow her out,

166
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.379
we're through.

167
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.965
But…

168
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.610
Still, how could you come to my office?

169
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.488
What if Ms. Bom finds out
about you and me?

170
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.324
Since it's come to this, I don't care.

171
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:46.910
What about me?

172
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:51.122
What if she finds out
that I've been in touch with you?

173
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.542
She'll be furious.

174
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:57.087
She made a fuss,
asking who told me where she lives.

175
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.507
You should leave.

176
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.802
If she sees us here like this,
she'll only get more hurt.

177
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.596
Don't you see how I'm hurt?

178
00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:10.725
You're the president
of The Chronicles of Nan-hee, my fancafe,

179
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.894
not Yoon Bom's.

180
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.690
Don't worry about anything else,

181
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.192
and tell me who he is and what he does.

182
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.652
In every detail.

183
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:26.658
He's your archenemy.

184
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.369
You said he ran off with your money.

185
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.122
Just what happened between you two?

186
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.845
What happened?

187
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:48.680
Did he beat you again?

188
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.227
If I stayed home,
one of two things would happen, so I left.

189
00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:59.608
Either he'd end up killing me…

190
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.821
or I'd end up killing him.

191
00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.409
That would never happen.

192
00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.078
Because…

193
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.291
I'll help you escape from your father.

194
00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.883
And how will you do that?

195
00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.513
I haven't heard from my sister,

196
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.350
and Han-gyul can't even walk yet.

197
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.769
And I have no money
even if I did want to run away.

198
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.533
You…

199
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.411
Did you steal it?

200
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.416
Where did you get so much money?

201
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.168
<i>Honey.</i>

202
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.420
He came in first on every midterm exam.

203
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:03.838
Look. Here.

204
00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:04.923
- Here.
- Really?

205
00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:06.925
Dad.

206
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.595
You promised to buy me a car
if I got into Hanguk University.

207
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.224
With these grades, I'm sure I'll get in.

208
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.350
Can I get the money

209
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.603
for the car in advance?

210
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.235
Answer my question.

211
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.196
Where did you get so much money?

212
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.573
Buddy.

213
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.327
I earned this fair and square,
so don't worry,

214
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.913
and study hard.

215
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:41.626
This is enough for your tuition.

216
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:49.509
Are you telling me to go to college?

217
00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.556
If we go to college in Seoul,
we can do whatever we want.

218
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.852
I can escape from my father...

219
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.440
and you from yours.

220
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.911
<i>This is terrible.</i>
<i>I hear Jae-gyu's house is on fire.</i>

221
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:20.206
<i>There are fire trucks and police cars.</i>
<i>It's total chaos.</i>

222
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.091
Oh, no. It looks like
the father didn't make it.

223
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.599
What about Jae-gyu?

224
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.351
What about Sun Jae-gyu, the son?

225
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.645
- He must've run off.
- Watch what you say.

226
00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.439
You don't know what happened.

227
00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:49.819
The father comes home wasted every day
and beats the son up.

228
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.405
So how can he be in his right mind?

229
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:53.740
I wouldn't put up with it.

230
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.785
Are you saying the son ran off
after setting the house on fire?

231
00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.998
You're a Haechon High student, right?
Do you know Sun Jae-gyu?

232
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.086
Hey!

233
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.008
Hey!

234
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:36.241
What is it? What happened between you two?

235
00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.081
Go.

236
00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:47.585
I'm sure you're rich enough to call a cab
or even a chopper to go home.

237
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:51.047
I won't.

238
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.507
Why not?

239
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.509
If you won't tell me,
I'll find out myself.

240
00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:56.636
I cleared my schedule anyway.

241
00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.974
While I'm here, I'll find out what kind
of person that Sun Jae-gyu guy really is.

242
00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.942
Listen. It's true
that I approached you on purpose,

243
00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.528
but I wasn't lying about how I felt.

244
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.322
When I'm with you,
I have fun and feel happy and…

245
00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.410
I get butterflies.

246
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.704
You're disturbing my workout. Leave.

247
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:26.958
I mean, if I didn't, why would I spend
my time and money meeting you?

248
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:30.086
We were both lonely,
so let's say we made a mistake

249
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.379
and part ways now.

250
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.673
Master, what do I do next?

251
00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.508
Dump him. No, I mean...

252
00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.677
We'll do a technical stand up.

253
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.936
Hye-suk, I don't want to part ways.

254
00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.398
I know we didn't get off to a good start,

255
00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:54.068
but we can build a good relationship
since we rely on each other.

256
00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.361
Do that with me.

257
00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.947
Pardon? Do what?

258
00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.532
Build a good relationship.

259
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.160
There's no one waiting
for me at home either.

260
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.912
I'm bored, so this is nice.

261
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.456
On weekends, let's go to an amusement park

262
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.749
and go to the movies.

263
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.835
What… Why would I go
to the movies with you?

264
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.086
If you don't like that,

265
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.797
- how about my place?
- Your place?

266
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.716
How about tonight? Want to come over

267
00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.218
and have <i>ramyeon </i>with me?

268
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:20.845
No. Gosh.

269
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:25.391
Well, I'm intermittent fasting right now.

270
00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.435
Well, then. Goodbye.

271
00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.281
Why are you following me?

272
00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.034
I'm just walking you home.

273
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.911
Why would you?

274
00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.666
Because I'm worried
that jerk might bother you again.

275
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.253
Do you have feelings for me?

276
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.422
What do you mean?

277
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.967
Let me make it clear.

278
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.594
There won't be any more men in my life.

279
00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.472
I've learned my lesson.

280
00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:08.393
I'm no longer interested in men,
and I've lost my confidence.

281
00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.186
Do you think I'm confident?

282
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:15.566
You're two years older than me,
you're divorced, and you have kids.

283
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.069
I mean, there's nothing I like about you.

284
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:21.239
Exactly! You just pointed out
my flaws one by one.

285
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.074
I wouldn't like me if I were you.

286
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.159
Now I know you're not interested.

287
00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.954
But I can't help it. I'll give it a shot.

288
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.874
Are you mocking me or saying you like me?

289
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.878
Look.

290
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:39.298
I don't date a woman
without marriage in mind.

291
00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:41.134
Marriage?

292
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.302
I don't know
if I can overcome the obstacles.

293
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.556
But I've become drawn to you
while bickering with you.

294
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:49.976
I don't know if the twins will grow on me.

295
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:53.438
I'll buy them meals and play soccer
with them. I want to try my best!

296
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.612
If it still doesn't work,
I'll give up on my own.

297
00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:05.199
So don't worry.

298
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.327
I'll confess my feeling for you then.

299
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.711
Come on, let's go.

300
00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:48.493
Why are you…

301
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:04.050
<i>The dream…</i>

302
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.305
<i>is back.</i>

303
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:37.583
You mentioned
a colleague of your colleague

304
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.585
who got assaulted by a parent.

305
00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:45.133
I put together the legal briefs
and court rulings from cases I worked on.

306
00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:57.937
COURT RULINGS ON TEACHER ASSAULT

307
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:01.899
<i>Is it because I recalled it after a while</i>

308
00:24:03.317 --> 00:24:04.277
<i>or…</i>

309
00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.947
<i>because I saw my mom?</i>

310
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.163
Yes, Mr. Sun.

311
00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:26.132
How many dishes did you order?

312
00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.719
This is pork cutlet with demi-glace.

313
00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:31.929
And this is katsudon.

314
00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:35.057
Pork cutlets are roughly
categorized into two types.

315
00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.852
Thick ones with meat as a main ingredient.

316
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:40.521
And thin ones focusing on crispiness.

317
00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.274
Which type do you prefer?

318
00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:44.775
Crispy ones, of course.

319
00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:46.485
Okay.

320
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.544
As expected, crispy ones are so good.

321
00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:10.718
Gosh, it's so thick and juicy, isn't it?

322
00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:14.055
By any chance,

323
00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:20.144
did what my mom said yesterday
hurt your feelings?

324
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.942
Speaking of which, why are you
wearing different clothes? And your hair…

325
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:28.110
I don't even remember what she said.

326
00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:29.111
Don't worry.

327
00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:33.741
What about you? I feel like
you fought with her because of me.

328
00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:40.039
What's wrong?

329
00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:42.416
Nothing. Let's eat.

330
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.086
I figured you might be upset
about what happened yesterday,

331
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:47.463
so I thought about
how to make you feel better

332
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:51.550
But when you feel down,
there's no special cure.

333
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:54.762
Eating something delicious
and sweating it out.

334
00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.889
The simplest method is the best.

335
00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.141
All right.

336
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:06.524
By sweating it out,
did you mean it literally?

337
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:10.444
You can't take everything as a metaphor.

338
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:15.241
What should I have you do
to make you sweat?

339
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:17.285
Are there any skills you want to learn?

340
00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:21.580
<i>Yes.</i>

341
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:28.212
Skills I need... to protect myself.

342
00:26:31.382 --> 00:26:32.258
Good.

343
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:36.053
I'll teach you properly,
so do your best, okay?

344
00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:38.306
Now, attack me.

345
00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:43.853
Block it like this,

346
00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.730
pull the arm like this,

347
00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:47.398
and choke the neck like this!

348
00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:51.402
Choke your opponent from behind
and kick the knee pit,

349
00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.029
- then it's a rear choke.
- Stop.

350
00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:55.448
Understand? Got it?

351
00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:58.576
All right. Look at me.

352
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.081
Yes! Pull!

353
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:08.461
Come on. Your right leg should move
to the back like this.

354
00:27:08.544 --> 00:27:09.462
Okay? Again.

355
00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.047
- I see.
- All right.

356
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:14.717
Hold! Yes!

357
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.801
Choke!

358
00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:18.387
- From behind. What's next?
- Next?

359
00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:20.306
- The knee pit!
- What?

360
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:00.281
Ms. Jeong.

361
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.753
Let go of me. Let go.

362
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:17.548
What on earth are you doing here?

363
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:20.509
That Sun Jae-gyu guy is terrible.

364
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:24.430
He's teaching her how to fight,
to become a thug.

365
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.310
I should confess.

366
00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:30.478
Confess what?

367
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:33.272
Your feelings for Bom?

368
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:36.525
I believed I could be helpful
because I like Bom.

369
00:29:37.985 --> 00:29:40.821
I wanted to help you two
clear up your misunderstanding

370
00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:41.989
and make up.

371
00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:44.992
But as a result, it's gotten worse.

372
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:50.581
Before it's too late,
I'll go tell Bom everything about us.

373
00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:54.543
Hey, Attorney Choi. Choi I-jun!

374
00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:25.950
What? Oh, no!

375
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.952
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

376
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:30.996
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:31.622 --> 00:30:33.123
Oh, no. Are you okay?

378
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.918
I'm so sorry.

379
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:39.171
I thought it was Mr. Sun
trying to make me practice.

380
00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:41.048
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

381
00:30:41.924 --> 00:30:44.468
Though my pride is a bit bruised.

382
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.181
Choi I-jun?

383
00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:56.021
I'm here because I have something
to tell Ms. Bom.

384
00:30:56.105 --> 00:30:57.606
That's good.

385
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.984
I also have something to tell you.

386
00:31:01.652 --> 00:31:03.279
The documents you gave me,

387
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:08.617
the colleague of my colleague
finally read them today.

388
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:10.411
The colleague of your colleague?

389
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.246
I'm glad she read them.

390
00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:13.747
Anyway…

391
00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:16.125
She said she'd make up her mind soon.

392
00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:18.544
Is that so?

393
00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:22.131
If she comes to consult me,
I'll kindly help her.

394
00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:24.883
You must be busy,
yet you're trying to help.

395
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.428
Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.

396
00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:32.474
What? What's wrong?

397
00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:34.184
The thing you taught me…

398
00:31:35.144 --> 00:31:36.312
I did it to him.

399
00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:38.272
- Good job.
- Let me have…

400
00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:54.079
<i>For instance, using the dark theater</i>
<i>as an excuse for physical contact.</i>

401
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.555
Wow, my makeup's done so well today.

402
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.810
This is the only way I can get that glow.

403
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.485
Did you wait long?

404
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:27.905
You look…

405
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.241
pretty today.

406
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:36.747
Not just today.
I'm planning to keep being pretty.

407
00:32:38.707 --> 00:32:40.876
What are you doing? Follow me.

408
00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:52.763
<i>Physical contact…</i>

409
00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:58.394
<i>Considerate. Reliable.</i>

410
00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:29.508
Oh, no!

411
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:47.025
I figured you'd be scared,
so I brought this.

412
00:33:50.863 --> 00:33:51.905
Hold it.

413
00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:14.636
The movie was so fun. Right?

414
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.055
I'm not sure.

415
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.227
My heart felt cold,
and so did my hands, so…

416
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:26.482
Did you… feel cold?

417
00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:35.032
Hey.

418
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.083
Finally.

419
00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:56.303
Choi Se-jin!

420
00:34:57.638 --> 00:34:58.889
What are you doing?

421
00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:03.018
- That brat…
- You…

422
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.102
- Goodness.
- I…

423
00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:07.856
finally held your hand, and I got busted.

424
00:35:18.242 --> 00:35:20.828
Didn't you skip your tutoring
because you were unwell?

425
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.205
Come on.

426
00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:24.998
Finals ended just two days ago.

427
00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:26.500
Goodness.

428
00:35:29.503 --> 00:35:30.629
Hello.

429
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.549
I'm Sun Han-gyul, Se-jin's classmate.

430
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:39.346
Gosh. You should study at times like this
to catch up with the top student.

431
00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:42.057
While you're having fun with a boy,

432
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.142
don't you think he must be studying?

433
00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:46.687
He's not studying today either.

434
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.688
Really.

435
00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:51.149
Says her friend
who's nothing but handsome.

436
00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:52.943
Dad.

437
00:35:53.026 --> 00:35:54.486
In any case, Choi Se-jin,

438
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:58.657
if you come second once again,
I will transfer you to another school.

439
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.950
That will never happen.

440
00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:04.580
What?

441
00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:08.083
Se-jin worked really hard for finals.

442
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.919
She was always the last one
to leave the library

443
00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:13.422
and went over the workbooks
again and again.

444
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:16.633
And she read the textbooks
until they were worn out.

445
00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:22.347
She never went out for <i>tteokbokki</i>
with her friends because she was studying,

446
00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:26.560
and she even brought
her English notes to the restroom.

447
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.479
Se-jin.

448
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.110
Don't worry. You worked so hard.

449
00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:40.157
You deserve to be the top student.

450
00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:53.837
<i>Where on earth are you?</i>

451
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:56.757
<i>The schedule on set is all messed up</i>
<i>because of you.</i>

452
00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.425
Oh, he's out.

453
00:36:58.508 --> 00:36:59.593
I'll call you later.

454
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.053
Bye.

455
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.480
Is he unemployed or what?

456
00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:55.941
Where is he going at this hour?

457
00:38:13.667 --> 00:38:14.501
What?

458
00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:16.753
Where did he go?

459
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.844
Hey. Let's stop here.

460
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:26.346
Yesterday was leg day,
so my legs are sore.

461
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.974
Who are you, following me like this?

462
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:31.977
What? Did he know I was following him?

463
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.231
If you go that way,
you might get into an accident.

464
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.314
Oh, no! Mr. Sun!

465
00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:18.482
Oh, no.

466
00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:21.151
Mr. Sun! Wake up!

467
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:22.819
Isn't that Han-gyul's uncle?

468
00:39:22.903 --> 00:39:25.072
Hey. Call 911.

469
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:30.202
LEGAL BRIEFS

470
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.540
Ms. Bom!

471
00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:37.626
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

472
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:41.296
Han-gyul's uncle got hit by a car
and has been taken to the hospital.

473
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.255
What?

474
00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:44.674
Is he seriously hurt?

475
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.594
Han-gyul's uncle... got hurt?

476
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:53.391
It might be a concussion.

477
00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:55.310
When you hit your head hard,

478
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:58.355
it's common
to lose consciousness like this.

479
00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:01.316
It might be an epidural hemorrhage.

480
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.403
When my aunt had a car accident,
she looked fine on the outside,

481
00:40:05.487 --> 00:40:08.156
but she fell into a coma
because of the hemorrhage.

482
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:12.285
But he's not moving at all.
Maybe he's not in a coma

483
00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:14.454
but in a vegetative state.

484
00:40:16.081 --> 00:40:17.666
Boss!

485
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.251
Boss!

486
00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:21.378
- Hey.
- What?

487
00:40:23.797 --> 00:40:26.424
This is why I kept telling you

488
00:40:26.508 --> 00:40:30.095
to stop stepping up so recklessly
for others.

489
00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:32.764
It's not the time for this.

490
00:40:32.848 --> 00:40:35.100
Hey, guys. Is the car okay?

491
00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:36.685
- Sorry?
- What?

492
00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:38.436
If he was brought to the hospital,

493
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.940
I bet the car's bumper or door
must be broken. Right?

494
00:40:42.816 --> 00:40:44.234
You're worried about the car?

495
00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:47.737
It's been over an hour,
but he hasn't woken up.

496
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:49.614
Oh, no, Jae-gyu.

497
00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:50.782
I'm sure he's fine.

498
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.542
- Uncle!
- Are you okay?

499
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.339
Hey. He's alive!

500
00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:08.133
He's okay!

501
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.015
Are you all here for me?

502
00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:17.893
I'm fine, so you can go back.

503
00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.936
Thank you for worrying about me. Hey.

504
00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:24.316
Gosh, is it a party or what?

505
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:26.985
Doctor.

506
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:29.029
What about the test results?

507
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.200
Are your bones and tendons
made of iron and concrete?

508
00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:36.453
A car hit you, but you don't
even have a crack in your bones.

509
00:41:37.245 --> 00:41:38.079
Look.

510
00:41:39.748 --> 00:41:44.169
In my 17 years as a doctor,
I've never seen such a beautiful scan.

511
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:46.254
His head and neck are totally fine.

512
00:41:46.755 --> 00:41:48.256
Let me check where you have pain.

513
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.634
Where I have pain? Oh, here.

514
00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:53.845
Come on, be gentle.

515
00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:56.139
That's it?

516
00:41:56.723 --> 00:41:57.724
What's that?

517
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:01.770
It won't leave a scar, will it?

518
00:42:04.064 --> 00:42:06.524
If you got enough sleep, you can go home.

519
00:42:06.608 --> 00:42:08.777
But while you're here, finish the IV.

520
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:13.490
Gosh, this is like a piece of art.

521
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:15.158
I want to keep a copy.

522
00:42:16.493 --> 00:42:18.161
- Let me see you. Let me.
- What?

523
00:42:18.787 --> 00:42:19.704
I'm fine.

524
00:42:21.623 --> 00:42:25.835
By the way, what about the woman he saved?

525
00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:27.295
Did you see her face?

526
00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:29.381
She was wearing a cap this low,

527
00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:32.384
so I couldn't see the face at all.

528
00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:37.055
How could she not even show her face?

529
00:42:37.138 --> 00:42:39.808
All right. I'm fine, so you can all leave.

530
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.851
Thank you, Mr. Hong. Bye.

531
00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.145
- Don't do that.
- Phillip, go.

532
00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:49.526
Excuse me.

533
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:53.154
I'd like to pay Sun Jae-gyu's bill.

534
00:42:53.238 --> 00:42:56.324
Isn't Han-gyul's uncle just amazing?

535
00:42:57.075 --> 00:43:00.787
She must have no conscience or shame.

536
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.040
What kind of person runs off
when someone's hurt because of her?

537
00:43:04.124 --> 00:43:08.044
Well, she must have her reasons.

538
00:43:08.128 --> 00:43:11.214
It's finished.
You can go home after paying your bill.

539
00:43:11.298 --> 00:43:12.132
Thank you.

540
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.551
What reasons?

541
00:43:14.634 --> 00:43:18.305
You saved her life.
Shouldn't she show her face at least?

542
00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:21.599
We should report people like her
to the police.

543
00:43:21.683 --> 00:43:23.310
- No, you can't.
- Why not?

544
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:27.105
Well…

545
00:43:28.023 --> 00:43:29.774
To tell the truth, she is…

546
00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:32.110
She is…

547
00:43:35.155 --> 00:43:37.407
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu! Mr. Sun!

548
00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:40.118
Oh, no. Wake up!

549
00:43:43.747 --> 00:43:45.332
It's Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

550
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:51.504
You mean my mom?

551
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.845
I'm sure she can't come
even if she wants to.

552
00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:01.473
It's not easy for a celebrity
to come here.

553
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:05.018
All the more reason
she should come and thank you.

554
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:07.604
This isn't just being irresponsible.
It's shameless.

555
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:10.106
But I'm totally fine.

556
00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:15.236
I'm okay, so stop being so mad. Calm down.

557
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.951
Why should I do that?

558
00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:28.583
Why does everyone have to put up with her
when they suffer because of her?

559
00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:36.508
Don't.

560
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:40.887
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

561
00:44:41.763 --> 00:44:45.683
"The adulterous teacher is Jeong Nan-hee's
daughter." "A scandal with a married man."

562
00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:49.145
If such articles get published,
who will take the blow?

563
00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:50.522
Dad.

564
00:44:53.316 --> 00:44:55.777
What needs to be done needs to be done.

565
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.655
Bom.

566
00:45:00.323 --> 00:45:01.408
Is it…

567
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:05.495
really not true?

568
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.374
<i>It felt like there was</i>

569
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:13.503
<i>no one to lean on in the whole world.</i>

570
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:19.801
Like I had no reason to live…

571
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.805
anymore.

572
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.650
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:42.240
You should've told me all about it
so we could cry, get angry,

574
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.993
and swear together.
Why did you bottle it up so long?

575
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:50.748
There are things
that are painful just to talk about.

576
00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:55.170
The one I told Mr. Choi about.

577
00:45:55.837 --> 00:45:57.464
The colleague of my colleague.

578
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:06.639
That's actually about me, not a colleague.

579
00:46:15.857 --> 00:46:17.484
- Let's go.
- Go where?

580
00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:20.528
Let's go tell I-jun to solve it.

581
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:25.700
Just as you once told me,
what needs to be done needs to be done.

582
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:29.787
Let's go.

583
00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:37.879
Darn it.

584
00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:42.675
<i>You must be busy,</i>
<i>yet you're trying to help.</i>

585
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:44.427
<i>Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.</i>

586
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.556
I should've confessed my feelings then.

587
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.226
You shouldn't
confess your feelings rashly.

588
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:53.770
You know, I did something similar
not long ago…

589
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:56.397
Seriously, where on earth did they go?
Mr. Choi.

590
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:59.692
Have you seen my cap and black hoodie
that I leave in the office?

591
00:46:59.776 --> 00:47:01.152
I swear I put them here.

592
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:08.117
- There! My cap and hoodie!
- Hey…

593
00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:11.955
By the way, when did you come down here?

594
00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:14.874
Are you still here?
Are you really not leaving?

595
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:18.294
I almost left this world
in a car accident. Happy?

596
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:20.713
Again?

597
00:47:20.797 --> 00:47:23.466
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

598
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.134
I'm not hurt.

599
00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:27.387
But Sun Jae-gyu is.

600
00:47:28.096 --> 00:47:29.305
Han-gyul's uncle?

601
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:32.100
He saved me from getting hit by a car.

602
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:35.311
If it weren't for him,

603
00:47:35.395 --> 00:47:39.941
my photo would be either on the front page
of the newspaper or in the obituaries.

604
00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:42.735
He sure is amazing.

605
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:46.281
No, he's the problem. He is.

606
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:47.907
Anyway, Mr. Choi,

607
00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:53.204
you told me he ran off with your money
and that he was your archenemy.

608
00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:54.581
Is that really true?

609
00:47:55.665 --> 00:47:57.000
What do you mean?

610
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:58.793
I mean, what you told me

611
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:02.714
is so different from what I've heard
about him from other people.

612
00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:06.718
Still, it's such a relief that he's okay.

613
00:48:07.302 --> 00:48:10.263
Gosh, you're right.
My heart sank when I heard it.

614
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.058
I just don't get
why you worry so much about him.

615
00:48:14.601 --> 00:48:15.685
Principal.

616
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:19.689
Have you forgotten how he made a fuss
at school on the snowy day?

617
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:22.775
Mr. Jeong, have you forgotten
he's nothing but a thug

618
00:48:22.859 --> 00:48:24.736
that hangs out with those big guys?

619
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.613
Come on, they're not thugs.

620
00:48:27.322 --> 00:48:31.534
The guys that hang out with him
all train at my jiu jitsu gym.

621
00:48:32.118 --> 00:48:34.203
They may be big and look like thugs,

622
00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:38.875
but they're good guys who love <i>tteokbokki</i>
and <i>jjolmyeon. </i>Don't get them wrong.

623
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:41.044
He's right. They're really good guys.

624
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:45.923
And remember how he lifted a car
in front of my place?

625
00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:48.009
Turns out he did it for a fire truck.

626
00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:52.138
There was a fire, but it couldn't get in
because of the illegally parked car.

627
00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:55.016
I heard this from the nurse at the vet's.

628
00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.435
When he was shoveling in the woods,

629
00:48:57.518 --> 00:49:00.772
it was to save the dog
buried by the landslide.

630
00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:02.190
You mean Bom-sik?

631
00:49:02.774 --> 00:49:05.234
How about your story? Is it true?

632
00:49:05.318 --> 00:49:06.444
What do you mean?

633
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.823
The scar on your palm,
was it really Mr. Sun's doing?

634
00:49:12.408 --> 00:49:14.243
- Where's the restroom?
- That way.

635
00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:15.495
I'll be back.

636
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:16.913
Just tell us.

637
00:49:16.996 --> 00:49:18.665
- Come on.
- Mr. Hong.

638
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:26.673
Are you doubting me right now?

639
00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:30.426
Am I doubting you?

640
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.388
Or are you slandering Sun Jae-gyu?

641
00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:37.558
Tell me.

642
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:43.356
You didn't speak ill of him to me
on purpose, did you?

643
00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:45.441
What?

644
00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:50.571
You know, when you like someone,
sometimes you get jealous and twisted.

645
00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:53.282
You wanted to win Bom over,

646
00:49:53.366 --> 00:49:57.036
but when you realized
you had no chance against him…

647
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:06.838
Everyone's being fooled!

648
00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:12.635
<i>You asked me</i>
<i>what kind of person Sun Jae-gyu is?</i>

649
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:16.139
<i>Jae-gyu is…</i>

650
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:18.057
What about Jae-gyu?

651
00:50:18.975 --> 00:50:20.810
What about Sun Jae-gyu, the son?

652
00:50:20.893 --> 00:50:21.728
<i>That jerk is…</i>

653
00:50:21.811 --> 00:50:22.937
He must've run off.

654
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.939
Watch what you say.

655
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:26.858
You don't know what happened.

656
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:28.359
I saw it.

657
00:50:28.443 --> 00:50:30.778
In front of the underpass, a guy this big

658
00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:33.156
was running with a baby on his back.
I saw it.

659
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:36.701
Are you saying the son ran off
after setting the house on fire?

660
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:42.248
The father comes home wasted every day
and beats the son up.

661
00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:45.251
So how can he be in his right mind?

662
00:50:45.334 --> 00:50:46.836
I wouldn't put up with it.

663
00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:50.840
<i>If I stayed home,</i>
<i>one of two things would happen, so I left.</i>

664
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:55.261
Either he'd end up killing me…

665
00:50:58.347 --> 00:51:00.016
or I'd end up killing him.

666
00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:02.769
<i>Sun Jae-gyu, that jerk…</i>

667
00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:08.649
killed his own father!

668
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:13.070
What…

669
00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:19.827
What are you talking about?

670
00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:21.412
Sir.

671
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:23.623
Mr. Choi.

672
00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:25.792
There.

673
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:16.717
How did it go? How about Bom?
Did you see her? Is she doing okay?

674
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:18.678
- Nothing's wrong, right?
- Honey.

675
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.556
Let me get some sleep first.

676
00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:22.598
Of course.

677
00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:09.186
Ms. Bom.

678
00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:14.025
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

679
00:53:14.775 --> 00:53:18.738
I've been running Ms. Jeong's fancafe
as her fan for a long time.

680
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.703
I finally get it.

681
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:29.332
Why you opened your office
in the countryside

682
00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:32.084
and how my mom knew everything about me.

683
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:37.798
I admit I've been telling Ms. Jeong
how you were doing,

684
00:53:37.882 --> 00:53:40.593
but I swear
I didn't approach you on purpose.

685
00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:44.639
The day Se-jin came to Seoul,
I happened to find out where you lived,

686
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:47.516
and it made me worry
about you living here alone.

687
00:53:48.476 --> 00:53:51.354
I thought it was a good chance
to help you two make up.

688
00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.607
That's why you kept
sending me the documents.

689
00:53:56.692 --> 00:54:00.154
Since you knew
what I'd gone through in Seoul.

690
00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.575
I understand why you're offended.

691
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:09.914
But still,
I wanted to help you clear your name.

692
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:11.666
What about Mr. Sun, then?

693
00:54:14.126 --> 00:54:17.630
What was your intention
when you slandered him like that?

694
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:21.008
Slander?

695
00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:28.683
Do you think so too?

696
00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:33.437
That I…

697
00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.235
slandered Jae-gyu?

698
00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:22.111
<i>Sun Jae-gyu, that jerk…</i>

699
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.742
<i>killed his own father!</i>

700
00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:35.374
Jae-gyu…

701
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:39.295
Jae-gyu…

702
00:56:10.493 --> 00:56:12.244
<i>Did you eat?</i>

703
00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:23.714
MS. YOON BOM

704
00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:53.536
Turns out Mr. Choi is the president
of my mom's fancafe.

705
00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:57.331
Gosh, no wonder she knew exactly
how I was doing.

706
00:56:57.414 --> 00:56:59.041
The <i>baeksuk </i>too.

707
00:56:59.125 --> 00:57:02.378
Mr. Choi didn't make it.
He just delivered what my dad made.

708
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.803
Should we just go back?

709
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:13.556
Why aren't you asking?

710
00:57:17.518 --> 00:57:19.812
If you heard something like that
from I-jun,

711
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:22.898
you should ask me if it's true.

712
00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:25.401
Why are you holding back?

713
00:57:27.153 --> 00:57:28.404
I'm not holding back.

714
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.781
I trust you.

715
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.041
Ms. Bom...

716
00:57:45.588 --> 00:57:47.256
listen carefully to…

717
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:50.551
what I'm about to say.

718
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:55.723
My father…

719
00:58:00.519 --> 00:58:01.729
My father…

720
00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:11.906
I killed him.

721
00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:27.690
{\an8}I guess God left me this scar
so I wouldn't forget my sin.

722
00:59:27.773 --> 00:59:29.942
{\an8}You've been looking
at your phone for days.

723
00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:31.986
{\an8}<i>The one who asked me about Bom…</i>

724
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:35.739
{\an8}<i>Strangely enough,</i>
<i>I see him everywhere I go lately.</i>

725
00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:36.657
{\an8}Hello?

726
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.577
{\an8}<i>Reporters might come for you, Ms. Bom,</i>
<i>so go straight home.</i>

727
00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:43.247
{\an8}Turn off your phone now.
Don't read any comments.

728
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.164
{\an8}What do you mean?

729
00:59:44.248 --> 00:59:47.459
{\an8}He told me to tell you not to worry
and to give you this.

730
00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:49.461
<i>It might become a long day.</i>

731
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:54.925
