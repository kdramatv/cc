﻿1
00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:13.741
Team White?

2
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.744
1 HOUR AGO

3
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.830
I'm resigning as parent rep
for Team White.

4
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.499
You're resigning?

5
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.752
Yes.

6
00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:28.005
I hurt my knee
while chopping wood the other day,

7
00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.341
so Dong-pyo's grandma will fill in for me.

8
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.551
Listen, I may not look it,

9
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:36.680
but I was on the relay team
at Shinsu Primary School back in 1967.

10
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.184
I almost made it
to the National Sports Festival.

11
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.144
Don't worry about a thing.

12
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.687
In 1967?

13
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.648
When I was 12.

14
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.568
I see.

15
00:01:54.532 --> 00:01:57.326
30 MINUTES AGO

16
00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:02.289
It's time to unleash
my Story Slayer skills.

17
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:09.338
Mr. Hong, what do you think justice means?

18
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.173
Justice?

19
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.759
"Justice."

20
00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:16.637
"Fiat justitia ruat caelum."

21
00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:19.682
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall."

22
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.225
That's what Kant said.

23
00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:25.563
In other words, following the rules
shouldn't depend on the situation.

24
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.690
It's a virtue that must be practiced

25
00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.775
no matter how bad
the consequences might be.

26
00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.070
I drew this white ball
in front of the students.

27
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.615
But to reverse that decision just because
it disadvantages your team?

28
00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.660
That violates the very rules
we established ourselves.

29
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:42.121
Wow.

30
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.374
Were you always this smart?

31
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.836
You're always so quiet. I had no idea.

32
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:52.172
You've got a way with words.

33
00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.801
Now then, I'll get straight to the point.

34
00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.053
I, Yoon Bom, will remain

35
00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.389
on Team White as originally decided.

36
00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:05.185
This decision isn't for any other reason.

37
00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.187
It's because, as an ethics teacher,

38
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.857
I need to show my students
what real justice looks like--

39
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.151
Sure. Go ahead, then.

40
00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:16.822
Sorry?

41
00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:18.866
Fine, have it your way.

42
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.960
Team White, are you ready to win?

43
00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:30.878
Let's go!

44
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:32.796
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

45
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.137
Hey, Sun Han-gyul.

46
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.975
Did you seriously play me?

47
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.727
No.

48
00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:49.688
Se-jin clearly said
Ms. Bom was on Team Blue.

49
00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:51.023
Here we go. Let's do this.

50
00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.108
-Let's go, Team White!
-There you go!

51
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:54.652
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

52
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:55.653
Let's go.

53
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.617
What's going on?

54
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.911
Didn't you say your teacher
was on Team Blue?

55
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.873
Who cares if she's on Team Blue or White?

56
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.626
There's only one thing
you need to care about.

57
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.961
Me. Don't you know that?

58
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.589
I just thought you were both on Team Blue,

59
00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:18.801
so I was going to do everything
to help you both win.

60
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.636
-Nope.
-Warm up.

61
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.888
I'm hoping she loses.

62
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.264
Your hands too.

63
00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:26.308
-Watch your wrists.
-Do you know

64
00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:28.644
why she came down here from Seoul?

65
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.437
How do you know?

66
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.440
What the heck? How do you know?

67
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.776
Did Dad tell you?

68
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:38.320
So I had Secretary Jung look into it,

69
00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:42.324
and there's a reason why Se-jin's teacher
volunteered to come here from Seoul.

70
00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:44.034
Why? What happened?

71
00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:47.162
It seems like she had some issues
with a man.

72
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.914
What? Unbelievable.

73
00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:49.832
Oh, right.

74
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:54.795
Apparently she's
actress Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

75
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.549
That explains it.
I thought she was pretty.

76
00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.428
So what is it? What did she do wrong?

77
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.722
Gosh, it's nasty.

78
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.932
Something with a parent,
that kind of thing.

79
00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:08.726
Oh, my goodness.

80
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.646
Don't tell anyone what you just said.

81
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.231
Got it?

82
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:17.317
Then you have to win.

83
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.822
Let me beat Evil Han-gyul,

84
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.366
and I'll do whatever you say.

85
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.204
Okay.

86
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.999
Now, let's kick off
Shinsu High's sports festival

87
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.126
with the first event.

88
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.463
First up is the relay race.
Isn't this exciting already?

89
00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:40.049
Absolutely. Keep an eye
on Oh Dong-pyo from Team White,

90
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.550
a 12-second 100-meter sprinter.

91
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.386
Choi Se-jin from Team Blue,
who runs 100 meters in 15 seconds.

92
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.597
Oh Dong-pyo's grandmother, Yang Bok-hee,

93
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.682
is in the race,
as Team White's parent rep.

94
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.269
We've got Sun Han-gyul,
our school's top student,

95
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.147
and Yoon Bom, the faculty's
young up-and-coming ethics teacher.

96
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.398
TEAM WHITE

97
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:58.275
Team White's lineup is spectacular.

98
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.027
Team Blue also has a strong lineup.

99
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.696
Hong Jung-pyo, science teacher
and Director of Academics.

100
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.948
Kim Min-guk, Shinsu High's prankster,

101
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:07.868
and Seo Hye-suk, parent representative,
who teaches Korean.

102
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:08.994
TEAM BLUE

103
00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:10.954
You never know who'll win until it's over.

104
00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.874
That's why not giving up
until the last second

105
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.459
can be a key strategy.

106
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.460
That's right.

107
00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:44.947
What's all this?

108
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.283
Do you think this is the Olympic finals
or something?

109
00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:49.451
What?

110
00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.453
Do I look too cool
for you to recognize me?

111
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.713
Relay runners, come forward!

112
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:06.718
Let's go.

113
00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:08.470
What?

114
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.267
Just because the situation's changed
doesn't mean our promise changes.

115
00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.185
I am

116
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:17.104
counting on you, Uncle.

117
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:19.857
Han-gyul, about me not--

118
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.191
Oh, dear. Wait.

119
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:26.238
You hurt your leg chopping wood.
Why are you out here?

120
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.532
Leave the parent rep job to me

121
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.161
and go rest in the stands. Now!

122
00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:33.078
Go on!

123
00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:35.455
-Wait, but...
-Let's step off the field.

124
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.832
-But--
-Come on, it's starting.

125
00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.460
Ms. Bom. I...

126
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:41.545
-Hey.
-Come on.

127
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.630
Did I hear that wrong?

128
00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:46.049
-First runner...
-Dong-pyo's grandma is running?

129
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.551
-Take position!
-You got this!

130
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.344
Ms. Bom.

131
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.265
"Fiat justitia ruat caelum," right?

132
00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.517
Let's give it our all and run.

133
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:58.228
Let's see if justice will be done.

134
00:07:58.312 --> 00:07:59.521
Geez, let's just watch.

135
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:01.064
Go, Han-gyul!

136
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:02.274
On your marks...

137
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.990
His uncle is... not participating?

138
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:13.535
Go!

139
00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:14.786
Yoon Bom's start was late.

140
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.996
Go!

141
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.750
Wow, Hong Jung-pyo's off to a great start.

142
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.419
He's not letting
the young Yoon Bom get ahead at all.

143
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.006
Swing your arms!

144
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.015
Yoon Bom is picking up speed now.

145
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.143
Run!

146
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.727
She's making a move for the lead!

147
00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:43.732
Here comes Yoon Bom!

148
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.820
No.

149
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:49.905
Hey, look!

150
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:50.948
Foul!

151
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.283
Hong Jung-pyo, that's not right.

152
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.243
Foul!

153
00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:58.372
What's happening?
Yoon Bom's form has collapsed.

154
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.667
Hong Jung-pyo is pulling ahead again.

155
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.001
Seriously, dang it!

156
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:06.380
Seriously?

157
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:11.510
And there it is. Seo Hye-suk
and Yang Bok-hee got the batons.

158
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.803
It's Dong-pyo's grandma.

159
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.012
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

160
00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:15.889
SUN HAN-GYUL,
THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE

161
00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:16.807
-Ma'am.
-Oh, ma'am.

162
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.684
What? Ma'am.

163
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.061
Oh, no.

164
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.688
What's happening here?

165
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.149
Is Yang Bok-hee really going
at full speed?

166
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:30.153
Is Team White losing
yet another chance to take the lead?

167
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.781
Go! Faster!

168
00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.367
What are you going to do, Evil Han-Gyul?

169
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.494
Looks like I'll be cutting
the finish ribbon.

170
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.788
-Now, the third runners...
-Let's go.

171
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.290
...are getting ready.

172
00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:43.125
Han-gyul, go.

173
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:45.836
Let's go.

174
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.046
Ma'am, pass it to Han-gyul.

175
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.342
Run!

176
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.885
Han-gyul!

177
00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:55.470
-Run!
-Let's go!

178
00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:56.680
ALREADY A WINNER IN LOOKS

179
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.557
-Why is he that fast?
-Wait.

180
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.101
-Sun Han-gyul!
-Sun Han-gyul!

181
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.185
What's this?

182
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.356
Sun Han-gyul
is catching up to Kim Min-guk.

183
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.941
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

184
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:09.735
You've settled in my heart!

185
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.653
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

186
00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.447
You've settled in my heart!

187
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.032
Sun Han-gyul, you drive me crazy!

188
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.491
You've settled in my heart!

189
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:19.328
Sun Han-gyul's really driving us crazy.

190
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.204
He's ruthless to the opposing team.

191
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.957
Oh, is this a comeback?

192
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.917
A comeback!

193
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:29.087
-Sun Han-gyul takes the lead!
-He's ahead!

194
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.757
You got this!

195
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:33.633
Run!

196
00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:35.093
Han-gyul.

197
00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:36.178
Here.

198
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.480
What just happened?

199
00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.733
The baton flew away!

200
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.242
You asked me last time

201
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.039
if my intentions were good or evil.

202
00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:10.045
Once the sports festival ends,
you'll know the answer.

203
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.636
GO, TEAM BLUE!
TEAM BLUE HAN-GYUL

204
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:54.840
Hey.

205
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.175
That dog...

206
00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.927
I can't believe this.

207
00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.221
-Se-jin, hurry!
-Go!

208
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.682
Whose dog is that?

209
00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.351
CAPTAIN

210
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.438
Let go! Hey, drop it!

211
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:10.522
Let go, you fool!

212
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.232
Dong-pyo, what are you doing?

213
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:14.568
Let go.

214
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.363
Run, Dong-pyo! Go, Dong-pyo!

215
00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:20.740
Finally, Oh Dong-pyo got the baton

216
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.452
and is chasing Choi Se-jin.

217
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.454
Faster! Swing your arms!

218
00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.290
But it'll be tough
to catch up to Choi Se-jin.

219
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.416
You got this, Se-jin!

220
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.424
That's right.

221
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:40.260
Choi Se-jin crosses the finish line

222
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.680
and claims victory!

223
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.602
I-jun, I won!

224
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.812
I crushed Evil Han-gyul!

225
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.238
Good job, kiddo.

226
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:06.995
Han-gyul.

227
00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.206
How was I supposed
to take the baton like that?

228
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:12.375
How could you not catch that thing?

229
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.170
I told you to keep your eyes
on the baton during practice.

230
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.714
You've really got some nerve saying that.

231
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.758
Oh, gosh.

232
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:21.927
Are you okay?

233
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.138
It looks like my artificial joints
are completely messed up.

234
00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.392
I don't think I can run anymore.

235
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.230
Stop scaring people here.

236
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.774
Go somewhere else and calm down, okay?

237
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.610
Please, I have to go now.

238
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.406
What a thrilling start
from the first event.

239
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.783
That's right.

240
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.701
I can't wait for the next event.

241
00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:47.786
That's right.

242
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.539
With that, Team Blue takes the point
in the first relay event.

243
00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:51.456
TEAM BLUE

244
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.543
We'll take a short break and be back
after the commercials.

245
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.170
You're watching
Shinsu High's sports festival,

246
00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:59.548
filled with passion,

247
00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.217
here at the Shinsu High School main field.

248
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.802
SHINSU HIGH
GOVERNOR CHOI CHANG-WOO

249
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.303
-Good work.
-Good work.

250
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.076
Bom.

251
00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.745
See? The whole thing
about your knee injury was a lie.

252
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:33.748
Bom.

253
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.377
I had to lie because--

254
00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.504
Probably because of me.

255
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.464
How did you know?

256
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.133
Mr. Sun.

257
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.719
Can't you keep
personal feelings out of this?

258
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:49.306
Even if there was tension between us,
that shouldn't hurt the team.

259
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.473
Gosh.

260
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:52.684
That's not the reason.

261
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:57.188
Of course,
I may have lost my temper with you.

262
00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:58.732
I admit that.

263
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.942
But there was a good reason

264
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:03.403
for me to act that way.

265
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.656
What is the reason?

266
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.369
You want to know?

267
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:12.871
Yes.

268
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.417
Then... win the medal for Bom-sik.

269
00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.588
I'll tell you why
on the day Bom-sik gets the medal.

270
00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.893
Just because the situation's changed
doesn't mean our promise changes.

271
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.729
No.

272
00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:43.276
Are you going to break the promise
you made to Bom-sik as his dad?

273
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.196
Bom.

274
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.531
Look, I'm Sun Jae-gyu.

275
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.660
When I promise something,
I stick to it, no matter what.

276
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:52.661
But?

277
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.704
But...

278
00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:58.333
the promises got all twisted.

279
00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:01.753
If I keep this one, it breaks the other,
and vice versa.

280
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.130
It's driving me crazy, you know?

281
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.052
If that's your final decision...

282
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.012
I get it.

283
00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.975
Wait, Bom.

284
00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.398
-What are you doing?
-Oh, my.

285
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.857
What's wrong with me?

286
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.026
Maybe I pushed myself too hard
in the relay.

287
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.782
Since my legs have given out already,
I'll say a few things like this.

288
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.623
Dong-pyo's grandmother's dream

289
00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:41.334
was to be a relay runner
at the National Sports Festival.

290
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.798
The 12-year-old girl
wanted to wear a medal

291
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.717
around her neck someday.

292
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.594
After all these years,

293
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.972
she now has artificial joints

294
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.767
and can't even run freely anymore.

295
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:04.607
Don't you want to put a medal...

296
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.653
around that girl's neck?

297
00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.241
Please don't crush...

298
00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.202
Ms. Yang Bok-hee's dream...

299
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.540
that she's held on to for 70 years.

300
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.462
Please?

301
00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.508
I am...

302
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.720
counting on you, Uncle.

303
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.644
I can't.

304
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.398
Darn it.

305
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.109
Gosh.

306
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:52.447
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

307
00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.867
Let me say just one last thing,
and I'll be out of your way.

308
00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:04.209
PLEASE FIND MY DAUGHTER
COMING TO THEATERS THIS MAY

309
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.670
I have a question for you, Ji-woo.

310
00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.381
How was it working
with actress Choi Jeong-hee?

311
00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:14.886
We really clicked, like childhood friends.

312
00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.221
You can look forward to it.

313
00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.680
Ms. Jeong Nan-hee.

314
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.724
Yes, go ahead.

315
00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.893
This is your first project in five years.

316
00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:25.396
Was there a particular reason
your big screen comeback took so long?

317
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.524
Among all the scripts coming in,

318
00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.568
it's not easy to find one
that really feels right for me.

319
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.154
As I read the script,

320
00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:37.200
it reminded me of everything
I shared with my daughter.

321
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:41.663
It all felt like my own story,
so I had no reason to turn it down.

322
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.456
Speaking of your daughter,

323
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:48.086
didn't she teach
at Munsong High School in Gangnam?

324
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.712
Not sure if you heard,

325
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.966
but there was a small incident
at Munsong High last year.

326
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.844
In class, a parent and a female teacher--

327
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.680
Please DM me for personal questions.

328
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:04.769
I feel a little uncomfortable taking away
attention from the other actors.

329
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:10.900
Does anyone have a question
for the director?

330
00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.069
Yes, I have a question for the director.

331
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.573
Your last film was loved
by eight million people...

332
00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.454
All right.

333
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:31.880
TEACHERS' OFFICE

334
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.854
She should make sure to eat properly.

335
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:13.171
Running around on an empty stomach
isn't good for you.

336
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.006
Make sure you eat your meals.

337
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.936
It tastes exactly
like what I was looking for.

338
00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.689
Especially the bittersweet aftertaste.

339
00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:34.734
No restaurant has recreated that taste.

340
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.237
Seriously? You'll give me
the secret recipe?

341
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.679
Now, the players from both teams
are entering the field.

342
00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:06.265
If Team Blue wins the tug-of-war,
they take the victory.

343
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.183
That's right.

344
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.436
Except for soccer,
Team Blue got every point.

345
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.315
This contest is really important
for Team White.

346
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.361
Jjun, pull yourself together.

347
00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.406
Why are you so out of it? Jjun?

348
00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.493
I was briefly confused
about which line to get in.

349
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.621
Now it's all clear.

350
00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.630
Everyone, take your positions
like we practiced!

351
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.048
To positions!

352
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.551
To positions!

353
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:48.224
Let's forget about the ones who left.
Let's do our best until the end.

354
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.142
Let's go!

355
00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.935
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

356
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.078
RODIN'S THE THINKER

357
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.581
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

358
00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:15.084
Let me say just one last thing,
and I'll be out of your way.

359
00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.546
I actually came here

360
00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:22.592
not because of Bom-sik, or the kids...

361
00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:25.386
or Dong-pyo's grandmother.

362
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:30.767
I...

363
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.896
need you, Mr. Sun.

364
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.114
Say that again,

365
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.325
one more time.

366
00:22:47.408 --> 00:22:49.619
Last time, for real.
It's really the last time.

367
00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:51.287
No, not that part.

368
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:54.624
What did you...

369
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.710
just say?

370
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.506
Mr. Sun, you're...

371
00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:03.633
the one

372
00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:06.427
I really need.

373
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.105
The one you really need.

374
00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:22.443
The one you really need.

375
00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:25.154
The one you really need.

376
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:48.761
Judging by their games so far,

377
00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.681
I'd say Team Blue has
a bit of an advantage in tug-of-war.

378
00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.682
Yes, I agree.

379
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.976
On top of that, Yang Bok-hee's out,

380
00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:57.311
so Team White is one player short.

381
00:23:57.395 --> 00:24:00.231
How will Team White
deal with this setback?

382
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:01.858
All eyes are on this next game.

383
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:03.568
The game is about to start.

384
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:04.485
TEAM WHITE
TEAM BLUE

385
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:36.267
Get ready, set...

386
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.811
That's not right.

387
00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:42.190
What? What is it?

388
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:02.960
What's happening, everyone?

389
00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:05.588
Sun Jae-gyu has appeared!

390
00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.465
Is he joining the team?

391
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:08.925
This changes everything.

392
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:12.303
No one can predict
how the game will play out.

393
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.100
I'm stepping in...

394
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:23.814
as Team White's parent rep.

395
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.608
Mr. Sun.

396
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:26.859
Uncle!

397
00:25:26.943 --> 00:25:27.777
Master.

398
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.237
Geez, Uncle.

399
00:25:36.327 --> 00:25:37.995
Today's chant

400
00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:39.664
is "Hey, ho."

401
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:43.542
When I say "Hey," you shout...

402
00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:45.544
-Ho!
-Ho!

403
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.389
Tug-of-war isn't about using your arms.

404
00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.432
It's all in your legs.

405
00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:00.434
Keep your core tight until the end.

406
00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:02.603
Tighten your glutes and thighs.

407
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:04.563
Heave, ho!

408
00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:06.732
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

409
00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:08.484
Got it?

410
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.777
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

411
00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:42.059
The game starts on the referee's signal.

412
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:45.396
-Heave, ho!
-Hey, ho!

413
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:48.024
-Heave, ho!
-Hey, ho!

414
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:50.693
-Hey.
-Ho!

415
00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:52.820
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

416
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:55.156
The cheers from both sides
echo across the field.

417
00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:57.533
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

418
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:58.576
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

419
00:26:58.659 --> 00:26:59.744
-Hey!
-Ho!

420
00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:02.121
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

421
00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:03.497
-Hey.
-Ho!

422
00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:05.458
We thought Team White had an advantage...

423
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:06.917
-Uncle.
-...with the new player.

424
00:27:07.001 --> 00:27:07.918
It's a close match.

425
00:27:08.002 --> 00:27:10.629
-Hey!
-Ho!

426
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:13.716
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

427
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:16.510
-Hey, ho!
-Heave, ho!

428
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:19.680
-Heave, ho!
-Heave, ho!

429
00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:21.474
-Hold!
-Heave, ho!

430
00:27:21.557 --> 00:27:22.600
Hold!

431
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:34.695
Hold!

432
00:27:36.906 --> 00:27:38.532
This is why I can't trust you.

433
00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:41.827
You always make people trust you
and then betray them.

434
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.788
You're the one who betrayed me.

435
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:48.209
I'm the one
who should be resentful, not you.

436
00:27:56.467 --> 00:28:00.346
You're the smartest in school,
but you can't think straight?

437
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.182
Pay the toll.

438
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:06.852
Gosh.

439
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:08.813
What?

440
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:11.899
Wow, he's loaded.

441
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:16.278
Damn it. Who are you?

442
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:20.074
Sun Jae-gyu?

443
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.994
Stay right there.

444
00:28:26.414 --> 00:28:27.331
Pick that up.

445
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:33.504
Yeah, give it to him.

446
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:37.258
You guys.

447
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:41.470
Choi I-jun is someone
I respect as my parenting mentor.

448
00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:44.223
If anyone touches him at Haechon High,

449
00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.767
you'll have to get past me first.
Is that clear?

450
00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:48.269
Got it.

451
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:50.271
Bye.

452
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:07.246
"Read the following poem
and answer the questions."

453
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:09.540
Aren't you going home?

454
00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.917
What's your deal, following me here?

455
00:29:13.294 --> 00:29:14.295
Cooperation.

456
00:29:14.879 --> 00:29:15.713
Cooperation?

457
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:19.133
You protect me, and I teach you.

458
00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:20.050
HAECHON
CHOI I-JUN

459
00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:24.472
I think this makes it
a fair trade between us.

460
00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:27.099
No need.

461
00:29:28.184 --> 00:29:29.602
I'm not going to college.

462
00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:32.897
If I ever get money,

463
00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:35.941
I'll get extra formula for Han-gyul.

464
00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:38.527
I don't have any money for tuition,

465
00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:42.740
and no time to read any books.

466
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:45.451
Stop talking nonsense and go.

467
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:50.164
I'll take care of the tuition.

468
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.876
You?

469
00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:57.880
If you don't have time
to read, then listen.

470
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:03.344
"Because I, a poor man,
love beautiful Natasha,

471
00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:08.349
the snow falls endlessly tonight."

472
00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:10.851
"Going to the mountains

473
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.479
doesn't mean you're losing to the world."

474
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:16.398
"You throw away

475
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.819
the world because it's dirty."

476
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:27.451
"Going to the mountains

477
00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:29.954
doesn't mean you're losing to the world."

478
00:30:31.205 --> 00:30:32.540
"You throw away

479
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.793
the world because it's dirty."

480
00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:52.518
I've never come in second
or felt regret in my life.

481
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:57.815
And my very first regret
was helping you back then,

482
00:30:58.607 --> 00:30:59.984
Sun Jae-gyu.

483
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.570
Are you done talking?

484
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:07.950
I was holding back because a short show
would be rude to the viewers.

485
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.035
But I'm wrapping it up now, okay?

486
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:12.079
The two teams are still deadlocked,

487
00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:14.873
and they're completely worn out.

488
00:31:14.957 --> 00:31:17.334
At this point, they need to settle this.

489
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.263
Hey!

490
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.472
Ho!

491
00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:38.856
Hey, ho!

492
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.859
With one powerful tug from Sun Jae-gyu,
Team Blue crumbles.

493
00:31:43.444 --> 00:31:45.487
And just like that, it's over.

494
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.087
Darn it.

495
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:11.513
Sun Jae-gyu is truly amazing.

496
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:13.891
Just replacing one parent
completely changed things.

497
00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:15.809
Team White was on the edge.

498
00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:18.228
But now they've regained momentum.

499
00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:25.903
It's impossible to tell who'll win.
Blue and White are neck and neck

500
00:32:25.986 --> 00:32:27.529
right up to the end.

501
00:32:56.517 --> 00:32:58.644
Where did everyone go?

502
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:01.313
Who are you?

503
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.940
Oh, sorry.

504
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.360
Well...

505
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.406
I'm...

506
00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:13.367
I'm here to see Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

507
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.785
I see.

508
00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:17.871
Han-gyul has a sports festival at school,
so everyone's there.

509
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:20.165
If it's urgent, should I give him a call?

510
00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:21.500
No.

511
00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:24.211
I'll call him myself.

512
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.964
Well, then.

513
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:32.219
Who is she?

514
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:38.934
Is she the woman he mentioned earlier?

515
00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:44.148
THAT WOMAN

516
00:33:50.404 --> 00:33:52.156
The score's tied at 2 to 2.

517
00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:56.410
Whoever wins the last round
will claim the victory.

518
00:33:56.493 --> 00:34:00.247
Mr. Wi Jeong-hwan,
which team do you think will win?

519
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.791
Yes, it seems Team White
has the upper hand

520
00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:04.293
after winning the previous game.

521
00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:07.296
Having Sun Jae-gyu
really turned the tide for them.

522
00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:09.005
What do you think, Principal?

523
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:11.216
I'm confident Team Blue
will come out on top.

524
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.176
There's a reason.

525
00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:15.304
We've seen how inconsistent
Team White's play has been.

526
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.847
On the other hand, Team Blue

527
00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.141
has earned many points
thanks to their steady performance.

528
00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:21.935
That's right. And as we speak,

529
00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:24.396
the final event
of Shinsu High's sports festival,

530
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.356
the piñata game, is kicking off.

531
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.485
You've worked hard keeping up
with the tough training. Great job.

532
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:32.737
Since this is the final game,

533
00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:34.947
blow off all the stress
you've been holding back.

534
00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:37.493
Toss it cursing at someone you hate,

535
00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:40.078
or shout out what you've been holding in
as you toss.

536
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:42.915
Have fun and throw your heart out.

537
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:44.041
I'll take care...

538
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.835
of everything else, got it?

539
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.420
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

540
00:34:48.504 --> 00:34:50.255
You're the one in charge of the outcome.

541
00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:52.132
Throw as hard as you can.

542
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:54.426
Let's meet at the top.

543
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.053
Go, Team Blue!

544
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:57.888
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

545
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.319
Let's go.

546
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:16.532
Let's go!

547
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.476
It's not about the wrist.

548
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.562
It's all about the snap, okay?

549
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.480
Pinch it, like this.

550
00:35:48.564 --> 00:35:50.566
Clench your fist.

551
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:53.193
Picture the face of the jerk
you want to curse at.

552
00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:57.281
"Get the hell out of my sight!"

553
00:35:57.364 --> 00:35:58.198
Try it.

554
00:35:58.282 --> 00:35:59.825
I can't say that around students.

555
00:35:59.908 --> 00:36:02.494
Try it. That doesn't even count
as swearing.

556
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.454
Hey, aim properly.

557
00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.373
Straight!

558
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.958
Work harder!

559
00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:09.626
Harder!

560
00:36:12.254 --> 00:36:14.464
Get the hell out of my sight!

561
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:18.927
Good job. One more time.

562
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:19.887
One more time?

563
00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:25.183
Team White is finally landing hits.

564
00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:26.727
They're gaining on Team Blue.

565
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:28.812
It's not my fault I'm ugly!

566
00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:31.273
It's not like I want my grades to suck!

567
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:33.692
I have no idea what I want to be!

568
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:38.697
I'll get a boyfriend!

569
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.200
Right now, Team Blue's piñata
is starting to open up.

570
00:36:42.284 --> 00:36:43.535
It's open!

571
00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:45.454
Look at Team Blue.

572
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:47.331
Oh, my.

573
00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:48.749
Hurry.

574
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:26.495
Who will claim the final victory
at Shinsu High's sports festival?

575
00:38:08.704 --> 00:38:10.122
CONGRATULATIONS, TEAM WHITE WINS

576
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:11.915
The victory goes to Team White!

577
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:14.960
Team White!

578
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:16.878
Team White's piñata opens first.

579
00:38:16.962 --> 00:38:18.755
The final score is 3 to 2.

580
00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:22.092
After a fierce battle,
the ultimate victory

581
00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:24.302
at the Shinsu High Sports Festival goes to

582
00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:26.805
-Team White!
-Team White!

583
00:38:43.405 --> 00:38:46.199
CONGRATULATIONS, TEAM WHITE WINS

584
00:39:29.618 --> 00:39:31.203
SPORTS FESTIVAL CHAMPION

585
00:39:42.047 --> 00:39:42.881
Traitor.

586
00:39:44.091 --> 00:39:46.510
You little punk.
You can't call your uncle a traitor.

587
00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:50.097
Since the day I was born,

588
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.015
I've never gone back on a promise to you.

589
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.811
You told me not to swear,
so I didn't even utter a harsh word.

590
00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:57.437
You told me to stay out of trouble,

591
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:59.773
so I didn't even touch
a cigarette or alcohol.

592
00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:01.399
You told me to listen to teachers,

593
00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:03.610
so I even gave in to Hong Jung-pyo.

594
00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:07.739
But how could my one and only family

595
00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:09.282
break a promise with me?

596
00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:12.661
Why did you do that?

597
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.081
Just why?

598
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:19.042
I don't know.

599
00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:20.710
You don't know?

600
00:40:20.794 --> 00:40:22.462
Yes.

601
00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:24.548
I don't know why I ran around like crazy

602
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:26.633
and went out to the field,
breaking a promise

603
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:28.051
to my one and only nephew.

604
00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:30.137
I don't even understand myself.

605
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:40.188
So why did you try so hard to lose?

606
00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:43.817
Like you said,
I'm your one and only family.

607
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.777
Do you really think I didn't know

608
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:47.863
you threw the baton on purpose?

609
00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:49.698
I don't know.

610
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.449
You don't know?

611
00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:54.411
Just like you, I have no idea.

612
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:56.913
I just...

613
00:40:57.497 --> 00:41:00.542
want to see her smile.
That's all I want to see.

614
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:02.919
It's the same for me.

615
00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:16.516
I'm the best

616
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.894
No, Bom-sik is the best.

617
00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:26.693
I got the medal

618
00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:27.777
SHINSU HIGH
SUN JAE-GYU

619
00:41:32.407 --> 00:41:33.617
I got the medal.

620
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.952
No, Bom-sik's Dad did!

621
00:41:41.458 --> 00:41:46.755
Everyone can see I'm totally killing it

622
00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:48.381
All right

623
00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:50.258
Sun Jae-gyu.

624
00:41:51.176 --> 00:41:53.637
What a killer guy.

625
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.016
How can he get more attractive
the more I look?

626
00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:00.602
Smooth surface.

627
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.151
Solid frame.

628
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.952
Even that sparkling night dew.

629
00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:30.632
Back off, Yoon Bom.

630
00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:36.137
You want to know?

631
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:38.223
Yes.

632
00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:41.393
Then win the medal for Bom-sik.

633
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:45.188
I'll tell you why
on the day Bom-sik gets the medal.

634
00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:49.067
Geez, this mouth of mine is the problem.

635
00:42:49.693 --> 00:42:53.154
Even if it was urgent,
I shouldn't have made a stupid promise.

636
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.409
I'm embarrassed to tell the truth,

637
00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:59.494
but I feel guilty to lie.

638
00:43:01.204 --> 00:43:02.789
What do I tell him tomorrow?

639
00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:15.385
The multi-purpose youth culture center
I'm planning is...

640
00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:19.806
We can use this section
for the press release.

641
00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:22.267
If you're going to include
the sports festival footage,

642
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.521
let's include Se-jin
crossing the finish line in the relay.

643
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:27.647
Come on.

644
00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:32.902
Wait, right here.

645
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:41.953
My goodness.

646
00:43:42.037 --> 00:43:43.955
You don't cry even when you fail exams.

647
00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:47.834
Se-jin.

648
00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:49.794
You're no different.

649
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.173
There's no one on my side in our family.

650
00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:56.718
I'll make up for it.

651
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:59.387
What can you do with a lost game?

652
00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:02.140
You lost the sports festival,
but you still have the finals.

653
00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:06.061
I'll sit with you
and tutor you personally, okay?

654
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.354
Really?

655
00:44:07.896 --> 00:44:09.272
No, forget it.

656
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.696
I mean it.

657
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.159
I'll make sure you get first place
for the whole school on the finals, okay?

658
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.459
What's wrong?

659
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.543
Se-jin?

660
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:48.103
Keep it if you want.

661
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.397
There's no room for this stupid medal
in our house.

662
00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:58.279
You don't want it?

663
00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:03.535
Fine, it's not gold anyway.

664
00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:05.620
It's just metal.

665
00:45:06.996 --> 00:45:09.916
Forget that stupid sports festival
that doesn't affect your grades

666
00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:11.167
and focus on your finals.

667
00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:27.350
Eat up.

668
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:32.480
This is why you can't beat me.

669
00:45:33.148 --> 00:45:34.399
Studying is a stamina game.

670
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:37.735
Crying out of frustration
drains your energy. How would you beat me?

671
00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:48.788
Sun Han-gyul.

672
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:12.395
Do you...

673
00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:15.648
like me?

674
00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:20.987
Oh, my goodness.

675
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.031
Bom-sik scored two wins.

676
00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:25.783
-I kept my promise, okay?
-I did too.

677
00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:32.040
Once you fill out
the animal registration form,

678
00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.833
the adoption is complete.

679
00:46:33.917 --> 00:46:35.668
Which of you will be taking him home?

680
00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:37.170
-Me.
-I will.

681
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:45.094
Why would you take Bom-sik?

682
00:46:45.178 --> 00:46:47.347
Of course Mom should take him.

683
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.891
He's named after me, "Bom-sik."

684
00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.936
Come on, that's nonsense.

685
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.146
I was the first to know about Bom-sik.

686
00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:59.817
I rescued him from the landslide
and pulled him out of the drain.

687
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:03.571
Haven't you two agreed
on who's going to raise him?

688
00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:05.490
Doctor...

689
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:07.450
I should be the one raising Bom-sik.

690
00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:10.578
I may not look it,
but I've raised a newborn

691
00:47:10.662 --> 00:47:13.164
into a proper high school student.

692
00:47:13.248 --> 00:47:14.082
Doctor.

693
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:16.417
I'm a teacher with a degree in education.

694
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:19.295
With years of experience
guiding teenagers,

695
00:47:19.379 --> 00:47:24.467
I'm confident I can support
Bom-sik's growth and development.

696
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:27.554
Only one person can register the animal.

697
00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:32.934
I might give up on other stuff,

698
00:47:33.643 --> 00:47:35.144
but I could never give him up.

699
00:47:35.228 --> 00:47:37.647
I can't give up
on this little guy either, Doctor.

700
00:47:48.575 --> 00:47:49.409
Bom-sik.

701
00:47:49.492 --> 00:47:51.536
No, it's okay. Everything's fine.

702
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:54.956
I'm sorry. We shouldn't be doing this
in front of a kid.

703
00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:57.542
Don't cry.

704
00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:01.254
Give it to me, please.

705
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.674
ANIMAL REGISTRATION, CHANGE REQUEST

706
00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:08.136
Twice a week.

707
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:12.432
Since I gave up custody,
you have to let me visit him.

708
00:48:18.104 --> 00:48:20.648
All right, are you ready to be discharged?

709
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:29.949
Stop right there.

710
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.038
Didn't you promise to tell me the reason

711
00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:36.831
when we put the medal on Bom-sik?

712
00:48:40.793 --> 00:48:41.961
Did I?

713
00:48:44.172 --> 00:48:45.882
Promises are meant to be kept.

714
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:51.137
Fine, I'll keep my promise.

715
00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:54.766
I said I'd tell you
on the day we put the medal on,

716
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:57.143
but I never said what time, did I?

717
00:48:57.226 --> 00:48:58.102
Right?

718
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.405
You have 12 hours left.

719
00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:25.588
I'm late because of traffic.

720
00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:28.007
I heard you had a rough time
at the showcase.

721
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:29.008
Attorney Choi.

722
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:32.428
You asked me
why I was so harsh to my daughter.

723
00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:35.098
This is exactly why.

724
00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:38.351
Honey, my medicine.

725
00:49:38.434 --> 00:49:39.268
Right. On it.

726
00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:43.856
Here.

727
00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:47.652
You know how it is, Attorney Choi.

728
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:50.363
She's had a rough time
dealing with the press.

729
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.616
I didn't tell Bom
because I didn't want her to worry,

730
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:54.992
but if she knew

731
00:49:55.076 --> 00:49:57.704
her mom was relying on anti-anxiety meds
to hold it together,

732
00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:00.373
she would've understood a bit.

733
00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:02.542
What should I do?

734
00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:06.170
Isn't there a way to save Jeong Nan-hee
both as an actress

735
00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:07.714
and as a mom?

736
00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:13.928
TASK FORCE FOR SASHIMI

737
00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:17.432
Task force for sashimi!

738
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:20.143
How expensive is this sashimi
that you even set up an office?

739
00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:21.978
Bluefin tuna? Sea bream?

740
00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:24.564
I've repurposed it.

741
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:27.150
It's a task force for the grand opening.

742
00:50:27.233 --> 00:50:28.484
What? Wait, Attorney Choi.

743
00:50:28.568 --> 00:50:29.402
MOVING COMPANY

744
00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:31.612
Fresh air is the only good thing here.

745
00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:34.532
This town has no crimes, scams,
people live happily ever after.

746
00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:35.825
Why open a business here...

747
00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:40.872
That plushie.

748
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:42.665
That massager.

749
00:50:43.583 --> 00:50:44.792
That pencil holder.

750
00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:45.710
Those are all mine.

751
00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:49.297
What the heck?
Do you expect me to stay here alone?

752
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.842
I don't have a friend or a girlfriend.
I can't be alone in this remote place.

753
00:50:52.925 --> 00:50:55.470
That's what
I should be telling you right now.

754
00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:59.474
Then how am I supposed
to add tangsuyuk when I get jjajang?

755
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.768
Who toasts with me when I drink soju?

756
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:04.937
Who do I share fried rice with,
the essential Korean finale?

757
00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:08.775
I'm fully aware
of the concerns in that situation.

758
00:51:08.858 --> 00:51:10.234
You're hired.

759
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:12.528
You can start tomorrow.

760
00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:13.988
Thank you.

761
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.117
ATTORNEY CHOI I-JUN

762
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.748
This is why my mom told me
to read a lot of books.

763
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:28.628
But, seriously, why here?

764
00:51:28.711 --> 00:51:30.046
What's in this nowhere town?

765
00:51:34.842 --> 00:51:35.760
Everything.

766
00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:42.558
Geez, why does time feel like
it's standing still?

767
00:51:46.062 --> 00:51:48.564
He's had all the shots,
so he shouldn't get sick, right?

768
00:51:50.233 --> 00:51:51.984
How much should I feed him?

769
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:53.236
How many walks a day?

770
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:06.374
Oh, my. What did he eat to poop that much?

771
00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:09.710
Wow, great job.

772
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:18.469
What do I do?

773
00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:21.514
It's warm, so it feels weird.

774
00:52:21.597 --> 00:52:23.432
I should wait until it cools down, right?

775
00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:25.268
My goodness.

776
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:27.103
Give it to me.

777
00:52:27.937 --> 00:52:30.273
No need to cool it down.

778
00:52:30.857 --> 00:52:33.818
Just pick it up.

779
00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:36.195
Moisture check, perfect.

780
00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:40.700
Digestion's great. He's healthy.

781
00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:41.909
Oh, my.

782
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:49.083
Raising kids starts
with cleaning up their poop.

783
00:52:51.294 --> 00:52:52.628
Good job.

784
00:52:56.132 --> 00:52:56.966
Wait.

785
00:52:57.842 --> 00:52:58.843
Look at this.

786
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:01.387
It's all bumpy. There's something here.

787
00:53:01.888 --> 00:53:03.306
It's nothing.

788
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:05.349
Those are Bom-sik's nipples.

789
00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:10.396
I don't think I can do this.

790
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:14.108
I took him in since he's cute,
not knowing how to raise him.

791
00:53:14.692 --> 00:53:16.611
If I mess up or end up hurting him,

792
00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:19.363
he might resent his mom too.

793
00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:21.407
Mom?

794
00:53:23.618 --> 00:53:25.119
Why?

795
00:53:26.245 --> 00:53:28.205
Did something happen
between you and your mom?

796
00:53:29.332 --> 00:53:31.417
I'm just saying.

797
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.630
What kind of mom
would want to mess up raising her kid?

798
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.724
I made tons of mistakes
when I was raising Han-gyul.

799
00:53:48.184 --> 00:53:51.020
I didn't know how to put a diaper on,
so I put it on backward.

800
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:54.982
He was crying because he was tired,
but I kept feeding him formula.

801
00:53:56.776 --> 00:53:58.527
Can I give you a parenting tip?

802
00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:03.866
When raising a kid,
as long as you focus on this one thing,

803
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:06.702
you might make mistakes,
but you'll never fail.

804
00:54:07.954 --> 00:54:08.913
What is that?

805
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.044
Love.

806
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.591
No matter how many mistakes parents make,

807
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:22.259
if there's love in it,

808
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:24.845
kids are bound to forgive them.

809
00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:29.517
So don't worry too much.

810
00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:32.395
From what I see, Bom-sik is...

811
00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:36.399
He'll get more love here
than most others get elsewhere.

812
00:54:36.983 --> 00:54:37.817
That's for sure.

813
00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:39.402
Am I right?

814
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:42.697
Now, go to your mom, Bom-sik.

815
00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:47.910
It's almost done.

816
00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:54.583
It's all done. Bom-sik's house.

817
00:54:56.836 --> 00:54:58.462
Hang out here when you're outside.

818
00:54:59.422 --> 00:55:01.132
-Okay.
-You want to try?

819
00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:02.675
There.

820
00:55:02.758 --> 00:55:04.927
There you go.

821
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.054
Wow.

822
00:55:07.138 --> 00:55:08.472
He seems to like it.

823
00:55:09.015 --> 00:55:10.349
Do you like it?

824
00:55:10.433 --> 00:55:12.977
I got you a house
when everything costs a fortune.

825
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.062
So grow up fast and make me proud, okay?

826
00:55:17.565 --> 00:55:19.608
You did great. Do you like it?

827
00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:24.947
I love you.

828
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.919
I love you, Dad.
Thank you for getting me a house.

829
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:42.840
Thank you.

830
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:52.683
Sure.

831
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:56.979
Bom-sik.

832
00:55:57.063 --> 00:55:59.106
I love you too.

833
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.149
I love you.

834
00:56:02.735 --> 00:56:07.907
Since we love each other,
shall we go for a walk?

835
00:56:09.575 --> 00:56:11.577
Sure, let's go take a walk.

836
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:21.462
Bom-sik.

837
00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:23.923
Leave him be.
There's only the two of us here.

838
00:56:25.466 --> 00:56:28.177
Even if you work here,

839
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.429
shouldn't you not sneak in
like this at night?

840
00:56:31.347 --> 00:56:33.224
What if the owner finds out?

841
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:36.102
He said it was fine,
so don't worry about it.

842
00:56:36.811 --> 00:56:40.064
Now, we have one minute left.

843
00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.150
Why are you so curious?

844
00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:47.154
Actually, I've got a few guesses.

845
00:56:49.573 --> 00:56:51.951
Is it because I saw your drunken antics?

846
00:56:53.369 --> 00:56:54.203
No.

847
00:56:55.037 --> 00:56:57.456
Or because I keep asking you
what happened in Seoul?

848
00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.499
No.

849
00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:02.002
Is it because I acted
as the Heir of the Wasp Family?

850
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:03.587
Not at all.

851
00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:05.714
Then that must be it.

852
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:07.967
Well...

853
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.009
Isn't it because

854
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.637
I keep trying to cross the line with you?

855
00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:16.684
It's not because
you might cross the line, Mr. Sun.

856
00:57:17.935 --> 00:57:18.894
What is it, then?

857
00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:22.398
If it's not because
I might cross the line,

858
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.650
what made you that angry?

859
00:57:32.575 --> 00:57:33.784
Ten seconds.

860
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:37.913
Nine seconds.

861
00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:46.422
I was afraid I might cross the line.

862
00:58:58.118 --> 00:58:59.578
Did you see that, Ms. Bom?

863
00:59:00.454 --> 00:59:02.289
-What's that?
-I'll show you

864
00:59:02.373 --> 00:59:04.041
what happens in Shinsu

865
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.002
when I decide to make myself attractive.

866
00:59:07.086 --> 00:59:09.171
Oh, my. Wait, Mr. Sun!

867
00:59:09.255 --> 00:59:10.881
If it's that hard, then break it.

868
00:59:10.965 --> 00:59:14.301
If what you want is to break the promise,
then I suppose we should.

869
00:59:14.385 --> 00:59:16.679
Some jerk was trying
to break into your house.

870
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:17.972
You're dead today.

871
00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:19.848
Jump in when needed, step back when not.

872
00:59:19.932 --> 00:59:23.143
If it's about you, I'm always jumping in.
I'll never step back.
