00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.742
<i>Now I remember...</i>

2
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.744
<i>this man.</i>

3
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.182
Are you okay?

4
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.685
I'm okay.

5
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.103
Let's find Se-jin first.

6
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.982
She probably couldn't get off
since it's too crowded.

7
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.401
Maybe she went to the front car.

8
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.115
That's him. The guy who was with Se-jin.

9
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.452
Darn it.

10
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.287
Darn it.

11
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.289
Excuse me.

12
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:05.876
Sorry, coming through.

13
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.297
Mister.

14
00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.015
Sun Jae-gyu?

15
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:25.521
Choi I-jun.

16
00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:29.066
So you're alive.

17
00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:35.155
Are you the guy who was with Se-jin?

18
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.491
Hey.

19
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.870
Why bring a high school girl here?

20
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:45.291
I spent ten years trying to find you,
and that's all you have to say?

21
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.170
Shouldn't you at least ask
how I've been first?

22
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.047
I don't care about that.

23
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:54.633
You don't...

24
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.385
care?

25
00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.555
Answer me.

26
00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.349
What's your relationship with Se-jin?

27
00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:07.688
I don't care about your relationship,

28
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.356
and I don't want to know.

29
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.735
Whether you talk things out
or fight it out, do it later.

30
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.947
Let me ask you as Se-jin's teacher.

31
00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.117
Where is she right now?

32
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.920
I should introduce myself.

33
00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:33.172
I'm...

34
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.883
Se-jin's older brother.

35
00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:38.469
Her brother?

36
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.139
I'm not sure why
her teacher has come all the way here,

37
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.184
but if you thought Se-jin ran away,

38
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.727
there's no reason to worry.

39
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.812
This runaway

40
00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:51.482
was entirely under my watch
as her older brother...

41
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:55.736
and our parents have already been updated
on where she is.

42
00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.737
What?

43
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:00.783
Wait.

44
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:05.704
So my big plan wasn't a disappearance...

45
00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:07.915
but just an outing?

46
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:14.755
{\an8}EPISODE 3

47
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:23.013
{\an8}I'm sorry.

48
00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:26.100
{\an8}I heard Se-jin would be staying
at some guy's place,

49
00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.142
{\an8}so I was scared.

50
00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:30.437
{\an8}I ended up telling you
without checking first.

51
00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.692
{\an8}It turned out to be a misunderstanding,
but you meant well.

52
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.779
{\an8}Our students are in the same class
for all three years,

53
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.657
{\an8}so you're more like family than friends.
It's natural to worry.

54
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:46.662
{\an8}Yes, coming all this way
was the right choice.

55
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.080
{\an8}You were brave, Han-gyul.

56
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:53.043
{\an8}Choi Se-jin must be really mad.

57
00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.256
Evil Han-gyul, that traitor.

58
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.634
I can't believe he told on me.

59
00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:02.469
And to that hypocrite teacher.

60
00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.891
Why on earth was Sun Jae-gyu
with Yoon Bom?

61
00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:08.892
Wait.

62
00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:11.520
You know my teacher's name?

63
00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:13.272
What?

64
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:17.735
I heard it earlier on the subway.

65
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.654
By the way,

66
00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:23.407
what does Sun Jae-gyu do there?

67
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:27.119
Has it been just him and Han-gyul?
No other family?

68
00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:29.329
Jjun?

69
00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:34.793
Are we talking about Han-gyul's uncle
or about me?

70
00:05:34.877 --> 00:05:38.172
What's going on with you
and Han-gyul's uncle?

71
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:46.055
Here, what does "gangho" mean?

72
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.849
"Gang" is river and "ho" is lake.

73
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:54.063
This kind of comparison to nature
is called a metaphor.

74
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:03.072
Gosh, here we go again.

75
00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:04.948
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

76
00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.289
I'm sorry.
There's no one at home to watch him.

77
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.751
Sorry about that, guys. I'm sorry.

78
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:20.089
If I-jun doesn't get into
Hanguk University because of your nephew,

79
00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.548
what are you going to do?

80
00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:23.759
He's not even your son.
Why did you have to

81
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.386
bring your nephew all the way to school?

82
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.431
Don't you have any family at home?

83
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:33.185
My dad is out on the boat and my sister--

84
00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.603
Have you ever seen his sister?

85
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.315
I've never seen her at home.

86
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.274
Tell me about it.

87
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:46.657
I-jun.

88
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.829
No, I-jun. Hold on, calm down.

89
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:52.955
Calm down.

90
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.166
What?

91
00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.128
Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.848
Hey, what's your deal?

93
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:15.227
I thought you were just smart.
You're good with babies, too?

94
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.854
My family happens to have...

95
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.565
a tiny little one like him.

96
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:22.943
Now let me study.

97
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:26.530
Come here.

98
00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.869
Oh, my goodness.

99
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.164
Let's give it up for I-jun!

100
00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:36.832
There's no one like him.

101
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.167
<i>We started out as friends...</i>

102
00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.734
<i>but ended up strangers.</i>

103
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.825
One's romantic, the other's into action.

104
00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:16.747
Based on your looks and style,
it makes sense you're strangers.

105
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.165
We are strangers.

106
00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.128
He said that
he's been looking for you for ten years.

107
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.506
If he were really a stranger,
would he search that long?

108
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.843
It's obvious
why he tried so hard to find me.

109
00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:31.637
Why?

110
00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:37.351
Forget about him.

111
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:41.188
He's got nothing to do with my life.

112
00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.748
Wait, we should be getting on the highway.
Why are we at a hotel?

113
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:05.545
We've covered 400 km
in 5 hours and 20 minutes.

114
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.005
We've traveled a lot.

115
00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:11.843
It's the same distance back home.
Imagine how exhausting that's going to be.

116
00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:14.263
I know you're tired from driving, but--

117
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.181
I'm not tired at all.

118
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:18.558
I'm talking about him, not me.

119
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.521
He's supposed to eat and sleep properly,

120
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.065
but he's only had noodles
and stayed up all night.

121
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.193
Shouldn't we let him wash up
and get some sleep?

122
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.154
Even so...

123
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:32.906
Hop out.

124
00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:40.497
{\an8}<i>Sorry about earlier.</i>

125
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.834
{\an8}<i>Text me when you see this.</i>

126
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.754
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:50.799
It's the weekend, so all the rooms are...

128
00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:51.883
No rooms?

129
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:55.095
Looks like there aren't any rooms.
We better go home.

130
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.471
Yes, there is.

131
00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:59.558
It's a family room
with a double bed and a single bed.

132
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.226
We'll take it.

133
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.185
What?

134
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.814
It's a family room for family.
What's the problem?

135
00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.858
You two are family, but we're not.

136
00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:10.736
You said
everyone at that school is family.

137
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.697
Don't you get figures of speech?

138
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.657
Why do you take everything literally?

139
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.494
Do you want to do something in the room?

140
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.247
As if.

141
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.499
Then we have only one purpose.

142
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:25.417
Sleep.

143
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.879
A family room fits that purpose perfectly.

144
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.173
It's cheaper than getting two rooms.

145
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.424
Why can't we sleep there?

146
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:50.776
Darn it.

147
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.236
It's a family room.
This isn't family-oriented.

148
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.458
You go wash up first.

149
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.709
No, you first.

150
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.181
Han-gyul, you look tired.
Go ahead and wash up first.

151
00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.600
Yeah, you go first.

152
00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.894
- Then I'll go first.
- Okay.

153
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.082
Why are you doing push-ups
all of a sudden?

154
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.583
Exercise is a habit.

155
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:51.545
Are you busy?

156
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.380
Why would I be busy here?

157
00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.506
Want to get on my back?

158
00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.800
Why would I get on a parent's back?

159
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.886
It doesn't even feel like a workout
with no weights.

160
00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.393
Hold my legs.

161
00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:08.812
I'm busy.

162
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.858
You're a teacher.
Why do you keep switching up?

163
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.234
You said you weren't busy.

164
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.407
Some teacher you are.

165
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.038
All right.

166
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.334
I'll do 100 reps, okay?

167
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.194
If you want to work out, go out.

168
00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.571
This hotel has a pool and a gym.

169
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:01.781
Don't do it in the room, okay?

170
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.666
Han-gyul.

171
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:14.961
Come on out.

172
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.213
Is he sleeping or what?

173
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:55.752
What the heck?

174
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.671
Is the kid alone?

175
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:12.894
"That woman"?

176
00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:14.980
Who's "that woman"?

177
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.275
A female friend? Someone he's seeing?

178
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.820
Could it be his ex?

179
00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:40.922
Where on earth is he?

180
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.802
Oh, my! Hey, kid!

181
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.762
Are you okay? Oh, no!

182
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.225
Hey, kid! Gosh, what do I do?

183
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.116
Mr. Sun?

184
00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.162
Wait right there!

185
00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.332
Don't move!

186
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.650
Stay right there!

187
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.447
Stay calm!

188
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.034
Geez.

189
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.662
Are you okay, kiddo?

190
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.664
- You're fine. Stop crying.
- Is he okay?

191
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.290
- Ji-u!
- Your mom's here.

192
00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.336
Are you all right?

193
00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.922
He scared me.

194
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.383
Why? What happened?

195
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:09.511
Did he do something to you?

196
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:13.723
Ma'am.

197
00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:16.685
I know I scared him,
but what happened is--

198
00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:17.769
How dare you!

199
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.446
What the heck?

200
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.616
What did you do with my husband?

201
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.953
Ma'am, what do you mean--

202
00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.913
I've checked all the evidence!

203
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.583
Your late-night calls...

204
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.796
and you two meeting at your place!

205
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.760
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

206
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.262
Your husband and I are not--

207
00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.639
I heard you flirted with him first.

208
00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.099
Ma'am.

209
00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.685
You told him how caring he was.

210
00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.813
You came on to him first!

211
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.733
No, ma'am, that's not... Wait.

212
00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.650
Right?

213
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.405
What's wrong with you?

214
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.323
What did you do to my kid?

215
00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.702
All right, please calm down.

216
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.662
He must've been startled.

217
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.081
If there's a pharmacy nearby,
get him some medicine.

218
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.585
Unbelievable. Let's go.

219
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:25.712
Take care!

220
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.923
Why aren't you explaining yourself?

221
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:33.720
She should be thanking you.
Why did you just take the blame?

222
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.891
It's fine as long as the kid's okay.
Why bother explaining?

223
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:38.933
No.

224
00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.227
What needs to be done needs to be done.

225
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.857
Once something's buried,
it's tough to dig it up later.

226
00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:48.610
Excuse me!

227
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.279
Wait up!

228
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:02.916
So, Dong-pyo, are you saying
you've personally met that great person?

229
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.000
I have.

230
00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.504
He'd have been thrilled
if he'd met you all.

231
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.720
But... the so-called great person
hasn't shown up.

232
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.764
How long
should we keep crawling like this?

233
00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.141
This is how everyone starts.
All right, get up.

234
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.394
Now, let's try the position
while lying down.

235
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.856
You two are a pair, and you two.

236
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.399
Master.

237
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.236
You want me to pair up with a woman?

238
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.529
Look.

239
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.740
Jiu jitsu is about skill, not strength.

240
00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.576
Why are you treating
men and women differently even here?

241
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.619
Forget it.

242
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.579
Dong-pyo.

243
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.082
- Guard recovery.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.875
What?

245
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.086
- Look carefully.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.922
The person on the bottom uses their legs

247
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.383
to keep the person on top
from moving around.

248
00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.968
Want to try an attack?

249
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.094
- Me?
- Yes.

250
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.346
Just get on top. Come on, follow along.

251
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.185
- Oh, like this?
- Attack.

252
00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.103
Come on.

253
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.106
All right, like this.

254
00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:11.609
Like this.

255
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.070
Like this.

256
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.823
Like this.

257
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.575
Like this, right?

258
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.535
Wow, is this really your first time?

259
00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.580
You're like a pro in a training video.

260
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.123
Is that so? Am I doing okay?

261
00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.833
You're incredible.

262
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.918
Now, head up and try faster.

263
00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.378
Faster. Like this.

264
00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.297
Like this.

265
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.506
Like this.

266
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.342
Like this.

267
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.386
Geez, seriously.

268
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.166
Darn it. That woman...

269
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.084
I knew this would happen.

270
00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.502
Did it burst?

271
00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:12.629
Did what burst?

272
00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:15.882
Stop with the nonsense and just go.

273
00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:19.552
Looks like there's a bit of a problem.

274
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.471
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong with you?

275
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.390
Go, just go!

276
00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:29.187
Check if there's an injury
and let me know.

277
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.898
Maybe you need to go to the hospital,
or maybe rest will do.

278
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.399
I'll need to pay for it.

279
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.610
And how are you going to pay for it, huh?

280
00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.571
What if I never marry and end up alone?

281
00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.115
How will you pay me back?

282
00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.326
- I guess you want to get married.
- Of course.

283
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.788
Even if I end up getting divorced
like someone I know,

284
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.914
I'll at least try.

285
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.167
What's with the jab at me?

286
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.168
Look, ma'am.

287
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.837
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

288
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.591
Stop going around and causing trouble.

289
00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:02.595
From now on,
just take care of your kids at home.

290
00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.180
Okay?

291
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.891
SPORTS CENTER

292
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.476
Just look at yourself.

293
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.939
With that hot temper of yours,
how could any girl like you?

294
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:16.150
Go home and look in the mirror.
You think you're still handsome?

295
00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.194
Your face is all dark and wrinkly.

296
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.031
And why's your head so tiny?
Can a brain even fit in there?

297
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.491
Goodness.

298
00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:26.160
With a face like that,
you ought to speak politely.

299
00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.037
Otherwise, forget about getting married.

300
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.790
My goodness.

301
00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.269
I'm so sorry. My apologies.

302
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.023
You should apologize... to her.

303
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.651
She'd been up all night
and was about to rest,

304
00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:01.904
but she couldn't catch her breath
before checking the security footage.

305
00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:09.078
I'm terribly sorry.

306
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:10.079
My apologies.

307
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:24.927
SE-JIN, SORRY ABOUT EARLIER
TEXT ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

308
00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:30.933
Put the phone down. Lights out.

309
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:32.643
Lights out now.

310
00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:35.646
Good night.

311
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:45.656
SE-JIN

312
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:50.870
Uncle, I'll go take this call.

313
00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:51.954
Han-gyul, take it here.

314
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.699
Beautiful.

315
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.916
Shiny and bright.

316
00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.501
So beautiful, like a star.

317
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.005
What?

318
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:49.804
What did you just say?

319
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.432
Seoul is different, huh?

320
00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:55.393
Look at the tower lights.

321
00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:57.228
Wow, awesome.

322
00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:16.372
Good night.

323
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:21.627
Let's sleep.

324
00:24:37.185 --> 00:24:38.728
<i>Doesn't she remember me yet?</i>

325
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.772
<i>How much does he remember?</i>

326
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:47.904
<i>She'll remember eventually.</i>

327
00:24:49.447 --> 00:24:51.908
<i>Maybe it's better to pretend</i>
<i>I don't remember.</i>

328
00:25:40.957 --> 00:25:42.041
I found her.

329
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.252
You found her?

330
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:47.296
You made a fuss that you couldn't,
but how?

331
00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:49.757
- Mom.
- You're here.

332
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.551
- Mom, did you lose weight?
- Really?

333
00:25:52.635 --> 00:25:53.761
You look gorgeous.

334
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:54.887
- Really?
- Yes.

335
00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:58.474
- You went to the salon?
- Yes, I did.

336
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.601
- Do I look pretty?
- Yes.

337
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:01.811
You too.

338
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:02.937
Thanks.

339
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.939
<i>It's too light to be a coincidence...</i>

340
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:11.487
Let me ask you as Se-jin's teacher.

341
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:14.073
Where is she right now?

342
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:16.993
<i>...and too heavy to be fate.</i>

343
00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:19.870
<i>I'd call it a meaningful connection.</i>

344
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:25.084
She lives in the same neighborhood
as the person I was looking for.

345
00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:27.169
Who? That jerk?

346
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.215
That dumb brute
who ran off with your money?

347
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:33.384
Where is she?

348
00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:36.220
Where the heck is she hiding?

349
00:26:36.304 --> 00:26:37.138
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

350
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:41.267
If Miss Bom cut ties with her family
on purpose, there must be a reason.

351
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.352
I can't get involved...

352
00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.938
- and hurt her even more.
- "Bom"?

353
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:48.607
My homeroom teacher?

354
00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:53.446
Anyway, I'll be in touch
once I'm in Seoul.

355
00:26:56.907 --> 00:26:57.783
Jjun.

356
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:01.120
Can't you be a lawyer here
instead of Seoul?

357
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:07.668
I said you asked me to come,
and Mom and Dad didn't nag me at all.

358
00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:10.838
If you help me with my studies,

359
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.424
I think I could beat Evil Han-gyul.
Please?

360
00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:15.176
First...

361
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:17.928
give me his address.

362
00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:19.055
Whose?

363
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:21.891
Han-gyul's uncle's?

364
00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:29.273
<i>Who cares if I remember or not?</i>

365
00:27:29.357 --> 00:27:30.733
<i>He won't know if I stay quiet.</i>

366
00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:36.238
<i>Yeah, I'll just keep my mouth shut</i>
<i>and try not to get involved with him.</i>

367
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:37.948
Didn't you lose your other half?

368
00:27:38.032 --> 00:27:39.241
Sorry?

369
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.994
I'll find my other half on my own.

370
00:27:42.078 --> 00:27:43.079
Where?

371
00:27:43.788 --> 00:27:45.539
- It's right here.
- What?

372
00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:48.376
There's nothing like hip-hop
on the way to work.

373
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:50.169
You have good taste in music.

374
00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:53.214
Why is my other earbud in your ear?

375
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.216
Han-gyul probably thought it was mine.

376
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.803
We were in Seoul during the weekend--

377
00:27:58.886 --> 00:28:01.722
Why are you whispering so loudly?

378
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:15.403
Darn it. I told him to bring an umbrella.

379
00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:34.004
Miss Bom, I heard everything earlier.

380
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.841
Did you go to Seoul with Sun Jae-gyu?

381
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.555
There was a reason behind it.

382
00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:44.098
Aren't you hurt?

383
00:28:45.975 --> 00:28:47.560
Mr. Sun isn't that kind of person.

384
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:49.395
What, are you defending him?

385
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:53.232
I'm not defending him.
I want to clear up the misunderstanding.

386
00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:57.361
He went to Seoul
to help Han-gyul's friend.

387
00:28:57.445 --> 00:29:00.781
He's the type to endure humiliation
even after saving a kid from drowning.

388
00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:03.742
We should also check

389
00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:06.245
if Mr. Hong really hurt his hand
because of Mr. Sun.

390
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:07.913
What's gotten into you?

391
00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:12.376
You spent just a few days together
and you've completely fallen for him.

392
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.212
Miss Bom.

393
00:29:15.296 --> 00:29:16.839
Take my advice.

394
00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:20.426
It's best to stay away from Sun Jae-gyu
if possible.

395
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.970
I've seen him downtown--

396
00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:24.263
What about Sun Jae-gyu?

397
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:25.222
Why?

398
00:29:26.056 --> 00:29:27.183
Did something happen?

399
00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.394
I mean...

400
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.106
just think about what he's like
all the time.

401
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.025
When it comes to Han-gyul,

402
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.944
he flips out and storms in here,
causing a scene.

403
00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:39.904
But with Han-gyul...

404
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:42.990
he's so caring and sweet.

405
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:46.368
Who would think he's his uncle?

406
00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.330
When he should have been out
meeting girls,

407
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:52.124
he didn't date anyone
because he was taking care of Han-gyul.

408
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.336
Gosh, no one could do that
even for their own kid.

409
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.923
Then it must be his own kid.

410
00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:01.175
What?

411
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.886
Gather around.

412
00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:13.395
It's fresh.

413
00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:15.022
<i>The other day, I was downtown</i>

414
00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:17.608
<i>and saw this guy with huge shoulders,</i>
<i>built like a tank,</i>

415
00:30:17.691 --> 00:30:19.818
<i>and a dragon tattoo running down his arm.</i>

416
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:23.489
<i>A guy that looked just like Sun Jae-gyu</i>
<i>was with some woman.</i>

417
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:24.865
<i>A woman?</i>

418
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:29.119
You've got some nerve
to ask about the kid.

419
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:33.749
<i>She was facing him</i>
<i>and going on about some kid.</i>

420
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.418
<i>She was crying her eyes out.</i>

421
00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.128
- Miss Seo.
- Yes.

422
00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:42.466
Is that true? Are you sure you saw it?

423
00:30:43.551 --> 00:30:47.930
Principal, who else in Shinsu
would walk around with a dragon tattoo

424
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:49.515
besides Sun Jae-gyu?

425
00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:51.725
Am I right?

426
00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:55.020
Looks can say a lot about someone.

427
00:30:55.104 --> 00:30:59.233
His eyes are all sharp
and his whole body oozes desire,

428
00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:00.818
hitting on one girl after another.

429
00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:04.071
He's tall and lanky, swaggering around.

430
00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:06.365
Anyone could tell
he's up to something scandalous.

431
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.284
Even so.

432
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.953
You said Han-gyul's mother passed away.

433
00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:14.748
There's no way to know
unless you check the family registry.

434
00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:15.666
Don't you think so?

435
00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:18.836
Am I right?

436
00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:20.796
Yes, that makes sense.

437
00:31:30.014 --> 00:31:32.141
THAT WOMAN

438
00:31:41.108 --> 00:31:42.067
What?

439
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:43.902
What the heck?

440
00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:48.616
Are you Kim Min-jae?

441
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:51.535
Why do you always get in my way?

442
00:31:58.042 --> 00:31:58.876
"Sorry"?

443
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:03.505
Do you have to say sorry
with a Nobel Prize-winning book?

444
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:05.966
I'm really sorry for telling the adults.

445
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.718
I wasn't trying to mess with you.

446
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:12.514
I just panicked when I heard
you'd sleep at some guy's house.

447
00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:13.849
Yeah, sure.

448
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.477
You need me, that's why.

449
00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:18.062
I need you?

450
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:20.773
Our class has 25 students.

451
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.400
If even one's missing,
you won't get Grade 1.

452
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.821
You need me beneath you
to keep your top grade safe.

453
00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:34.411
I know how you can get Grade 1.

454
00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:41.251
Are you...

455
00:32:44.004 --> 00:32:44.838
dying?

456
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.591
If I die, there'll be 24.

457
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:50.844
If you want to get Grade 1,
you need me, too.

458
00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:53.389
How am I supposed to do that?

459
00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:54.306
You just have to...

460
00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:56.600
beat me.

461
00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:03.315
Guess who won Usain Bolt's farewell race?

462
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:06.819
Gatlin, the one
who was always second to him.

463
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:11.490
Roger Deakins lost the Oscar
for cinematography 13 times

464
00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:12.825
before winning on the 14th.

465
00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.285
Nobody's second forever.

466
00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:16.995
You sure can beat me.

467
00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:19.331
But I just don't know how!

468
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:26.922
Here's the stuff most likely on the final.
Start here.

469
00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:30.384
You're doing this
knowing I can't beat you.

470
00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.261
It's because I want you to beat me.

471
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.178
Why?

472
00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:37.224
Why do you want me to beat you?

473
00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:45.733
Go over it.
I'll add the other subjects too.

474
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:48.152
Let's go.

475
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:53.574
I knew Se-jin and I
were on the same level.

476
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.493
Hermann Hesse's...

477
00:33:56.994 --> 00:33:59.204
<i>Mian. </i>Wow, it's a masterpiece.

478
00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:03.417
It's about a wounded soul learning to live
by forgiving others, you know.

479
00:34:04.293 --> 00:34:06.670
I'm embarrassed we were in the same womb.

480
00:34:07.254 --> 00:34:08.464
<i>What's this provocation?</i>

481
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:11.258
At least learn the title!

482
00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:14.011
This book is not <i>"Mian," </i>it's <i>"Daemian."</i>

483
00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:18.474
<i>"Dae" </i>means "super,"
so it means "super sorry."

484
00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:26.148
So, was the woman
who called him at the hotel

485
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:27.775
the same one Miss Seo saw?

486
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.279
But if Han-gyul is his son,
why would he pretend he's his nephew?

487
00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:35.949
I spent too much time with him.

488
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.995
It doesn't matter who he is to Han-gyul.
It's none of my business.

489
00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:50.380
What is he doing over there?

490
00:34:54.843 --> 00:34:56.011
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:22.579
Did he load up on supplements
or take steroids or something?

492
00:35:23.205 --> 00:35:25.541
Why does he get so fired up every night?

493
00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:34.716
Mr. Sun.

494
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.846
I've been trying to look the other way
regardless of what you do,

495
00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:42.266
but as a resident of Shinsu,
I can't really turn a blind eye.

496
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:45.978
The drains are city property,
so you shouldn't damage them.

497
00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:52.693
Goodness, it's big enough
for you to slip an arm in.

498
00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:54.403
- Is it?
- What?

499
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:55.946
Is it big enough?

500
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:21.847
Goodness, is it you again?

501
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.350
Now you recognize me.

502
00:36:25.434 --> 00:36:28.562
Oh, you know this puppy?

503
00:36:57.591 --> 00:37:00.594
Who left you here?
Were you caught in a landslide?

504
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.055
I followed your sound.

505
00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.182
It's okay.

506
00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:08.936
<i>I saved this little guy</i>
<i>during the landslide before.</i>

507
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.155
Are you lost?
Why are you alone? Come here.

508
00:37:20.948 --> 00:37:22.324
My goodness.

509
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.409
Are you okay?

510
00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:27.162
Wait.

511
00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:31.750
Looks like it hurt its leg.

512
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.088
What do we do? Is there a vet nearby?

513
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.108
Do you have something to dry it off?

514
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.992
- I do.
- Where?

515
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.373
PAWS & MEOW ANIMAL CLINIC

516
00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.924
What?

517
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.260
What's wrong?

518
00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:32.204
Working the night shift
is finally paying off tonight.

519
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.977
Why would you take your shirt off
to get it dry?

520
00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:58.105
It's shaking so much,
who cares about a shirt?

521
00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:59.022
Still...

522
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.733
This is a quick-dry shirt,
so it dries quickly.

523
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.527
Can you treat it?

524
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:04.986
Probably.

525
00:40:06.947 --> 00:40:09.783
Sure, just say the word.
We can do anything for you.

526
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:12.536
I think this little one hurt its leg,
please take a look.

527
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:14.371
And do a full check-up while we're here.

528
00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.999
The doctor's out birthing a calf.
You'll have to wait a bit.

529
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:22.337
Can you fill this out?

530
00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:25.298
Sure. Go have a seat.

531
00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:26.383
It's okay.

532
00:40:58.748 --> 00:41:00.625
Why's it taking so long?

533
00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:16.933
There's no need to hide it.

534
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:21.730
Scars aren't always a bad thing.

535
00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:25.066
They're proof of what you've endured.

536
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.203
Excuse me.

537
00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:38.163
You're Han-gyul's dad, right?

538
00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:42.667
Oh, he's Han-gyul's uncle, not his dad.

539
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:45.045
What? Yes, he is.

540
00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:48.673
You are Han-gyul's dad.

541
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:55.388
I've checked all the paperwork.

542
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:59.184
Paperwork? What do you mean?

543
00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:06.149
Say something, Mr. Sun.

544
00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:11.029
She's saying you're Han-gyul's dad
and not his uncle.

545
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.450
She's right.

546
00:42:17.285 --> 00:42:18.161
I am...

547
00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:22.249
Han-gyul's father.

548
00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:27.963
<i>His uncle is... his dad?</i>

549
00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:51.236
What?

550
00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:53.238
Take the umbrella.

551
00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:00.203
If you catch a cold from the rain,
you can't do well on the finals.

552
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.080
Why?

553
00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:05.667
Worried your grade will drop
if your pacemaker gives up?

554
00:43:07.836 --> 00:43:10.380
If I take this, how will you get home?

555
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:12.841
I'd still beat you
even if I get rained on.

556
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.141
Share it with me.

557
00:43:25.186 --> 00:43:27.689
If I beat you like this,
what will everyone think?

558
00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:31.151
They'll think I only won
because Evil Han-gyul caught a cold.

559
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:34.571
It's too small. You take it.

560
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:43.705
You can't get
a single drop of rain on you.

561
00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:45.332
That's how we keep it fair.

562
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:50.337
Stay healthy no matter what
until the exams.

563
00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:53.131
Understand? That's an order.

564
00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:24.788
{\an8}AWARD CERTIFICATE

565
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:27.707
{\an8}FILIAL PIETY AWARD

566
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:32.337
AWARD CERTIFICATE

567
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.922
It must have been hard...

568
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:38.051
for Se-jin.

569
00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:43.515
So, you came to give me a hard time?

570
00:44:49.562 --> 00:44:51.439
You're holding up better than I expected.

571
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:57.237
I even filed a fake complaint
just to find where you are.

572
00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:01.408
Here.

573
00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:05.995
You went through all that trouble
to find me.

574
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:07.455
This is why, right?

575
00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:09.999
It's three times as much as before.

576
00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:15.713
I figured I'd give it back someday,
so I put it in the same box.

577
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:19.050
It came in handy, thanks.

578
00:45:21.594 --> 00:45:22.595
So, you think...

579
00:45:25.265 --> 00:45:26.182
I spent ten years...

580
00:45:28.476 --> 00:45:29.519
looking for you...

581
00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:33.565
because of money?

582
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:38.153
What else do you want from me
other than money?

583
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:42.615
An apology.

584
00:45:44.826 --> 00:45:45.743
An apology?

585
00:45:48.663 --> 00:45:49.581
There's no apology.

586
00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:52.584
Money is all you'll get from me.

587
00:45:53.376 --> 00:45:54.711
Tell me if you want more.

588
00:46:19.736 --> 00:46:23.323
Evil Han-gyul thinks I'm a joke.

589
00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:25.366
He gave me his notebook this morning,

590
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.702
and now an umbrella
like I'm a charity case.

591
00:46:28.244 --> 00:46:32.290
He's looking down on me
because my grades suck, right?

592
00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:37.170
I wanted to forgive him,
but I want to take revenge now.

593
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.631
Tell me about it.

594
00:46:40.465 --> 00:46:42.592
Are you throwing money away?

595
00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:45.345
I'll recycle it, then.

596
00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:46.387
No.

597
00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:49.349
Leave it. I'll take it back later.

598
00:46:50.725 --> 00:46:55.063
This is just a performance
to vent my rage.

599
00:46:59.192 --> 00:47:00.235
Se-jin...

600
00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:02.820
you wanted to beat Han-gyul, right?

601
00:47:02.904 --> 00:47:04.280
I want to crush him.

602
00:47:04.364 --> 00:47:07.784
There's someone from that family
I'd love to crush, too.

603
00:47:09.077 --> 00:47:09.953
Han-gyul's uncle?

604
00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:14.332
- Team up?
- Absolutely.

605
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.668
By the way...

606
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.755
if we're going to work together,
don't you need to come to Shinsu?

607
00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:23.132
I need your help to beat Evil Han-gyul.

608
00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:28.263
I'm doing this to steal first place.

609
00:47:29.514 --> 00:47:30.348
But what about you?

610
00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:33.142
What are you planning to take
from his uncle?

611
00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.031
So the rumor about you...

612
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.160
being Han-gyul's dad was true?

613
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:57.000
That rumor... got out?

614
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:00.545
There's no way it could have.

615
00:48:02.297 --> 00:48:05.216
Otherwise, how would she know?
She said she checked the paperwork.

616
00:48:07.969 --> 00:48:08.845
Take a look.

617
00:48:15.018 --> 00:48:17.395
{\an8}PET CHECK-IN FORM

618
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:21.399
{\an8}NAME: HAN-GYUL
DAD: SUN JAE-GYU, MOM: YOON BOM

619
00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:24.902
Confirm that and then come in.

620
00:48:24.986 --> 00:48:26.237
Sure.

621
00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:32.744
When did you fill this in?

622
00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:34.996
And why am I its mom?

623
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:36.205
Then are you the dad?

624
00:48:37.832 --> 00:48:40.168
Even so, how could you write "Han-gyul"?

625
00:48:40.877 --> 00:48:43.963
Who in their right mind
names a random dog after their nephew?

626
00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:48.051
She suddenly asked me to write a name.
That's all I could think of.

627
00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:51.929
If you don't like it,
you can come up with something.

628
00:48:56.601 --> 00:48:59.687
See? I knew it.
You're drawing a blank, too, right?

629
00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:01.147
Geez.

630
00:49:04.192 --> 00:49:07.362
If you don't like Han-gyul,
let's go with Bom-sik.

631
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:09.697
Bom-sik, Yoon Bom's son. Nice.

632
00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:10.948
What if it's a girl?

633
00:49:11.032 --> 00:49:12.575
- It's a boy.
- Goodness.

634
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.455
Han-gyul's mom and dad, please come in.

635
00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:19.290
We just changed his name.

636
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:22.293
It's Bom-sik. Let's go, Bom-sik.

637
00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:33.429
Other than the small bruise,
there are no fractures or major problems,

638
00:49:33.513 --> 00:49:37.475
but due to poor nutrition,
he's showing signs of low blood sugar.

639
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:40.019
If he gets IV fluids and some rest,
he should be fine.

640
00:49:41.729 --> 00:49:43.523
So, what happens to him from here on?

641
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:49.237
We also take in stray animals,
so you can leave him with us...

642
00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.614
but he doesn't have a chip,

643
00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:53.741
so we need to put up a notice
to find the owner.

644
00:49:53.825 --> 00:49:55.993
What if the owner doesn't turn up?

645
00:49:57.954 --> 00:49:59.747
If no one shows up in ten days...

646
00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:03.876
What, are you saying you'd put him down?

647
00:50:06.129 --> 00:50:07.004
No.

648
00:50:07.088 --> 00:50:11.634
If the owner doesn't turn up,
please let us know. Please.

649
00:50:13.553 --> 00:50:16.556
We will. Don't worry and go eat something.

650
00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:22.019
He's perfectly fine.

651
00:50:23.813 --> 00:50:24.772
Open your eyes.

652
00:50:27.567 --> 00:50:28.943
Come in, honey.

653
00:50:29.902 --> 00:50:31.112
What did you just call me?

654
00:50:32.155 --> 00:50:34.699
You're Bom-sik's mom and I'm his dad.

655
00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:37.827
That makes us a couple, doesn't it?

656
00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:39.620
Honey.

657
00:50:40.246 --> 00:50:41.456
Welcome.

658
00:50:42.457 --> 00:50:43.583
My goodness.

659
00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:46.794
Oh, my. You came with your wife today.

660
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.047
I'm not his wife. I'm his kid's teacher.

661
00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:51.466
What would you like?

662
00:50:53.426 --> 00:50:55.887
Everything's made of flour here.

663
00:50:56.512 --> 00:50:58.848
Ma'am, don't you have something healthy?

664
00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:02.518
My goodness.
You take really good care of your wife.

665
00:51:02.602 --> 00:51:03.770
I'm jealous.

666
00:51:04.645 --> 00:51:08.357
Our kid hurt his leg,
so my wife hasn't had a single bite.

667
00:51:08.441 --> 00:51:09.567
She's been starving.

668
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.485
Poor thing.

669
00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:13.696
How could a mom even eat
when her kid is sick?

670
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.364
- How many kids?
- One.

671
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.866
- A girl?
- A boy.

672
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:19.368
Oh, dear. Then you better have a daughter.

673
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:23.539
Sons are a pain to raise.
They just cause problems.

674
00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:25.958
My point exactly.

675
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:29.712
I've been pushing for one more kid.
She's been saying no.

676
00:51:29.796 --> 00:51:32.298
Excuse me,
aren't you going to take our order?

677
00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:33.382
Hold on.

678
00:51:33.466 --> 00:51:36.219
I made some beef bone broth
during the day.

679
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:41.682
I'll whip up a hearty dumpling soup
especially for your wife.

680
00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:43.100
It'll give you some strength,

681
00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:45.478
so have a girl with your husband.

682
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.896
Okay?

683
00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:49.315
Geez.

684
00:52:13.256 --> 00:52:14.715
Are you free tomorrow evening?

685
00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:17.385
Do you want to check out
my workplace again?

686
00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:19.053
As long as Han-gyul's free.

687
00:52:20.012 --> 00:52:21.264
Han-gyul's not coming.

688
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:25.393
Let's meet, just us.

689
00:52:27.812 --> 00:52:28.938
Just the two of us?

690
00:52:31.107 --> 00:52:32.108
Let's have a drink.

691
00:52:41.367 --> 00:52:42.743
No way. Unbelievable.

692
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:45.371
Are you serious?

693
00:52:45.997 --> 00:52:47.748
No, wait.

694
00:52:47.832 --> 00:52:50.418
So, the girl you're interested in

695
00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:54.088
asked you out for drinks tonight?
Alone, just the two of you?

696
00:52:54.964 --> 00:52:57.133
She's not someone I'm interested in.

697
00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:58.634
She's just someone I know.

698
00:52:58.718 --> 00:52:59.969
Either way,

699
00:53:00.052 --> 00:53:02.555
she must've asked you
because she's interested in you.

700
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:05.349
I guess she's in the mood for a drink.

701
00:53:05.933 --> 00:53:07.351
You really have no clue, do you?

702
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:10.521
You think "Want to stay for coffee?"
actually means coffee?

703
00:53:10.605 --> 00:53:13.441
You think "Want to rest a bit?"
means just rest?

704
00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:15.693
Wait a minute.

705
00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:19.155
You haven't been
taking everything she said

706
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:21.574
literally like that, have you?

707
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.247
"Why do you take everything literally?"

708
00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:30.958
She did say that to me.

709
00:53:31.042 --> 00:53:32.501
So you have been doing that.

710
00:53:32.585 --> 00:53:34.086
See? So, listen.

711
00:53:35.171 --> 00:53:38.382
You should've noticed
the tone of her voice

712
00:53:38.466 --> 00:53:39.884
and the nuances in her actions.

713
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:44.472
Come here.

714
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:47.934
That brat.

715
00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:56.400
Here.

716
00:53:57.526 --> 00:53:58.444
Boss.

717
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:12.583
Wait, it's so good.

718
00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.251
Have some, boss.

719
00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:27.723
Nuances...
How am I supposed to figure those out?

720
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:34.146
When you saw her, how was she dressed?

721
00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:39.151
It kind of looked like
she put in extra effort, right?

722
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:44.365
Didn't she wear a light, fluttery dress
with her hair nicely done?

723
00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:46.492
She always looks ready for a funeral.

724
00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:50.830
Doesn't she smile constantly
and find you funny?

725
00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:53.165
She always clenches her jaw tightly.

726
00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:55.084
Doesn't she give compliments over nothing?

727
00:54:55.167 --> 00:54:56.836
She loves to nitpick and complain.

728
00:54:56.919 --> 00:55:00.464
No, I'm sure she must've given you clues,
but you didn't catch any.

729
00:55:00.548 --> 00:55:01.465
Then...

730
00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:04.010
look carefully from now on.

731
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:06.971
"Let's have a drink."

732
00:55:07.054 --> 00:55:12.435
It's definitely an approval.

733
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.251
That's nonsense.

734
00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:39.962
What approval?

735
00:55:45.176 --> 00:55:47.178
<i>There's no need to hide it.</i>

736
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:52.975
<i>Scars aren't always a bad thing.</i>

737
00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:55.811
<i>They're proof of what you've endured.</i>

738
00:56:13.454 --> 00:56:15.998
Is it the coffee I had?
Why is my heart racing?

739
00:56:18.334 --> 00:56:19.418
Jae-gyu!

740
00:56:28.344 --> 00:56:33.474
<i>She looked like she put in</i>
<i>extra effort to look nice, right?</i>

741
00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:08.884
Open up.

742
00:57:12.638 --> 00:57:14.682
- Do you need handyman work?
- No.

743
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.392
- Do you need to move heavy stuff?
- No.

744
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:20.020
Is there someone to take care of, then?

745
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:21.730
No, not at all.

746
00:57:21.814 --> 00:57:23.858
It's nothing like that, so stop glaring.

747
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:26.735
Open up.

748
00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:30.656
Then why are you suddenly
making a wrap for me I wonder.

749
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.117
- Forget it then.
- Here.

750
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.996
Open up.

751
00:57:42.293 --> 00:57:44.211
How is it? Is it good?

752
00:57:47.423 --> 00:57:49.592
It tastes good, but...

753
00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:52.553
it feels like it might not sit well.

754
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:57.308
Wait.

755
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.056
That's better.

756
00:58:39.141 --> 00:58:40.601
Shall we have a drink?

757
00:58:42.394 --> 00:58:43.520
Cheers!

758
00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:47.608
Cheers.

759
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.715
IF YOU DRINK THIS,
WE'LL BECOME A COUPLE

760
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:21.225
Nuances.

761
00:59:22.518 --> 00:59:23.477
Nuances.

762
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.436
Right.

763
00:59:25.104 --> 00:59:29.817
Green Narae has decided to visit
the company you work for,

764
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.568
so make sure you're ready.

765
00:59:31.652 --> 00:59:32.486
Really?

766
00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:34.363
No preliminary visit?

767
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:37.199
After spending some time with you...

768
00:59:37.825 --> 00:59:40.411
I can tell you're trustworthy
and righteous.

769
00:59:41.245 --> 00:59:43.330
There's no reason
not to visit your company.

770
00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:45.749
Well, wait.

771
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.628
<i>She gives compliments over nothing.</i>

772
00:59:53.674 --> 00:59:55.092
You see...

773
00:59:58.137 --> 01:00:01.515
I think I know why you're like this.

774
01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:05.311
Did you know?

775
01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.526
Do you...

776
01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:19.033
Well...

777
01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.160
Do you...

778
01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:25.122
Miss Bom, do you...

779
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:40.554
You're right.

780
01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:58.549
{\an8}I thought about
why I kept letting you get to me.

781
01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.384
{\an8}Hide.

782
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.219
{\an8}There's Camil Coffee on Rodeo Street.

783
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.221
{\an8}That's my favorite coffee shop.

784
01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:05.514
{\an8}<i>She has no clue how I feel.</i>

785
01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:07.349
{\an8}<i>Who's he going to beat up today?</i>

786
01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:11.562
{\an8}Medals for everyone
on the winning team, yes or no?

787
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.479
{\an8}Yes!

788
01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.982
{\an8}Bom-sik, I'll get the medal for you.

789
01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.609
{\an8}<i>Make sure everyone's ready, okay?</i>

790
01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:19.736
<i>The homeroom teacher!</i>

791
01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.620
