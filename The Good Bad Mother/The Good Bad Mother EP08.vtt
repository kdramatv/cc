No, Mom.

13
00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.911
Mom...

14
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.512
No, Mom.

Kang-ho...

16
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.561
Kang-ho.

17
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.214
Kang-ho, you're...

18
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.191
You're...

19
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.328
Kang-ho...

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.902
You just...

21
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.920
stood up, right?

22
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.035
Honey...

23
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.079
Our son... Thank you.

24
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.263
Thank you.

25
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.349
Thank you.

26
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.729
Kang-ho, do it again.

27
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.525
Stand up again.

28
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.161
Kang-ho, that was...

29
00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.733
Kang-ho.

30
00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.501
Kang-ho.

31
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.863
Kang-ho.

32
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.713
Kang-ho!

33
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.633
Kang-ho.

34
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.470
Kang-ho!

35
00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.430
Kang-ho!

36
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.626
Kang-ho!

37
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.560
Kang-ho!

39
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.274
{\an8}Let me see your fingernail.

40
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.441
{\an8}I fixed it for now,

41
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.917
{\an8}but it could chip again.

42
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.710
Here.

43
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.740
I'll mark it with this nail polish,

44
00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:46.175
so be careful with this fingernail, okay?

45
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.848
My mom abandoned me.

46
00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.395
She took me to an unfamiliar place...

47
00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.982
and left without me to go somewhere nice.

48
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.053
Your mom...

49
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.904
would never abandon you.

50
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.573
However,

51
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.700
if she really...

52
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.578
did such a thing,

53
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.457
I'm sure she had a reason.

54
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.402
A reason?

55
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.961
Yes.

56
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.382
She may be unable to tell you now,

57
00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:30.594
but someday you'll understand everything.

58
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.850
Mi-joo, how do you know that?

59
00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.440
Because I was abandoned too.

60
00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:46.777
You were?

61
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:50.572
Why?

62
00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.825
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.649
I also really want to know...

64
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.750
why I was abandoned.

65
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.422
But I'll never know.

66
00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.889
Kang-ho!

67
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.183
Kang-ho.

68
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.776
Kang-ho.

69
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.028
About what happened...

70
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.961
What's the reason?

71
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.032
What?

72
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.841
Why did you abandon me?

73
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.746
Mi-joo told me...

74
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.430
that there must be a reason for that.

75
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.187
Kang-ho.

76
00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.273
I never...

77
00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.109
abandoned you.

78
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.996
Kang-ho, look at me.

79
00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.458
Look at me. Please?

80
00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:31.715
I'll be honest.

81
00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.969
Kang-ho, the thing is...

82
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.847
I'm actually...

83
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.308
a bit unwell.

84
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.007
You are?

85
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.649
Where?

86
00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:50.943
Here.

87
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.696
My stomach hurts a bit.

88
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:01.230
Because I'm unwell, I need to take
medicine and go to the hospital.

89
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.332
Someone needs to cook, do the
laundry, and look after me.

90
00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.001
But...

91
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.297
I didn't want to burden you.

92
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.758
That's why.

93
00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.055
Was I a burden to you...

94
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.934
because I'm unwell?

95
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.271
What?

96
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.650
You fed me medicine and took me to the hospital.

97
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.486
You cooked and did my laundry too.

98
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:39.116
To me, you're just my mom.

99
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.998
But I must've been a burden to you.

100
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.924
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.968
I was wrong.

102
00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.470
You're right.

103
00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:04.349
I'm your mom,

104
00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:06.920
and you're my son.

105
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.646
I was so stupid to think that way.

106
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.763
Besides, you're no longer unwell.

107
00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:19.016
You definitely stood up earlier.

108
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.893
And soon enough,

109
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.161
you'll be able to walk and run.

110
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.246
And...

111
00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.832
you'll be able to take care of me.

112
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.487
That's right.

113
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.282
I also have a guardian now, don't I?

114
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.299
"Guardian"?

115
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.468
Yes.

116
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:44.348
You're my guardian now.

117
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.018
Your guardian.

118
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.223
So Kang-ho,

119
00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.615
try to stand up...

120
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.953
like you did earlier.

121
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.915
It's okay. You can do it.

122
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.708
Take your time and try it again.

123
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.350
Okay.

124
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.430
Don't give up. You're almost there.

125
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:43.031
A bit more.

126
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.144
I can't do it.

127
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:49.454
No, you did. You already did.

128
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.025
Get up, Kang-ho.

129
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:53.583
Get up.

130
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.969
Don't leave me, Mom.

131
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.600
Mom, where are we going?

132
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.523
No. I don't want to go.

133
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.861
Can't I just live with you? Please?

134
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.904
Mom.

135
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.951
Mom.

136
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.688
Mom!

137
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.663
Mom!

138
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.168
Mom!

139
00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.529
Mom!

140
00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:40.198
Mom! Save me!

141
00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.923
Do you want to live?

142
00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.076
Do you?

143
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.370
- Mom!
- Then get up.

144
00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:48.013
Stand up like you did earlier!

145
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.002
- Mom!
- Get up!

146
00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.920
- Kang-ho, look!
- Mom!

147
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.381
If you stand up,

148
00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.592
the water will be only knee-deep!

149
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.093
- Mom.
- So get up!

150
00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:02.137
Stand up!

151
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.821
Mom.

152
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:09.227
Mom!

153
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.104
The wheelchair is gone.

154
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:12.439
So get up.

155
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.691
Get up and walk!

156
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:17.501
I can't...

157
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.409
It's not that you can't. You just won't.

158
00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.953
That's not true.

159
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:29.331
I can't do it, Mom.

160
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.249
- Really?
- Mom!

161
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.475
Really?

162
00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.546
Mom!

163
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.756
- Get up.
- Mom!

164
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.883
- Mom!
- Get up!

165
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:43.970
- Mom!
- Get up and walk!

166
00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:45.597
Mom!

167
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.724
Get up!

168
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.450
Mom...

169
00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:58.083
Hold him by his pelvis...

170
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.742
Mom...

171
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.926
Get up.

172
00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:10.428
All right.

173
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.750
It's okay. You can do it.

174
00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:14.835
Get up.

175
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.102
- You're doing well.
- A bit more. Your left foot.

176
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.825
That's it.

177
00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.145
Your legs.

178
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.855
Move your legs!

179
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.955
I can't move them.

180
00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:44.129
Slowly. Good.

181
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:47.784
Well done.

182
00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.286
- Well done.
- You're doing well.

183
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.636
Slowly.

184
00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.597
Gosh!

185
00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.941
- Move them.
- Mom.

186
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.679
I can move them, Mom.

187
00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:08.805
Mom.

188
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:12.032
Well done. More.

189
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.915
- I don't want to!

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.374
- Come here.
- <i>...received the highest votes...</i>

191
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.312
- Kang-ho!
- <i>...in the preliminary elections.</i>

192
00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:39.870
Mr. Son!

193
00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.251
Come here, Kang-ho.

194
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.711
Kang-ho.

195
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.933
She's already been through so much hardship.

196
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.852
With her son in that state,

197
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.145
and now her farm in ruins,

198
00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.398
she must be in so much distress.

199
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.900
I can't believe I made such a fuss...

200
00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:47.904
trying to get rid of her pig farm.

201
00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:50.115
I deserve to die.

202
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.116
That's true.

203
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.841
What?

204
00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.289
Don't say that.

205
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.875
We're all to blame.

206
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.309
No one here is innocent.

207
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:06.339
I should visit and console her,

208
00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:10.886
but I feel too ashamed to do that.

209
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.179
Speaking of which,

210
00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:15.849
as her neighbors,

211
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.226
we should be doing something to help her.

212
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.315
Then should we all pitch in some money for her?

213
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.735
You know her. She'd never accept it.

214
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.988
I agree. Instead of giving her money,

215
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.324
how about we give her a gift?

216
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:36.369
Perhaps some nice sheet masks,
clothes, or a luxury bag.

217
00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:39.414
She's been giving away everything she owns.

218
00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.291
I doubt she'll be happy.

219
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.876
What's she giving away?

220
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.310
Did she give you something?

221
00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.715
- Did she give you something?
- No.

222
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.066
That's not it.

223
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.552
What I mean is that...

224
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:56.765
she's not the type...

225
00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:00.185
to want nice clothes or bags.

226
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:06.039
Her only desire is to dote
on her one-and-only son.

227
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.860
Why don't we get Kang-ho a gift instead?

228
00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.154
Goodness, that's a great idea.

229
00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:12.113
Right.

230
00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.575
Then what about a new wheelchair?

231
00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:19.829
I saw she'd thrown out his
broken wheelchair a few days ago.

232
00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:23.083
Then don't you think she
would've already bought a new one?

233
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.126
- Right.
- You think so?

234
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.796
Since he can't go anywhere without it.

235
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.381
That's true.

236
00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:34.678
Then how about we get him a mobility scooter?

237
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.223
It won't break since it's sturdy.

238
00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:41.309
The roads here are very rough.

239
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.535
It's perfect!

240
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.940
You sure are an early adopter.

241
00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:47.983
I'm all for it.

242
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.151
- Me too!
- We all are!

243
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:53.670
- Then let's get one, already.
- Okay.

244
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.199
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Jin Young-soon

247
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.807
Mr. Soh.

248
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.728
You startled me.

249
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:14.092
You jerk. I told you not to barge in like that.

250
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.651
- We finally have it.
- What?

251
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.532
Are you serious?

252
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.701
Where?

253
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:27.662
Where is it?

254
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.068
Look at this.

255
00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:33.835
We finally have...

256
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.171
a lettuce leaf.

257
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.840
So...

258
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.177
you didn't mean evidence.

259
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:48.418
You meant lettuce leaves.

260
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:50.170
The evidence?

261
00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:53.673
But sir, look. We went through
the effort of planting them.

262
00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:57.844
At times, we forgot to water
them or spray pesticides.

263
00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.930
But look how they've grown.

264
00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:02.572
So...

265
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:04.976
you're elated.

266
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.186
Right?

267
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.147
Yes, sir. I'm very happy.

268
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:12.707
It's the first time I've planted
something and seen it grow.

269
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.278
- Take a closer look.
- Don't come near me.

270
00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:16.488
Don't!

271
00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.239
Get out!

272
00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.991
Go!

273
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:21.451
You punk!

274
00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:23.718
Leave!

275
00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:26.623
What are you talking about?

276
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.166
We aren't qualified?

277
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.003
We're young, healthy men who
decided to farm in the countryside.

278
00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:34.506
We've completed the required course too.

279
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.799
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

280
00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:38.843
<i>But both of the applicants are
employed in a conglomerate...</i>

281
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:42.097
<i>and covered by social insurance,
therefore aren't eligible for this loan.</i>

282
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.891
What on earth are you talking about?

283
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.783
Then what about me?

284
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.311
What should I do?

285
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:49.869
<i>Sorry?</i>

286
00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:51.189
<i>What are you...?</i>

287
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.608
I'll die if I don't pay them back soon.

288
00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.567
And it'll be messy.

289
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.486
They'll tear out my liver, kidneys, eyes,

290
00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.240
lungs, intestines, duodenum,
and everything else...

291
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:03.383
piece by piece, and that's how I'll end up...

292
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:12.919
I should just die.

293
00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.337
I should just die.

294
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:18.022
I should just die.

295
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:21.386
I should just die.

296
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.278
I should just die.

297
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.947
What are you looking for?

298
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.685
Are there any pesticides?

299
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.827
I want to kill myself.

300
00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.162
It's down there.

301
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.248
What?

302
00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:40.378
Mix two tablespoons of this in one <i>mal</i> of water.

303
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.658
Okay.

304
00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.717
This one too.

305
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.998
Here's your insecticide.

306
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.249
- Thank you.
- Sure.

307
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.641
- Bye.
- Bye.

308
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.218
Goodness.

309
00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:04.846
What is this? Is this for me?

310
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.014
Are you senile?

311
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.016
What? What's wrong with me?

312
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.685
Is looking for romance at my age so wrong?

313
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.687
Gosh.

314
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:17.108
This countryside has been
teeming with old ladies.

315
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:20.111
- All the men around here are excited...
- Does it hurt?

316
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:24.422
...to see such a young, pretty lady.

317
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.035
Mi-joo has been treating everyone...

318
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.163
in this village well.

319
00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:33.041
Thanks to her, I have more customers now.

320
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.433
She's my lucky charm.

321
00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.462
Hey, young lady.

322
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:40.215
Are you interested in opening a nail salon...

323
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.760
in a bigger and cleaner place?

324
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.137
I could easily get you...

325
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.933
the best spot in this area.

326
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:51.574
What do you say?

327
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.854
Thank you for the offer, but I like this place.

328
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:59.499
I have many regulars, and
the owners here are so lovely.

329
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:01.945
Did you hear that?

330
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:07.548
Don't even dream of stealing her from me.

331
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.218
Shouldn't you get going?

332
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.220
Excuse me.

333
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:13.706
Hi, Mom.

334
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.125
Mom, Dad is here.

335
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:19.978
What? What are you talking
about? Why would he be here?

336
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:23.591
- <i>I'm working, so call me later.</i>
- I'm not lying. I know his face.

337
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.301
He drove a Banz here.

338
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.485
I'm certain it's him.

339
00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:32.156
Stop here please.

340
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.018
Mom!

341
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.785
Mom!

342
00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:38.856
Mom, hurry!

343
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.775
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

344
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.485
You need to hurry!

345
00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:46.030
Grandma is beating Dad up right now!

346
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:48.574
He's being beaten up!

347
00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:51.327
You darn son of a gun!

348
00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:54.038
I know it's you! Stop lying!

349
00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:55.541
- What's wrong?
- You're the guy...

350
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.208
who abandoned my daughter!

351
00:21:57.232 --> 00:21:58.334
That's not me.

352
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.003
Don't dare lie!

353
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:03.646
You don't think I know your face?

354
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.843
I set a picture of you...

355
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.777
as the wallpaper on my phone.

356
00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:14.100
I wanted to make sure to
recognize you so I can beat you up.

357
00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:15.977
I only took that because she asked me to.

358
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.020
Stop lying!

359
00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:19.147
Darn it. And that's not even the U.S.

360
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.290
We took that in Seoul.

361
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.652
Be quiet.

362
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.653
The kids will hear.

363
00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:28.755
- Dad!
- Dad!

364
00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.830
The kids think you're their dad.

365
00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.457
You can't show up like this.

366
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.000
Pay me back.

367
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.463
- Sun-young borrowed that money.
- I don't want to hear it.

368
00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.855
You have until the end of the month.

369
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.633
If you don't,

370
00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:51.596
I'll tell those ladies who
are dying to find you...

371
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.446
that you're here.

372
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.920
What? What's wrong?

373
00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.964
Where is Dad?

374
00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.300
Dad?

375
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:15.870
He left.

376
00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.622
He left?

377
00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:19.248
Where did he go?

378
00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:20.807
To the U.S.

379
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.351
The U.S.?

380
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.881
Something urgent came up, so he had to.

381
00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:29.340
He said he was sorry for
leaving without saying goodbye,

382
00:23:29.364 --> 00:23:32.095
- and that when he returns...
- I hate you both.

383
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.862
I won't go to kindergarten anymore.

384
00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:38.241
Ye-jin.

385
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.271
There's this boy named
Park Jun-seo at our kindergarten.

386
00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:44.816
He always teases her for not having a dad,

387
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.318
so they always get into fights.

388
00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:49.386
So we were going to bring Dad along tomorrow...

389
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.738
and teach him a lesson.

390
00:23:53.473 --> 00:23:55.341
But not anymore.

391
00:23:55.892 --> 00:23:58.344
Seo-jin.

392
00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:00.748
It's me.

393
00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:04.767
The hen I told you to prepare,
I don't need it anymore.

394
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.818
Darn it.

395
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:20.324
The kids kept saying they
wanted to see their dad.

396
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:25.913
So I asked my friend's boyfriend
to video-call them a few times.

397
00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:28.833
Mom.

398
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:30.945
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.753
Don't be.

400
00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:37.383
It's not like I've been a
model parent to you anyway.

401
00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:41.721
I'm the one who started all this,

402
00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:43.916
so you don't have to apologize to me.

403
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.725
It's just that...

404
00:24:46.234 --> 00:24:47.628
those kids...

405
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:50.229
will be going to school soon.

406
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.801
Once they see the family register
and find out they don't have a dad,

407
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:56.193
they'll be so heartbroken.

408
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:03.102
I thought of telling them
that you guys got a divorce,

409
00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.146
or that he died of an illness.

410
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.372
I thought long and hard too.

411
00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:10.333
But...

412
00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:12.320
I just can't do it.

413
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:16.699
I can't bear the thought of making them cry.

414
00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:21.469
They'll both bawl. How
can I possibly watch that?

415
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:24.749
They must be so heartbroken right now,

416
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:28.044
and bawling their eyes out.

417
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:31.896
My babies...

418
00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:34.342
- No way!
- No way!

419
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.469
Is this for Kang-ho?

420
00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.012
Yes, what do you think?

421
00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.472
Isn't it incredible?

422
00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:41.933
It's a bit small for three.

423
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.809
What are you talking about?

424
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.394
You shouldn't ride it!

425
00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:46.437
It's just for him!

426
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:48.439
Don't raise your voice at them.

427
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:50.900
- They could get hurt.
- He's right. You could get hurt.

428
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.694
Kids, this is very expensive.

429
00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:55.613
So you shouldn't ride it, okay?

430
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.073
- Okay.
- Good boy.

431
00:25:57.097 --> 00:26:00.284
The wheels are huge, and it looks so sturdy.

432
00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:01.661
Kang-ho will love it.

433
00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.454
- Right.
- Of course.

434
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:06.540
This will save Young-soon the hassle too.

435
00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:08.584
I'm glad we got it.

436
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:10.211
- Right.
- Hey, it's Mi-joo.

437
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.004
- Hi, Mi-joo.
- Gosh.

438
00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:14.340
Look who's here. It's Mi-joo.

439
00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.176
Did you close your salon today for this?

440
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.719
Sorry?

441
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.847
Goodness, you must be busy
with so many customers.

442
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:24.475
How considerate of you.

443
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:27.353
But then again, she's
always cared for Kang-ho...

444
00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:29.814
- since they were kids.
- That's true.

445
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.858
And Sam-sik always bullied Kang-ho.

446
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:33.859
What...?

447
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:35.945
What on earth are you talking about?

448
00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:40.241
Sam-sik never bullied Kang-ho.

449
00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.534
He did. Be quiet.

450
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:45.538
Anyway, now that everyone's here, let's go.

451
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:47.081
- All right.
- Let's go.

452
00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.666
- Move aside.
- Let's go!

453
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.626
- You're going to hurt yourself!
- Go.

454
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.253
All right.

455
00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:55.104
- Look at him.
- Goodness!

456
00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:57.758
I need to go back to the salon now.

457
00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.385
After they complimented you?

458
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:02.445
- What?
- Be quiet and follow me.

459
00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:04.739
Mom...

460
00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.896
We can't make any mistakes this time.

461
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.149
Do something stupid once again,

462
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:15.693
and you'll see lettuce roots...

463
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.987
instead of leaves.

464
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:19.697
Roots?

465
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.298
But the roots are underground...

466
00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:26.385
Yes, sir.

467
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:43.486
Hey, hide!

468
00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.780
Over there!

469
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:53.454
Where in the world are they after messing me up?

470
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:55.649
And why aren't they picking up?

471
00:27:55.673 --> 00:27:57.360
Darn it.

472
00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.569
All right.

473
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:00.780
Gosh, it's so fascinating.

474
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:03.240
- Be careful! You'll trip and fall!
- Make way!

475
00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:05.576
- Make way!
- Make way!

476
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.244
Make way!

477
00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:09.038
Hey!

478
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:11.332
All right.

479
00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:14.251
- Make way!
- Make way!

480
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:17.686
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

481
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:21.982
Wait, why am I hiding?

482
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.195
I'll ask her to open the gates.

483
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.655
Why aren't you picking up?

484
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.156
- Hey...
- Wait.

485
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.908
- What is it?
- Hold on.

486
00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:50.079
Don't you think it'd be too boring...

487
00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:52.164
to just hand it over to him?

488
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:53.582
- Boring?
- What do you mean?

489
00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:54.875
- Yes.
- How about...

490
00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:58.921
you all line up in two rows?

491
00:28:58.945 --> 00:29:00.381
- Both ways?
- Yes.

492
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.717
- Like a wedding.
- I see.

493
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:05.052
- Go on.
- Like this?

494
00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:10.891
I'll be hiding in that corner, okay?

495
00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:14.019
Once Kang-ho comes out,

496
00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:16.188
I want you to shout out his name.

497
00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:18.607
That'll be my cue.

498
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:23.502
- Then I'll appear with this scooter.
- What are they doing?

499
00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:25.740
- I love it.
- Great.

500
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:28.409
You sure are the brains around here.

501
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.885
You're flattering me.

502
00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.872
Anyway, give me my cue.

503
00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:35.082
All right. "Kang-ho!"

504
00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:38.252
Gosh, they're so over-the-top.

505
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.838
Young-soon!

506
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.882
Are you home?

507
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:44.607
Young-soon!

508
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.734
Young-soon.

509
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.986
I'm coming.

510
00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.287
What brings you all here?

511
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:00.080
Goodness.

512
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.151
Mr. Son.

513
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:05.878
It must've been so tough for you.

514
00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.615
As the old saying goes,

515
00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:11.952
"Neighbors are worth a thousand homes."

516
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.371
But none of us are well-off enough...

517
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:16.916
to help you out.

518
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.810
We also thought you'd need
some time to cope with your loss.

519
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:23.964
It may sound like an excuse,

520
00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:26.982
but we finally mustered
up the courage to see you.

521
00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:29.637
We're truly...

522
00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.612
sorry.

523
00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:34.308
Don't say that.

524
00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:37.603
I'm the one who should be sorry
for inconveniencing the village.

525
00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:39.563
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

526
00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:41.607
- We're sorry.
- Enough.

527
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:45.528
We apologized, and you accepted our apology.

528
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:47.530
We're good now, okay?

529
00:30:47.554 --> 00:30:48.572
Sure.

530
00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.115
Where is Kang-ho?

531
00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:52.243
We haven't seen him in a while.

532
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.619
We miss him.

533
00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.204
- Kang-ho?
- Yes.

534
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.914
One minute.

535
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.415
Kang-ho.

536
00:30:58.439 --> 00:30:59.625
Kang-ho, come on out.

537
00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:00.543
All right now.

538
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.711
- Should we get him?
- We should.

539
00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:04.645
No, stay here.

540
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:49.258
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

541
00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:50.593
Goodness.

542
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.887
- Goodness...
- This is great.

543
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.471
I'm so happy for you!

544
00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:56.223
Goodness!

545
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.700
- Goodness...
- This is unbelievable.

546
00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:02.855
Kang-ho!

547
00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.231
I'm coming!

548
00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.733
Goodness.

549
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.402
Goodness, this is amazing.

550
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:11.337
I'm so grateful.

551
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:13.073
Goodness...

552
00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.283
- Goodness!
- Hey!

553
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:16.508
Mr. Bang!

554
00:32:17.478 --> 00:32:18.454
Dad!

555
00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.497
- Dad!
- No! Move aside!

556
00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:22.458
Honey, where does it hurt?

557
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:23.709
Where?

558
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.169
- My legs!
- Your legs?

559
00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:26.420
Are you okay?

560
00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.880
- Goodness.
- What do I do?

561
00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:30.007
- Hi, Sam-sik.
- Are my legs okay?

562
00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:31.842
Hold on. No.

563
00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:33.677
- Call 119!
- Call 119!

564
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:35.861
- Call 119!
- Hurry!

565
00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.319
They say sunshine comes after the rain.

566
00:32:40.343 --> 00:32:44.063
God must've been moved by
your mom's perseverance and love.

567
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.316
That's why He's given you this miracle.

568
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.317
I agree.

569
00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:51.737
And He's given me this mobility scooter.

570
00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:55.839
You should be grateful for it.
That was a close call.

571
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.579
You two from Seoul, eat up.

572
00:33:00.603 --> 00:33:01.622
Thank you.

573
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.514
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

574
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.434
Hey.

575
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.437
Focus and look around carefully.

576
00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:14.176
We didn't come here to drink <i>makgeolli.</i>

577
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.151
Yes, sir.

578
00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:25.437
A little bird told me...

579
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:28.288
you work for a conglomerate.

580
00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:31.652
How did you know we work for Woobyeok Group?

581
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.611
What?

582
00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:34.488
I didn't know that.

583
00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:37.256
Gosh, you work for Woobyeok Group?

584
00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:42.261
Then you should've told me sooner.

585
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.164
Hold on.

586
00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:46.890
If that's the case,

587
00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:48.934
why do you want to farm?

588
00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:51.380
We've retired.

589
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:52.840
Did you?

590
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.550
I see.

591
00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:58.345
Don't you usually receive a severance?

592
00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:02.156
You see, I have a really great business idea.

593
00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:04.867
Listen up.

594
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.860
Look who's here.

595
00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.945
It's Mi-joo, my love.

596
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.280
Say hello.

597
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:18.741
These two are my future business partners.

598
00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:20.743
And she'll be my future...

599
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:24.663
Can't you see everyone is working?
Get some <i>makgeolli</i> from the kitchen.

600
00:34:24.687 --> 00:34:26.680
Enjoy.

601
00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:28.500
That's her charm.

602
00:34:28.524 --> 00:34:31.003
The straightforwardness and jabs.

603
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:34.548
I'll invite you to our wedding,
so make sure you come.

604
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.592
- We'll talk about our business later.
- Okay.

605
00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:38.844
I'll give them to the kids.

606
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:41.430
Kids, there's more.

607
00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:43.447
Eat up.

608
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:54.041
Wait.

609
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:57.294
Look.

610
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.506
I'm all better now.

611
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.382
You're right.

612
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.260
You're all better now. I'm glad.

613
00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.515
Wait.

614
00:35:12.568 --> 00:35:14.394
My mom said...

615
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.064
she didn't abandon me.

616
00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.927
So I'm sure...

617
00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:23.946
that person didn't abandon you either.

618
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.030
Here you go.

619
00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:42.783
We used to be similar in height.

620
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.910
But you're much taller now.

621
00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:47.886
Tell me about it. You're like an adult.

622
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:49.081
Here.

623
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:52.140
If I do this, you're taller than me.

624
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.896
All right.

625
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.927
What is this? Why do I have butterflies?

626
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.054
Me too. Lift me up too.

627
00:36:04.078 --> 00:36:05.097
Should I?

628
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.723
Come here, Seo-jin.

629
00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:08.016
Here we go.

630
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.727
- Get a good look at the view, Seo-jin.
- And again.

631
00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:11.895
Good boy.

632
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:13.313
You got a good view.

633
00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:15.163
Sam-sik.

634
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.234
Come and eat.

635
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.736
Congratulations, Young-soon.

636
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.530
Now that Kang-ho can walk again,

637
00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:24.783
I'm sure only good things
will come your way now.

638
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:25.868
That's right.

639
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:30.012
Once you open the farm again, Kang-ho
will help out. This is just great.

640
00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:33.458
It's so fascinating.

641
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:38.005
Her pigs have been around for the past 30 years,

642
00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.174
and now that I don't smell them,

643
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:43.218
a part of me feels empty and strange.

644
00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:48.223
I'll be honest. She used to give
us free meat every now and then.

645
00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:51.894
We also got manure for free. It was nice.

646
00:36:51.918 --> 00:36:54.062
Of course.

647
00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:56.815
A pig farm is far better...

648
00:36:56.839 --> 00:37:00.667
than some trot concert hall.

649
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.712
Look at those despicable humans.

650
00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:11.455
By the way, I haven't
seen Hoon-ah around lately.

651
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.221
You're right.

652
00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:28.096
We grilled some meat.

653
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.515
So what? Are you rubbing it in my face?

654
00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:33.477
If you haven't eaten yet,

655
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.604
you should come over and eat with us.

656
00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:37.272
The villagers are all there.

657
00:37:37.296 --> 00:37:38.440
No.

658
00:37:38.464 --> 00:37:40.275
I'm allergic to pork.

659
00:37:40.299 --> 00:37:42.000
It's beef.

660
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.613
These darn flies.

661
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:45.656
I hate them!

662
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.366
Go.

663
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.841
- Darn it.
- Sir.

664
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.970
I won't be alive for long.

665
00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:56.098
I have terminal cancer.

666
00:37:56.691 --> 00:37:59.643
Since I won't be running the farm for long,

667
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:04.856
I told my lawyer to hand
it over to you after I die.

668
00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:06.969
But...

669
00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:10.988
my son can walk again now.

670
00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:14.199
That pig farm...

671
00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:17.938
is the only thing I can leave him.

672
00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:21.415
It's also the only thing I can teach him.

673
00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:24.251
So please.

674
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:27.546
Please...

675
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:30.173
don't take it away from us.

676
00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:40.460
I knew you wouldn't join us,
so I brought some meat.

677
00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.185
Here.

678
00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.649
Please keep my illness...

679
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:50.986
a secret from the villagers.

680
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:52.347
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

681
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.474
The meat just melts in my mouth.

682
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.184
- It's like ice cream.
- It's tasty.

683
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.436
Everything's so good.

684
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.979
Gosh.

685
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.003
- I need to use the bathroom.
- It's so tender.

686
00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:02.914
Gosh.

687
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.042
The vegetables are good too.

688
00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:11.825
Hey, don't drag your feet. It's so
dusty. Where are your table manners?

689
00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.718
- Where's the bathroom?
- There's dust everywhere!

690
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.891
Is this it?

691
00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:25.062
This isn't it.

692
00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:38.450
It's here.

693
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:40.312
Thank you.

694
00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:41.772
- Gosh, thank you.
- It's so good.

695
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:43.899
- Use both hands.
- Just eat this.

696
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:44.941
Come on.

697
00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:46.526
We finally have it.

698
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.086
What is it this time?

699
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.239
- Poop?
- No.

700
00:39:51.263 --> 00:39:52.449
The evidence.

701
00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:56.078
All his files and belongings
are in the shed back there.

702
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.579
What?

703
00:39:57.603 --> 00:39:59.387
Are you serious?

704
00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:02.849
- Let's go.
- All right.

705
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.629
Right!

706
00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:07.130
I finally remember who you are.

707
00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:08.298
Darn it.

708
00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:10.258
We met before, right?

709
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:12.260
You were hiding in my closet,

710
00:40:12.284 --> 00:40:15.024
and then came out and started
fighting with a knife with a guy.

711
00:40:15.048 --> 00:40:16.932
What? With a knife?

712
00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.683
- Yes.
- Are you thieves?

713
00:40:18.707 --> 00:40:20.352
Why were you hiding in their closet?

714
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:23.355
What are you talking about?

715
00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:26.483
They're my business partners.

716
00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:27.943
Then they're thieves.

717
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:28.902
Hey!

718
00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.987
- Wait.
- Come on.

719
00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:32.197
You're wrong.

720
00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:35.367
They recently moved here from the city to farm.

721
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:37.869
- Remember my cornfield?
- Yes.

722
00:40:37.893 --> 00:40:39.329
They bought it.

723
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:43.375
They're growing lettuce with Sam-sik now.

724
00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.626
- Really?
- Yes.

725
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.087
Then come here and have some <i>makgeolli</i> with us.

726
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.880
- You won't be driving.
- Come.

727
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:50.882
I'm afraid we need to leave.

728
00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:52.342
We need to water the lettuce.

729
00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:55.902
Right. We should.

730
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.472
- Excuse us.
- Bye.

731
00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:59.391
- They're so hard-working.
- Wait.

732
00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:02.352
Make sure you let the water run first.

733
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:05.480
The water in the hose is lukewarm,
so it'll kill the lettuce.

734
00:41:05.504 --> 00:41:07.566
- How cute.
- Lion, come here.

735
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.984
Lion, come here.

736
00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:11.445
Lion.

737
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.989
Sit down, Lion.

738
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:15.240
Over here.

739
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:18.201
Now I can play soccer...

740
00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:19.911
and hopscotch with you.

741
00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:21.720
Right, Kang-ho?

742
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.331
Don't call him like that.

743
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.125
He's all grown up now.

744
00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.934
Right, Kang-ho?

745
00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:30.464
It's okay. We're friends.

746
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:34.733
You're an adult so we need
to treat you like one, okay?

747
00:41:35.242 --> 00:41:39.237
Then do we need to speak formally too?

748
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.267
All right. I got it.

749
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.452
I actually always thought you should.

750
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.914
Is it tasty, Lion?

751
00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:53.919
They look like one happy family.

752
00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:57.365
Goodness, I'm sorry.

753
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.534
I can wrap up here.

754
00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.870
You should go home with your kids.

755
00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.511
Ms. Jin.

756
00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:06.765
I stayed behind because
I had something to ask you.

757
00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:10.143
Do you remember...

758
00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:13.507
when we met by the pond when it was raining?

759
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.149
Kang-ho said something...

760
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.779
I won't do it again.

761
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.365
Never again.

762
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.019
Okay.

763
00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:28.536
Then I won't worry anymore.

764
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.234
Thanks.

765
00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:34.125
Likewise.

766
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:37.447
♫ <i>"I love you"
"I love you"</i> ♫

767
00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:40.325
♫ <i>is such

770
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:51.378

771

772
00:42:57.074 --> 00:43:00.819
- I love you.
- I love you, Mom and Dad.

773
00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:05.058
I'm sorry about getting angry earlier.

774
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.768
I guess Dad must've been very busy,

775
00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:10.161
if he had to leave without saying goodbye.

776
00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:13.915
I'm sure he'll come to our
elementary entrance ceremony.

777
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:17.153
I can teach Park Jun-seo a lesson then.

778
00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:21.658
But tell Dad to look good that day.

779
00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:24.661
I don't know if he was
dressed the way Americans do,

780
00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:28.623
but he looked quite shabby,
and I didn't like it.

781
00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:31.751
I agree. Kang-ho looked great today.

782
00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:35.061
He was tall and strong.

783
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:38.633
What if we pretend that Kang-ho is our dad?

784
00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:40.010
- No!
- No.

785
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.761
Goodness. All right.

786
00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:44.055
You guys didn't have to get all worked up.

787
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:46.725
You. I told you not to treat him like a friend.

788
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:49.144
- Treat him like an adult!
- Mom!

789
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:51.187
- Stop it.
- Hello.

790
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:56.693
My babies.

791
00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:59.252
It's Mr. Sam-sik.

792
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:04.242
Why do you call me
"Mr. Sam-sik" and Kang-ho "sir"?

793
00:44:04.266 --> 00:44:06.343
Come here.

794
00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:08.079
What are you doing? Put me down.

795
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:10.332
I'm scared of heights.

796
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.208
- Don't do that!
- So suddenly?

797
00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:15.560
You liked it when Kang-ho lifted you up.

798
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:17.047
Baby.

799
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:19.314
Answer me, will you?

800
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.509
You reek of alcohol.

801
00:44:21.533 --> 00:44:24.262
That's enough. Go inside and wash up.

802
00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:25.680
- Let's go!
- No.

803
00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:27.182
My babies!

804
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.893
Goodness. You should go
home and sleep if you're drunk.

805
00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:32.118
You're embarrassing yourself.

806
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:33.897
Go home.

807
00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:35.455
Mi-joo.

808
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:37.692
What is it?

809
00:44:37.716 --> 00:44:39.501
I'm going to be...

810
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.280
straightforward with you.

811
00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:43.615
Okay.

812
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:45.882
Do you like Kang-ho?

813
00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:47.535
What?

814
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:49.663
Does seeing him walk...

815
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:52.639
stir up your emotions?

816
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:55.001
Is that why you didn't go to work today,

817
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.769
and stayed behind and helped them clean up?

818
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:01.257
Just go home.

819
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:04.984
Why can't you say you don't?

820
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:08.973
I don't. I don't like him.

821
00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:09.933
Happy?

822
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.783
If that's true,

823
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.036
let's get married.

824
00:45:16.922 --> 00:45:19.275
Let's live a happy life,

825
00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:22.085
and raise the kids together.

826
00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:23.405
Let's do that.

827
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:25.240
They need a dad.

828
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:28.716
I promise to make you guys happy.

829
00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:35.974
Should we?

830
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.338
What? What did you say?

831
00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:41.756
Are you serious?

832
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.357
- You'll marry me?
- Yes.

833
00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:47.235
Let's do it.

834
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.389
But you know I'm broke, right?

835
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.015
I have a ton of debt too.

836
00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:52.851
A creditor came by today too.

837
00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:55.687
We can struggle together every single day...

838
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:57.313
to pay off our debt.

839
00:45:57.337 --> 00:46:01.234
We'll be chased around pathetically.

840
00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:04.404
But amid all that, let's live happily together.

841
00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.697
Sure.

842
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:08.923
"Stir up my emotions"? "Get married"?

843
00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:13.204
I work like a dog every day
to pay off my debt bit by bit.

844
00:46:13.228 --> 00:46:16.583
It's tough to make ends meet
while taking care of my family.

845
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.642
I can't afford to have my
head in the clouds like you.

846
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.854
Bye.

847
00:46:29.745 --> 00:46:32.071
Is the debt the only issue then?

848
00:46:32.998 --> 00:46:36.728
Mi-joo, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

849
00:46:36.752 --> 00:46:39.370
I'll be back.

850
00:46:39.505 --> 00:46:43.943
This used to be your room.

851
00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.820
You'll be sleeping here now.

852
00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:48.031
But I don't want to be alone.

853
00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:49.115
No.

854
00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.451
You need to learn to be independent.

855
00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.676
That's how you become an adult.

856
00:46:54.686 --> 00:46:58.723
I'll teach you one step at a time. Okay?

857
00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.850
Okay.

858
00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.105
Who is this?

859
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:09.984
Hello?

860
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:25.151
Excuse me.

861
00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.945
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's...

862
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:30.630
Goodness, you're here. Please come in.

863
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:32.325
This way.

864
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:35.176
- Have this.
- Thank you.

865
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:42.126
On the day you dropped off the side dishes,

866
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:45.395
Prosecutor Choi came by late at night.

867
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.720
If my mother comes by...

868
00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:56.197
to pick up my belongings when I'm not here,

869
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.934
please give her this.

870
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.626
<i><font color="#ffa07a">To My Mother</font></i>

871
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:05.164
Are you moving?

872
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.958
No.

873
00:48:07.342 --> 00:48:11.087
But I might have to.

874
00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:16.259
Please give it to her and nobody else.

875
00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:18.496
Please.

876
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.999
But I was off duty that day,

877
00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:23.876
so I didn't even know he'd moved.

878
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.087
Fortunately, you gave me your number last time,

879
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:28.423
so I'm finally giving it to you.

880
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.273
Sorry it's so late.

881
00:48:33.118 --> 00:48:35.111
<i>To my mother who I miss dearly.</i>

882
00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:37.947
<i>Are you healthy and well?</i>

883
00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:42.368
<i>I got the side dishes you
left at the security office.</i>

884
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.497
<i>I'd always missed your home-cooked meals.</i>

885
00:48:46.798 --> 00:48:50.877
<i>I had a lovely dinner for
the first time in a long time.</i>

886
00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:55.158
<i>I'm sorry that my work keeps me...</i>

887
00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:58.760
<i>from calling or visiting you often.</i>

888
00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.262
<i>But Mother,</i>

889
00:49:01.355 --> 00:49:03.514
<i>I want you to know this.</i>

890
00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:07.003
<i>We may be apart,</i>

891
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:09.672
<i>but I still live...</i>

892
00:49:09.696 --> 00:49:14.359
<i>in the memories I shared with you and Father.</i>

893
00:49:14.701 --> 00:49:18.806
<i>I'll see you next week on your birthday.</i>

894
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:22.992
"September 7. From your beloved son, Kang-ho."

895
00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.772
"Kang-ho"?

896
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.373
Did I write this?

897
00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:31.459
It's just so odd.

898
00:49:31.843 --> 00:49:36.881
You've never spoken to me in this manner before.

899
00:49:37.182 --> 00:49:40.161
Why did you leave this with the security guard?

900
00:49:40.185 --> 00:49:44.097
How did you know I'd be
packing your stuff without you?

901
00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:47.585
Tell me.

902
00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:52.256
Did you know you'd end up this way?

903
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.110
Were you trying to tell me
something with this letter?

904
00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:59.138
You were, right?

905
00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:02.073
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

906
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.411
And then...

907
00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.872
Again.

908
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:12.276
Again.

909
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.277
Again.

910
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.387
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Investigation Officer</font></i>

911
00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:17.740
Hello?

912
00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:20.618
It's me, ma'am. You called.

913
00:50:20.642 --> 00:50:22.829
I was attending a trial earlier.

914
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:25.748
I see. One minute.

915
00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:29.252
Fill it out, and when they call number 25,

916
00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:32.755
go hand them the bank book and the seal.

917
00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:34.215
What's the password again?

918
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:35.758
The password is...

919
00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:37.900
zero, nine...

920
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.555
Zero, nine, zero, seven. My birthday.

921
00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:42.613
That's right.

922
00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.782
I'm sorry.

923
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:47.869
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

924
00:50:49.004 --> 00:50:51.247
Do you mean...

925
00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:55.528
the assemblyman who's running for President?

926
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.029
The former prosecutor?

927
00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:58.239
<i>Correct.</i>

928
00:50:58.263 --> 00:51:03.384
Prosecutor Choi was engaged to his daughter.

929
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.579
You didn't know?

930
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:06.345
Goodness.

931
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.681
How could this be?

932
00:51:10.275 --> 00:51:12.003
That's a relief.

933
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:15.131
I've been acquainted with Assembly Oh.

934
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.633
Could you give me his number please?

935
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:18.593
<i>Sorry?</i>

936
00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:21.819
His daughter's number would be even better.

937
00:51:22.537 --> 00:51:25.016
I have a few things to check about my son.

938
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.770
And I think she'd know best,

939
00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:30.730
since they were engaged.

940
00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.731
<i>Gosh.</i>

941
00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.815
<i>Ma'am.</i>

942
00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:36.375
There's no way for me to know their numbers.

943
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.447
And she's getting married soon.

944
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:42.298
<i>I think it'd be best if you didn't call them.</i>

945
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:44.967
Here comes the bride.

946
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.460
Where's the groom?

947
00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:55.019
He's taking a call outside.

948
00:51:57.572 --> 00:51:59.091
Where's the groom?

949
00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.400
He's taking a call inside.

950
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.603
Is he serious?

951
00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.745
He's in the room next door.

952
00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:19.418
Make sure the baby is dressed warmly.
It's pretty windy near the sea.

953
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.380
I'll pick you up at 8 p.m.

954
00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.924
Kang-ho.

955
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.094
What baby?

956
00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:29.789
It's nothing.

957
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.806
Are you done?

958
00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:36.978
I was going to surprise you
with a grand appearance.

959
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:40.856
Is the other one better?
Or is something fancier better?

960
00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:43.553
You already look pretty enough.

961
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:44.762
Whatever.

962
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:46.931
You do. Let's go.

963
00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:48.823
Kang-ho.

964
00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:53.729
We're visiting your mother tomorrow.
Do you really have to go out tonight?

965
00:52:53.753 --> 00:52:55.481
It's work-related. I won't be long.

966
00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.316
You're such a workaholic.

967
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.875
Let's stop by the department store.

968
00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:05.381
<i>We need to make a move first.</i>

969
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.967
I heard about your daughter's wedding.

970
00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:11.497
You'll become in-laws with Dosang Group.

971
00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.749
Yes, that's right.

972
00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:16.168
What can I do? Our children are in love.

973
00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.295
<i>I understand.</i>

974
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:19.797
<i>Parents are always bound
to give in to their children.</i>

975
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:21.841
Though there are parents who kill them.

976
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:23.509
Mr. Song!

977
00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.553
Gosh, you startled me.

978
00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:27.430
<i>It's about time you dropped it.</i>

979
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:28.973
It's all in the past.

980
00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:30.948
I believe...

981
00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:35.995
my men found something in Kang-ho's home.

982
00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:43.044
Do you mean the original
copy of the DNA test result?

983
00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:47.632
As you said, it's just a piece of paper.

984
00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:51.412
<i>What if I claim you colluded
with Bareun Hanguk Party,</i>

985
00:53:51.436 --> 00:53:53.414
and fabricated it to take me down?

986
00:53:53.438 --> 00:53:56.265
Then how will you prove its authenticity?

987
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:59.629
So why did you have to take it so far...

988
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:02.590
as to kill the poor woman and her child?

989
00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:03.799
What did you say?

990
00:54:03.823 --> 00:54:06.385
<i>I hope we never see each other again.</i>

991
00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:08.235
<i>Goodbye then.</i>

992
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.326
Right.

993
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:18.204
I expected nothing less from him.

994
00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:28.991
How did it go?

995
00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:31.634
We finally located the file.

996
00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:37.750
In two days,

997
00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:42.019
Oh Tae-soo will become
in-laws with Dosang Group.

998
00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:45.132
And you just managed to locate it?

999
00:54:45.156 --> 00:54:47.843
- Are you kidding me right...?
- Choi Kang-ho...

1000
00:54:47.867 --> 00:54:49.902
is walking again.

1001
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:54.907
What do you mean?

1002
00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:06.278
See? What did I tell you?

1003
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:09.004
I told you he'd walk again.

1004
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:11.826
Where should you record
the pig feed you purchased?

1005
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.452
Pig feed.

1006
00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.578
Pig feed...

1007
00:55:14.602 --> 00:55:16.372
Here. "Pig Feed Management."

1008
00:55:16.396 --> 00:55:17.873
Good.

1009
00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:20.376
What about their medicine and injections?

1010
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.877
Medicine...

1011
00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:23.921
and injections...

1012
00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:24.922
Here.

1013
00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:26.090
Well done.

1014
00:55:26.114 --> 00:55:28.607
You're so smart.

1015
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:32.847
You need to check and
record them every day, okay?

1016
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:34.613
Okay.

1017
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:36.642
What am I learning tomorrow?

1018
00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.325
Tomorrow?

1019
00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:40.104
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Copied Documents</font></i>

1020
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:43.831
- Are these all mine?
- Yes, they're all yours.

1021
00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:47.570
Mom, this too?

1022
00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:49.363
Yes.

1023
00:55:49.387 --> 00:55:50.948
Awesome.

1024
00:55:50.972 --> 00:55:53.841
I'm going to show it to Seo-jin and Ye-jin.

1025
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.010
Found it.

1026
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.376
Mr. Kang-ho!

1027
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.227
Hello, you cuties.

1028
00:56:05.487 --> 00:56:08.049
You must be here to hang out with Uncle Kang-ho.

1029
00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:11.052
But we need to go into town.

1030
00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:12.428
It's okay.

1031
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:15.765
Ye-jin only came to
congratulate him on walking again.

1032
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:17.725
She brought a flower.

1033
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:20.201
Go on.

1034
00:56:20.585 --> 00:56:24.872
They said yellow was your lucky color.

1035
00:56:28.968 --> 00:56:31.378
Thanks, Ye-jin. It's so pretty.

1036
00:56:31.846 --> 00:56:34.673
But of course you're prettier.

1037
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.106
We'll be back.

1038
00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:58.140
I'm going to beat up anyone
who tells me to wash my hands.

1039
00:56:58.164 --> 00:57:00.518
Did you see how we were wearing matching colors?

1040
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:01.977
This is fate.

1041
00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:04.745
I'm going to marry him.

1042
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.541
One, two, three.

1043
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.613
Okay, it's all done.

1044
00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:15.533
Please wait in the waiting
room while it gets printed.

1045
00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:17.341
- Okay.
- Okay.

1046
00:57:21.896 --> 00:57:26.669
Excuse me, but could I take one alone?

1047
00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:30.172
Sure. Please sit in the middle.

1048
00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:32.898
Is it for your passport or ID?

1049
00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:36.554
I need a photo much bigger than those.

1050
00:57:36.578 --> 00:57:38.973
Those who pay their condolences will see it,

1051
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:41.225
so please make sure to take it well.

1052
00:57:41.249 --> 00:57:43.310
"Condolences"?

1053
00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:44.910
Yes.

1054
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.289
Okay, ma'am.

1055
00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:50.207
One minute please.

1056
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.059
All right. Let's try it again.

1057
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.688
Mom.

1058
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:14.633
Why are we doing this?

1059
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.901
Do it.

1060
00:58:18.745 --> 00:58:20.529
Now.

1061
00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:24.825
Goodness.

1062
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.146
Go on.

1063
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.289
I don't want to. I'm scared.

1064
00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:34.460
There's nothing to be scared about.

1065
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:36.697
Kang-ho.

1066
00:58:36.721 --> 00:58:41.467
I'm just teaching you things you don't know.

1067
00:58:41.559 --> 00:58:44.413
Just like teaching you how to
cook and what to do at the bank.

1068
00:58:44.437 --> 00:58:48.042
I'm teaching you things
you'll need to know in life.

1069
00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:50.559
When will I need to do this?

1070
00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.395
Later.

1071
00:58:53.446 --> 00:58:55.606
Much later.

1072
00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.566
So let's try it.

1073
00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:05.935
Goodness.

1074
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:09.328
Goodness.

1075
00:59:10.171 --> 00:59:13.025
Goodness.

1076
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:19.421
Goodness.

1077
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:25.552
Goodness.

1078
00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:44.571
What did I tell you to do?

1079
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:09.847
You need to get up too.

1080
01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.816
You must be heartbroken.

1081
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.822
You must be heartbroken.

1082
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.826
- Mom.
- You must be heartbroken.

1083
01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:38.125
Thank you for coming here
and offering your condolences.

1084
01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:43.922
Did she have an illness?

1085
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:48.969
"She had cancer."

1086
01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.348
She had cancer.

1087
01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.940
Well done, my son.

1088
01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.536
- Done.
- Done.

1089
01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.653
Let's put him in there too.

1090
01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.946
What? Who?

1091
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.448
Dad.

1092
01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:25.532
Dad?

1093
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.257
Yes.

1094
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:30.996
Just like that photo, let's
add him to the new photo too.

1095
01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.430
Then we'll be together.

1096
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.601
Sure, let's do that.

1097
01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.884
<i>But I still live...</i>

1098
01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:48.487
<i>in the memories I shared with you and Father.</i>

1099
01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:02.251
"In the memories."

1100
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.967
Inside?

1101
01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.679
Mom, what's wrong?

1102
01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:41.549
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1103
01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:03.854
<i>I want to find out the reason...</i>

1104
01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.966
<i>I had to attend law school.</i>

1105
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.303
<i>Beg him, or you'll go to jail!</i>

1106
01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.597
<i>Once you study hard and become a prosecutor,</i>

1107
01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.057
<i>no one will be able to look
down on you or bully you.</i>

1108
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.642
{\an8}<i>That's true power.</i>

1109
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:19.897
{\an8}<i>You want me to become a cowardly
snob who'd do anything to get my way.</i>

1110
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.358
{\an8}<i>He hasn't even been appointed yet.
It's too soon to think about marriage.</i>

1111
01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:24.985
{\an8}<i>Do you want to know...</i>

1112
01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.960
{\an8}<i>what I want to do?</i>

1113
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:31.131
{\an8}<i>Oh Ha-young is Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo's daughter.</i>

1114
01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.620
{\an8}<i>The moment Chairman Song accepted me as his son,</i>

1115
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.720
{\an8}<i>she became a stranger to me.</i>
