Who are you people?

13
00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.121
Kang-ho!

14
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.877
Kang-ho!

15
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:42.384
Ma'am, it's been a while.

16
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.705
Your late husband...

17
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.124
was such a courageous man.

18
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:50.669
And Kang-ho takes after him.

19
00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.632
I took care of him like my own.
What an ungrateful kid.

20
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.190
Let me see.

21
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.152
Tell me, Kang-ho.

22
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:03.015
What were you going to do to me?

23
00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.309
- Mom!
- Stop it.

24
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.393
Stop it.

25
00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:08.285
Stop it!

26
00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.497
Stop it...

27
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.777
Please...

28
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.461
Please don't do this.

29
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:21.575
You know he had an accident and hurt his head.

30
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.801
He doesn't remember anything.

31
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.832
He can't harm you!

32
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.723
Who knows?

33
00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:32.253
He could remember everything any day...

34
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.964
and stab me in my back, couldn't he?

35
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.676
I heard he's gathered tons
of evidence against me...

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.137
while working for me all these years.

37
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.180
I'm here to find it.

38
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.072
It's not here.

39
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.601
Not anymore.

40
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.061
Look at that.

41
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.646
I burned it all.

42
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.982
You did? Why?

43
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.084
I knew it. So there was something, right?

44
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:03.173
I did it so he wouldn't go back to his old life.

45
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.679
I didn't want you to get the wrong
idea after finding out who his father was.

46
00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:10.933
I didn't want him to be in any more danger.

47
00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.033
I'm telling you the truth.

48
00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:18.188
He doesn't know what went on between us.

49
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.096
And what exactly...

50
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.322
was that?

51
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.497
Let me...

52
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.792
answer that question.

53
00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.711
No.

54
00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:42.198
No!

55
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.881
No!

64
00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:23.739

66
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.204
...after all that his dad went
through to get him that job.

67
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.957
But he already quit after
working there for a few days.

68
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.542
{\an8}- What's the reason this time?
- It's obvious.

69
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:38.963
{\an8}He still wants to become a movie director.

70
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:39.922
{\an8}Goodness.

71
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:45.761
{\an8}I heard even decent directors struggle
for years without making any money.

72
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.696
{\an8}Does he think he's Bong Joon-ho or something?

73
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.808
{\an8}Maybe I'm Bong Joon-ho.

74
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.893
{\an8}After all, I gave birth to a parasite.

75
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.478
I'm sick of him.

76
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:58.774
Gosh, it takes boys ages to mature.

77
00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.235
They might once they have a family of their own.

78
00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.322
My son completely changed after getting married.

79
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.658
- Really?
- Yes.

80
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:11.120
He has a loving wife and
adorable children to look after.

81
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.579
So of course he has to mature.

82
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.958
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Marry him off</font></i>

83
00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:19.378
You're going to suffer worse symptoms soon.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.089
I don't think taking medicine will suffice.

85
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.800
Why don't you get hospitalized and treated?

86
00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.608
I can't do that.

87
00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:30.279
What I mean is...

88
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.349
Later.

89
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:36.368
There are some things I need to do right now.

90
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.288
{\an8}Lion, look at this.

91
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:43.709
{\an8}"Choi Kang-ho, Supreme Prosecutors' Office."

92
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.295
{\an8}Isn't it cool?

93
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.982
Lion, do I look like myself in the picture?

94
00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:14.683
Lion, that's it. Come here.

95
00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.227
Good job.

96
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:18.562
Lion, come here.

97
00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.397
- Gosh.
- Where are you going?

98
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.315
Goodness.

99
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.249
- Hi, Lion.
- Lion!

100
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.047
Lion has become so much stronger.

101
00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:31.700
You're right.

102
00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:35.636
We should build a separate home for her.

103
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.915
Let's build her a small home,

104
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.834
so she can get used to
living in an enclosed space...

105
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:43.310
until she's ready to have piglets.

106
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:48.607
Then in the future, she won't have
any problems living with other pigs.

107
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.428
- Other pigs?
- Yes.

108
00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:54.530
We're getting new pigs next week.

109
00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.784
Does that mean you're
going to run the farm again?

110
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.661
No.

111
00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:03.664
You will.

112
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:08.001
You are now the owner of Happy Farm.

113
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.989
Then...

114
00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:13.450
what about my job as a prosecutor?

115
00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.801
I won't be a prosecutor anymore?

116
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.163
Who told you that...

117
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.139
you were a prosecutor?

118
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.627
Mr. Son, the ladies, and
the rest of the villagers.

119
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:27.229
They told me to get better
and be a prosecutor again.

120
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.981
Kang-ho.

121
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.635
Listen carefully.

122
00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.178
You're no longer...

123
00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:35.389
a prosecutor.

124
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.516
No matter what people say,

125
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.492
deny it and tell them you don't know.

126
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.957
You'll live a happy life running the farm.

127
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.042
I beg you.

128
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.756
Please don't remember anything
and let's just live like this, okay?

129
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.915
I know I can be a good farmer.

130
00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:04.558
After all, you taught me everything.

131
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.438
Of course you can. You're my son.

132
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.734
Lion.

133
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.361
Lion.

134
00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.906
Lion.

135
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.035
Here you are.

136
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.609
Lion, I'm the owner now.

137
00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.069
The owner of Happy Farm.

138
00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:35.214
I'm going to build you a
new home. Aren't you happy?

139
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.678
But it feels weird.

140
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.708
Everyone is telling me to
get better so I can return...

141
00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:47.184
to being a prosecutor.

142
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.270
But not my mom.

143
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.774
She told me not to remember
anything because it'll be dangerous.

144
00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.406
I wonder what happened.

145
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.285
- Mr. Kang-ho!
- We're here!

146
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.232
Let's go, Lion.

147
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:12.501
Could you please give me a $50 discount?

148
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.198
You're unbelievable.

149
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.701
You're like the Yeouido
interchange at 6 p.m. on a weekday.

150
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.495
"Yeouido interchange"?

151
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.470
There's no getting through to you.

152
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.082
Gosh.

153
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.307
I bought it for my girlfriend...

154
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.810
to celebrate our thousandth day together.

155
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.230
But she cheated on me.

156
00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:39.027
♫ <i>Were you happy</i> ♫

157
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:43.392
♫ <i>for the past thousand days?</i> ♫

158
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.102
♫ <i>Mi-joo</i> ♫

159
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.078
♫ <i>Mi-joo</i> ♫
All right. Quiet down.

160
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:49.691
I'll transfer the money right now.

161
00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:52.192
You've made a wise decision.

162
00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.002
I'll wrap it up right away.

163
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.709
Hello, sir. Have you been well?

164
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.629
Something strange was transferred
to my bank account just now.

165
00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:15.007
The amount should've been $200,000,

166
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.051
but it's missing two zeros.

167
00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.971
<i>Just like how you'll be missing...</i>

168
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.015
both of your kidneys soon.

169
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.559
I sent you the interest first.

170
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.270
<i>I see. So that's what it is.</i>

171
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.980
Then when will I...

172
00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:33.332
be able to receive the principal?

173
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.752
<i>Don't take it the wrong way.</i>

174
00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.655
I'm not rushing you.

175
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:41.700
Why would I? Right, Sam-sik?

176
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.202
<i>Your home is worth $180,000.</i>

177
00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:46.955
<i>Your mill is worth $250,000.</i>

178
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.415
Right.

179
00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.584
Your parents also set up...

180
00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.295
life insurance for you.

181
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.798
Please, sir!

182
00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.592
♫ <i>Sam-sik's head</i> ♫

183
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.970
♫ <i>is hanging from the eastern cottonwood</i> ♫

184
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:06.156
You'd better send me the rest by
this weekend if you want to avoid that.

185
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.273
Don't sing.

186
00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:16.958
Don't sing, you punk!

187
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.960
Hey.

188
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.173
What did the streetlamp
sing for you to beat it up?

189
00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.703
Say hello. They're from the
Rural Development Administration.

190
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.914
The Rural Development Administration?

191
00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.248
Hello.

192
00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:33.043
We stumbled across this
while visiting some farms.

193
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:34.252
Gosh.

194
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:36.630
You did an excellent job growing the lettuce.

195
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:40.440
I highly doubt that this lousy kid grew them.

196
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.678
Where are those men?

197
00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.514
- Lion!
- Lion!

198
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.183
- Lion!
- Here she is!

199
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.409
Why do you keep coming back...?

200
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.023
What were you thinking digging a hole here?!

201
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.483
Oh, dear.

202
00:11:56.507 --> 00:12:00.695
Ms. Jin will be upset once she finds out.

203
00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.864
- Are you sure you saw it?
- Of course.

204
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:06.007
I may not be the brightest,
but I have great eyesight.

205
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:10.095
Feel free to bury me in
the lettuce field if I'm wrong.

206
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.933
Where are they going?

207
00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.060
They left.

208
00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.231
What...? No way.

209
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.775
It was...

210
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.902
It was right here.

211
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.947
Hide!

212
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.522
- I told you to stay in the truck.
- Mom.

213
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.590
- Let me carry them. They're heavy.
- It's okay.

214
00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:39.857
- They're heavy.
- Come on, let's go.

215
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.179
Mom.

216
00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:54.833
Can you hold Lion for a minute?

217
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.641
Don't let her run off.

218
00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.394
- Lion.
- No!

219
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:16.244
Goodness, he's so strong.

220
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.207
All right.

221
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.239
Have I told you...

222
00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:29.799
I'm going to marry you?

223
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.331
- Lion!
- Lion!

224
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.973
- No! Lion!
- Lion!

225
00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:43.772
Hello?

226
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.941
Yes.

227
00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:49.611
Sorry?

228
00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:51.863
Okay.

229
00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.893
We have a situation! We
need to get out right now!

230
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.728
- Hurry!
- Why?

231
00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.438
What's the matter?

232
00:13:58.462 --> 00:14:00.273
Is it...

233
00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.874
- who I think it is?
- Yes.

234
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:04.736
Mr. Bang.

235
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.087
- What?
- They want to interview us.

236
00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:09.324
What interview?

237
00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:12.786
About our lettuce. We don't
have much time. We must hurry.

238
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.788
Mr. Cha.

239
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.638
Step back.

240
00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:20.517
One, two, three!

241
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.646
That worked!

242
00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.306
- We have plenty of alcohol,
- Right.

243
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.184
- ...so have it with some pancakes.
- Goodness.

244
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:39.744
Gosh, why did you cook?

245
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.398
I mean,

246
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.066
I was actually peckish.

247
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.276
- Right.
- Here.

248
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.611
- Have some.
- Sure.

249
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:47.696
It looks good.

250
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.547
- Here.
- Thanks.

251
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.118
- Gosh, it looks good.
- Try some.

252
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.759
How is it?

253
00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:58.373
This is insane.

254
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:02.586
What a surprise. I can't believe
you're complimenting my food.

255
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.255
It's insanely bitter.

256
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.523
What in the world did you put in?

257
00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.113
It tastes just fine!

258
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.810
Look at that. I knew it.

259
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.979
You said you were on a diet.

260
00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.580
Have you already caved in?

261
00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:26.166
Goodness.

262
00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:28.028
Darn it.

263
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.446
- Goodness!
- Come on.

264
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.239
Here you all are.

265
00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:33.450
- Goodness, come join us.
- Come here.

266
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.201
- Come.
- Sit.

267
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:37.329
- Sit here.
- Take a seat.

268
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.664
Sit and have some.

269
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.208
- It's still very hot.
- Here.

270
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:44.643
Are you sure there'll be enough?

271
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.464
- How is it?
- It's good.

272
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.482
So you're telling me that this dish...

273
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.635
is tasty, right?

274
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.360
Yes.

275
00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:58.365
It would've been tastier
if it'd been less bitter.

276
00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:04.079
How is this bitter?

277
00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:05.482
It tastes just fine.

278
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:07.275
You must be making alcohol.

279
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.027
We need to make it now,

280
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.029
for it to last the rest of the year.

281
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:12.864
We all need to help out.

282
00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.574
Exactly.

283
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:16.618
If you need all the help you can get,

284
00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.745
why do you always leave me out?

285
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.122
Don't take it the wrong way.

286
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:25.752
It's just that you've been so busy
taking care of the pigs and Kang-ho.

287
00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:29.339
I know how considerate you've
been and I'm grateful for that.

288
00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:33.108
But please start inviting Kang-ho and me too.

289
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:35.178
We're all neighbors.

290
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:38.264
It hurts my feelings whenever you leave us out.

291
00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:41.434
- Gosh, we aren't leaving you out.
- That's not true.

292
00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:42.477
All right then.

293
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.397
I want you and Kang-ho to join us.

294
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.817
You'd better make it every time,
until Kang-ho fully recovers...

295
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.459
and becomes a prosecutor again.

296
00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.239
- Mr. Son.
- Yes?

297
00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:57.882
Kang-ho won't go back to being a prosecutor.

298
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:02.262
He never will.

299
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:06.793
You don't have to be so adamant about it.

300
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.461
- Mr. Son.
- Yes?

301
00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:10.630
Remember the lady you mentioned?

302
00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:12.882
The daughter of the family
that runs the orchard.

303
00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:15.427
Could you set her up with Kang-ho?

304
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:16.720
What?

305
00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.431
I want to marry him off.

306
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.682
- What?
- What?

307
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:23.059
You want to marry him off?

308
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.784
Yes.

309
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.038
If he meets a decent woman and starts a family,

310
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:33.737
I think he'll be more stable
and happier than he is now.

311
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.920
I'd appreciate your help.

312
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.242
Okay!

313
00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.910
All right!

314
00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:42.996
As the village head of Jou-ri,

315
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.624
I'll see to it that Kang-ho gets married!

316
00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:48.251
Let's go!

317
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:50.211
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

318
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.380
- Let's go!
- All right!

319
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.689
You're eating so well.

320
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.797
You really aren't going to eat?

321
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:01.942
Right. I need to be slim if I want
to wear a pretty wedding dress.

322
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.642
What are you drawing?

323
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.451
Let me see.

324
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.856
It's a bride and a groom. Open up.

325
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.333
I'm going to have an outdoor wedding.

326
00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.905
The groom is so handsome.

327
00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.032
He has a small face and long legs.

328
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.342
- What's he holding?
- A rock.

329
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.162
He must be very strong too.

330
00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.554
A man needs to be strong.

331
00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.977
He's useless.

332
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.236
I'll open it.

333
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:46.059
Are you eating well?

334
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.034
Here, you have some too.

335
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.036
Eat up.

336
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.663
I'm done.

337
00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:53.691
- Ta-da.
- Goodness.

338
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:54.859
{\an8}That looks nice.

339
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:56.027
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Owner of Happy Farm</font></i>

340
00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:57.529
"Happy Farm"?

341
00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.782
{\an8}Yes, Mr. Kang-ho is the owner now.

342
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.868
{\an8}"Owner of Happy Farm."

343
00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:06.454
The new pigs will arrive next week.

344
00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:11.182
{\an8}Then I'll be the wife of
the owner of Happy Farm.

345
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:12.794
Goodness.

346
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.254
"Wife"?

347
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.005
Dream on.

348
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.258
Starting tomorrow, he'll
be looking for a match...

349
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.108
- What?
- What?

350
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:24.988
...to set things on fire.

351
00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:26.558
What?

352
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:29.492
Gosh, it's so greasy. I need kimchi.

353
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:35.483
What? Why in the world would he do that?

354
00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.375
What's she talking about?

355
00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:44.591
Why did I say that in front
of my unmarried daughter?

356
00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:46.619
I'm such a fool.

357
00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:48.037
I'm here.

358
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.332
I'm producing an incredible song...

359
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.141
What?

360
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.603
What's going on?

361
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.063
We're done for.

362
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:02.594
They ran off with all the investment money...

363
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.972
we scraped together using your name!

364
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.156
Hold on.

365
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.732
What's...?

366
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:16.941
My money!

367
00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.444
- Where is he?
- There he is!

368
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.696
- There he is!
- The company went under!

369
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.906
What's going on?

370
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.117
- You jerk! Give me back my money!
- You jerk!

371
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:27.660
- My money!
- What is this?

372
00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:29.594
Even his hair was fake!

373
00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:32.207
Mom.

374
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.791
Did it hurt?

375
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:37.393
Mom, why do I need to do this?

376
00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:41.898
Because we need to go somewhere today.

377
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.859
Where are we going?

378
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.729
Kang-ho.

379
00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:56.287
Look.

380
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.028
This is for your fiancée.

381
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.072
- "Fiancée"?
- Yes.

382
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.658
A friend who'll live here...

383
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:10.119
and run the farm with you.

384
00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:12.664
You'll care for and love each other.

385
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.139
She'll stick with you forever.

386
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.017
A friend?

387
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.296
Like Mi-joo?

388
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.590
Not her.

389
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:26.135
Mi-joo has people she loves,

390
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.736
so she can't be with you.

391
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.099
And who are they?

392
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.851
There's Ye-jin, Seo-jin,

393
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.688
and their dad who's in the U.S.

394
00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.871
That horrifying jerk?

395
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.959
You've never even met him.
You can't call him like that.

396
00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.904
Don't worry.

397
00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:49.632
I'll find you someone better than Mi-joo.

398
00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:51.926
All right.

399
00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:59.419
Okay now.

400
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:02.395
Let's get you dolled up.

401
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:05.341
Why isn't this working?

402
00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:08.094
- Hold on.
- Mom.

403
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.319
Mom.

404
00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.031
Step aside!

405
00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.037
Mousse.

406
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.784
That's incredible.

407
00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:33.953
- You look handsome.
- What do you say?

408
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:37.248
Goodness! You look so handsome.

409
00:22:37.272 --> 00:22:38.332
What do you say?

410
00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:41.809
<i>Is it my turn now?</i>

411
00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:55.072
What on earth is her deal?

412
00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:57.158
A Yakuza's daughter.

413
00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:01.537
Let's pick out his clothes.

414
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:03.399
- Let's see.
- Goodness.

415
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:07.668
Look at her meddling with my work.

416
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.547
All right.

417
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:13.284
Let's pick some out.

418
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.452
Goodness.

419
00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.037
- What about this one?
- Gosh.

420
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.330
Doesn't it look elegant?

421
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.874
He'll look intelligent.

422
00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.599
Okay.

423
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.229
Oh, my. This is just to my taste.

424
00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.717
Let's see.

425
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.485
- What do you think?
- I love it.

426
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:35.598
One, zero, two?

427
00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:37.975
Is that a zero?

428
00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.602
- It looks good.
- Yes.

429
00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:41.312
Adding cologne would be nice.

430
00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:44.455
- Cologne?
- It's always good to smell good.

431
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:47.026
Oh, my.

432
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.736
She still has it.

433
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.212
It's half a carat.

434
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.757
Hi, Half A Carat.

435
00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:58.010
I hope you find a nice owner.

436
00:23:58.478 --> 00:23:59.997
Hi, Half A Carat.

437
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:03.474
I wonder who your owner will be.

438
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.727
We shouldn't try these on, right?

439
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:25.898
Goodness.

440
00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:27.733
You look so handsome.

441
00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:29.876
You look great.

442
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.405
You look amazing!

443
00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:34.657
- You look so handsome.
- He does.

444
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.492
You look so handsome.

445
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.327
My dear Kang-ho.

446
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:40.052
Where are you going?

447
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:44.140
You're finally wearing these again.

448
00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:48.394
Here. Try them on.

449
00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:57.528
They fit me perfectly.

450
00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.740
Of course. They're yours.

451
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.603
- Turn around.
- Goodness.

452
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:04.812
Oh, my!

453
00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.689
Gosh, you look so handsome.

454
00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:08.581
Goodness me.

455
00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:09.692
Goodness.

456
00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:11.694
- You look great.
- You look amazing.

457
00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:13.419
They must be here.

459
00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:23.721
That's enough.

Hey.

Look who it is.

463
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:36.427
It's Choi Kang-ho, the most
eligible bachelor of Jou-ri.

464
00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:37.386
You're right.

465
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.764
It seems...

466
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.183
he's on a blind date to find himself a match.

467
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:45.019
I don't know who the lucky lady will be,

468
00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.897
but she sure will be hitting the jackpot.

469
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:50.498
You're totally right.

470
00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.839
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Certificate of Award
Choi Kang-ho</font></i>

471
00:26:13.863 --> 00:26:16.133
He was incredibly smart...

ever since he was young.

Okay.

475
00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.785
- Bubbles.
- Right, bubbles.

476
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.496
I have a few more.

477
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:40.950
He's handsome, well-built,

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:47.707
How many pigs do you have at your farm again?

480
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.834
We have about...

481
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.684
They have...

482
00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:54.463
- They have 500 pigs...
- Go!

483
00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:56.632
- That's Kang-ho!
- Go!

484
00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:58.441
Go?

485
00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:02.805
Their potato field is over 10,000 <i>pyeong</i> wide.

No, it's 1000 <i>pyeong.</i>

487
00:27:04.247 --> 00:27:07.184
Right, 1000 <i>pyeong.</i> Let
me explain how big that is.

488
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:11.397
It could contain over 300
30-<i>pyeong</i> apartment units.

489
00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:13.831
No, 30 apartment units.

490
00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.151
Right?

491
00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:17.376
And the potato field is...

492
00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.406
All right.

493
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.991
This is his home.

494
00:27:22.015 --> 00:27:24.201
- Goodness.
- Take out the pigsty.

495
00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:28.205
The remaining land costs $700 per <i>pyeong.</i>

496
00:27:28.229 --> 00:27:31.167
However, the only thing is...

497
00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:34.643
There's just one tiny catch.

498
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.273
Kang-ho, how old are you?

499
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:42.193
I'm seven years...

500
00:27:43.244 --> 00:27:47.114
I mean, I'm 35.

501
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.854
Something was off when
you kept talking about pigs.

502
00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.564
This isn't right.

503
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:56.067
I can't believe we sat down with an idiot.

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:57.068
- "Idiot"?
- Let's go.

505
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:58.319
- Let's go, Mom.
- Wait...

506
00:27:58.343 --> 00:27:59.862
- "Idiot"?
- Wait.

507
00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:01.781
- I'm so offended.
- "Idiot"?

- How dare she...?

509

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.266
Goodness.

511
00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:18.270
Do this.

She's right. I'll look for
someone better, so don't worry.

515
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:37.274
If we can't find one,
then I'll make one for him.

516

Shall we hurry home and make one then?

517
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.239
What? You should do it while you still can.

518

- Okay.

519
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:46.659

Pesticides? What for?

You want to show Mi-joo how

All right. I'll buy some
paint and go to her salon.

Right.

It may not seem like much,

00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:02.693
Why do you ask?

540
00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:06.572
Why don't we go somewhere
nice and have a cup of coffee?

541
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:08.866
I also have a few questions.

542
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.091
Like what?

543
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.914
For example, I'm curious about...

544
00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:18.209
how you give hand massages.

545
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:20.768
There are various types of massages.

546
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:23.312
There's oil massage.

547
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:26.467
There's also outcall massage.

548
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.428
Let me show you something.

549
00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:31.055
That's it.

550
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.932
Like this.

551
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:36.617
There's this kind of massage too.

552
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.104
- Like this?
- That's right.

553
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.564
There's also this...

554
00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:42.706
and this.

555
00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:46.278
If you do something like this again,
I'll snap your neck right off.

556
00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:48.113
- You little...!
- No.

557
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:49.824
Not by me.

558
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.575
But by your wife.

559
00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:52.910
What?

560
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:53.994
Hey!

561
00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:55.329
What did I do?

562
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:58.249
You kept glancing at my
chest and groping my hand.

563
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.835
And what? Outcall massage?

564
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.211
Don't you know who I am?

565
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.462
Of course I do.

566
00:31:03.486 --> 00:31:05.486
You're Lee Bong-su, the business alliance rep,

567
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.384
who's been going around
pestering young ladies...

568
00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:12.820
at hair salons and coffee
shops like a hungry dog.

569
00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.765
Leave. Come out.

570
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:18.284
Leave. Go.

571
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.605
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of everyone,

572
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:22.982
Representative Lee Bong-su?

573
00:31:23.006 --> 00:31:24.748
You little...!

574
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.335
I'm bleeding!

575
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:31.365
You crazy wench!

576
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.075
Come here!

577
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:35.661
- How dare you hurt me?
- What's going on?

578
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:37.037
- You little...!
- What's wrong?

579
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.331
I'll put you behind bars for attempted murder!

580
00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:41.515
- What?
- Come here, you wench!

581
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:54.570
Who are you?

582
00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:04.121
Goodness!

583
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:08.152
What...?

584
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:09.778
Who are you?

585
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:11.488
I'm...

586
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:12.656
Well...

587
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.949
He's a prosecutor.

588
00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.118
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

589
00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:18.619
- What?
- You're in trouble now.

590
00:32:18.644 --> 00:32:21.373
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

591
00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:24.001
He groped me, cursed at me,
and sexually harassed me.

592
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:27.186
Come on, be a prosecutor, Babe.

593
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.605
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office?

594
00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:35.554
Hey, why would a prosecutor from Seoul...

595
00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.556
date someone like you?

596
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.058
- What did you say?
- Mi-joo.

597
00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:40.851
Why don't you answer me?

598
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:43.062
Are you a prosecutor? Are you?

599
00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:45.272
- Seriously, that...!
- Mi-joo.

600
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:48.150
Who are you trying to fool?

601
00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:50.042
No, I...

602
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:53.837
Mi-joo, I'm not a prosecutor...

603
00:32:56.724 --> 00:33:00.636
The lucky color is yellow
for the Year of the Dragon.

604
00:33:01.562 --> 00:33:02.581
Mi-joo!

605
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:03.624
Over here!

606
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:06.183
- This way.
- Mi-joo, don't die.

607
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:13.008
Oh, no! Are you okay, Mi-joo?

608
00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:14.206
- Are you okay?
- That jerk!

609
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.803
They must be hurt.

610
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.653
What...?

611
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:20.140
"Choi Kang-ho."

612
00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.810
"Supreme Prosecutors'
Office." He's a prosecutor.

613
00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:26.146
See! He really is a prosecutor!

614
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.257
What are you going to do?

615
00:33:27.281 --> 00:33:28.732
You'd better leave.

616
00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:31.568
- Kang-ho.
- Go or you'll get in trouble!

617
00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:34.154
- Are you okay? Wake up.
- Go mind your own business.

618
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:36.991
- I'll call 119.
- Are you okay? Hang in there.

619
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.549
Are you okay?

620
00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:41.620
You're bleeding. Get up.

621
00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:43.929
Are you okay? Oh, no.

622
00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.667
Oh, no. Are you okay?

623
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.877
This is all my fault.

624
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:51.103
What do I do?

625
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:55.023
- Oh, no.
- No, it's okay.

626
00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:02.406
It's okay, Mi-joo.

627
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.744
I can take the exam next year.

628
00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:06.437
<i><font color="#ffff00">Happy Farm</font></i>

629
00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:17.731
Kang-ho, earlier in town...

630
00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:20.302
Kang-ho.

631
00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.069
Choi Kang-ho.

632
00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:23.987
Yes?

633
00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.532
What are you painting?

634
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:35.207
Wait.

635
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.585
- What happened to your forehead?
- What?

636
00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:43.032
A motorbike?

637
00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:44.660
Are you out of your mind?

638
00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:46.328
Let me see.

639
00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:48.038
Are you hurt anywhere else?

640
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.889
No, I'm okay.

641
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.811
Wait, Mom...

642
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.648
You're not okay. You also hurt your arm.

643
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:01.483
Kang-ho.

644
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:05.472
What were you thinking
running toward the motorcycle?

645
00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:08.156
Mi-joo almost got hurt.

646
00:36:10.793 --> 00:36:12.437
So what?

647
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:14.329
Did she die?

648
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.540
Kang-ho.

649
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:19.835
Why would you say that?

650
00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:23.740
I don't know.

651
00:36:23.764 --> 00:36:26.091
It suddenly popped into my head.

652
00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:30.429
All right, eat up.

653
00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.323
<i>So what?</i>

654
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.075
Did she die?

655
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.578
I must've hurt him...

656
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:58.081
very deeply.

657
00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.169
That's why he still remembers those words.

658
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.964
But he can't regain his memory just yet.

659
00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:10.218
He needs to get married and start a family.

660
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:13.388
That way,

661
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:17.184
he won't act recklessly...

662
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:20.020
to avenge you,

663
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:24.024
even if all his memories return.

664
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.154
So I beg you.

665
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:32.616
Please don't let him...

666
00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:37.746
regain his memory until then.

667
00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:51.510
I must've been crazy.

668
00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:54.262
I was insane.

669
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.598
Darn it.

670
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:17.187
Mi-joo, why do you have a
plastic bag over your head?

671
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.730
Hey.

672
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:20.107
Hi, Kang-ho.

673
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:22.651
- Hi.
- I was a bit cold.

674
00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:25.195
- You were cold?
- Yes.

675
00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.656
You look like a hermit crab. Or a greenhouse.

676
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.799
Right, because I'm wearing this.

677
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:36.999
- You should get going.
- Okay.

678
00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:38.583
Bye.

679
00:38:38.607 --> 00:38:40.434
Bye.

680
00:38:47.616 --> 00:38:49.151
Mi-joo.

681
00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.861
Yes?

682
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:53.196
I can't hold back anymore.

683
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.762
Did you have seaweed again?

684
00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:19.723
There's another one over here.

685
00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:21.460
"Again"?

686
00:39:21.484 --> 00:39:24.588
I smelled seaweed when we kissed back in town.

687
00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.590
And you have some on your lips right now.

688
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:29.775
That's because I had <i>gimbap</i> for lunch.

689
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:31.860
I see.

690
00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:34.863
You should brush your teeth to stay clean.

691
00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:38.143
Why are you speaking casually to me?

692
00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:40.145
You spoke casually to me since we first met.

693
00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:42.147
That's right. I did.

694
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:44.483
But you didn't up until yesterday.

695
00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:46.318
So why did you suddenly change?

696
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:48.236
Do you see me as a pushover now?

697
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.420
No, I like you.

698
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:01.098
Bye.

699
00:40:02.858 --> 00:40:04.601
Kang-ho.

700
00:40:05.027 --> 00:40:06.561
Yes?

701
00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:11.009
Do you want some beer?

702
00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:13.610
No, I can't drink.

703
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.278
Bye.

704
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:19.017
As if.

705
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:21.368
You used to love beer.

706
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.438
Hold on.

707
00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:25.997
What seaweed?

708
00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:42.165
We need to nourish the pigs...

709
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:45.976
so they're happy and healthy.

710
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:51.174
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Pig Feed Management</font></i>

711
00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.009
Goodness.

712
00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:55.277
You're doing so well.

713
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.530
I picked the perfect owner.

714
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:03.562
Goodness.

715
00:41:03.586 --> 00:41:06.246
I should cut your nails.

716
00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:09.025
It's okay. I can cut them later.

717
00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:11.653
We can do it right now.

718
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:13.447
Give me your hand.

719
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.614
Mom.

720
00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:17.075
I noticed that the feed tube was clogged up.

721
00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.092
Let me check.

722
00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:22.414
The pigs need to eat.

723
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:23.540
But...

724
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:26.683
It won't take long. Bang, bang, bang.

725
00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:29.254
- Ms. Jin.
- Hey.

726
00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:31.047
Right. Hold on.

727
00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:33.884
The owner of Happy Farm...

728
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:37.903
is no longer me but him, Mr. Choi Kang-ho.

729
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.488
Right?

730
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:45.493
Yes.

731
00:41:57.431 --> 00:42:00.535
I request a consultation.

732
00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:02.260
About what?

733
00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:08.808
Have you found a partner for Kang-ho yet?

734
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:10.545
No.

735
00:42:10.569 --> 00:42:13.340
I have a female friend in my major.

736
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.800
Would you like to set them up on a blind date?

737
00:42:15.824 --> 00:42:18.136
That'd be great.

738
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.096
Can you set up a date?

739
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.014
Okay.

740
00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.615
- As soon as possible.
- Okay.

741
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:27.452
You're so cute. Give me a kiss.

742
00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:30.982
Darn it.

743
00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:32.984
It went in my mouth!

744
00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:35.403
Come here, you punk!

745
00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:37.781
Come here.

746
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:39.699
How could you pee on me?

747
00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:40.867
- Seriously.
- Goodness.

748
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:44.678
Gosh, seeing you both on all fours,

749
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:48.083
I can't tell which of you is the real dog.

750
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:51.184
Come on. That's a bit harsh.

751
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:54.047
Wait, what's going on?

752
00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.898
Where are you going with your lipstick on?

753
00:42:55.922 --> 00:42:58.134
I'm going to town to search for a bride.

754
00:42:58.158 --> 00:42:59.761
A bride? Gosh.

755
00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:03.431
Shouldn't I have a say in who you pick?

756
00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:04.933
But there's no need.

757
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.603
There's a woman who captured my heart ages ago.

758
00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:09.688
Right?

759
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:11.815
The only woman who's ever captured you...

760
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:14.165
is a female police officer.

761
00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:15.277
Mom!

762
00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:16.987
It's for Kang-ho.

763
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:21.199
Don't dare go out and get in
trouble. Just stay home, okay?

764
00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:22.909
Kang-ho?

765
00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.119
Yes.

766
00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:27.372
What's the point of having
that expensive jewelry?

767
00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.124
The moment girls meet Kang-ho,

768
00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:32.434
they have absolutely no desire to marry him.

769
00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:34.713
You'd better stay home today!

770
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:36.479
Okay.

771
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:40.927
<i>A blind date?</i>

772
00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:43.763
She's Andrea's friend from college.

773
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:48.435
Apparently she wants to marry a
nice man and settle down in Korea.

774
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.145
So he told her about Kang-ho,

775
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:53.148
and she wanted to meet him.

776
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.859
Then why isn't Kang-ho here?

777
00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:58.445
You said she wanted to meet him.

778
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.629
Well, I'm just worried.

779
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:04.200
She may say she's down to meet him.

780
00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:07.203
But what if she doesn't like
him when they actually meet?

781
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:10.430
I don't want Kang-ho to get hurt again.

782
00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.210
Don't worry about it.

783
00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:16.630
What could Kang-ho possibly lack?

784
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.299
Let's be frank. He's the
perfect husband material.

785
00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.384
If I had another daughter,

786
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:24.527
I would've immediately married her off to him.

787
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:29.100
So don't concern yourself with those rude brats.

788
00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:32.729
Let's just focus on this blind date.

789
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:33.855
- Yes.
- Sure.

790
00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:35.523
Let's focus on this instead.

791
00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:36.858
Hold on.

792
00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:39.250
Look at me.

793
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.405
What's with your face?

794
00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:44.699
Gosh. Hold on.

795
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:46.326
Do this.

796
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.286
That's it.

797
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.747
Do this. Goodness.

798
00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:53.958
You must've been stressed
lately. You look a bit rough.

799
00:44:53.982 --> 00:44:55.794
You should wear some lipstick.

800
00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:58.046
- Okay.
- Come on.

801
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.550
Don't go around looking so pale and
haggard like your days are numbered.

802
00:45:02.574 --> 00:45:05.553
You're already looking livelier. Gosh.

803
00:45:05.577 --> 00:45:07.110
<i><font color="#ffff00">Choi Kang-ho
Supreme Prosecutors' Office</font></i>

804
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:08.848
<i>He's a prosecutor.</i>

805
00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:12.003
<i>Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.</i>

806
00:45:12.027 --> 00:45:14.604
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

807
00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:17.899
<i>You're no longer a prosecutor.</i>

808
00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:20.834
You're the owner of Happy Farm.

809
00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.298
Kang-ho!

810
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:31.010
Kang-ho, let's play.

811
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:32.997
Have you eaten?

812
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:34.749
Ta-da.

813
00:45:34.773 --> 00:45:37.544
We should celebrate your
new position as the owner...

814
00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:39.087
of Happy Farm.

815
00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:40.755
But I can't drink.

816
00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:44.426
You're wrong. You're actually a good drinker.

817
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.886
So drink up. Come on.

818
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.221
I can't.

819
00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.974
Choi Kang-ho, you're an adult.

820
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.684
A man should know how to drink...

821
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.436
and black out every now and then.

822
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.412
Who knows? Maybe your memory will come back.

823
00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:58.523
Here.

824
00:45:58.547 --> 00:46:00.024
Drink up.

825
00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:01.901
Cheers.

826
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.653
Drink up.

827
00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:05.071
Go on.

828
00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:07.463
Drink up.

829
00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:12.719
Kang-ho, you punk.

830
00:46:13.061 --> 00:46:15.331
You're a true man. I approve.

831
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:17.125
- Sam-sik.
- No.

832
00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:20.503
We're out of alcohol. We're done.

833
00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:21.671
It's not about that.

834
00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:24.606
How can I become a prosecutor?

835
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.066
I want to become one again.

836
00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:36.019
You want to become a prosecutor again?

837
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:36.978
Yes.

838
00:46:37.002 --> 00:46:41.247
Then I should help you as your friend.

839
00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:45.960
A prosecutor...

840
00:46:46.386 --> 00:46:48.531
should be a jerk.

841
00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:50.283
A jerk.

842
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.577
But don't worry. You were born as one.

843
00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.329
I see. That's a relief.

844
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:55.288
Second.

845
00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:57.373
Second.

846
00:46:57.397 --> 00:46:59.349
A prosecutor...

847
00:47:00.108 --> 00:47:01.544
Right. Handcuffs.

848
00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:03.296
You should have a pair of handcuffs.

849
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.548
For all the criminals you catch.

850
00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:08.134
Handcuffs? What if I don't have any?

851
00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:11.095
Don't worry. I'll get a pair for you.

852
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.514
Will you really do that?

853
00:47:12.538 --> 00:47:14.307
Trust me.

854
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.074
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

855
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:19.869
Right!

856
00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:24.526
If I were to get you a
pair of handcuffs for free,

857
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.362
you'd probably feel indebted, right?

858
00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.920
No.

859
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:30.365
Come on.

860
00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:32.700
Think carefully.

861
00:47:32.724 --> 00:47:34.494
I'm sure you will.

862
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.427
All right.

863
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:37.914
How about this?

864
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:40.166
We'll give each other a gift.

865
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.503
I'll get you the handcuffs.

866
00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.921
As for me...

867
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:47.522
What do I want?

868
00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.510
Right! A ring!

869
00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.636
A ring?

870
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.805
I've been dying to get a ring lately.

871
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.306
- Here.
- You want a ring?

872
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.432
Like this one.

873
00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:57.725
You get it, right?

874
00:47:57.749 --> 00:48:00.311
A ring like this.

875
00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:01.479
Sam-sik.

876
00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:03.231
- Yes?
- I have this.

877
00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:04.440
Do you?

878
00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:06.067
Yes, I do.

879
00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:08.987
I didn't think you'd have
one, but I guess you do.

880
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:11.155
- I do.
- Gosh.

881
00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:15.091
Then I guess you could give it to me as a gift.

882
00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.786
I can't.

883
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:17.787
It's for my fiancée.

884
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.956
Do you even know what a fiancée is?

885
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.791
- I do.
- What is it?

886
00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:23.793
- A friend.
- "A friend"?

887
00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:25.351
Yes.

888
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.590
- You're right!
- See?

889
00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:30.925
You're so smart.

890
00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:32.302
- I am.
- Gosh.

891
00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:36.097
You're right. A fiancée is a friend.

892
00:48:36.121 --> 00:48:38.266
We're friends, right?

893
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.326
That means I'm your fiancée.

894
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.786
Are you now?

895
00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:46.983
Don't you want the handcuffs?

896
00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:50.168
Get your fiancée's gift.

897
00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:52.447
Don't you want the ring?

898
00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:55.366
I do. I desperately want it.

899
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.577
- Do you?
- Of course I do!

900
00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.954
Okay, but promise me
you'll get me the handcuffs.

901
00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:03.207
- I'll get them right now.
- All right.

902
00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:05.209
- Do you want the ring?
- I do!

903
00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:07.185
Shout if you want it!

904
00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.312
Once more if you want it!

905
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.883
Once more for the last time!

906
00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:13.649
Stop!

907
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:17.055
Hey, have you identified the body yet?

908
00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:21.184
Yes, according to the DNA result, it's
a 36-year-old female named Hwang Soo-hyun.

909
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.811
We found a passport in her bag,

910
00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:26.204
and it was fake.

911
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.456
A fake passport?

912
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:30.234
Cause of death?

913
00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:34.197
Based on the state of her
body and the autopsy result,

914
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:35.990
I doubt it was a murder.

915
00:49:36.014 --> 00:49:37.700
How would you know?

916
00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:39.202
Sorry?

917
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:42.330
We found $30,000 in her bag.

918
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:44.889
In a zipper bag at that.

919
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:48.378
Do you think she committed suicide
while carrying a fake passport...

920
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:50.019
and $30,000?

921
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.688
- You're right.
- All right.

922
00:49:52.948 --> 00:49:55.510
Let her family know,

923
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:56.969
and look into stowaway ships.

924
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:59.195
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

925
00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:07.036
Still no word from Mr. Soh?

926
00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:08.815
Right.

927
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.191
This won't do.

928
00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:12.917
I'll have to go there myself.

929
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.411
He's so handsome.

930
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:27.098
Kang-ho is the best-looking in this town.

931
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:31.671
But I heard he was unwell.

932
00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:33.589
If you have any videos of him,

933
00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:36.676
I'd like to watch one.

934
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.012
I do. I have a video of him.

935
00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:44.058
Ye-jin wanted to create her own video channel,

936
00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:46.936
so she took all kinds of videos.

937
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.661
Here's Kang-ho.

938
00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:51.733
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

939
00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:56.571
<i>Today, we're going to meet Mr. Kang-ho,
the person I love the most.</i>

940
00:50:56.595 --> 00:50:58.906
<i>He's drawing right now.</i>

941
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.215
<i>What are you drawing?</i>

942
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.536
- <i>My mom.
- I see.</i>

943
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.761
<i>Why are you drawing her?</i>

944
00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.039
<i>Because I like her.</i>

945
00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:10.126
<i>What do you like so much about her?</i>

946
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.687
<i>She's pretty, she has a beautiful
voice, and she's also very smart.</i>

947
00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.717
- He loves his mom.
- <i>She's friendly and cooks well.</i>

948
00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:19.567
Goodness.

949
00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:23.446
<i>I don't know. I just can't
stop thinking about her.</i>

950
00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:25.600
<i>All done.</i>

951
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:28.326
<i>Ta-da.</i>

952
00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:32.997
You look so pretty.

953
00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:34.108
Oh, my.

954
00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:36.778
You look very young...

955
00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.821
- in this drawing.
- Let me see.

956
00:51:38.845 --> 00:51:39.822
Goodness.

957
00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:42.909
Kang-ho is so in love with his mom.

958
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.160
Goodness me.

959
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:46.204
He drew so well.

960
00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:49.332
I like him.

961
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:52.016
He seems like a nice person.

962
00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:54.253
Can I meet him?

963
00:51:54.277 --> 00:51:56.923
Of course you can.

964
00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.299
Are you serious?

965
00:51:58.323 --> 00:52:01.093
- This is great!
- Thank you!

966
00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:03.721
Thank you!

967
00:52:03.745 --> 00:52:05.556
- You have a call!
- This is great!

968
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.476
♫ <i>I'm happy
I'm happy</i> ♫

969
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.436
Hello?
♫ <i>I'm happy</i> ♫

970
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.231
♫ <i>I'm happy
I'm happy</i> ♫

971
00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:15.024
The police station?

972
00:52:15.048 --> 00:52:15.942
What is this?

973
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.777
What's going on?

974
00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:19.487
Why are you here again?

975
00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:22.865
You crazy jerk. You son of a gun.

976
00:52:22.889 --> 00:52:25.493
- You punk.
- You just can't change!

977
00:52:25.517 --> 00:52:27.995
You just can't change,
can you, you son of a gun?

978
00:52:28.019 --> 00:52:30.498
Our village has been crime-
free for the past 20 years,

979
00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:32.291
so Mr. Son was going to be awarded...

980
00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.544
by the prime minister at the end of this month.

981
00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:36.254
We had just 20 days to go.

982
00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:38.548
What have you done, Sam-sik?

983
00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:40.675
Gosh, my 20 years.

984
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:43.177
My 20 years...

985
00:52:43.201 --> 00:52:45.361
Mr. Choi Kang-ho is here.

986
00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:47.937
<i><font color="#ffff00">Congratulations, Jou-ri! Crime-Free for 20 Years</font></i>

987
00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:50.032
Sam-sik.

988
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.315
This was reported to be stolen.

989
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:58.291
Is it yours?

990
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:01.195
- Gosh.
- Wait.

991
00:53:01.219 --> 00:53:03.072
Why is this here?

992
00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:05.199
Goodness, it's hers.

993
00:53:05.223 --> 00:53:06.742
Oh, dear.

994
00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:08.676
My 20 years!

995
00:53:10.103 --> 00:53:12.915
It all went down the drain!

996
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:16.183
I gave this to him as a gift.

997
00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:18.379
- What?
- What?

998
00:53:18.403 --> 00:53:20.381
It was a gift?

999
00:53:20.405 --> 00:53:22.383
You gave this to him?

1000
00:53:22.407 --> 00:53:23.759
Yes.

1001
00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:25.901
I gave it to him.

1002
00:53:26.745 --> 00:53:28.598
Goodness.

1003
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.474
Right.

1004
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:34.228
Kang-ho gave it to him as a gift.

1005
00:53:34.252 --> 00:53:35.897
Gosh, our dear Kang-ho.

1006
00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:37.481
How kind of you.

1007
00:53:37.505 --> 00:53:40.583
- Let's put this back up.
- Yes.

1008
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:43.988
- Why?
- It was a gift.

1009
00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:45.031
A gift.

1010
00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:47.950
Why did you give this to him?

1011
00:53:47.974 --> 00:53:49.842
Because...

1012
00:53:50.977 --> 00:53:53.456
he's my fiancée.

1013
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.124
Right, Sam-sik?

1014
00:53:55.148 --> 00:53:56.724
What?

1015
00:53:56.775 --> 00:53:58.684
What did he say?

1016
00:54:03.823 --> 00:54:06.359
You really got the handcuffs.

1017
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.555
Thank you, my fiancée.

1018
00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.697
What's he talking about?

1019
00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:19.830
Mom.

1020
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:22.500
I'm sorry.

1021
00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:29.575
Don't you know what's yours,

1022
00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.369
and what's important?

1023
00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:34.762
I told you not to give
away what's yours to others.

1024
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.181
Mom.

1025
00:54:38.483 --> 00:54:40.976
I want to be a prosecutor.

1026
00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:45.439
Kang-ho, no.

1027
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:48.567
You promised me.

1028
00:54:48.743 --> 00:54:50.930
You promised to run Happy Farm...

1029
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:54.600
- with your fiancée and...
- No.

1030
00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.435
I don't want to do that.

1031
00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:58.020
I'm going to be a prosecutor again.

1032
00:54:58.044 --> 00:54:59.939
You're no longer a prosecutor.

1033
00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.190
Yes, I am.

1034
00:55:01.214 --> 00:55:05.167
Mi-joo said I work in the Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1035
00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:11.492
Is she the reason you want to be a prosecutor?

1036
00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:13.217
Yes.

1037
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:15.386
That's why.

1038
00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:17.513
You little...!

1039
00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:21.210
Why won't you listen to me?

1040
00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:23.462
Why are you giving me a hard time?

1041
00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.339
Say you were wrong.

1042
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:29.400
Promise me you won't say
something like that again!

1043
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:37.658
I did everything you told me to.

1044
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.646
I ate well.

1045
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:44.999
I exercised diligently, and
I even moved my arms and legs.

1046
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:47.820
I took medicine and got acupuncture.

1047
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.782
It was really painful and exhausting.

1048
00:55:51.806 --> 00:55:54.660
When you tossed me into the water,

1049
00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.969
I was terrified.

1050
00:55:57.979 --> 00:56:01.265
But I still endured it all.

1051
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:04.226
Because it made you happy.

1052
00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:07.354
I wanted to make you happy.

1053
00:56:09.115 --> 00:56:12.818
So why won't you let me do what I want to do?

1054
00:56:13.828 --> 00:56:16.614
Why do you always decide for me?

1055
00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:19.784
Is it because...

1056
00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:23.120
you also see me as an idiot?

1057
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:33.925
<i><font color="#ffff00">When Nails Come</font></i>

1058
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.581
I'm sorry for dropping in on you like this.

1059
00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:42.431
It's okay.

1060
00:56:43.108 --> 00:56:45.351
Is something going on?

1061
00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:50.231
Kang-ho is getting married soon.

1062
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.525
Sorry?

1063
00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.137
He went on a blind date today,

1064
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:58.322
and the lady seemed to like him.

1065
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:02.061
She's a foreigner.

1066
00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:04.438
But she majored in nursing in Vietnam.

1067
00:57:04.462 --> 00:57:08.249
She also worked at a hospital
and a school for the disabled.

1068
00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:12.586
So I think she'll understand
and take good care of him.

1069
00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:16.799
Speaking of which,

1070
00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:21.178
could you please help him?

1071
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.582
What do you mean?

1072
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:26.016
What can I do?

1073
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.769
Kang-ho...

1074
00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:32.148
seems to like you a lot.

1075
00:57:32.532 --> 00:57:35.177
I told him numerous times that...

1076
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:38.889
you were married to someone else,

1077
00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:41.323
but I don't think he understands.

1078
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.326
So Mi-joo,

1079
00:57:44.752 --> 00:57:48.455
could you please talk some sense into him?

1080
00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:55.698
Please, Mi-joo.

1081
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:59.452
The lady will be visiting us tomorrow.

1082
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:02.163
He needs to get married this time.

1083
00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:04.513
I'm running out of time.

1084
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:06.640
So please help me.

1085
00:58:12.447 --> 00:58:14.815
- Ms. Jin.
- Yes?

1086
00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:17.443
Something's going on, right?

1087
00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:20.514
No, nothing's going on.

1088
00:58:20.538 --> 00:58:22.615
No, something's up.

1089
00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:25.784
You bought herbicide last time,

1090
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:28.704
and Kang-ho told me you abandoned him.

1091
00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:32.276
And now you're rushing his marriage.

1092
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.877
Something's going on, right?

1093
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.047
Please tell me.

1094
00:58:38.306 --> 00:58:41.759
That's the only way I can help.

1095
00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:45.888
Well...

1096
00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:51.018
Mi-joo.

1097
00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:55.022
The thing is...

1098
00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:57.983
I'm quite unwell.

1099
00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:03.030
I'm dying soon.

1100
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.758
<i>There's something I want to do.</i>

1101
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:55.416
- Hi!
- Hi.

1102
00:59:55.508 --> 00:59:57.486
- Hello.
- Hello.

1103
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.238
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Say hi.

1104
00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.922
- This is my friend, Kim Jun-won.
- Hello.

1105
01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:04.008
Hello.

1106
01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:09.582
He's not bad, right?

1107
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.751
I'm sorry for not telling you this sooner.

1108
01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.169
- What?
- Actually...

1109
01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:15.728
Yes?

1110
01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.424
I'm pregnant.

1111
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.190
What?

1112
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.427
What did you say?

1113
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.485
You're pregnant?

1114
01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.491
Does he know?

1115
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.353
I didn't tell him.

1116
01:00:31.377 --> 01:00:34.356
You idiot. You should've told him.

1117
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.249
He said there was something he wanted to do.

1118
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.878
And that he could only do it without me.

1119
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.217
It was important enough for him
to break up with someone he loved.

1120
01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:51.221
If I told him I was pregnant with his babies,

1121
01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.808
he would've given it up.

1122
01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.675
I don't want to ruin his life anymore.

1123
01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:03.510
Wait. "Babies"?

1124
01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:04.803
What?

1125
01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.695
What do you mean?

1126
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.451
Twins.

1127
01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.440
I got an ultrasound.

1128
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.400
I saw two peas.

1129
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:19.860
It was so adorable!

1130
01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:21.612
Lee Mi-joo!

1131
01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:24.505
Are you saying you're going to have the babies?

1132
01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.673
Yes.

1133
01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:30.803
My twins and I will wait for him.

1134
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.430
Kang-ho...

1135
01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:36.600
will return once he's done.

1136
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.130
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Supreme Court of Korea</font></i>

1137
01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:42.758
There's your mommy.

1138
01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.567
What did they say? Can you get your money back?

1139
01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:50.447
Even if the judge orders the landlord to pay,

1140
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:54.368
they can ignore it and get away with it.

1141
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.147
That's ridiculous.

1142
01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:59.608
Didn't you say the landlord has many homes?

1143
01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:01.777
You should get your money even by force.

1144
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.446
They already put the homes
under someone else's name,

1145
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:06.755
so compulsory execution isn't an option.

1146
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.911
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

1147
01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:13.720
It's okay.

1148
01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:17.182
I'm sorry, guys.

1149
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.727
I wanted you guys to live in a bigger home.

1150
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.064
But I'm afraid we'll have to
live in Sillim-dong for now.

1151
01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:28.902
I'm broke because I haven't
been working since giving birth.

1152
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.363
Sun-young.

1153
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:34.533
I should start working again.

1154
01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.040
Let's hurry home.

1155
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.835
- Let's go.
- Over here.

1156
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.545
Kang-ho.

1157
01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.755
Hurry.

1158
01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.537
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1159
01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.664
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1160
01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:57.166
It is.

1161
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.683
He finally made it.

1162
01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:02.004
Why would such a wealthy girl...

1163
01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.964
date someone like him?

1164
01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:06.133
He has neither money nor connections.

1165
01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.260
She's his money and connection.

1166
01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:11.972
He'd been following her around
ever since he was at the institute.

1167
01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:14.641
You dedicated yourself to
supporting him while he studied,

1168
01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:17.784
and what he wanted to do
was meet some well-off girl?

1169
01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.646
What a jerk.

1170
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.732
You'd better hope I don't catch you.

1171
01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.124
You're dead meat if I do.

1172
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:35.311
<i><font color="#ffff00">Petit Nail</font></i>

1173
01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.628

- Yes?

1174
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.311
What are you doing?

1175
01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:55.155
Gosh, who is it so early in the morning?

1176
01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.241
Goodness.

1177
01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:04.331
Who are they?

1178

1179

Mi-joo.

1180
01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.299
Mi-joo, come on out.

1181
01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:31.108
Mi-joo!

1182
01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.528
Mi-joo, you crazy brat!

1183
01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.974
Where are you?

1184
01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.740
Mi-joo!

1185
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.186
Goodness.

1186
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:45.956
Oh, dear. What do I do?

1187
01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:50.294
- What do I do?
- <i>I should've told him I was pregnant.</i>

1188
01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:53.839
Even if he was eventually going to leave us,

1189
01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:57.175
Kang-ho still should've known.

1190
01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:01.096
I made a mistake...

1191
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.974
with Kang-ho,

1192
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.393
Ms. Jin,

1193
01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.938
my kids,

1194
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.150
and...

1195
01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.405
with you, Mom.

1196
01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.784
What did you say?

1197
01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:24.995
So you're saying...

1198
01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:28.582
Kang-ho is their father?

1199
01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:33.378
Choi Kang-ho from the pig farm?

1200
01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:37.132
The Choi Kang-ho we all know?

1201
01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.706
Oh, dear.

1202
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.042
No.

1203
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.352
Why do you have to end
up with an idiot like him?

1204
01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.187
Hang on.

1205
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.774
Who knows about this?

1206
01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.193
Did you tell his mom?

1207
01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.445
No.

1208
01:05:59.538 --> 01:06:02.517
Goodness. Thank God.

1209
01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:04.603
That's a relief.

1210
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.649
Listen to me carefully.

1211
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:10.457
You can't be with him.

1212
01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:14.613
Do you know how exhausting it is
to care for someone who's unwell?

1213
01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.950
You'll have to sacrifice your entire life.

1214
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.118
What will you tell the kids?

1215
01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.203
Last time,

1216
01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:24.915
when Seo-jin said he
wished Kang-ho were his dad,

1217
01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:28.767
didn't you see how Ye-jin had a fit about it?

1218
01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:35.065
Goodness.

1219
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:38.220
Goodness.

1220
01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.028
Oh, dear.

1221
01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:47.077
Oh, dear.

1222
01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.704
Oh, dear.

1223
01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:51.331
Goodness.

1224
01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:55.168
I can't believe this.

1225
01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:57.614
They say you're unlucky with your kids...

1226
01:06:57.638 --> 01:07:00.424
if you're unlucky with your husband.

1227
01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.511
I can't believe this.

1228
01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:14.730
Gosh, my poor babies...

1229
01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.219
Oh, no...

1230
01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:23.056
My poor babies...

1231
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.698
Why?

1232
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.869
Why do you pity us?

1233
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:33.650
You don't have to.

1234
01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:36.376
There's no reason to pity us.

1235
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.644
Do you like them?

1236
01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:57.689
Okay.

1237
01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.348
Gosh, you're so handsome.

1238
01:08:05.372 --> 01:08:07.157
