00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.962
I told you. I'm not a churchgoer.

17
00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.548
My son became a prosecutor because I prayed...

18
00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.716
to a shaman.

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.260
Goodness. A shaman?

20
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.763
Ma'am, that's just superstition.

21
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.823
Your descendants will suffer bad
luck if you stand on a threshold.

22
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.827
But that's also a superstition, right?

23
00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.064
In that case,

24
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.650
- I'll just leave a Sunday bulletin.
- Okay.

25
00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:34.251
- I wish you well.

{\an8}Unbeknownst to me, these
articles are making headlines.

32
00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:03.432
{\an8}I wonder what tomorrow's headline will bring.

33
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.310
{\an8}I'll find out who's behind this.

34
00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.786
{\an8}No need for that. It's obvious.

35
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.023
{\an8}What's the first thing politicians do...

36
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.067
{\an8}when they gain power?

37
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.459
{\an8}They go after companies like mine.

38
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.781
{\an8}What can I do? The
presidential election is coming up.

39
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.284
They have to create a distraction
if they want to save themselves.

40
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:26.247
Still, they crossed the line. Don't you think?

41
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.084
Why did they use such
an unflattering photo of me?

42
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.085
Darn it.

43
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.644
Look at that double chin.

44
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.688
Gosh.

45
00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.942
Don't worry, sir.

46
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.486
I'll take care of it.

47
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.780
Right. And...

48
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:51.230
This is my husband's old phone.

49
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.358
There's a recording of a call he
had with Woobyeok Construction.

50
00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.542
Do you want to be my son?

51
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.053
Sorry?

52
00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.333
I'd really love that.

53
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:16.478
How great would it be if
I had a reliable son like you?

54
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.259
Then I'd hand over my business to you,

55
00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:25.070
move to a place like Hawaii, and fish every day.

56
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:29.992
But my one-and-only grandson is a hellion.

57
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.478
Oh, right.

58
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.356
What do you mean, things will get troublesome?

59
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.457
Right. Well...

60
00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:39.695
Due to the extreme public outrage,

61
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.489
I'm afraid Mr. Park won't be
able to get a reduced sentence.

62
00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.491
That's what it was?

63
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.035
Don't worry about that.

64
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.345
I was going to get rid of him after this stint.

65
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.999
Thank you for all your hard work.

66
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.293
Let me know if you need anything.

67
00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.895
Do you want another new car?

68
00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.007
That reminds me.

69
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.134
How's your new home? Do you like it?

70
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.860
It was a very generous gift.

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.073
Thank you so much.

72
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.893
I'll work even harder.

73
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.229
Forget it. Just keep up the good work.

74
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.498
Do better, and you'll make me go broke.

75
00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.460
I'll get going then.

76
00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.512
Hold on.

77
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.264
You seemed to have forgotten something.

78
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.939
Put that down.

79
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:50.975
People laugh when I tell them I play baseball.

80
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.160
They think it's ridiculous
when I can't even run.

81
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.273
But it's simple.

82
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.249
If I hit a home run, I don't need to run.

83
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.405
Or I can strike out.

84
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.448
That's how I've lived my life.

85
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.632
Hit a home run or strikeout.

86
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.846
So that was the secret.

87
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.541
That was how you grew...

88
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:19.143
Yongra Construction into
Woobyeok Group so quickly.

89
00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.979
I'll keep that in mind.

90
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.898
"Hit a home run..."

91
00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.817
"or strikeout."

92
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.700
Gosh, that hurt.

93
00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:38.814
Gosh, you've improved a lot. You
weren't so good not too long ago.

94
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.789
I practiced a lot.

95
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.626
Honestly, I've always liked baseball.

96
00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:50.325
But I could neither play with
my friends nor watch them on TV.

97
00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.884
Why not?

98
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.290
- Because I wanted to meet you.
- What?

99
00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:59.850
How would I ever have met you,
if I hadn't become a prosecutor?

100
00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.019
I feel the same way.

101
00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:07.649
It'd be wonderful if I had
a reliable father like you.

102
00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.616
All right.

103
00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:19.161
You can start addressing me as your father.

104
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.317
May I really do that?

105
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.359
Look at you.

106
00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:28.504
I've never seen you smile
from ear to ear before.

107
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:34.843
Then could we go to a sauna together?

108
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:35.996
A sauna?

109
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.890
It was my lifelong dream
to scrub my father's back.

110
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.477
"Father"?

111
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.965
So this is how it feels.

112
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:48.732
I love it.

113
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.761
All right.

114
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.822
I'll let my son scrub my back!

115
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.788
"Hit a home run or a strikeout."

116
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.477
Hey!

117
00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.227
Please identify the source,

118
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.991
and look into the related articles,
organizations, and victims.

119
00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:44.758
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.318
Sir.

121
00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:49.653
This is truly unfair!

122
00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:53.907
My son would never kill anyone!

123
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.243
That wealthy chairman's grandson...

124
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.704
framed my son!

125
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.664
- You know that!
- Sir!

126
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.250
All you need to say...

127
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:07.796
is that my son isn't the murderer!

128
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.423
- Please stop...
- Sir!

129
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.633
Please, I beg you!

130
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.526
- Please!
- Please let go, sir.

131
00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.263
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

132
00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.599
You impudent jerk!

133
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.909
Don't you have a father?

134
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.698
No, I don't.

135
00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.506
But...

136
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:40.010
does having one change anything?

137
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:47.017
You can't even help your son.
You're powerless and incompetent.

138
00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.894
What did you say?

139
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.481
Oh, dear...

140
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.179
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Jou-ri</font></i>

141
00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.155

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.019
<i>Your call could not be completed
and will be transferred to...</i>

143
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.119
He must be busy.

144
00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:10.874
Of course. You can't slack off
when you're doing important work.

145
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.971
Right. The ribs.

146
00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:39.721
The seasoned vegetables,

147
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.933
stir-fried glass noodles, pancakes, and...

148
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.741
All done, right?

149
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:51.164
Gosh, I can't reach it.

150
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:16.883
How did you hurt your back?

151
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:20.012
Those pain-relief patches only smell.

152
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.322
When you've hurt your back,

153
00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:26.825
the best remedy is acupuncture.

154
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.937
No, I'm okay.

155
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:32.691
These pain-relief patches will work just fine.

156
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:37.112
A long time ago, my uncle
fell down the stairs once.

157
00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.157
He thought he'd be fine just
applying pain-relief patches.

158
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.424
Then he became paralyzed and bedridden.

159
00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.454
He developed bedsores that made his flesh rot.

160
00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.471
It was terrible.

161
00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:51.627
Why would you say something like that?

162
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.061
I'm just saying.

163
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.590
How does your stomach feel?

164
00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.091
Do you feel nauseated?

165
00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:02.069
Or does it feel like you've been stabbed?

166
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.740
How would she know how it feels to be stabbed?

167
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.034
Wouldn't she know?

168
00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.939
I think it's just indigestion from
tasting all the food while cooking.

169
00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.400
This will do the trick.

170
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.167
A long time ago,

171
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.655
my aunt kept downing that drink
whenever she had indigestion.

172
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.715
She passed away after
getting a hole in her stomach.

173
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:27.594
They opened her up, and
her organs had all melted.

174
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.833
What's the matter with you?

175
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.795
Why do you keep rambling nonsense?

176
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.422
I'm just saying.

177
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:39.606
Don't worry.

178
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:43.652
My baby.

179
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.390
Right.

180
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.559
I'm thinking of naming our puppy Kang-ho.

181
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.602
What?

182
00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.479
Why that name?

183
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:54.356
If you think about it,

184
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.150
everyone with that name seems to prosper.

185
00:11:57.174 --> 00:12:00.862
There's Song Kang-ho and there's Choi Kang-ho.

186
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.281
I want our puppy to prosper too.

187
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:08.760
A prosperous dog will still be
a dog. It won't turn into a tiger.

188
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.164
A tiger?

189
00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:12.582
Oh, my.

190
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:14.918
Let's name our dog Tiger.

191
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:17.712
Then it'll become a tiger, won't it?

192
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:21.258
Tiger, roar for me.

193
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:24.344
Roar for me.

194
00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.361
Don't mind her.

195
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.992
So tell me. How's our prosecutor doing?

196
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:38.623
He's never visited ever since moving to Seoul.

197
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:42.863
He actually called in the
afternoon and said he'd visit.

198
00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.031
But I dissuaded him.

199
00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:47.617
He has trials lined up back-to-back,

200
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.662
so I told him to just rest on the weekend.

201
00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:51.663
I see.

202
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.166
I tracked down the IP address of the posts...

203
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.251
that were posted on the media sites.

204
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.712
This is footage from an
internet café in Sangdo-dong.

205
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:03.273
I believe they're exposing Woobyeok
Group's corruption to the press.

206
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.455
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Ha-young</font></i>

207
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.144
Did he reject your call again?

208
00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.994
Yes.

209
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.732
Should I call one more time?

210
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.582
Hey.

211
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.211
Forget it. Just end it.

212
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:28.340
I get that he's busy, but
he's been ignoring you for days.

213
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.995
I'm pretty sure he's seeing someone else.

214
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:33.803
Hey...

215
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.501
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

216
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:38.960
Hey, are you okay?

217
00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.019
- Here...
- Oh, no.

218
00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:43.381
Goodness, what's wrong?

219
00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.883
My goodness!

220
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.801
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

221
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.094
I'm so sorry.

222
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.138
Hurry up and apologize.

223
00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.640
I'm so sorry.

224
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.434
You don't know what I do?

225
00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:55.393
Sorry?

226
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.953
I'm a ballerina.

227
00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:01.915
Is that the best apology
after almost cutting off my toe?

228
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.042
Right.

229
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.089
I'm really sorry.

230
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.801
This is so annoying.

231
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.345
Let's go.

232
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.102
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.882
Are you okay?

234
00:14:25.906 --> 00:14:27.691
Wait.

235
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.824
It's your turn now.

236
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:37.853
What?

237
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.647
Please apologize for kicking me.

238
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.190
Mi-joo, what's with you?

239
00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:45.301
If you're that sensitive about your
feet, you shouldn't have come here.

240
00:14:45.325 --> 00:14:47.696
- Have you gone crazy?
- No, ma'am.

241
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.739
Not yet.

242
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:53.300
But I'll go crazy if you don't apologize.

243
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.105
I won't apologize.

244
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.509
There.

245
00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:11.359
What'll you do now?

246
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.097
What?

247
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.905
What?

248
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.159
I see.

249
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.912
In that case, it can't be helped.

250
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.423
She didn't hit you.

251
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:40.138
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

252
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:47.547
The last time I felt this satisfied...

253
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:50.216
was when I got my first Brazilian waxing.

254
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.469
She shouldn't have provoked me.

255
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.986
But what are you going to do now?

256
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.516
- I won't vote for him.
- What do you mean?

257
00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.476
Vote for who?

258
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.062
Her dad will be running for President.

259
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.037
He'll never get my vote.

260
00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:08.458
Sure. That's the worst you could do.

261
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.259
I'm going to open a small salon...

262
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.497
with the money I've saved up.

263
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.916
- A salon?
- Yes.

264
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.128
I wanted to save up for two more
years and open up a big one in Seoul.

265
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.673
But I should look outside
the city or a shop-in-shop.

266
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.341
- Mi-joo.
- Yes?

267
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.301
Me too. I want in.

268
00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.220
- I'll chip in.
- Seriously?

269
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.682
I'll chip in so we can look for a
place on the outskirts of Seoul.

270
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.365
What do you say?

271
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.771
Sun-young, I'd love that!

272
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.147
- Really?
- Yes!

273
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.607
Okay!

274
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.943
Then you can be the owner.

275
00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.862
- What?
- I'll be the CEO.

276
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.030
What?

277
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:56.241
That's ridiculous.

278
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.410
- All right then.
- Okay.

279
00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.995
I look forward to it, ma'am.

280
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.955
I'll do my best, Ms. CEO.

281
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:03.707
- Let me.
- You can speak casually.

282
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:04.731
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Mom</font></i>

283
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.627
Please excuse me for a minute, Ms. CEO.

284
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:10.186
- Sure, take the call.
- Thank you.

285
00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.023
Hi, Mom.

286
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.927
<i>I'm not your mom.</i>

287
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:19.988
Who told you you could use Grandma's phone?

288
00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:23.825
<i>Grandma is dead.</i>

289
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.647
What? What are you saying?

290
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:28.982
Why is she dead?

291
00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.151
<i>She ran out.</i>

292
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.318
"Ran out"?

293
00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:33.945
Yes.

294
00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:35.572
Goodness.

295
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.866
She ran out of cards,

296
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.745
so she lost the match and all her money.

297
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.497
She's as good as dead for this round.

298
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.749
Hey!

299
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.625
You startled me!

300
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:50.128
- Who's that?
- Mom.

301
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.671
Mom?

302
00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:52.922
Do you mean...

303
00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.090
Mi-joo?

304
00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.885
Your youngest daughter who's in the U.S.?

305
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.261
Give that to me.

306
00:17:58.285 --> 00:17:59.304
Hello?

307
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:02.766
Mom, didn't I tell you not to
play cards with the kids around?

308
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.725
<i>What?</i>

309
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.144
You want to send me money?

310
00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:10.231
Gosh, you don't need to send
me your hard-earned money.

311
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:14.778
Gosh, seems Mi-joo is trying
to send you money. How lucky.

312
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.946
Her daughter sends her money,

313
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.992
while we work like dogs to buy
food for our incarcerated son.

314
00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:23.578
Why is my life so miserable?

315
00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.080
<i>I'm not sending you any money.</i>

316
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.713
- Would you like me to read your fortune?
- <i>And I won't be...</i>

317
00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:29.751
<i>sending you any money for the time being.</i>

318
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.169
I'm opening a nail salon.

319
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:32.128
What?

320
00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:34.896
Your husband is opening a nail salon for you?

321
00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:37.133
Goodness. That's great.

322
00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:38.593
What?

323
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.053
Good job.

324
00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:41.846
"Nail"? What's a "nail salon"?

325
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.515
Why did you call?

326
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.100
Ye-jin is the one who called.

327
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:48.144
I told you not to give them your phone.

328
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.563
Watching videos will worsen their eyesight.

329
00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:53.149
If you're that concerned,
you can raise them instead.

330
00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:56.653
Right. What happened to that jerk?

331
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.488
What jerk?

332
00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.949
The father of your children!

333
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.590
Goodness.

334
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.845
Have you found him?

335
00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.582
Didn't we agree not to talk about that anymore?

336
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:12.418
And I chose not to look for him.

337
00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:13.878
It's over between us.

338
00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:16.172
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

339
00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:19.134
What will you say to the people here?

340
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:22.053
What will you tell your kids?

341
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:25.098
They think you're working hard in the U.S...

342
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.683
and will send for them.

343
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:29.394
So why did you have to lie to them?

344
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.063
Whatever. Just say I got divorced.

345
00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:34.957
You want me to tell them that you,
alongside Jin-joo and Seon-joo,

346
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:36.526
are divorced too?

347
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.070
Is our family cursed or something?

348
00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:43.116
Goodness. Do you know how embarrassing it is?

349
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.743
<i>You're the one who started it all.</i>

350
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:47.495
I never got a divorce.

351
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.455
But he left you for another woman.

352
00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:51.890
At least I was married when I had kids!

353
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.975
- Hang up!
- Hang up!

354
00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:57.979
This rotten brat.

355
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.885
Why does her life have to
be so miserable like mine?

356
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.860
Goodness, you startled me.

357
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:06.487
Who had kids out of wedlock?

358
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.032
We were talking about a drama.

359
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.997
Sam-sik will be released soon, right?

360
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:17.692
What should I do?

361
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:21.487
Should we carry out a
ritual when he's released?

362
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.114
Just pack up and leave.

363
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.575
There's absolutely no
ritual that could fix this.

364
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.828
There's no deity who can change his fate.

365
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.663
So just leave.

366
00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:32.373
- Let me.
- It's okay.

367
00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.125
Look who's here!

368
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:37.629
It's the woman who's been
blessed with everything.

369
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:41.007
Prosecutor Choi's mother is here!

370
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.300
- Goodness.
- Hello.

371
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.385
- Gosh, you didn't have to.
- Hello.

372
00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:46.512
- Come on in.
- It's okay.

373
00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.765
I have to leave for Seoul.

374
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.601
I made <i>geotjeori</i> and a few side dishes. Enjoy.

375
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:55.188
- So that's why you're all dolled up.
- Goodness.

376
00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:57.649
- You're going to see your son.
- Yes.

377
00:20:57.673 --> 00:20:59.275
What's wrong with your arm?

378
00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:02.001
You seemed to be limping too.

379
00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:05.490
I fell in the kitchen yesterday, but I'm okay.

380
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:07.533
You're such a doting mother.

381
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:09.827
A successful prosecutor like him...

382
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:13.221
must have good and expensive food all the time.

383
00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.749
Still, it's his birthday.

384
00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:18.294
- Is it? Then you should go.
- Yes.

385
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.004
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

386
00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:22.423
Please enjoy the food.

387
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.175
Ye-jin and Seo-jin, eat lots.

388
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.052
- Okay, goodbye.
- Okay, goodbye.

389
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.804
- Goodbye.
- Have a safe trip.

390
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.639
- Bye.
- Gosh.

391
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.225
How can I enjoy her food
when it looks like that?

392
00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.283
It's tasty.

393
00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:35.478
Try some.

394
00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:37.078
Here.

395
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.189
I'm on a diet.

396
00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:39.998
Hold on.

397
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:46.254
If it's Kang-ho's birthday,
then it's Mi-joo's birthday too.

398
00:21:46.763 --> 00:21:48.548
You're right.

399
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.661
Goodness.

400
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:55.930
You brat. You should've told
me it's your birthday today!

401
00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.084
What's your bank account number?

402
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:01.629
<i>So which building and unit is it?</i>

403
00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.048
I'm calling him right now.

404
00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:06.149
Why isn't he picking up?

405
00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:09.095
Sir, it's me.

406
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:13.698
I'm at the address you sent me.
But which building and unit is it?

407
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:15.977
Sorry?

408
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.645
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

409
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.023
What are you doing?

410
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:22.025
Pull up over there.

411
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.985
- Pull up.
- Okay.

412
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.960
One minute please.

413
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:34.969
<i>You have a call from the lobby.</i>

414
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:37.665
Yes?

415
00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:41.044
<i>Hello, sir. This is the security office.</i>

416
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:44.005
<i>Your mother is here.</i>

417
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.089
Tell her I'm not home.

418
00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:46.049
Sorry?

419
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.941
Tell her you're not home?

420
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:55.323
But she brought a bunch of food.

421
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:58.242
Hello?

422
00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:05.750
You see, Mr. Choi is...

423
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.295
What is it? He's not home yet?

424
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:12.784
I understand. He's one of the
top prosecutors in this country.

425
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.660
Of course he's busy.

426
00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:17.345
I should've called in advance.

427
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.456
In that case,

428
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.100
could you please give him these for me?

429
00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.436
Goodness.

430
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.855
- Thank you.
- No problem.

431
00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.317
Sir.

432
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.137
Do you see him at times?

433
00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.848
Yes, every now and then.

434
00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:38.351
How is he? Does he look okay?

435
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.019
Does he look healthy?

436
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:43.981
Yes. He's such a handsome man...

437
00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:46.999
who takes great care of himself.

438
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:52.031
Has he ever gotten drunk and looked depressed?

439
00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:55.383
No, I don't think so.

440
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:58.246
That's good. Goodbye.

441
00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.929
Goodbye.

442
00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.207
One minute.

443
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.765
Sorry?

444
00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:07.588
If anything seems off,

445
00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:10.591
please give me a call.

446
00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:12.135
- Okay.
- Thank you.

447
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:15.361
- No problem.
- Goodbye.

448
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:20.685
I wonder if she's eaten.

449
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.827
She seems to be in pain.

450
00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:27.275
So what if he's a prosecutor?

451
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.208
He's so impudent.

452
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.016
<i><font color="#ffff00">Choco Pie</font></i>

453
00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:46.601
He's just busy. That's all.

454
00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:01.100
<i>With a 33% approval rate,</i>

455
00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:03.081

00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:05.917
<i>former chairman of Bareun Hanguk Party

457
00:25:05.941 --> 00:25:08.915

458
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.960
<i>Assemblyman Oh, who led the ruling

459
00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:14.614
<i>as former committee chairman
of the Jeilmirae Party,</i>

460
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.866
<i>emerged as a leading presidential candidate...</i>

461
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.868

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.745
<i><font color="#ffff00">Become a Passionate Judicial Officer</font></i>

463
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:24.096
Do you know why people bad-mouth
judicial officers of this country?

464
00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:26.807
Because all they know is to study.

465
00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:30.922
But studying is merely a talent,

466
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:32.798
just like singing or drawing.

467
00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:35.676
It doesn't make you superior to others.

468
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.598
Perhaps those who only know how
to study could be the most inferior.

469
00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:42.198
Let's be honest.

470
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.851
You don't have friends.

471
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.701
Aren't you all outcasts?

472
00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.857
But those idiots act like
being a prosecutor or a judge...

473
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:54.528
is the most powerful right a human could have.

474
00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:56.447
That's why people bash them.

475
00:25:56.471 --> 00:26:00.451
A true judicial officer must
be able to both think and feel.

476
00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:05.373
Those with no friends or
empathy toward others...

477
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:08.209
studied hard to prosecute, defend,

478
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.794
and judge others?

479
00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.713
No wonder the world has turned out this way.

480
00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:16.774
No wonder only the weak
and the innocent are victimized.

481
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:20.054
Let me ask you future
judicial officers for a favor,

482
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.723
as an old, former judicial officer.

483
00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:26.435
We've been overworking
our brains for far too long.

484
00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:29.438
So let's stop doing that,

485
00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:33.541
and use our passionate
hearts to guide us instead.

486
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:35.302
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Oh Tae-soo</font></i>

487
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:40.381
That's enough. Get going now.

488
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:44.203
Tae-soo, this is Choi Kang-ho.

489
00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:46.497
He entered the institute
at the top of his class.

490
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:49.625
He's a talent who's always
placed first in his class.

491
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.684
Really?

492
00:26:52.652 --> 00:26:54.463
- Are we alumni?
- Yes.

493
00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:56.173
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

494
00:26:56.197 --> 00:27:00.344
With your grades, it'll only be a
matter of time until you become a judge.

495
00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:03.014
I actually aspire to become a prosecutor.

496
00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:05.391
You're his role model.

497
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:09.478
He's an avid fan of yours who's memorized...

498
00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:11.314
all your books and theses.

499
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:12.997
Really?

500
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.191
I'm honored.

501
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:16.417
Not at all.

502
00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:19.920
Goodbye, sir.

503
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:31.000
Have we met before?

504
00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:32.641
You look familiar.

505
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:37.131
No, sir. We've never met.

506
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.382
But...

507
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:39.925
Actually,

508
00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:43.027
- you've met my father...
- Dad.

509
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.556
We're late. Let's go.

510
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.433
Okay.

511
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:48.851
I need to go.

512
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.978
See you next time.

513
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:53.788
Yes, sir. I'll make sure we meet again.

514
00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:00.878
She's so pretty.

515
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.838
You're so pretty.

516
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:29.949
I'm not interested, so get lost.

517
00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:34.411
You'll be interested soon.

518
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.489
Have you gone insane?

519
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:45.908
I didn't do any drugs.

520
00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:48.259
Do you have proof?

521
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:51.429
This is driving me crazy.

522
00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:58.713
You're going to regret this.

523
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.381
I won't let this slide.

524
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.508
I'll get you all fired.

525
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.343
You can take your time with that.

526
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:06.277
What's this?

527
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:12.893
It's just medicine.

528
00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:15.828
Exactly. What kind of medicine?

529
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:19.915
Please answer.

530
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.710
It's for my panic disorder.

531
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:24.196
You have panic disorder?

532
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.505
It's not serious.

533
00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:31.245
Wait! What are you doing?

534
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.872
Hey! What are you doing?

535
00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:34.039
- Hey!
- Stay still.

536
00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:35.249
- You lunatic!
- Stay still.

537
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.667
Wait! No!

538
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:39.462
Do you know how expensive that is?

539
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.255
No! That's a limited-edition!

540
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.106
- They don't sell it anymore.
- Stay still!

541
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.842
- Please!
- The urinalysis came out.

542
00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.942
They all tested negative.

543
00:29:57.003 --> 00:30:00.274
I believe there was a mistake
in the report we received.

544
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:01.317
I'm sorry.

545
00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:02.318
You're sorry?

546
00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.043
Are you?

547
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.865
That's all you can say after ruining this?

548
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.965
I'll compensate for that.

549
00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:16.430
My dad was a former prosecutor
so I know how much you make.

550
00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:19.710
Don't be ridiculous.

551
00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:23.687
This is more expensive than your life.

552
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.110
Let's go.

553
00:30:32.205 --> 00:30:34.156
Will it be okay?

554
00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:37.394
It hurts, but I'm okay.

555
00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:39.230
No, I'm talking about us.

556
00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:43.943
It says here that she's the
daughter of Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo,

557
00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:46.320
a former chief prosecutor.

558
00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.920
What?

559
00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.924
How may we help you?

560
00:30:56.729 --> 00:30:58.541
I shouldn't have hit you.

561
00:30:58.565 --> 00:30:59.875
That's okay.

562
00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:03.769
It's all right. He deserved it.

563
00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:09.066
But by any chance, will
my time here be recorded?

564
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.735
You won't call my parents, will you?

565
00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:17.157
It was my first time clubbing.

566
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:22.121
Make that the second or third.

567
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.441
As for my panic disorder,

568
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:25.943
it's really not that bad.

569
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:27.611
I just...

570
00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:29.113
have trouble sleeping.

571
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:32.089
I'm just taking it to prevent it from worsening.

572
00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:35.634
So let's pretend today never happened.

573
00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:38.664
You don't need to compensate for the bag either.

574
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:41.292
I'm sick of it, so I was
going to throw it away anyway.

575
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:44.560
Then I'll assume you understand.

576
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:45.921
I'll go now.

577
00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.688
Goodbye.

How could you come here?

00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:46.413
We agreed to forget about it.

593
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.233
I got you a new bag.

594
00:32:48.257 --> 00:32:49.958
What?

595
00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:53.948
What is this?

596
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:57.466
You actually got a new one?
It was a limited-edition.

597
00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:01.497
What?

598
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:03.555
Are you serious?

599
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.016
No way.

600
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.560
What's this?

601
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:11.438
Where's the bag? This is just a dust bag...

602
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:14.525
Sir.

603
00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:18.195
You do know how well-respected
your father is, right?

604
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:23.310
The people trust and support
him due to his humility.

605
00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.938
So should you carry such an expensive bag,

606
00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:29.164
and go clubbing with your wealthy friends?

607
00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:32.903
Stop tainting his reputation, and carry that.

608
00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:35.879
Who are you to tell me what to do?

609
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.344
What is this?

610
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:49.351
Jujubes are said to be natural tranquilizers.

611
00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:51.630
You said your symptoms weren't severe,

612
00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:53.716
so don't take any medication.

613
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.400
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

614
00:33:57.785 --> 00:34:01.864
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

615
00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.869
What the...?

616
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.086
Dad.

617
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:21.341
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

618
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.260
I'm glad my daughter...

619
00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.768
Who is he?

620
00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:34.855
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

621
00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:38.859
You must be surprised.

622
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.069
He's your birthday gift.

623
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.264
Your future son-in-law.

624
00:34:42.288 --> 00:34:43.906
What?

625
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.822
You brat.

626
00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:02.424
What took you so long to
introduce such a fine, young man?

627
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:07.262
All right. Have a seat.

628
00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:09.374
{\an8}That's right.

629
00:35:09.398 --> 00:35:11.725
{\an8}Judicial Research and Training Institute.

630
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.311
No wonder you seemed familiar.

631
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:18.050
It must've been hard...

632
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.886
to grow up without a father.

633
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.681
But he grew up so well and
became a competent prosecutor.

634
00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:26.433
Even I'm proud of you.

635
00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:29.520
I still have a long way to go.
I hope to learn from you.

636
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.562
All right.

637
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.606
I hope we get along.

638
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.456
Yes, sir.

639
00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.069
It's getting late.

640
00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:40.072
How about you ladies give us some privacy?

641
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:41.740
Why?

642
00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.617
What will you talk about without us?

643
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:47.246
Men have things to talk about among themselves.

644
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.872
- Right?
- Yes, you're right.

645
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:50.681
Exactly.

646
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.919
Don't make him drink too much.

647
00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:56.547
- It's okay.
- Look at that.

648
00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:58.882
A daughter will always put her boyfriend first.

649
00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:01.066
Honey, take her.

650
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:04.069
- Call me when you get home.
- I will.

651
00:36:04.453 --> 00:36:05.722
See you later, ma'am.

652
00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:07.099
Bye, Dad.

653
00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:08.657
Bye.

654
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.092
So what will it be?

655
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.287
Sorry?

656
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:30.721
The reason for your breakup.

657
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:32.791
Another woman?

658
00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:36.101
Or do you want to be sent abroad for work?

659
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:39.631
Or I could make you a corrupt
prosecutor and send you to prison.

660
00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:42.274
I can't suddenly kill you off.

661
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:50.741
You reek of something.

662
00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:53.243
Ever since we first met.

663
00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:55.147
What could it be?

664
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:56.773
Is it the smell of dirt,

665
00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:59.207
since you came from the bottom up?

666
00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:03.462
- Father.
- "Father"?

667
00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:09.426
You're funny.

668
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.877
Listen carefully.

669
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:20.062
You two will break up within a week.

670
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:24.900
And Ha-young will marry into
Dosang Group as I'd planned.

671
00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:30.072
"Father"?

672
00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:34.701
Someone like you can never call me "Father."

673
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:38.664
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

674
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.874
Kang-ho.

675
00:37:55.898 --> 00:37:57.933
What's all this?

676
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:01.561
Don't tell me you're seeing another woman.

677
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:05.759
Hold on! My foot.

678
00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.887
I hurt my toe today.

679
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:10.946
Let me in for just a minute.

680
00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:20.539
Kang-ho. It's not true, right?

681
00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:24.027
Ta-da.

682
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.670
I even got you a birthday gift.

683
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.049
- Go home.
- How are you so heartless?

684
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.245
Are you really ending it with me?

685
00:38:33.269 --> 00:38:35.580
I'm doing this not to do that.

686
00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:38.542
But if you keep doing this,
it'll hinder my plan.

687
00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:40.183
Your plan?

688
00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:42.561
What is it?

689
00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:48.135
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">DNA Test Result</font></i>

690
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:51.722
Corporate sales, which were to be
reduced to the global economic downturn,

691
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:55.365
have actually increased by
21.5% compared to last year.

692
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.785
Here are the documents I told you about on...

693
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:10.198
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Probability of Paternity: 99.9%</font></i>

694
00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:12.883
<i>Home run!</i>

695
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.705
This is a true home run.

696
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:19.931
A walk-off grand slam with two outs.

697
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.794
So you're saying...

698
00:39:22.818 --> 00:39:27.090
Hwang Soo-hyun gave birth to Oh Tae-soo's baby?

699
00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:28.133
Correct.

700
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.900
That idiot.

701
00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.512
He had no idea what was coming...

702
00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.988
when he betrayed me for Dosang Group.

703
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.808
So what if he steals a base?

704
00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:39.076
He just hit into a double play.

705
00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:45.692
He doesn't know about the child yet.

706
00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:49.821
She was afraid he'd harm her
and the child if he found out.

707
00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:53.325
So she quit and hid as soon as
she found out about her pregnancy.

708
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:57.385
A secret about him he doesn't even know exists.

709
00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:03.335
This is...

710
00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:05.462
very valuable information.

711
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:07.104
Right?

712
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:12.818
By the way, why are you giving me this?

713
00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:17.155
Isn't that why you took me in?

714
00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.935
If you have the future President in your hands,

715
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:22.786
Woobyeok Group will be invincible.

716
00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:24.996
However,

717
00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:27.749
this isn't the original paper.

718
00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:32.129
You must want a favor from me.

719
00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:38.426
Please take me in as your real son.

720
00:40:39.813 --> 00:40:40.789
What did you say?

721
00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:45.517
I want to become your legal son.

722
00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:47.838
Then as your son,

723
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.647
I'll marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

724
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.634
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

725
00:40:52.658 --> 00:40:54.943
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

726
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.904
And I'll have a father.

727
00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:01.852
None of us will be able to betray one another.

728
00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:03.827
We'll become a true family.

729
00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.547
What if I refuse?

730
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:20.093
What can a son who's been
abandoned by his father do?

731
00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:23.847
I'll have to find a new father.

732
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:35.942
A father never abandons his child.

733
00:41:38.954 --> 00:41:42.726
She was a smart secretary of mine
who knew how the company worked.

734
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.102
I entrusted you with her,

735
00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:47.272
so you'd find a way to save my company.

736
00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:50.901
But instead, you knocked her up.

737
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:53.126
Where is Hwang Soo-hyun?

738
00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:58.840
How will you lead the
country if you're this slow?

739
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:03.747
Hwang Soo-hyun isn't the one you should meet.

740
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:05.639
It's Choi Kang-ho.

741
00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:08.376
If that kid takes this information...

742
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.046
and sides with the Bareun Hanguk Party,

743
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.481
it'll be the end for both of us.

744
00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.052
Let's be honest.

745
00:42:17.076 --> 00:42:22.307
We've gotten our hands
dirty for the past 30 years.

746
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:23.865
Don't you agree?

747
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.701
Judging by...

748
00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:29.397
how he even found out about Hwang Soo-hyun,

749
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:33.959
he must have many cards up his sleeve.

750
00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:37.420
I heard you opposed his
relationship with your daughter.

751
00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:42.050
It seems to have hurt his pride greatly.

752
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:48.306
I believe that's when he
started digging up dirt on you.

753
00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:53.255
How about we let them get back together first?

754
00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:55.549
As for the parts you believe he lacks,

755
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.133
I'll fill them in.

756
00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:59.317
What do you mean?

757
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.695
I'm going to...

758
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.322
adopt Choi Kang-ho as my son...

759
00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.158
who'll have the right to inherit my business.

760
00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:14.582
Will you get rid of the original copy
of the DNA test result in front of me?

761
00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:19.614
Come on. Getting rid of that
paper won't change anything.

762
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:21.157
Right?

763
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:25.010
He'll get rid of them like they never existed.

764
00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:27.846
My son will do that.

765
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.850
Right?

766
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:45.822
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

767
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:55.206
No one will be able to find you.

768
00:43:57.426 --> 00:44:00.712
Don't worry about it. It'll all work out.

769
00:44:00.929 --> 00:44:02.839
Thank you for the drink.

770
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:57.352
I took care of it.

771
00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:06.528
We finally have our own nail salon!

772
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.183
<i><font color="#ffff00">Nail & Nail</font></i>

773
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.784
Sun-young...

774
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:16.162
Why are you crying?

775
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:25.115
Why would you cry on such a delightful day?

776
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:28.716
You're the one who cried first.

777
00:45:30.602 --> 00:45:32.387
You know what?

778
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:35.348
I'm going to make a ton of money,

779
00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:39.185
and bring my kids back.

780
00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:43.633
I'm going to buy them...

781
00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:45.510
whatever food they want,

782
00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:48.736
and dress them in all the pretty clothes.

783
00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:50.864
I will.

784
00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:58.440
It's not smelly, right?

785
00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.525
It's thanks to our homemade <i>doenjang.</i>

786
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:03.918
Have some aged kimchi too. It's tasty.

787
00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:10.160
It would've been perfect if there was skate.

788
00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:12.662
Skate and celebrations go hand in hand.

789
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:15.832
I'm sure someone will bring some.

790
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:18.918
Gosh, do you hear those two kids?

791
00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.337
Kids these days learn so quickly.

792
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:25.273
They learn too quickly.

793
00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:28.818
I suddenly miss my late mother.

794
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.981
- It'll be fun...
- This is too salty.

795
00:46:34.005 --> 00:46:36.644
...to hit a ball with this.

796
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:38.188
This is too bland.

797
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:39.746
Do you want some?

798
00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.901
Even a dog doesn't want it.

799
00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:46.279
Goodness. Young-soon is so lucky.

800
00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:53.051
She went through so much
to raise her son by herself.

801
00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:57.415
And now he's a prosecutor and
an assemblyman's son-in-law.

802
00:46:57.439 --> 00:46:59.125
Things are looking up for her.

803
00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:02.378
It's more than just that.

804
00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:05.230
Her social status will change.

805
00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:07.842
Social status, my foot.

806
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.804
And if that's the case, she
should've hired a catering service.

807
00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.681
Look at this.

808
00:47:13.705 --> 00:47:16.518
How will we feed all those
people with that much meat?

809
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:20.146
We can slaughter a pig if need be.

810
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:24.832
There's no need to worry about
that when she has a pig farm.

811
00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:26.361
Nice one.

812
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.654
You must be tired.

813
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.572
- Hello.
- Let me do it.

814
00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:30.740
Gosh, you reek.

815
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:32.492
Wash up.

816
00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.786
Yes, leave this up to us.

817
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.247
Get dressed up.

818
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.209
Will you greet the assemblyman's
daughter while looking like that?

819
00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:42.934
You little...!

820
00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:45.046
I told you not to tell anyone.

821
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.590
She also told me to keep it a secret.

822
00:47:47.614 --> 00:47:49.399
Right.

823
00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:52.527
Well, it's good news, so...

824
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:56.266
By the way, who's the assemblyman?

825
00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.770
My son's colleague told me the news,

826
00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:03.773
but I don't know who it is exactly.

827
00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:07.694
Anyway, please don't say
these things in front of Kang-ho.

828
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.612
- Okay?
- Of course.

829
00:48:09.636 --> 00:48:12.198
It's great that he's marrying
an assemblyman's daughter.

830
00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:16.592
But honestly, it's not great news for us.

831
00:48:16.852 --> 00:48:19.914
Honestly, we didn't benefit from Kang-ho's...

832
00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:23.683
going to law school and
becoming a prosecutor, did we?

833
00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:26.129
Darn it.

834
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:28.590
We could've gotten that done at a mill.

835
00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:33.011
Look at that old man overworking himself.

836
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:34.777
At that age, he...

837
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.348
Never mind. Keep going.

838
00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:41.811
You weren't talking about me, were you?

839
00:48:41.835 --> 00:48:43.605
Hey, Sung-ae!

840
00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:46.232
- Go ahead and hit.
- She's bitter about...

841
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.583
how Sam-sik was incarcerated for theft.

842
00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:52.864
She begged Kang-ho not
to put her son behind bars,

843
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.575
but he refused to listen.

844
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.926
She's still bitter about that.

845
00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:00.622
Just leave her alone.

846
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:02.305
Okay.

847
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:09.020
What's the big deal about marrying
an assemblyman's daughter?

848
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.094
I should go home.

849
00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:19.572
My dog hasn't been eating
much due to her labor pains.

850
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.575
When's the date?

851
00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:26.147
Since she's spotting,
it'll be today or tomorrow.

852
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.915
No, I'm talking about Sam-sik.

853
00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:35.046
I'm going to ask Kang-ho to help
him get a job when he comes today.

854
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:40.093
Where are the mung beans? There they are.

855
00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:41.704
Move.

856
00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:44.430
I know Kang-ho likes mung bean pancakes.

857
00:49:58.745 --> 00:49:59.721
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Sillim Fresh Raw Fish</font></i>

{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Reject</font></i>

859
00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:16.295
My head hurts.

860
00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:25.957
You didn't have to come.

861
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:28.683
I should meet her at least once.

862
00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:31.212
After all, she's your mother.

863
00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:35.356
And I can drive when you feel tired.

864
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:37.525
Oh, right.

865
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.304
I'm just going to get a five-carat diamond ring.

866
00:50:40.328 --> 00:50:43.239
Smaller ones are trendier these days.

867
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.854
Only those who want to come off as wealthy...

868
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.496
go for big rings.

869
00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:53.958
And my dad's presidential
election is coming up too.

870
00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:01.132
Darn it.

871
00:51:05.979 --> 00:51:07.457
<i>What?</i>

872
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:08.791
You got half a carat?

873
00:51:08.815 --> 00:51:12.894
Only big department stores in Seoul have them.

874
00:51:13.195 --> 00:51:16.507
- There's a warranty in there too.
- A warranty?

875
00:51:16.531 --> 00:51:18.384
In there. Underneath.

876
00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:21.846
Come on. Stay still.

877
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.490
The gem sure looks huge.

878
00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.560
Goodness. Half a carat?

879
00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.729
Wait. Don't touch it.

880
00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.538
- I wasn't going to.
- You look nice.

881
00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:39.921
It would've been wonderful if Kang-ho
and Mi-joo had ended up together.

882
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:43.201
Remember?

883
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.927
When they were kids,

884
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:48.998
we promised to become in-laws.

885
00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:51.834
Your daughter is happily married in the U.S.

886
00:51:51.858 --> 00:51:52.919
What are you saying?

887
00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.269
I'm just saying.

888
00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:58.064
By the way,

889
00:51:58.698 --> 00:52:01.427
why did you get this when
they haven't set a date yet?

890
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:05.363
I also got a ring before I got married.

891
00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:10.743
He brought a pig with the ring
around its neck when he proposed.

892
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:14.774
Gosh.

893
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:18.042
He would've been delighted if he'd been alive.

894
00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:26.008
You're all done.

895
00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:35.393
You look like Brooke Shields.

896
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:40.216
No wonder Sam-sik is dexterous.
He takes after his mother.

897
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.985
Why are you bringing up his dexterity right now?

898
00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:46.889
What is this? Is it a back-handed compliment?

899
00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.934
What are you talking about?

900
00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:53.396
It's only natural for your
child to take after you.

901
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.525
Sure, but we're talking about Sam-sik.

902
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:59.443
What do you think?

903
00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:01.586
This is a set.

904
00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:09.328
Goodness, you look gorgeous.

905
00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:12.930
You look like a forsythia.

906
00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:15.167
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

907
00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:18.212
She has a good eye for
picking out the right colors.

908
00:53:18.236 --> 00:53:19.338
Tell me about it.

909
00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.883
How did you think of picking such a color?

910
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:25.526
Vivid colors are trendy now.

911
00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:27.638
I don't want her to think...

912
00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:30.141
I'm a hillbilly with no fashion sense.

913
00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:33.603
How dare a woman look down on her mother-in-law?

914
00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:35.104
Who cares who her father is?

915
00:53:35.128 --> 00:53:36.939
Reject her if you don't like her.

916
00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:39.525
- Goodness.
- She's right.

917
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:43.362
I'm telling you, whoever and whatever it may be,

918
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:46.490
you need to show them who's boss from the start.

919
00:53:46.514 --> 00:53:49.702
That way, they won't cause problems.

920
00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:52.204
Be confident. Okay?

921
00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.789
Okay.

922
00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:56.250
<i>Young-soon, come out!</i>

923
00:53:56.274 --> 00:53:58.544
<i>I can't seem to find the drinks.</i>

924
00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.353
Coming!

925
00:54:01.821 --> 00:54:05.024
Doesn't she look like a pickled radish?

926
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:07.970
She's gone.

927
00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:10.655
Her hair looks great, though.

928
00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:13.115
I think she'll be looked down on.

929
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.644
Right?

930
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:18.731
- Pickled radish!
- Pickled radish!

931
00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.650
- Pickled radish!
- Pickled radish!

932
00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:24.070
- Goodness. We have no pickled radish.
- Kids always tell the truth.

933
00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.404
Drink slowly.

934
00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:26.864
Young-soon.

935
00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:29.659
Have a drink with us.

936
00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:30.826
Sit.

937
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:34.845
I'll eat after I meet Kang-ho's fiancée.

938
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:35.957
Right.

939
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:38.876
It's your first time meeting her, right?

940
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.753
- Yes.
- Gosh.

941
00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:44.674
Kang-ho shouldn't be like this to his mother.

942
00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:47.149
It's understandable.

943
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:50.012
His mother worked so hard to raise him,

944
00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:54.767
so how could he only now
introduce his fiancée to her?

945
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:57.436
- He's very busy.
- Right.

946
00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:02.650
Honestly, I'm elated that
he's visiting us today.

947
00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:03.776
Of course.

948
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.876
- Hold on.
- What?

949
00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.739
Do you think he's coming here...

950
00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:11.632
to take Young-soon to Seoul?

951
00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.119
Seoul?

952
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.579
Think about it. Jong-ho did that too.

953
00:55:15.603 --> 00:55:18.666
He took his parents to
Seoul before getting married.

954
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:21.335
- You're right.
- You're right.

955
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:23.921
That could happen. So she's going to Seoul?

956
00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:25.006
It makes sense.

957
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:27.967
After all, his future
father-in-law is an assemblyman.

958
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:31.736
Kang-ho wouldn't let his mother
keep living here all by herself.

959
00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.681
What now?

960
00:55:33.705 --> 00:55:35.391
Is this goodbye for us?

961
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:39.061
This is great.

962
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:41.439
What will happen to your farm then?

963
00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:43.733
Leave your potato farm to me.

964
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:45.526
Oh, dear. Hold on.

965
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.501
Goodness.

966
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:53.367
You'll still help Sam-sik get a job, right?

967
00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:54.452
You will, right?

968
00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.037
- Young-soon.
- Sung-ae.

969
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:59.415
Oh, no. Is this farewell?

970
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.624
He's here!

971
00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:02.543
Kang-ho has arrived from Seoul!

972
00:56:02.567 --> 00:56:05.755
- He's here.
- Kang-ho? He's here!

973
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.006
- Kang-ho!
- Hurry up!

974
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.632
- Kang-ho!
- Kang-ho!

975
00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:10.983
- Kang-ho!
- Kang-ho!

976
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.804
- Goodness. Kang-ho!
- Goodness.

977
00:56:13.828 --> 00:56:14.764
Goodness.

978
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:16.515
- Oh, my!
- Goodness!

979
00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.892
She's so pretty.

980
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:20.117
How pretty.

981
00:56:22.128 --> 00:56:24.163
You're here.

982
00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:27.833
I'm the village head.

983
00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:30.002
Hello.

984
00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:36.660
We sincerely welcome you two to Jou-ri,

985
00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:40.456
a village with clear water...

986
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.793
and good-hearted people.

987
00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:46.545
There's no body of water here.

988
00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:49.673
And why do you sound like an AI?

989
00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:51.050
You're unbelievable.

990
00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:55.304
Everyone, this is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho...

991
00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:58.432
and his fiancée, an assemblyman's daughter.

992
00:56:58.456 --> 00:56:59.350
Let's all bow... No.

993
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.727
Give them a round of applause.

994
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.787
I told you not to mention her father.

995
00:57:05.213 --> 00:57:07.191
It must've been a long trip.

996
00:57:07.215 --> 00:57:08.609
Come on in.

997
00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:10.402
- Come on.
- Go in.

998
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:13.003
- Goodness.
- Hello.

999
00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:16.117
- She's pretty.
- Behave.

1000
00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:17.535
Come on.

1001
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:18.869
You must be hungry.

1002
00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:21.288
Let's eat first.

1003
00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:23.624
- I have something to tell you.
- Gosh.

1004
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:25.376
What's the rush?

1005
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.978
Let's eat first and talk later.

1006
00:57:29.028 --> 00:57:30.673
- Come here.
- Ma'am.

1007
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.524
You're so beautiful.

1008
00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.720
- How about you sing a song?
- That's a good idea.

1009
00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:38.597
- Sing for us!
- Sing for us!

1010
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.558
- Sing for us!
- Sing for us!

1011
00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:42.518
- Sing for us!
- Sing for us!

1012
00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:44.186
- Sing for us!
- Sir.

1013
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.065
♫ <i>You can't get married if you can't sing</i> ♫

1014
00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:51.527
♫ <i>You're so mean</i> ♫
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1015
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.571
So mean!
♫ <i>If you can't get married</i> ♫

1016
00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:54.697
Kang-ho.
♫ <i>You can't</i> ♫

1017
00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:56.714
I have something to say!

1018
00:57:58.099 --> 00:58:00.384
- Goodness.
- Go inside.

1019
00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:08.058
Come in. Goodness.

1020
00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:11.061
Last night,

1021
00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:14.425
your father visited me in my dreams.

1022
00:58:14.449 --> 00:58:16.775
Have a seat.

1023
00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:25.019
He was silent and glared
at me like he was upset.

1024
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:29.023
I thought long and hard about
why he was sulking so much.

1025
00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:33.792
He must've been jealous that
I'd be the only one to witness this.

1026
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:37.588
Gosh, you're beautiful.

1027
00:58:38.056 --> 00:58:39.658
How old are you?

1028
00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:41.368
I'm 27.

1029
00:58:41.392 --> 00:58:43.928
You have the perfect age gap.

1030
00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:47.348
Hold on.

1031
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:59.026
I got this at the biggest jewelry shop in town.

1032
00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:04.990
They're diamonds.

1033
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:07.326
I see.

1034
00:59:09.754 --> 00:59:11.607
Can you wait outside?

1035
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:12.816
Okay.

1036
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.209
Why?

1037
00:59:25.436 --> 00:59:27.596
I know that brand.

1038
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:28.958
You know...

1039
00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:30.125
Vutton!

1040
00:59:30.149 --> 00:59:32.726
- It's a luxury handbag.
- I see.

1041
00:59:33.695 --> 00:59:37.007
What are those boxes?

1042
00:59:37.031 --> 00:59:40.511
It says "fur..."

1043
00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:42.721
As in animal fur?

1044
00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:45.724
Animal fur? Maybe it's a mink coat.

1045
00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:46.892
It could be.

1046
00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:49.270
I heard they skin minks alive.

1047
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:54.039
Don't say something so horrific.

1048
00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:56.819
By the way, what are those boxes?

1049
00:59:56.843 --> 01:00:01.463
Do you think they're for us?

1050
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:03.966
What are you doing there?

1051
01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:17.771
Goodness.

1052
01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:23.304
Come to think of it, your fiancée
was born in the Year of the Pig.

1053
01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.598
It must be destiny.

1054
01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:29.393
Who am I? I'm a pig farmer.

1055
01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:33.579
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

1056
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.088
What is this?

1057
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.723
"Adoption Agreement"?

1058
01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.793
What is this?

1059
01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.770
Are you going to adopt a child?

1060
01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.466
Why?

1061
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.384
She can't get pregnant?

1062
01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:06.362
I'll be adopted by Chairman Song
who's been raising me all along.

1063
01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:09.323
Please stamp your seal there.

1064
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:16.315
- What?
- Be quiet.

1065
01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.983
What...?

1066
01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.542
What are you saying?

1067
01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:25.172
Who raised you? Who's adopting you?

1068
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.035
I'm your mom.

1069
01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.344
I gave birth to you.

1070
01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.790
What are you talking about?

1071
01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.958
I'm going to become Chairman Song's son,

1072
01:01:34.982 --> 01:01:38.811
inherit his business, and become
an assemblyman's son-in-law.

1073
01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.814
Wait.

1074
01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:47.429
Wait, Kang-ho. What are you talking about?

1075
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:50.099
I get that money and power are great.

1076
01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:52.351
But you can't cut ties with your mom.

1077
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.035
Isn't this what you wanted?

1078
01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:58.956
What...?

1079
01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.642
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Consenting Party: Jin Young-soon
Signature or Seal</font></i>

1080
01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:49.339
All right.

1081
01:02:52.393 --> 01:02:54.928
I'll always be your mom.

1082
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.976
This piece of paper won't matter.

1083
01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:04.855
I'm happy as long as you are.

1084
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.118
Let me ask you one question.

1085
01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:21.121
Did you propose the idea?

1086
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.941
You didn't, right?

1087
01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.401
He did, right?

1088
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:28.071
You didn't want to, but he forced
you because he needs you, right?

1089
01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:30.297
Am I right?

1090
01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:59.326
Wait.

1091
01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.480
Kang-ho.

1092
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:04.331
I can't let you go like this.

1093
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.044
Have some food before you go.

1094
01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:14.341
Food?

1095
01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:18.178
You're inviting me to eat,

1096
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.724
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

1097
01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.677
Then take this.

1098
01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.346
Take this with you.

1099
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.266
Why won't you take this?

1100
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.270
I get that you're embarrassed
by me since I'm a poor hillbilly.

1101
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.729
But why won't you take this?

1102
01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:44.356
These are all brand new.

1103
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.317
They sell these at big
department stores in Seoul.

1104
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:49.820
There's a warranty too. Kang...

1105
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.572
Kang-ho...

1106
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:54.881
- Does this make sense?
- I don't know.

1107
01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.388
Goodness.

1108
01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.351
Wait. Kang-ho.

1109
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.854
Kang-ho.

1110
01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:22.936
Kang-ho.

1111
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.897
Wait.

1112
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.899
They're mung bean pancakes, your favorite.

1113
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.124
Have some on your way, okay?

1114
01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:37.507
Kang-ho!

1115
01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:41.038
What an impudent punk!

1116
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.597
Goodness.

1117
01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.544
Look at this handbag.

1118
01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:51.340
She must have good taste
because she lives in Seoul.

1119
01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.717
Goodness. This is very light.

1120
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.817
I can barely feel it.

1121
01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.903
By the way,

1122
01:05:58.037 --> 01:05:59.973
if Chairman Song adopts him,

1123
01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:02.699
does that mean he'll be Song Kang-ho now?

1124
01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.208
Don't worry about me.

1125
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.627
Gosh.

1126
01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:17.157
I've been running on an
empty stomach. I'm hungry now.

1127
01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:18.784
Why are you out here?

1128
01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.828
We have lots of food inside. Go inside.

1129
01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:22.996
Go inside.

1130
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.581
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1131
01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:27.099
Go away, kids.

1132
01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:30.128
Kids, go play.

1133
01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.687
Go.

1134
01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.283
The smell is making me carsick.

1135
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.666
Are we really taking that home?

1136
01:06:56.762 --> 01:06:59.214
I hope my clothes won't reek of it.

1137
01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:08.959
Kang-ho.

1138
01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.684
Kang-ho.

1139
01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:13.395
Kang-ho...

1140
01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:36.710
Kang-ho.

1141
01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.350
Should I drive instead?

1142
01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.563
Okay. I'm sorry.

1143
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:07.574
Kang-ho.

1144
01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.576
Are you okay?

1145
01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.751
It still reeks.

1146
01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.512
Kang-ho.

1147
01:09:11.105 --> 01:09:12.791
No.

1148
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.808
Kang-ho, no...

1149
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.894
No!

1150
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.092
Kang-ho!

1151
01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.569
Kang-ho!

1152
01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:51.478
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1153
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.716
<i>My son won't die.</i>

1154
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.051
<i>I won't let him die.</i>

1155
01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.928
<i>What? Kang-ho?</i>

1156
01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:09.973
<i>- I'm telling you.
- Then what will happen to Kang-ho?</i>

1157
01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.740
<i>Just watch and see.</i>

1158
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.395
<i>Our son will walk out of that room.</i>

1159
01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:18.690
{\an8}<i>He'll stand here and look at you.</i>

1160
01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.525
{\an8}<i>I'll make sure he does.</i>

1161
01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:23.820
{\an8}<i>I hope you learn English
quickly so we can live together.</i>

1162
01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:25.697
{\an8}<i>That was the worst sin you could commit.</i>

1163
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.073
{\an8}<i>Letting others use you.</i>

1164
01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:29.492
{\an8}<i>My son woke up!</i>

1165
01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:30.994
{\an8}<i>It's me, Mom.</i>

1166
01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:33.386
{\an8}<i>Do you recognize me?</i>
