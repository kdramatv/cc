us anything from the U.S.

00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,091
Then what do we call him?

181
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,608
Mr. Kang-ho? Uncle Kang-ho?

182
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,906
Don't call him.

183
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,061
Don't ever meet him or play with him again.

184
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,619
Okay?

185
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,454
But...

186
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,108
Do you both understand?

187
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,916
- Yes.
- Yes.

188
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,820
That's enough.

189
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,839
They're excited to see you
again, so stop scolding them.

190
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,466
Wait.

191
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,705
Why did you suddenly come home?

192
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,789
Is something wrong?

193
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,333
Goodness, nothing's wrong.

194
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,893
I just decided to stop by.

195
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,975
My babies, I have presents for you.

196
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,936
Let's see what I got for you. Where is it?

197
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,021
<i><font color="#ffff00">My First Korean Words</font></i>

198
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,814
You should've bought them...

199
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:28,126
comic books, slime, push pop,
or other things like that.

200
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,086
Then again,

201
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,449
you left as soon as you weaned them.

202
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,633
You couldn't have known.

203
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,427
Sorry.

204
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,956
I didn't get you anything.

205
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,515
This is plenty.

206
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,066
My hands never looked this
fancy in my 60 years of living.

207
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,181
You'd always look at my hands...

208
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,617
and get angry saying,
"Why are your hands like this?"

209
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,940
I had to pay for your dad's dance craze,

210
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,360
and my hands were covered with
dirt from farming all the time.

211
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,252
I never even imagined getting my nails done.

212
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,156
Back then,

213
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,593
although you were the youngest,
you were the most considerate.

214
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,414
You always knew...

215
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,350
what was going on just by looking at my face.

216
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,236
That's how it is between a parent and a child.

217
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,323
You don't have to say a word.

218
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,118
You can tell just by the look on their face.

219
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:50,166
My daughter suddenly shows up one day,

220
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,154
and she has the look on her face that I had...

221
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,324
when my husband had an affair and ran away,

222
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,910
creditors came and destroyed my home,

223
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,761
and my future seemed so grim.

224
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,556
So...

225
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,892
how can't I recognize it?

226
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,821
It must've been so tough for you.

227
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,034
Your children will start school soon,

228
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,343
and I'm now too old and
tired to look after them.

229
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,373
I don't know what's going on,

230
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,725
but since you came back with all your stuff,

231
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:53,104
it seems you've come to stay.

232
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,734
I know it wasn't easy for you to come.

233
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,736
And it might not be easy,

234
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,030
but let's live together.

235
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,451
I once heard this singer sing on TV...

236
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,913
that if you live on,

237
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,624
you can continue to live.

238
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,462
- Okay.
- All right.

239
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,536
<i>You feel pain there? Why?</i>

240
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,913
When did it start?

241
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,556
After seeing that pretty lady.

242
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,809
Who could it be?

243
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,853
Ms. Jin!

244
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,134
I made it according to your instructions.

245
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,053
Okay. Put it there.

246
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,946
- Give it to them in there.
- Okay.

247
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,070
I know how much you care for your own piglets.

248
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,157
But this piglet has lost its mom.

249
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,925
Please share your milk, okay?

250
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,265
Goodness.

251
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,350
You must've been hungry.

252
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,228
- Ms. Jin.
- Yes?

253
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,050
It was scheduled for sawdust to arrive today,

254
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,928
but the forecast says
there's an 80% chance of rain.

255
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,639
Let's push it back then.
Ask them to come when it's dry.

256
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,197
Okay.

257
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,486
Kang-ho.

258
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,071
It's forecast to rain today.

259
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,158
We have a hospital appointment,
so stay home, okay?

260
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,258
Don't go outside.

261
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,303
Okay.

262
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,435
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

263
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,520
Hello.

264
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,980
Hello.

265
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,399
You're so adorable!

266
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,318
What's its name?

267
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,904
- Tiger.
- "Tiger"?

268
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,157
That's a unique name.

269
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,633
May I hold it?

270
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,411
Here. Careful.

271
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,206
- Tiger, careful. Come here.
- There we go.

272
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,124
Hello.

273
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,477
By the way, who are you?
I've never seen you here before.

274
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,606
Ms. Jo, it's me, Mi-joo.

275
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,760
Mi-joo?

276
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,679
Goodness! Gum-ja's youngest daughter!

277
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,098
- Yes.
- Yes, it's you!

278
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,936
You've grown really old,
so I didn't recognize you.

279
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,688
I thought you were in the
U.S. Did you come back?

280
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,581
- Yes.
- I see.

281
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,504
How have you been?

282
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,633
I've been busy. Life is really busy over there.

283
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,593
Mi-joo.

284
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,834
<i><font color="#ffff00">Intrusion Upon Habitation</font></i>

285
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,019
I'm feeling it. Wait.

286
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,049
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

287
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,927
"A person who intrudes upon
one's residence, guarded building,"

288
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,471
"structure, ship, or occupied
room, shall be punished..."

289
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,323
"for up to three years or
by a fine under $5000."

290
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,019
"Intrusion into My Heart"!

291
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,231
<i>When did you come in?</i>

292
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,942
<i>Into my heart?</i>

293
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:46,212
<i>Into my tightly shut heart?</i>

294
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,658
It'll sound good with a bit of work.

295
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,550
Oh, my.

296
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,929
Darn it.

297
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,525
Darn it.

298
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,661
Excuse me. Outsiders can't come in here.

299
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,026
Lady, why are you here?

300
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,777
How did you...?

301
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,071
I get it now. This poop-smelling truck.

302
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,782
This is where the poop smell comes from!

303
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,617
What will you do about this?

304
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,536
- What is that?
- My clothes.

305
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,913
They're all ruined because of the poop smell!

306
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,958
I'm sorry if the smell caused any inconvenience.

307
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,460
It's usually fine,

308
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,671
but when it's windy and rainy,
it gets a little worse.

309
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,548
"A little worse"?

310
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,884
No one can breathe around here.

311
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,261
We're doing our best about that.

312
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,930
We have a smell reduction
system and sprayed ozonated water,

313
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:57,393
but no matter how clean we keep
the place, they're still livestock.

314
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,104
It's impossible to get rid
of the smell completely.

315
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,955
If you can't get rid of the smell,

316
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,110
you should get rid of the pig farm!

317
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:10,198
You're ruining other people's careers
just to make a living for yourself.

318
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,908
Isn't that right?

319
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,160
What are you talking about?

320
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,745
I didn't ruin anyone's career!

321
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,705
I'm a composer. An artist.

322
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,958
But I'm unable to do anything
because of this poop smell.

323
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,544
What if I can never write songs again?

324
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,546
Are you going to provide for me?

325
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,048
I'm warning you.

326
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,466
Stop being disrespectful.

327
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,218
Or what? What will you do?

328
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,677
Then I'll stop being polite too.

329
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,430
So you're a composer?
But you can't write a song?

330
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,516
Let me tell you why.

331
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,518
It's not because of the smell of the poop.

332
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,229
It's because you're an awful person!

333
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,147
You have no basic manners for others,

334
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,456
and zero authenticity!

335
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,484
Forget it.

336
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,028
My business is legally registered,

337
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,281
and I'm operating my farm
without any legal problems.

338
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,158
So if you have any issues,

339
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,161
go file a complaint or sue me!

340
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,303
Do whatever you want.

341
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,791
I have no manners?

342
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,087
I'll show you what I'm made of.

343
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,964
You're dead.

344
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,216
Livestock Division!

345
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,025
- Livestock Division!
- How may I help you?

346
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,648
Livestock Division...

347
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,832
How may I help you, sir?

348
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,572
Is this...

349
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,657
the Livestock Division?

350
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,716
It's the Livestock Division.

351
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,788
I thought you'd like pizza.
But you didn't even finish half.

352
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,708
It's too greasy, and it tastes bad.

353
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,709
Wait.

354
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:50,104
When we go to the U.S., do we have
to eat food like this every day?

355
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,799
It's awful.

356
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,984
Can you just ask Dad to live in Korea?

357
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,763
Right, when will he come?

358
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,822
Well...

359
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,119
Things are busy at the beauty salon,
so he can't come for a while.

360
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,874
What a relief.

361
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,112
Right? I was scared that he might come.

362
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,172
- What?
- Look, there's a clothing store.

363
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,452
The nail salon next door?

364
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,662
It's been closed for a while.

365
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,972
They picked the wrong business.

366
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,004
Most of the customers around
here are elderly farmers.

367
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,981
Who'd get their nails
done in this rural village?

368
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,109
I'm about to go bust too.

369
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,644
It's a hassle to do it every year,

370
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,396
but once we cut and dry them,

371
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,024
we can eat pumpkin seeds, porridge, pancakes,

372
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,943
and ricecake all winter.

373
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,961
It's the best snack, isn't it?

374
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,113
I mean,

375
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,910
I always tell her we should
all come and work together.

376
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:05,331
How come she never shows up?

377
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,959
Don't be so harsh on her.

378
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,002
It's not easy to raise pigs.

379
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,812
I'm not talking about Young-soon!

380
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,802
Let me ask you something.

381
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,613
Mr. Son, when, where, how, and why...

382
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,893
did you meet someone like her?

383
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,521
I've never heard the story either.

384
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,416
I haven't been able to tell you
for the sake of our village's safety.

385
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,129
But I think it's finally time.

386
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,299
She was actually...

387
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,751
a daughter of a newly-rising Yakuza boss...

388
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,044
in Japan.

389
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,936
- What?
- What?

390
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:58,634
<i>Her family had to disperse to
avoid their enemies' attacks.</i>

391
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,528
And that's how she ended up coming to Korea.

392
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,641
She wandered around,

393
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,452
then she collapsed in a valley at Mt. Gyeryong.

394
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,232
<i>I found and saved her.</i>

395
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,957
Excuse me.

396
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,501
Hello?

397
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,155
Wake up.

398
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,130
Are you all right?

399
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,040
<i>If her true identity is leaked,</i>

400
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,042
there'll be...

401
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,251
- Goodness!
- Goodness.

402
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,268
...bloodshed in this village.

403
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,938
So if you don't want to die...

404
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,067
- Goodness!
- Goodness!

405
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,194
Get the porridge ready.

406
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,154
Pumpkin porridge.

407
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,898
You totally got us!

408
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,775
You scared us!

409
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,110
It's not like you to make such jokes.

410
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,987
"Get the porridge ready!"

411
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,530
- Goodness!
- My gosh!

412
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,865
Good grief!

413
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,408
You scared me!

414
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,452
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,594
I'm late, aren't I?

416
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,623
What?

417
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,681
Which one should I cut open first?

418
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,648
- My gosh!
- What's up with you?

419
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,843
- My gosh.
- Look at this.

420
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,553
I don't want to die.

421
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,071
Your nails are so pretty!

422
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,324
Mi-joo did it for you, right?

423
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,980
<i>I already know you take great care of your farm.</i>

424
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:39,443
But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.

425
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,613
I'm sorry my farm is taking
up your busy schedule.

426
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,240
Don't mention it.

427
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,534
I should speak with you in person,

428
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,602
but it's foot-and-mouth disease control period,

429
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,954
so farm visits are restricted.

430
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,138
Yes, I'm well aware.

431
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,918
I'll do what I can to take care
of it, so don't worry about it.

432
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,378
Yes.

433
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,562
Okay. Goodbye.

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,285
Mom, look.

435
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:18,080
I can fully squeeze this now.

436
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,778
You're the best.

437
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,948
See? All the exercise is paying off, isn't it?

438
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,116
Yes.

439
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,411
If you continue to practice
walking and treat your legs,

440
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,496
you'll be able to walk very soon.

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,054
Gosh.

442
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,268
Mom.

443
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,672
There's something I want.

444
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,023
- Something you want?
- Yes.

445
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,485
There's something you want?

446
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,404
Tell me. I'll buy anything for you.

447
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,573
A dog.

448
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,351
- A dog?
- Yes.

449
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,645
We have a dog at the farm. Yellow.

450
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,330
No, not like Yellow.

451
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,401
A dog I can keep in the room like Ms. Jo's dog.

452
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,321
A dog I can carry in my arms.

453
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,239
No, you can't have that.

454
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,617
And in the room?

455
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,204
What about all the fur?
And who'll pick up after it?

456
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,372
Who'll feed and wash it?

457
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,848
I will! I'll do everything.

458
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,020
Kang-ho, who made you breakfast this morning?

459
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,715
You did.

460
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,317
Who bathed you and helped you get dressed?

461
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,389
Goodness.

462
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,141
And you have rhinitis too.

463
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,226
So no.

464
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,769
Come on, Mom. Please.

465
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,396
- Please, just this once.
- No.

466
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,331
You can't have a dog.

467
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,472
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Happy Farm</font></i>

468
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,759
We're here. Let's go.

469
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,187
Good. One second.

470
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,900
Kang-ho, great job.

471
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,138
Let's try moving your feet.

472
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,863
How...

473
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,992
can I live with this?

474
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,413
Don't get discouraged.

475
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,374
Kang-ho. Look at me.

476
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,863
You're doing great right now. You got this.

477
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,407
You're a miracle. A miracle in our hospital.

478
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,367
Not everyone can recover so quickly...

479
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,578
- No, dog.
- Yes, dawg, you're tough!

480
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,829
Tougher than anyone!

481
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,122
No, not that!

482
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,724
That dog! I want that dog!

483
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,102
My Happy?

484
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,731
You can't have Happy. That's my dog.

485
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,688
{\an8}<i>The foot-and-mouth disease also
broke out in North Gyeongsang.</i>

486
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:58,282
<i>Quarantine authorities are doing everything
they can to prevent the spread.</i>

487
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,560
<i>Next story.</i>

488
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,103
- Ms. Jin Young-soon.
- <i>Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo...</i>

489
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,605
- Come to the endoscopy room.
- <i>...of the Jeilmirae Party...</i>

490
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,021
- Yes.
- <i>...declared candidacy...</i>

491
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:05,941
<i>for the primary presidential election.</i>

492
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,459
<i>Park Min-hui reports.</i>

<i>with the highest approval
ratings as a potential candidate,</i>

<i>...in his office in Yeouido,</i>

<i>...his presidential candidacy.</i>

499
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,291
- <i>His first scheduled item...</i>
- He's that prosecutor.

500
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,668
- <i>...was visiting a nearby market...</i>
- Oh, my.

501
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,545
- <i>...to encourage businesses.</i>
- He must be running for President.

502
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,963
- <i>The marketplace was packed...</i>
- Ms. Jin.

503
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,049
- <i>...with reporters and supporters.</i>
- Come in.

504
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,258
- Okay.
- <i>Assemblyman Oh...</i>

505
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,636
{\an8}<i>promised the revitalization
of local marketplaces,</i>

506
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,278
{\an8}<i>and took his first step for the campaign.</i>

507
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,462
- I need to make a bathroom run.
- Okay.

508
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,443
What's this?

509
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,945
He was with another woman.

510
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,337
He even had a child with her.

511
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,555
He wanted to marry you,

512
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,016
so he killed her and his child.

513
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,940
I can't believe this.

514
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,161
Do you expect me to believe this?

515
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,289
Dad, what's wrong with you?

516
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,708
Fine.

517
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,488
Let's say this is true.

518
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:20,174
Why didn't you report him to the police then?

519
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,126
It was 30 years ago.

520
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,504
He knew I was involved in his father's death.

521
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,564
He's trying to use you to take revenge on me.

522
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,860
<i>Jujubes are said to be natural tranquilizers.</i>

523
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,764
<i>You said your symptoms weren't severe,</i>

524
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,099
so don't take any medication.

525
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,867
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

526
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,997
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

527
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,001
If I report him to the police
and an investigation is launched,

528
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,963
everything will be exposed to the world.

529
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,509
And that'll be the end of me.

530
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,457
Ha-young.

531
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,682
We should end this first.

532
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,696
If news of his son's draft evasion breaks out,

533
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,241
people will turn their backs.

534
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,520
This is why...

535
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,539
it's best to have daughters since
they're free of military service.

536
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,334
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

537
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,920
Ha-young.

538
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,715
- What happened to your hand?
- Hello.

539
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,177
Goodness.

540
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,749
I gave him the pills to kill him.

541
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,042
What are you saying?

542
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,503
- Take her upstairs.
- Please come upstairs.

543
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,546
Dad.

544
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,132
I did it.

545
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,149
- Ha-young!
- Wait.

546
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,512
I did it, Mom.

547
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,555
Dad.

548
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,973
Dad?

549
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,156
- Please come upstairs.
- I did it.

550
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,409
Dad?

551
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,355
I'm telling you, I did it.

552
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,899
Kang-ho ended up like that,

553
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,668
so he must be like a dog off its leash.

554
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,203
He needs to be squeezed tight...

555
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,497
to realize who's holding his leash, right?

556
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,749
I'll find Yang Gu-man's suicide note.

557
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,003
Mr. Soh, that's not a card we can play.

558
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,548
Who'll believe what's on
a criminal's suicide note?

559
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,885
Even if we do find the water
bottle with Kang-ho's blood on it,

560
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,861
how are we going to prove Ha-young did that?

561
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,223
Oh Tae-soo knows all this.

562
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,225
He was once a prosecutor.

563
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,687
So we need to secure a
hidden ace up our sleeves...

564
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,622
to use in unforeseen situations.

565
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,582
Bring me that.

566
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:21,089
<i>I already know you take great care of your farm.</i>

567
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:26,193
<i>But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.</i>

568
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,702
What are you doing there?

569
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,871
I want to see you.

570
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,066
Mom.

571
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,610
Why are you so pretty?

572
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,404
You're prettier than people on TV.

573
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,464
You're much prettier than IU, Mom.

574
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,675
I said no.

575
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,830
Why not?

576
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,640
Mi-joo likes dogs.

577
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,767
Mi-joo?

578
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,962
Oh, my.

579
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,171
Do you remember her?

580
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,689
I keep thinking of her.

581
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,345
So please, Mom. Buy me a dog so I can show her.

582
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,349
But Mi-joo is married and lives in the U.S. now.

583
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,575
So even if you had one, you couldn't show her.

584
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,689
No, Mi-joo lives in Ye-jin's home.

585
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,025
I'm going to visit our neighbor.

586
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,501
Don't go out and stay home.

587
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,546
Don't go out.

588
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,389
Yellow.

589
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,751
Come here, Yellow.

590
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,671
Good boy. Yellow.

591
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,715
All right, come here. Good boy.

592
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,649
Come here. It's all right.

593
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,804
Good boy.

594
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,488
All right. One second.

595
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,038
Stay still, Yellow.

596
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,275
- No!
- No!

597
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,110
This can't happen! Yellow!

598
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,946
- No, Yellow! Gosh.
- Kang-ho.

599
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,049
Hold this. Halt immediately!

600
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,752
<i><font color="#ffa07a">From the Pig Farm
Please Enjoy</font></i>

601
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,957
You surprised me.

602
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,238
This isn't your first time seeing me.
Why are you so surprised?

603
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,922
You're right.

604
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,132
Are you going somewhere?

605
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,036
Yes, to get my nails done.

606
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,886
I see.

607
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,931
- See you around.
- Okay.

608
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,186
Wait.

609
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,272
What kind of dog is that?

610
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,803
Canine.

611
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,362
Yes, I know that.

612
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,658
I meant the breed.

613
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,328
Bi...

614
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,789
Bickering?

615
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,360
It was something like that.

616
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,210
Bishop?

617
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,672
- Bi...
- Bichon?

618
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,174
Yes, that's right.

619
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,470
Bichon.

620
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,265
Bichon.

621
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,600
Bichon.

622
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,840
I understand what you're saying,

623
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,843
but to be precise, the
farm was in the village first.

624
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,554
You moved in after.

625
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,572
There's nothing we can do in this situation.

626
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,685
I already spoke to the
farm and provided guidance.

627
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,727
Guidance?

628
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,830
Even a street dog could
give them this much guidance.

629
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,609
What did you say?

630
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,238
I mean, a citizen is suffering from it.

631
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:17,784
My rights to the pursuit of
happiness are being violated!

632
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,536
And who provides your paycheck?

633
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,288
You're paid by our tax money.

634
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,624
I'm the reason you're making a living!

635
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,418
You're crossing the line.

636
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,004
The farm owner is a citizen too.

637
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,354
She pays taxes too.

638
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,092
Or has she done anything illegal at the farm?

639
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,219
Why are you giving her such a hard time?

640
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,346
What's your name? Where's your nametag?

641
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,891
And why are you yelling at me?

642
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,611
I'll call the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs,

643
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:47,522
and make sure you get the
biggest lesson of your lifetime.

644
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,899
I'll end your life!

645
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,749
Go ahead.

646
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:55,489
Even the old villagers don't say
anything, and you roll in and do this?

647
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,949
"Roll in"? I'll show you how I roll.

648
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,994
I'll defend my right to pursue happiness!

649
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,387
I'll defend my right to pursue happiness!

650
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,026
Bichon.

651
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,971
Bichon.

652
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,681
Bichon.

653
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,099
Goodness.

654
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,159
How can I work with these
hands? They're so pretty.

655
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,104
Right? Goodness.

656
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,482
Forget working. I don't
even want them to get wet.

657
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,942
How can I cook?

658
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,027
Make your husband cook.

659
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,403
What are husbands for?

660
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,170
Should I do that?

661
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,075
My hands are as pretty as my maiden days,

662
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,759
so maybe he'll do it for me, right?

663
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,037
Oh, my.

664
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,722
Were your hands as huge
as a caldron lid back then?

665
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,085
- Caldron lids?
- Never mind.

666
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,296
Caldron lids are at least shiny.

667
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,381
You little...!

668
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,232
- You and your mouth.
- Stop it.

669
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,345
When did he come and leave this here?

670
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,889
I don't think he came and left it.

671
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,949
It was in the drain.

672
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,021
Does this mean we can't see Kang-ho anymore?

673
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,316
No way. We live in the same village.

674
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,001
We'll run into each other sometimes.

675
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,712
Do we pretend he's a stranger?

676
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,965
I'm sure a little nod will be fine.

677
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,579
Poor Kang-ho.

678
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,540
He must be bored without us.

679
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:33,184
But why do we seem more bored than he might be?

680
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,987
Kang-ho!

681
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,807
I mean, Mr. Kang-ho.

682
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,726
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

683
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,437
Seo-jin, Ye-jin. What brings you here?

684
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,980
This is our home,

685
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,316
so we're usually here.

686
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,416
Right.

687
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,237
Anyway, what's that?

688
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,905
My goodness.

689
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,340
Is that a pig?

690
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,301
This is my pet pig,

691
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,538
Lion!

692
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,166
A dog named Tiger,

693
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,960
and a pig named Lion.

694
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,795
What an odd village.

695
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,979
May I hold the pig?

696
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,106
Sure.

697
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,111
Be careful.

698
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,602
By the way, are there any
other people in the home?

699
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,895
Other people?

700
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,245
There are lots of people.

701
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,081
Lots?

702
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,027
No, Lion!

703
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,487
- No!
- No!

704
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,447
- No!
- Lion!

705
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,366
- No!
- Catch it!

706
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,217
I have to give it to Mi-joo!

707
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,662
What?

708
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,663
Kang-ho left with a pig?

709
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:53,807
I deserve to die, Ms. Jin.

710
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,127
That punk.

00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,648
Choi Kang-ho!

717
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,191
- Catch it!
- Lion!

718
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,068
- Lion!
- Lion!

719
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,086
- Lion!
- Run!

720
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,199
- Lion!
- Lion!

721
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,283
Yes.

722
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,284
You said you know...

723
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,874
the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs, right?

724
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:31,871
How do you know him?

725
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,207
Yes, the minister has a daughter.

726
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,668
The daughter's friend? Yes.

727
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,351
And...

728
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,879
Hey, if that's the case,

729
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,215
I might be closer to him, you punk.

730
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,635
- Hey, listen.
- Lion!

731
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,220
- Lion!
- Lion!

732
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,930
- Lion!
- Where are you going?

733
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,172
- I'll really kill...
- Lion!

734
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:51,865
- Lion!
- Lion!

735
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,893
- Lion!
- Lion!

736
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,520
I just had an accident.

737
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,148
Yes, I was driving!

738
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,315
I'm sorry!

739
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,401
Hey, stop right there!

740
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,027
You rascals!

741
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,530
Darn it!

742
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,339
Darn it! Hey!

743
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,968
- Lion!
- Lion!

744
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,997
- No!
- I can't.

745
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,722
No!

746
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,795
Guys, come on.

747
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,755
I can't run anymore!

748
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:25,008
Yes, we're done.

749
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,400
You should go.

750
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,430
Come here.

751
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,724
If your mom catches the three of us on that,

752
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,017
we're dead meat.

753
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,227
We're already dead because of Lion.

754
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,952
Come quickly!

755
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,232
Kang-ho!

756
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,151
- Ye-jin!
- Seo-jin!

757
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,402
- Assemble!
- Assemble!

758
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,211
Seo-jin!

759
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,254
Ye-jin!

760
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,534
- Move!
- Move!

761
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,952
- Lion!
- All right!

762
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,121
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

763
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,748
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

764
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

765
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,958
- See you later.
- Thanks.

766
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,001
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

767
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,936
- Bye!
- Goodbye.

768
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,635
- Mom.
- Yes?

769
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,970
Should I open a nail salon here?

770
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,515
You saw how thrilled they were.

771
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,767
Women will be women even in a rural village.

772
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,435
They all want to be pretty.

773
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,146
What do you think?

774
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,955
Do you have...

775
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,748
enough money?

776
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,336
How will you open it?

777
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,047
Just set the table.

778
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,800
Come on, Mom.

779
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,972
Stop right there!

780
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,500
Mom, catch it!

781
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,834
- Catch Lion!
- Catch the pig!

782
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,961
- Mom, hurry!
- Mom!

783
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,046
- Catch the pig!
- Catch it, Mom!

784
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,674
- Catch the pig!
- Mom, catch it!

785
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,357
Lion!

786
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,469
Mom, catch Lion!

787
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,720
- Catch Lion!
- Mom, hurry!

788
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,639
- Lion!
- Catch it!

789
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,974
She caught it! Mom!

790
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,892
- Yes.
- What a relief.

791
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,310
What a relief.

792
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,994
Thank you.

793
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,957
Lion.

794
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,010
It's...

795
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,216
Choi Kang-ho!

796
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,026
Run! Now!

797
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,679
Stop right there!

798
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,347
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

799
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,932
That little...!

800
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,574
Darn it.

801
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,161
Hello?

802
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,981
Yes, Director.

803
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,067
<i>Yes, regarding the dog you asked about earlier.</i>

804
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,113
Let me call you back right back.

805
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,213
Stop right there!

806
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,722
Mi-joo?

807
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,715
Oh, my.

808
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,442
Kang-ho really was talking about you.

809
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,888
Goodness, he mentioned Mi-joo?

810
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,515
He kept saying he had to show her a dog,

811
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,283
and I had no idea what he meant.

812
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,870
Anyway, are you back for good?
What about your husband?

813
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,774
Well, the thing is...

814
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,693
He owns a huge beauty salon in the U.S.

815
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,694
Right.

816
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,363
She's back for the children.

817
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,281
It's just her for now.

818
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,590
I see.

819
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,411
But isn't it wonderful?

820
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:44,123
Your husband is successful,
and you have adorable children.

821
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,057
Right.

822
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,228
Is Kang-ho back?

823
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,606
Yes, don't let him into the piggery.

824
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,235
I'm sorry. I have to get going.

825
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,518
- Come by for a visit.
- Okay.

826
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,895
- Bye.
- All right.

827
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,162
- Bye.
- Bye.

828
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,547
If I catch them, I'll kill them.

829
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,627
What is this? What's this water?

830
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,003
Wait a second.

831
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,881
It smells like disinfectant.

832
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,991
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">All Incoming Cars
Must Be Disinfected</font></i>

833
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,222
Do you know how sensitive pigs are?

834
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,574
When one of them is infected, they all get sick.

835
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,353
This one ran all around the village,

836
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,148
so who knows what it caught?

837
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,915
What are we going to do with it?

838
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,861
I'm sorry.

839
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,780
It lost its mom, and is
the runt of the litter...

840
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,991
that gets pushed around by other pigs.

841
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,468
I had to feed the poor thing
through a surrogate mom.

842
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,455
Mom.

843
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,139
May I keep this one?

844
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,709
I'll feed it,

845
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,794
wash it, and lull it to sleep.

846
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,004
What?

847
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,424
I have you, but this pig doesn't have a mom.

848
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,150
I'll be its mom.

849
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,262
Nonsense.

850
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,655
How will you raise a dirty
and smelly pig at home?

851
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:29,771
"Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,"

852
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,481
"but that's not the case."

853
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,776
"They not only do their business in one place,"

854
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,251
"but they also only sleep where it's clean."

855
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:42,340
"But humans started to
lock them up in tiny pigsties."

856
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,176
"Isn't that so sad?"

857
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,181
That's what you said.

858
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,297
Who could it be?

859
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,924
All right.

860
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,857
Come here.

861
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,260
Let's go inside.

862
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,486
Go in. I'll be right back.

863
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,621
Coming!

864
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,958
Who is it?

865
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,294
Hey. Are you kidding me?

866
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,783
Oh, no.

867
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,326
Are you bummed about the food?

868
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,953
Then look at my car.

869
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,872
I almost totaled the car not long ago.

870
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,749
But you let out the darned pig again,

871
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,585
and made me drive it into a ditch.

872
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,753
I'll have to scrap it!

873
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:39,090
I don't know what happened,

874
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:43,302
but I'll compensate you if you were
harmed in any way because of us.

875
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,264
Okay, good. Then give me $1 million a year.

876
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,223
What?

877
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,225
I'm a composer.

878
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,395
I write at least 60 songs
a year for $10,000 each,

879
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,146
so that's $600,000.

880
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,065
Plus the royalty...

881
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,483
and album sales.

882
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,653
You haven't even released ten songs altogether.

883
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,530
And they're off the market...

884
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,532
because of plagiarism.

885
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,367
You were sued for the newest song,

886
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,663
because it was the same as
"Ripe Persimmon" by Na Hoon-a.

887
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,456
- What's your problem?
- Goodness.

888
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,710
Are you a detective or something?

889
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,920
- Who the heck are you?
- What's with you?

890
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,505
- Let go!
- What the...?

891
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,215
- Who are you?
- Hey!

892
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,815
Hey!

893
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,195
Darn it. Hey!

894
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,684
So you're saying...

895
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,438
Mr. Choi Kang-ho here attacked you first?

896
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,996
Yes.

897
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,942
I'm sorry.

898
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,877
I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

899
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,071
Don't apologize.

900
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,907
You didn't do anything wrong.

901
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,091
You did nothing wrong, okay?

902
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,762
I mean,

903
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,708
there's no son who'd hold
back when he sees his mom...

904
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,975
being grabbed and hurled on the ground.

905
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,005
I was grabbing her,

906
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,634
but he suddenly rushed at me,

907
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,219
then pushed me, so I let go of her.

908
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,888
I'm not going to settle.

909
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,348
Just arrest him.

910
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,100
All right, don't be like this.

911
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,686
Ms. Jin here is a woman of great character,

912
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,856
and she has a great
relationship with everyone here.

913
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,942
You've become neighbors now, so...

914
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,318
"Neighbors"?

915
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,487
I'm a civil man, so I haven't done anything,

916
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,656
but I can sue them for a lot of things.

917
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,865
Hey, tell them.

918
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,409
You intruded on my home,

919
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,079
and then you brought that pig out on the road.

920
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,539
That's why I'm in this mess. Isn't that true?

921
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,582
It's Lion.

922
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,292
It was a pig, you idiot!

923
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,850
Hey!

924
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,296
"Idiot"?

925
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,801
My son is much smarter and has
much better judgment than you do!

926
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,721
Then you tell me with your better judgment.

927
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,516
Did you see me get into a car accident?

928
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,075
- Did you or didn't you?
- I did!

929
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,662
"Game over."

930
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,817
- He saw me.
- That man...

931
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,583
I'll really kill...

932
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,780
<i>He saw Lion, tried to dodge it,
and then the car swerved and crashed.</i>

933
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,991
<i>And he said this into the phone.</i>

934
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,284
"I just had an accident."

935
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,094
"Yes, I was driving!"

936
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:18,582
Then he got out of the car and fell down.

937
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,210
Hang on.

938
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,753
Hold on.

939
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,754
That means...

940
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,841
you used your phone while driving.

941
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:31,068
Were you even wearing your seatbelt?

942
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,779
Well...

943
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,017
I mean,

944
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,325
well...

945
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,854
Phone use is a violation...

946
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,289
of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

947
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,119
Neglect of a seatbelt is a violation...

948
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:47,803
of Article 50, Paragraph 1
of the Road Traffic Act.

949
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,949
- I'll fold.
- Another one.

950
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,784
- Give him one.
- I'm done.

951
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,495
Hey, bring me a pack of cigarettes!

952
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,180
- Yes.
- Here we go.

953
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,881
Bet big, will you?

954
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,689
I'll take one.

955
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,986
Enjoy your cigarettes.

956
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,518
- Hey, a pack of cigarettes.
- Yes, sir.

957
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,203
- Goodness.
- What now?

958
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,273
Okay.

959
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,483
Good work.

960
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,042
- Gosh.
- That's your paycheck.

961
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,170
You little...!

962
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,617
You jerk.

963
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,258
Let go!

964
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,953
You jerk.

965
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,164
I've been looking everywhere for you.

966
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,250
- Bang Sam-sik?
- Yes, that's me, you scumbag.

967
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,960
You knew it was stolen, right?

968
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,338
You sent me there knowing it was stolen.

969
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,091
I rotted in prison for months because of you!

970
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,399
Your friend is a prosecutor!

971
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,736
I thought he'd get you out.

972
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,140
He was never my friend, you punk.

973
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,949
Goodness!

974
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,938
{\an8}<i>This afternoon, a violent
fight between gangs broke out...</i>

975
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:06,565
{\an8}<i>at an adult entertainment
business in Ilcheong-dong,</i>

976
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,610
- <i>resulting in 2 deaths and 17 injuries.</i>
- Goodness.

977
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,196
It must be heartbreaking news...

978
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,950
for the parents of those punks.

979
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,912
You know, Sam-sik may have quick hands,

980
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,872
but he doesn't get into fights.

981
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,014
Isn't that a relief?

982
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,628
Don't I look different today?

983
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,547
My head hurts. Oh, my.

984
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,188
Wait.

985
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,846
These fell off your nails.

986
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,973
How did those end up there?

987
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,700
No, it's all right.

988
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,453
My wife looks...

989
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:51,667
so sexy for the first time in 40 years.

990
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,879
What's with you? Gosh.

991
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,324
Oh, my.

992
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,160
- Just eat your meal.
- No.

993
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,453
Oh, my.

994
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,412
<i>Next story.</i>

995
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,654
<i>Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo, the presidential
candidate of the Jeilmirae Party,</i>

996
00:58:04,678 --> 00:58:07,126
<i>volunteered to do laundry
at the temporary shelter...</i>

997
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,170
<i>for flood victims in Anseon,</i>

998
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,847
<i>now designated as a special
disaster area due to the typhoon.</i>

999
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:14,425
{\an8}<i>Assemblyman Oh made his visit with his family,</i>

1000
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:18,471
{\an8}<i>and was surprised to see how the
situation seemed worse in person.</i>

1001
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,365
You're banned from going out
except for official occasions.

1002
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,978
Don't schedule any
performances for the time being,

1003
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,354
and don't meet anybody.

1004
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,706
Is that my next job?

1005
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,418
Sure, I'll do as you say.

1006
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,380
If you're still worried, take this.

1007
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,675
You never know when I'll
start acting crazy again.

1008
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,553
Ha-young.

1009
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,389
Listen to me carefully.

1010
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:53,771
If you ever get in my way, I won't condone it,

1011
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,024
even if it's you.

1012
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,236
Dad.

1013
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,448
Don't worry.

1014
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:08,229
Nothing in Korea can threaten you.

1015
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,481
- Hello, Assemblyman Oh.
- Hello.

1016
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,457
- Are you doing okay?
- I'm fine.

1017
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,002
Unless...

1018
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,256
he regains his memory.

1019
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,706
Let's get rid of...

1020
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,515
Choi Kang-ho.

1021
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,926
Hey, Kang-ho.

1022
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,969
Yes?

1023
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,944
Well...

1024
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:46,016
About what you said at the police station.

1025
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,645
You know, the Road Traffic Act.

1026
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,912
How did you remember that?

1027
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,998
Road Traffic...

1028
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,420
What? What's that?

1029
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,334
Kang-ho.

1030
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,836
Go on in.

1031
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,838
I'm going to stop by Mr. Son's place.

1032
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,089
I'll go too.

1033
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,232
No, I'll be quick.

1034
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,318
But still...

1035
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,306
Right, what about Lion?

1036
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,225
Lion didn't have dinner. It must be hungry.

1037
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,159
Right, Lion.

1038
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,314
Okay, then. Come home quickly.

1039
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,790
- Okay.
- I'll feed Lion, so come back quickly.

1040
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,410
Goodness.

1041
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:51,290
What kind of a jerk made a scene
and made you suffer like this?

1042
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,515
Goodness, it's okay.

1043
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,502
It's just a stomach cramp.

1044
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,562
The medicine will help me feel better.

1045
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,508
This is bad. You're sick so often.

1046
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:05,819
Our medicine cabinet is empty because of you.

1047
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,725
Goodness, woman. Stop talking nonsense.

1048
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,518
You and that red face mask!

1049
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,395
I'm just saying.

1050
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,272
Don't worry about it,

1051
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,233
although it's costing us a
fortune to refill the medications.

1052
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,917
What?

1053
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,919
I'm sorry.

1054
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,491
I'll go to town and refill your
medicine cabinet tomorrow.

1055
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,575
Goodness, no.

1056
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,868
It's all right.

1057
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,664
Anyway, if you're this sick,
shouldn't you get a checkup?

1058
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,667
I got a gastroscopy yesterday.

1059
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,418
I'll get the result next week.

1060
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:40,673
It's because you have too much on your plate.

1061
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,218
I'll meet with that composer or whatever,

1062
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,095
so don't worry about him.

1063
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,862
Thank you, Mr. Son.

1064
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,602
Will you do something about that red face thing?

1065
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,495
Take it off or turn it off!

1066
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,498
Darn it. It's yellow now.

1067
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,190
I'm relieved that Mom is at Mr. Son's place.

1068
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:30,431
Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

1069
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,031
You're going to be kicked out.

1070
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,621
Mom.

1071
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,665
Mom?

1072
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,001
No!

1073
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,172
No.

1074
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,352
Who are you?

1075
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,624
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1076
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,716
<i>Promise me you won't get
into trouble like last time.</i>

1077
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,329
- <i>Promise.
- Mi-joo!</i>

1078
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,497
<i>Mi-joo!</i>

1079
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,514
<i>Do you know him?</i>

1080
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:39,917
<i>No, I...</i>

1081
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,726
<i>I don't want to see you anymore.</i>

1082
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,860
{\an8}<i>This is the last time I'll be helping you out.</i>

1083
01:03:44,884 --> 01:03:45,881
{\an8}<i>Mom.</i>

1084
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,716
{\an8}<i>Please help me, sir.</i>

1085
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,719
{\an8}<i>- Help me.
- Sam-sik.</i>

1086
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,596
{\an8}<i>Are we friends?</i>

1087
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,973
{\an8}<i>How dare they say that to our friend?</i>

1088
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,101
{\an8}<i>The pig farm was kind of an
inconvenience. We can't deny that.</i>

1089
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:02,606
{\an8}<i>And now she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.</i>

1090
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,665
{\an8}<i>Mom.</i>
