Mr. Cho!

14
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.996
Mr. Cho, it's me.

15
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.625
Mr. Cho.

16
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.718
Have you been well?

17
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.706
Mr. Cho.

18
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.224
Mr. Cho, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

19
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.118
Mr. Cho, what's wrong?

20
00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.067
Are you all right?

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.985
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.961
Suicide?

23
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.075
Ms. Hwang committed suicide?

24
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.259
Strictly speaking,

25
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.470
<i>it was suicide.</i>

26
00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.728
It should be here by now.

27
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.243
Is that the one?

28
00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.043
That must be the boat Kang-ho mentioned.

29
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.136
We're here. Please get ready.

30
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.079
You need to hide. Now!

31
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.460
Darn it!

32
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.296
You need to hide! Hurry!

33
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.497
Who are you?

34
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.222
Darn it, you...!

35
00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.249
<i>After that day,</i>

36
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.266
<i>I called you many times,</i>

37
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.337
but you couldn't be reached.

38
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.506
So I went to the Prosecutors' Office,

39
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.217
and I heard you got into a car accident...

40
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.651
and fell into a vegetative state.

41
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.556
I had a feeling those same men were responsible.

42
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.409
I didn't dare report it to the police.

43
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.230
I was helping her stow away illegally,

44
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.399
and if they found out I was alive,

45
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.500
they would've tried to kill me again.

46
00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.531
That's why I sold off my business...

47
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.673
and began to live in hiding.

48
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.788
I'm sorry for earlier.

49
00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.082
When I saw you standing there,

50
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.167
looking rather healthy and normal,

51
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:19.211
I got scared.

52
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.672
I can't believe anybody anymore,

53
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.382
not even you,

54
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.482
who were like my son.

58
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.233
{\an8}It's just as we expected.

59
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.918
{\an8}They completely denied that
there's a patient here by her name.

60
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.463
{\an8}What?

61
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:52.009
{\an8}Perhaps we were wrong. Maybe she's not here.

62
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.538
{\an8}We should look around some more.

63
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.081
{\an8}Okay.

64
00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.015
{\an8}What are you doing?

65
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.018
- What is it?
- Come here.

66
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.130
- What is it?
- I saw a suspicious man.

67
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.938
What's with you?

68
00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:06.216
Darn it.

69
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.761
You're the most suspicious
one here. Hurry up and hide.

70
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.528
- I'm serious.
- Okay, just hide.

71
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.687
Get in. It's okay.

72
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.163
- So this is the first floor.
- <i>Going up.</i>

73
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.212

75
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.100
- Found it.
- What?

76
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.172
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.966
Goodness, Sis.

78
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.193
I found the OB-GYN department.

79
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.847
- It's on the eighth floor.
- Yes, right.

80
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:56.573
The eighth floor.

81
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.893
My gosh.

82
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.979
I wonder how big your baby is now.

83
00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:03.482
- Goodness.
- I know, right?

84
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.458
I wonder how big my baby is.

85

Mi-joo, are you okay?

90
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:26.672
- Do you want to die?
- Maybe later.

91
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.882
- Let's go.
- What's wrong with you?

92
00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:31.009
This way. Hide.

93
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.594

- Do you see that guy wearing a cap?
- Yes.

100
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:49.903
If he's there,

101
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.447
it means she's there too.

102

...he tried to kill me.

106
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.463
I saw his tattoo.

107
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.479
Let's go down.

108
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.135
I recognized him back there,

109
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.471
- but you stepped on me so hard.
- Sorry about that.

110
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.529
- Wait.
- What?

111
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:24.453
Those who are in love
don't say sorry to each other.

112
00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.482
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.025
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

114
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.151
Sam-sik, my friend.

115
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.293
I'm so truly sorry.

117
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.114
Darn it.

118
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.465
- Follow me.
- I'm sorry.

119
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.676
- Hurry.
- Why?

120
00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:41.497
Why are we here?

121
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.581
- What?
- Why?

122
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.707
It's locked?

123
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.377
Why? It's not like anyone's going
to steal from the laundry room.

124
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.421
We're here to steal something, though.

125
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:50.547
What?

126
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.091
- Yes, you're right.
- That's right.

127
00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:54.983
Hide.

128
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.237
- We seem even more suspicious.
- No.

129
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:01.031
- Wait.
- What?

130
00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.442
All right.

131
00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.709
- I think I can do this.
- All clear.

132
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.592
I got it.

133
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:25.374
My gosh, Sam-sik!

134
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.750
Welcome.

135
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.518
My babies. I'm coming.

136
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.717
What brings you here?

137
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.095
We came to check a few things.

138
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.112
Is Mr. Choi Kang-ho inside?

139
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.892
He just fell asleep.

140
00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.102
This is urgent.

141
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.396
Wait, sir.

142
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.939
Sir.

143
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.607
You can talk to me.

144
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.693
You know his condition.

145
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.363
He's not in the state to remember
things to answer your questions.

146
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.992
The visit to the police station
was very disturbing for him.

147
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.077
He's been having screaming fits.

148
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.412
- Detective Cho.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.289
Wait, sir.

150
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.790
Sir!

151
00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:08.584
Please.

152
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.419
Did Mr. Choi...

153
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.269
run away?

154
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.022
If he didn't, please let go.

155
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.899
- Mr. Choi.
- Sir.

156
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.988
We're the police. May we have a word?

157
00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:33.275
You need to stop!

158
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.236
Why do you keep coming to
harass my son who's unwell?

159
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.448
If his condition worsens because of the shock,

160
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.715
will you take responsibility?

161
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.967
Wait.

162
00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:46.845
Do you even have a warrant?

163
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:50.724
Then you can't just barge
into my home and do this!

164
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.836
It's Intrusion upon Habitation.

165
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.728
Goodness.

166
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.147
Excuse me.

167
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.348
I've warned you.

168
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.240
Don't ever come back without a warrant.

169
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.076
If you do...

170
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:12.788
I don't care if you're
detectives. I won't stand back.

171
00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:16.500
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

172
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:29.763
You can come out now.

173
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.851
I almost suffocated.

174
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.965
I've been worried that...

175
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:42.469
you might suddenly end up losing your job.

176
00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:46.404
I'm relieved to hear you're going back.

177
00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.291
Thank you for all your hard work.

178
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:01.113
This isn't much,

179
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.032
but use it for your flight back home.

180
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.800
It's your severance.

181
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.346
Ms. Jin, you're wonderful.

182
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.464
Thanks to you, I learned a lot about farming,

183
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.983
and got addicted to <i>makgeolli</i> too.

184
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.889
Although Korean is still super hard to learn.

185
00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.724
Right, Ms. Jin.

186
00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:33.660
I just learned a new word.

187
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.689
What was it?

188
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.497
In...

189
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.666
In...

190
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.779
Intrusion upon Habitation.

191
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:45.449
♫ <i>I love it to death</i> ♫

192
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.758
♫ <i>when you intrude into my heart</i> ♫

193
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.914
This is a huge hit.

194
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:57.184
It's blowing up right now.

195
00:12:58.402 --> 00:13:00.422
What on earth is happening?

196
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.882
Tell me about it.

197
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.385
How did you come up with these lyrics?

198
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:06.761
"Intrusion into My Heart"?

199
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.847
You must be a genius.

200
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:13.393
We're going to the top the
Billboard charts with this song.

201
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.285
Kang-ho!

202
00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.455
Thank you, Kang-ho!

203
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.249
Congratulations, Mr. Son.

204
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:24.070
A crime-free village commendation...

205
00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.879
for Jou-ri.

206
00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.825
I hear you're the first village
in our area to receive it.

207
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.327
I mean, seriously.

208
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.079
I knew it when I first heard the name Jou-ri.

209
00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:36.431
Mr. Son, you must feel jolly.

210
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.517
Come on. This is...

211
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.087
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.299
...all because they picked
the great village head.

213
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.884
I never bothered to say it,

214
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.346
but do you have any idea
how much stress I've endured?

215
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.014
They wouldn't even pave the road,

216
00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:52.641
because there weren't
enough people in the village.

217
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.393
Because of it, we couldn't
get early-morning deliveries.

218
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:59.564
And because of that, people
wouldn't move into our village.

219
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:01.748
- It was a...
- Goodness.

220
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.068
That's good.

221
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.238
I'm finally getting some recognition.

222
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.656
That stings.

223
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.592
- What is this, acupuncture? Be careful.
- That's an acupuncture point. You're fine.

224
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.621
Hey, Honey.

225
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:17.847
How does the suit look? Is the color all right?

226
00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.544
Honey, look at me.

227
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.228
What on earth are you up to?

228
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:27.384
I want to make a suit for our baby too,

229
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:30.235
since Daddy's receiving a huge award.

230
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:36.518
She treats her dog better than her husband.

231
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.645
I'm also an animal expert,

232
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.538
so I'll make a nifty suit for your dog.

233
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:44.818
You're an animal expert?

234
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:47.195
Well, just birds.

235
00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.240
I used to run a fried-chicken restaurant.

236
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.048
It went under.

237
00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.954
That's my phone.

238
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.330
But I can't move, can I?

239
00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:58.790
- Please be careful.
- My phone...

240
00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:01.084
- Can you answer it?
- Sure.

241
00:15:01.108 --> 00:15:03.351
Be careful. You'll get paralyzed.

242
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.761
You've never seen a village like
this. Is this Jou-ri or heaven?

243
00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:14.848
This is the phone of the village head...

244
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.198
of Jou-ri, a crime-free village.

245
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.352
Where?

246
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.187
The police?

247
00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.787
What?

248
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.319
A mur...

249
00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.085
Murder case?

250
00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.699
Oh, my.

251
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.966
You didn't have to.

252
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.386
This is really good...

253
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:42.557
More for you, doggy.

254
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:45.602
Gross. He can't have what a human touched.

255
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.592
Sir.

256
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:54.346
We came to check a few things with you.

257
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.723
You know Mr. Choi Kang-ho, right?

258
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.768
Yes, of course I know him well.

259
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.978
He's like a son to me.

260
00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:04.439
This is Mr. Choi...

261
00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:08.333
during his police investigation at our station.

262
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.323
And this is him...

263
00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:17.801
when he was at the hospital with
his mother, Ms. Jin Young-soon.

264
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.288
I checked with the hospital,

265
00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:24.918
and heard he met the doctor
himself as his mother's guardian...

266
00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:27.602
to discuss her condition.

267
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:34.109
And these documents were also filled out by him.

268
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.680
What do you think?

269
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.266
There's too much of a difference to
say these are the same person, right?

270
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.270
In your opinion, which man is the true Mr. Choi?

271
00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.037
The one at the police station,

272
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.081
or the hospital?

273
00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:49.859
Police station?

274
00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:51.918
Or hospital?

275
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.532
Come on.

276
00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:58.493
You must be able to tell
if he's like a son to you.

277
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.912
Goodness, a son?

278
00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.540
I never said that.

279
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:04.749
The sun.

280
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.584
He's like the sun.

281
00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:08.920
He's always around his mother,

282
00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:10.714
refusing to leave her.

283
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.965
So we all said,

284
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:17.193
"He's like the sun that's always there."

285
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:24.436
Hey, Sung-ae. Are you there?

286
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.938
- You're here.
- Hello.

287
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.524
Where's our minivan?

288
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.860
Where is Sam-sik? Have you seen him?

289
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.460
No.

290
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.656
Sam-sik pulled a Sam-sik again.

291
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.951
Hey, don't pile on like that.

292
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.327
Have you had dinner?

293
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.928
- If not, you should eat.
- What?

294
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:47.375
My gosh, what's all this?

295
00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.919
Skate, <i>galbi jjim, tangsuyuk,</i>

296
00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:51.378
and <i>japchae</i> too?

297
00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:53.798
Is it a special day?

298
00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:56.051
It's nothing like that.

299
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.053
I just made them because the kids enjoy them.

300
00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.471
Eat up.

301
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.889
Don't worry about the kids.

302
00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.015
Just play your hand.

303
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.224
- Yes.
- It's my turn?

304
00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.684
- Yes.
- Let's see.

305
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:06.493
Then...

306
00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:09.939
This one.

307
00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:12.442
Goodness me.

308
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:15.570
How many times do I have to tell
you that these are different suits?

309
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.280
This one is all black,

310
00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.365
but this one is mixed with red dots.

311
00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:21.466
Good grief.

312
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.676
In that case,

313
00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:25.455
- what should I play?
- Come on!

314
00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:26.956
Goodness gracious.

315
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.793
You can't show me your entire hand!

316
00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:30.794
Wait.

317
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.755
You only got three cards. I went
first, so you should have four.

318
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.673
- Really?
- What?

319
00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:37.759
- Goodness. What?
- Where did it go?

320
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.469
- We're done with this round.
- Wait.

321
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.554
- Did you pick up an extra card?
- We're done?

322
00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:44.265
- Wait.
- I almost lost big. What a relief!

323
00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.185
I was so close to winning the game,

324
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.812
- but you ruined it!
- Put it down.

325
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.688
- I had it in my hand.
- Put that down.

326
00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:52.273
This is awful.

327
00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.192
Goodness, are you two in this together?

328
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.401
Darn it!

329
00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:56.820
Don't worry.

330
00:18:56.844 --> 00:19:00.698
We'll play all night and
you can win all this from me.

331
00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:02.033
All night?

332
00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:05.537
You never play Go-Stop. What's gotten into you?

333
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.080
Tell me about it.

334
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.290
You've been acting odd since last night.

335
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.417
Not only did you sing and dance,

336
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:14.087
you even had a drink.

337
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:18.481
When someone acts out of the
ordinary, it means they'll die soon.

338
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.969
Sung-ae!

339
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.679
You startled me.

340
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.264
Why are you yelling?

341
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:25.947
Please!

342
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:30.076
You need to stop blurting
out words without thinking.

343
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.272
Come on. Don't be like that.

344
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.107
What did I do?

345
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.693
I was just making a joke...

346
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.987
to have a laugh.

347
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.071
To have a laugh?

348
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:42.031
Is life and death funny to you?

349
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.992
Is it?

350
00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.203
There are things you should and shouldn't say.

351
00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:50.707
How dare you say something like that to her?

352
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:52.932
"How dare you"?

353
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.460
Darn it.

354
00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:58.590
That's how you've thought of me all along?

355
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.300
So you're saying...

356
00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.942
a mother of a thief like me...

357
00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.763
shouldn't dare to speak that way...

358
00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:08.641
to a mother of a prosecutor?

359
00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:09.934
Tell me!

360
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.436
Is that what you're saying?

361
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.522
- You must be drunk. Stop it.
- Don't! I'm not drunk!

362
00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.733
What do you know anyway?

363
00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:20.945
A mother like you with a smart
son has no idea what it's like!

364
00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.448
Kang-ho got all the attention...

365
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.882
for being smart and getting good grades.

366
00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.953
And now he's getting all the attention...

367
00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:30.997
because he's become an idiot.

368
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:35.168
Hey, do you even know...

369
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:39.130
how much derision I suffered...

370
00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:41.799
because people compared your son to mine?

371
00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.218
Have you gone insane?

372
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.761
What's wrong with you?

373
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:47.013
- Come here! Let's go home.
- Darn it. Let go!

374
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:49.432
I'll walk out on my own!

375
00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:51.392
- Let's go! Cut it out!
- Let go of me!

376
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.978
- I don't care if he's a prosecutor.
- That's enough!

377
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:57.023
- You can't do this to me.
- Stop it!

378
00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.442
- Darn it.
- That's enough!

379
00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.376
Good grief!

380
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.072
Good grief!

381
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.491
- I can't deal with this!
- Where are you going?

382
00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.633
Good grief!

383
00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:11.287
Goodness.

384
00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:13.972
No, it's all right.

385
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:16.125
Goodness, it's all right. Don't cry.

386
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:18.628
My babies, don't cry.

387
00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.672
Why are you acting so childish?

388
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.173
- Goodness me.
- Sung-ae.

389
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:24.273
I need to talk to you.

390
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:27.652
Hear me out!

391
00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:30.556
Forget it, you brat.

392
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.517
You're out of my life for good,

393
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:36.521
so just have fun humoring
Young-soon all the time,

394
00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:39.148
- and have a great life!
- Enough.

395
00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.358
Goodbye.

396
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.277
Young-soon...

397
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.168
is dying.

398
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.924
She has stage four stomach cancer.

399
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.620
No surgery or medicine...

400
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.429
can make her better.

401
00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:01.462
That brat must've gone crazy.

402
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.214
What kind of nonsense is that?

403
00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:06.899
I honestly wish I was just insane.

404
00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:10.096
I really want this to be nonsense.

405
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.723
How can this...?

406
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:15.241
How can...? What will she...?

407
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.210
Jin Young-soon!

408
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.713
Come out!

409
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.148
Sung-ae.

410
00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:57.825
You.

411
00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:00.953
How could you do this to me?

412
00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:03.483
How could you do this to me to the very end?

413
00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:06.083
You turned me into this crazy woman.

414
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.671
You can't go anywhere.

415
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.759
Stop this nonsense!

416
00:23:14.976 --> 00:23:16.969
I won't accept this.

417
00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:20.166
There's no terminal illness in this day and age.

418
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.351
There's no illness that's incurable!

419
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:25.379
So...

420
00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:28.606
get yourself treated right now!

421
00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.386
You can't go anywhere.

422
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.014
You need to stick with me,

423
00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:38.184
and fight with me the rest of my life.

424
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.602
You brat.

425
00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:41.395
Get treated now.

426
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:44.941
Get treated, you brat.

427
00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:46.874
Good grief!

428
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.754
I hate you.

429
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.741
You rotten brat.

430
00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:57.760
You need to live to see Sam-sik succeed.

431
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.956
You must live to envy me,

432
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.225
and be mean to me out of jealousy.

433
00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:08.855
You must live to throw a fit at me, you brat.

434
00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:10.982
Sung-ae,

435
00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:14.193
I always envied you.

436
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:21.227
You have a wonderful husband who loves you,

437
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:25.079
and a son who's healthy and amiable.

438
00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.527
I was always jealous.

439
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:32.446
Goodness, what are we going to do?

440
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.756
You poor brat.

441
00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:39.245
What do we do with you?

442
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.179
You poor thing...

443
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:47.044
- Thank you.
- I had a good trip thanks to you.

444
00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:48.769
And this.

445
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.381
This is fresh abalone.

446
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:52.425
Please have it with your mother.

447
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:54.260
Goodness, abalone?

448
00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:57.194
They're her favorite. Thank you.

449
00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:59.557
I'll see you soon.

450
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.225
Okay, sir.

451
00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:03.895
Let me know whenever you need my help.

452
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.494
I will.

453
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:23.220
- Investigation Officer.
- Yes?

454
00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:27.543
This phone belonged to Park Cheol-su.

455
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:32.131
He was the defendant in the Woobyeok
construction site case two years ago.

456
00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.133
Can you run digital forensics on this?

457
00:25:34.157 --> 00:25:38.721
But he abandoned the appeal,
and the case has been closed.

458
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:40.279
I know.

459
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:46.118
But there's new evidence, so we
must uncover the truth, even now.

460
00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.065
Anything that'd help take down
Woobyeok Group would do,

461
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.790
so please take a look.

462
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:53.319
Are you really...

463
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:55.336
going to take down Woobyeok?

464
00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.797
Well...

465
00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:00.701
The higher-ups colluded...

466
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:04.247
to destroy all the evidence,

467
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:06.457
- so it won't be easy.
- It's not that.

468
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:08.474
Honestly,

469
00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:14.438
I'm not sure if you're Woobyeok's enemy or ally.

470
00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:18.010
Mr. Park Cheol-su's wife visited
and told me about this phone.

471
00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:21.597
She made a scene saying
you destroyed the only evidence,

472
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.698
and then got dragged out.

473
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:26.727
The same goes for Yoon Jae-min's case.

474
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.397
Last time, your mother came
and got into a huge fight...

475
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.858
with Jung Jong-gu's mother who was protesting.

476
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:34.583
That day...

477
00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:38.963
was the first time I felt like quitting my job.

478
00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.491
Your mother...

479
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:44.495
yelled at her, saying her son wouldn't
have done something so terrible,

480
00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:48.889
but I couldn't side with her.

481
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:55.881
I've stuck with you and
assisted you for the longest time.

482
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:57.216
But honestly,

483
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.443
I'm not sure what you're really like.

484
00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.914
Thank you...

485
00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:17.084
for not quitting your job.

486
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:18.836
Sorry?

487
00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:22.256
I finally have a chance to
show you what I'm really like.

488
00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:25.426
I can't guarantee...

489
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:28.220
I'll succeed.

490
00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:31.709
But for the longest time,

491
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:35.811
you've worked tirelessly to support me,

492
00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.814
so I'll make sure you won't regret your effort.

493
00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:48.157
Can you really...

494
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.910
keep that promise?

495
00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:56.290
Then I'll do it.

496
00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:59.653
We have to do that to Choi Kang-ho?

497
00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:01.614
I always wondered...

498
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:06.077
why Oh Tae-soo was so desperate to kill Kang-ho.

499
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:09.872
And it turns out, it wasn't
Kang-ho who killed Hwang Soo-hyun.

500
00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:12.625
I knew it.

501
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:14.668
Kang-ho isn't the type of guy...

502
00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:17.421
to let go once he's onto something.

503
00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:18.464
However,

504
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.716
Oh Tae-soo got wind of it...

505
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.010
and acted first.

506
00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.470
He killed...

507
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:27.071
Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby,

508
00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:31.936
then framed Choi Kang-ho as the father...

509
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.940
and the prime suspect in the murder.

510
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:37.566
So...

511
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.904
what if the baby's body is found,

512
00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:44.198
or Choi Kang-ho regains his memory?

513
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:46.617
What will happen then?

514
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:49.328
Now before any of that happens,

515
00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:53.222
we'd have to get rid of him, right?

516
00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:59.380
How long do we have to stay like this?

517
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:03.816
Why isn't that punk leaving?

518
00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:09.682
This won't do.

519
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.309
The hospital will close before that punk leaves.

520
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:15.161
- Let's begin.
- Sam-sik.

521
00:29:15.628 --> 00:29:16.731
Wait.

522
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.232
Why don't you do it instead?

523
00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.374
This is killing me.

524
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.278
- Mi-joo.
- Yes?

525
00:29:22.302 --> 00:29:24.864
What do you think Oh Ha-young
will do when she sees me?

526
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:26.365
This may be killing you,

527
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:29.008
but I'll really be dead if she catches me.

528
00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:33.179
Okay, give me a second.

529
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:38.252
Look at me. Wear this and the mask.

530
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.670
Gosh, you look so smart.

531
00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:41.505
You look very clever.

532
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.799
You can do this. You got it, Mi-joo!

533
00:29:43.823 --> 00:29:46.233
No, I can't!

534
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:49.054
I really can't do this. Sam-sik, please.

535
00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:51.197
I don't have a choice then.

536
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:54.101
- I must help you.
- How?

537
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.743
- Mi-joo.
- Yes?

538
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:13.302
What is it?

539
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:14.705
I'm here to see the patient.

540
00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:16.165
A doctor was just here.

541
00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:19.084
The doctor who just came by called.

542
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:21.504
The patient has a severely
unstable state of mind,

543
00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.047
so she requires counseling.

544
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:25.090
I'll go back if she doesn't need me.

545
00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:26.857
Wait.

546
00:30:34.457 --> 00:30:36.325
"Joo Gwang-cheol"?

547
00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:40.815
Such a masculine name, right?

548
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:43.567
My parents gave me this
name hoping to have a son next.

549
00:30:43.591 --> 00:30:47.294
Aren't we all sick and tired
of this preference for boys?

550
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:51.090
The counseling will take some time.

551
00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:10.609
Ms. Oh Ha-young?

552
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.361
Get out.

553
00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:15.891
May I have a word with you?

554
00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:17.268
Get out of here.

555
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.936
Yes, exactly.

556
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.245
Let's get out of here together.

557
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:32.298
You know Choi Kang-ho, right?

558
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.748
If you scream now,

559
00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:42.141
you'll never get out of this room.

560
00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:48.966
<i>Do you remember what
you asked of me a while ago?</i>

561
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.093
I'll find the evidence.

562
00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:53.762
So until then,

563
00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:56.155
you must stay alive in here.

564
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.291
<i>Find out the license plate number of the car,</i>

565
00:32:01.315 --> 00:32:03.850
and recover the dashcam footage no matter what.

566
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.957
<i>I have that footage.</i>

567
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:25.934
You should cut your nails once you're out.

568
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:36.195
I got this only a month ago.

569
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.159
Who are you?

570
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.606
Why are you doing this?

571
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.289
What about you?

572
00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:50.486
Why did you do that to Kang-ho?

573
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.987
What did I do?

574
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.505
Aren't you the least bit sorry?

575
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:56.367
He was once...

576
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:59.301
someone you loved, wasn't he?

577
00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:01.720
He betrayed me first.

578
00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:04.500
He betrayed me before he betrayed you.

579
00:33:04.524 --> 00:33:06.934
But I didn't try to kill him.

580
00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.046
Let's get out.

581
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.589
You must confess everything.

582
00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:12.314
No!

583
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.301
Why not?

584
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.235
Because of your dad?

585
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.473
He's capable of killing his own child.

586
00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.865
He already did.

587
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:25.786
He killed your sibling, a newborn baby.

588
00:33:26.045 --> 00:33:27.871
And what about you?

589
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.040
Look what he's done to you.

590
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.668
Do you think this is living?

591
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:36.323
He put you up to killing a man,

592
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:39.299
and locked you up in here as a mental patient.

593
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:42.761
Even beasts wouldn't do that to their own.

594
00:33:42.937 --> 00:33:44.415
And now...

595
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:48.002
he wants to be a President of a country?

596
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.421
No, I can't condone it.

597
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.731
If you don't do it, I'll stop him.

598
00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:58.303
Then he'll kill you too.

599
00:33:58.327 --> 00:34:00.279
I'm sure.

600
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:04.491
He's a man who'd destroy
anything that gets in his way.

601
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:06.437
Just recently...

602
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:09.329
he tried to kill Kang-ho again.

603
00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:12.693
Like killing his father wasn't enough,

604
00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.239
this time, he locked him up
with his mother in the farm...

605
00:34:15.263 --> 00:34:17.339
and set it on fire.

606
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:21.133
This is...

607
00:34:21.642 --> 00:34:24.121
your last chance at redemption.

608
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.888
At this rate,

609
00:34:26.314 --> 00:34:28.459
Kang-ho may really die.

610
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:32.087
If you ignore it, you'll
become an accomplice again.

611
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:33.922
But of course...

612
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:35.299
you won't go to jail.

613
00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:37.065
Because...

614
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.554
the moment something happens to Kang-ho,

615
00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:43.155
you'll die at my hands.

616
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:54.666
Let's say I do get out of here.

617
00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:58.489
Then what?

618
00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.532
Report my dad to the police?

619
00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:03.926
His influence runs deep.

620
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.872
That includes the police and the prosecution.

621
00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:07.998
Everywhere,

622
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:09.807
but one.

623
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:11.934
Choi Kang-ho.

624
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:17.523
It's been over an hour.

625
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:19.593
- Move aside!
- What?

626
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.261
She's in hypovolemic shock!

627
00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.471
Hype what?

628
00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:23.806
Hypovolemic shock!

629
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.182
It's an emergency!

630
00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.226
- Wait! Just one call!
- It's an emergency!

631
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.435
Sam-sik!

632
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.953
- Mi-joo!
- Sam-sik! Come on!

633
00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.941
- Sam-sik, let's go!
- Let's go.

634
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.567
- Are you okay?
- It's an emergency!

635
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:37.152
Get them!

636
00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:39.071
- Goodness.
- They're coming!

637
00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:41.004
Wait!

638
00:35:41.347 --> 00:35:42.881
Come on.

639
00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:46.176
No!

640
00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:48.122
My goodness!

641
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.763
Sam-sik, hurry!

642
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.001
Wait, you're that...

643
00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.685
Darn it.

644
00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:57.005
Wait for me!

645
00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:59.383
- Hurry!
- Come on!

646
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:01.510
Close the doors!

647
00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.944
- Close the doors!
- Go away!

648
00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.662
Take the stairs.

649
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:18.917
Run!

650
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:21.420
Mi-joo!

651
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.380
Kang-ho, catch!

652
00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:26.994
Mi-joo!

653
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:30.596
How could you do something so
dangerous? You're in for it now!

654
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.099
- Goodness.
- Go!

655
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.671
- Get in.
- Okay. Oh Ha-young too!

656
00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:40.105
- Get in the back!
- Hurry!

657
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.009
Wait, I'm not insured with this car.

658
00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:44.178
- Are we good?
- Go!

659
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:46.028
Hurry!

660
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:53.729
Are you all insane?

661
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:55.898
- Mi-joo, you.
- No.

662
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:59.151
We were perfect. Everyone was great.

663
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:01.585
It was excellent.

664
00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:07.466
Our plan was more perfect than General
MacArthur's Incheon Landing Operation.

665
00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:11.997
They may not have seen our faces,
but they probably got the plate number.

666
00:37:12.021 --> 00:37:14.458
Come on. Who am I?

667
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.501
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

668
00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:19.087
I disguised it beforehand.

669
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.522
Even ghosts wouldn't know who we are.

670
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:24.533
<i><font color="#ffff00">Sam-sik's Mill</font></i>

671
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:27.763
<i>What now? Even ghosts wouldn't know?</i>

672
00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:29.483
- Let go of me.
- That's enough, Mi-joo.

673
00:37:29.507 --> 00:37:30.307
What's wrong?

674
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.516
Is something going on?

675
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.228
It'll be too dangerous to return to the village.

676
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.513
Let's find a different place.

677
00:37:35.537 --> 00:37:38.148
Can't we just report this to the police?

678
00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:39.441
- No.
- No.

679
00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:40.943
We abducted her.

680
00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.361
Who are we going to report?

681
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.404
We didn't abduct anyone.

682
00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:46.782
We rescued her.

683
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:47.824
Who'd believe that?

684
00:37:47.848 --> 00:37:49.076
Would you?

685
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.995
Man, what's with my life?

686
00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:52.996
I'm a thief,

687
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.624
a blackmailer, and now an abductor?

688
00:37:55.648 --> 00:37:58.252
Darn it.

689
00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.213
What did I get myself into
while trying to help a friend?

690
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:02.938
Wait.

691
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.649
Friend?

692
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.987
Who's my friend?

693
00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:12.557
Come to think of it, this is absurd.

694
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:16.118
Why in the world am I helping you, Kang-ho?

695
00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:18.855
I begged you to help me,

696
00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:23.041
but you didn't even flinch
and locked me up in prison.

697
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:25.696
You're nitpicking over that now?

698
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.323
- It's okay.
- I didn't have an opportunity before.

699
00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:31.326
He's only just regained his senses!

700
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.411
All right.

701
00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:33.829
First off,

702
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:37.207
Ha-young participated in the
escape, so this isn't abduction.

703
00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:41.393
The security cameras would've
caught it, so they can't report us.

704
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.312
But we also can't report them.

705
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.385
We can't let anybody find out
until we're thoroughly prepared.

706
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.569
Okay, Mi-joo?

707
00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:53.640
A place where nobody can find us.

708
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:58.243
Man, I do know this very secretive place.

709
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:02.816
Where are we?

710
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.901
A place that isn't open to just anybody.

711
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:07.904
However, it's also a place that's hard to leave.

712
00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:11.283
If we go inside, I can't
guarantee we'll make it out alive.

713
00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:12.409
<i><font color="#ffff00">Do Not Enter</font></i>

714
00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:14.745
- He's coming out!
- What?

715
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.371
Hey! Goodness.

716
00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:18.513
Good grief.

717
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:21.335
- What?
- What are they doing?

718
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.128
Why are they so scary?

719
00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:26.340
Kang-ho, listen carefully.

720
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.301
I'm risking my life bringing you here.

721
00:39:29.325 --> 00:39:31.219
Because we're friends.

722
00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.763
Hey, where are you going?

723
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:36.156
You crazy punk! Where are you going?

724
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:45.025
♫ <i>Mom, mom, come here</i> ♫

725
00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:48.585
♫ <i>and look at this</i> ♫

726
00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.238
Look at this.

727
00:39:50.262 --> 00:39:53.590
You've been ignoring my calls.

728
00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:57.954
♫ <i>I never imagined you would</i> ♫

729
00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:02.557
♫ <i>show up on your own</i> ♫

730
00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.877
So...

731
00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:07.646
did you bring what you promised?

732
00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:12.025
It's not ready yet.

733
00:40:12.411 --> 00:40:13.387
Instead,

734
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:16.446
I brought my best friend.

735
00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:23.161
Your friend?

736
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.319
<i><font color="#ffff00">Choi Kang-ho
Supreme Prosecutors' Office</font></i>

737
00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:33.171
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

738
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.954
- Please sit.
- Sir, this way.

739
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.330
May my officers sit too?

740
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:42.916
Of course. Come this way.

741
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.641
- Please.
- Sure.

742
00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.882
You've illegally purchased,

743
00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:53.009
renovated, and sailed a ship,

744
00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:55.720
and even operated a gambling house.

745
00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:58.014
Also, you failed to pay your employees,

746
00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.183
blackmailed, confined, resorted to violence,

747
00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:02.951
and made an illegal organ trading contract.

748
00:41:04.086 --> 00:41:08.150
It seems that your business should
be discussed with me, a prosecutor.

749
00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:11.403
But apparently you have business
with my dear friend, Sam-sik.

750
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:14.698
No, sir. I have no idea what you're saying.

751
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:16.908
Sam-sik, do I have...

752
00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:19.369
any business with you?

753
00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:22.164
You wanted $100,000 from me.

754
00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.540
Gosh.

755
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:26.516
Did you really take it that way?

756
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.087
There must be a misunderstanding.

757
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:32.549
Sam-sik and I were very close...

758
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:34.092
since our school days.

759
00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:36.109
We weren't.

760
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:41.475
Sam-sik and I attended the same school.

761
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.726
Not that school.

762
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.244
Prosecutor Choi, you already know what I mean.

763
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.273
I closed the gambling house ages ago,

764
00:41:48.297 --> 00:41:50.358
and look at my staff.

765
00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:54.002
They don't look like they'd
blackmail, confine, or hurt anyone.

766
00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:56.463
Come on, smile.

767
00:41:56.597 --> 00:41:58.658
Aren't they cute?

768
00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:02.636
Something like that's never
happened around here.

769
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.247
I see.

770
00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:08.043
But I heard this hotel was
a private gambling den...

771
00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:09.503
open for members only.

772
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.339
Goodness, that's absurd.

773
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:15.383
This is simply my home.

774
00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:18.485
My house of joy. Home sweet home.

775
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.990
In that case,

776
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:27.604
can my officers stay here for a few days...

777
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:28.813
and investigate?

778
00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:30.956
Sorry?

779
00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:33.443
Of course.

780
00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:35.612
Of course this is just my home.

781
00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.531
You can just live here.

782
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.700
If anything happens to my officers,

783
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:45.205
or to my dear friend Sam-sik...

784
00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:48.291
It'll be my fault, obviously.

785
00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:51.518
I'll make sure they don't get hurt.

786
00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.964
Goodness.

787
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.966
Look at that mess.

788
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.760
Once they burn all those shady ledgers,

789
00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:01.278
they'll be wetting their beds tonight.

790
00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:04.281
What's that?

791
00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:12.372
What?

792
00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:16.459
Fireworks?

793
00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:18.655
My gosh, that's pretty.

794
00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.548
- Did you prepare this?
- How did you know?

795
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:26.386
My gosh.

796
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:32.684
Aren't you cold?

797
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:35.422
I am. It's a bit chilly by the sea.

798
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:38.216
I told you to stay inside.

799
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.234
Why did you come out?

800
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:44.529
I figured the two of them...

801
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.364
needed some time alone.

802
00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.667
How pretty.

803
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:03.548
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

804
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.384
Thank you.

805
00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:10.305
I'm not doing this for you. It's for me.

806
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.543
My life will be a living
hell if I don't do this.

807
00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:16.561
And I'm the cause of that hell.

808
00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:23.068
You were innocent, but I dragged you into this.

809
00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:25.487
I hurt you deeply.

810
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:27.864
I'm sorry.

811
00:44:28.707 --> 00:44:30.852
Did you...

812
00:44:30.876 --> 00:44:33.244
ever love me?

813
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.455
I was in love...

814
00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:37.248
with someone else.

815
00:44:40.886 --> 00:44:42.781
I thought so.

816
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:46.132
You always seemed to yearn for someone.

817
00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:48.760
I hated that,

818
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:51.304
and it made me jealous.

819
00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:56.518
That must be why I fell for
my dad's lie when he said...

820
00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:59.145
Hwang Soo-hyun was your woman.

821
00:45:01.323 --> 00:45:03.399
The person you love...

822
00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:06.736
is Lee Mi-joo, right?

823
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.573
Yes.

824
00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:13.076
It's Lee Mi-joo.

825
00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.878
What's taking you so long
to pick up your jacket?

826
00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.121
I'm sure they're after us.

827
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:33.832
So don't leave the hotel, okay?

828
00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:35.250
Where are you going?

829
00:45:35.274 --> 00:45:38.002
I found Ha-young thanks to you two.

830
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:40.171
I need to find evidence on Song Woo-byeok.

831
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:41.965
Song Woo-byeok?

832
00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:43.591
How are you going to find that?

833
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:46.276
I thought the evidence
you had was all destroyed.

834
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:50.723
There's one last piece of evidence left.

835
00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.976
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

836
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.602
It's not dangerous, is it?

837
00:45:54.626 --> 00:45:57.829
I'm going there to make
sure there's no further danger.

838
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:04.043
My dear friend, Bang Sam-sik.

839
00:46:04.803 --> 00:46:07.172
Please keep them safe.

840
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.200
I'll be back.

841
00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:11.050
Okay.

842
00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:24.689
Hey, Mi-joo!

843
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.899
I told you, didn't I?

844
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.401
That if you saved my life once again,

845
00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:45.627
I'd let you marry me.

846
00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:47.780
You saved me from choking on candy,

847
00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.866
and from the motorcycle accident.

848
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.842
Do you know the last thing you did to save me?

849
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:54.761
Our children.

850
00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:57.540
You weren't with us,

851
00:46:57.564 --> 00:47:01.184
but I was always with you.

852
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.469
So make sure you come back.

853
00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:14.530
Come back and live with
us the rest of your life, okay?

854
00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:21.955
Thanks, Mi-joo.

855
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:25.416
I'll make sure I do that.

856
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.385
I'll be back.

857
00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:38.721
Hey.

858
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:41.042
A little lower and my lips are right here.

859
00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:42.502
Was it too far down?

860
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.546
Was it too far for you to reach down?

861
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.230
Was it?

862
00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:23.516
Goodness.

863
00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:26.170
You always came over with a stomachache,

864
00:48:26.194 --> 00:48:28.881
but it never dawned on me
that you had to see a doctor.

865
00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:31.009
I shouldn't be the village head.

866
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.693
How is that your fault?

867
00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:37.098
You told me to see a doctor time and time again,

868
00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:38.808
but I never listened.

869
00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:42.910
You had to suffer all alone.

870
00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:46.482
We spent our time in this village like a family.

871
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.818
Why didn't you tell me?

872
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.403
How could you let me hear this...

873
00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:53.489
from a detective who's a complete stranger?

874
00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:55.283
Detective?

875
00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.409
Yes.

876
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:59.746
Some detectives came in the
afternoon and asked me about Kang-ho,

877
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.749
regarding a murder case.

878
00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.710
No, it wasn't Kang-ho.

879
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:09.687
Goodness, of course it wasn't.

880
00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:11.439
Young-soon.

881
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.676
I know it's hard for you,

882
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.111
but I need to know what's going on to help you.

883
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:20.433
So tell me everything.

884
00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:25.203
What on earth is happening to Kang-ho?

885
00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:30.401
Please stop crying.

886
00:49:30.425 --> 00:49:34.420
You'll break Young-soon's heart even more.

887
00:49:36.264 --> 00:49:37.784
Goodness.

888
00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:40.453
Sung-ae, please stop crying.

889
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.303
Goodness.

890
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:46.751
By the way, why do you have
those spoons on your eyes?

891
00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:50.103
I can't open my eyes from crying so much.

892
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:53.424
Why is everyone crying?

893
00:49:53.448 --> 00:49:59.153
Everyone is crying, so it's making me cry too.

894
00:50:02.207 --> 00:50:03.643
Goodness.

895
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.811
Goodness.

896
00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.021
Not you kids too.

897
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:08.606
Don't cry.

898
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.817
Goodness, don't cry, my babies.

899
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.443
Don't cry.

900
00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:13.695
Your mom.

901
00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:16.170
Let's call your mom.

902
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:23.454
Mi-joo, it's me.

903
00:50:23.478 --> 00:50:24.831
Can you pick up the kids...

904
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:27.375
from Kang-ho's place on your way home?

905
00:50:27.399 --> 00:50:31.185
Mom, I was actually going to call you.

906
00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:32.964
I won't be home tonight.

907
00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:36.357
I actually won't be home for a few days.

908
00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:38.386
What do you mean?

909
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.180
Where are you? Why can't you come home?

910
00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:44.350
Well, my friend's father passed,

911
00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.643
so I'm at a wake.

912
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:47.910
Mi-joo, the food is here. Come.

913
00:50:48.336 --> 00:50:49.522
<i>Wait.</i>

914
00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:51.372
That voice.

915
00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:52.734
Isn't that Sam-sik?

916
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:54.402
Are you with him?

917
00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:58.406
Yes, she's a mutual acquaintance.

918
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:01.075
Your <i>jjajangmyeon</i> is getting soggy. Come.

919
00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:02.702
- <i>Jjajangmyeon?</i>
- Hurry.

920
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.787
<i>So you eat </i>jjajangmyeon<i> at a wake?</i>

921
00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:06.706
You brat. Where are you?

922
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.040
Mom, the thing is...

923
00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:11.043
<i>What are you doing with Sam-sik
that you can't come home?</i>

924
00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.170
<i>Have you...</i>

925
00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:14.729
moved on from Kang-ho to Sam-sik, of all people?

926
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.216
It's nothing like that.

927
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.260
Anyway, I can't tell you now.

928
00:51:19.284 --> 00:51:20.845
What do you mean?

929
00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:22.472
Why can't you tell me?

930
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:24.155
Wait.

931
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:25.850
Mi-joo.

932
00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:28.019
<i>Something is going on, right?</i>

933
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:30.354
<i>I heard Sam-sik took his parents' minivan.</i>

934
00:51:30.378 --> 00:51:33.608
Are you in trouble right now?

935
00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:35.234
<i>Tell me if that's the case.</i>

936
00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.650
I'll call the police right away.

937
00:51:36.674 --> 00:51:37.987
No, Mom. Don't.

938
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.906
- <i>Not the police.</i>
- Not the police?

939
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.617
Goodness, so something is going on with you.

940
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:44.952
Sam-sik, that punk. That son of a gun!

941
00:51:44.976 --> 00:51:46.996
Mom, please. Calm down.

942
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.998
How can I calm down right now?

943
00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:50.958
<i>How? I'm hanging up.</i>

944
00:51:50.982 --> 00:51:53.851
- I have to call the police...
- <i>Mom, please!</i>

945
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.426
The thing is,

946
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.235
it's not about me.

947
00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:05.154
It's Kang-ho.

948
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.615
What? Who?

949
00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:08.893
Kang-ho?

950
00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:10.535
Yes.

951
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.647
So I have to help him for a few days.

952
00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:15.691
But he's in the hospital.

953
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:17.583
Are you staying out...

954
00:52:17.676 --> 00:52:19.612
to look after him?

955
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.281
I'll explain everything later.

956
00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.783
You brat!

957
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.869
<i>You rotten brat. You're still out of your mind.</i>

958
00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:28.663
I know...

959
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.706
you tried to run into the farm...

960
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.793
to save Kang-ho when it was on fire.

961
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.879
<i>You gave everything you had to
support him through everything,</i>

962
00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:38.673
<i>yet he abandoned you.</i>

963
00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:41.843
<i>So why are you still hung up
on him and looking after him?</i>

964
00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:44.679
Why do you keep acting like an idiot?

965
00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:46.696
Because I take after you.

966
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.307
What?

967
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:51.075
<i>You lived like that.</i>

968
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:55.106
<i>Dad always put you through so much,</i>

969
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.734
<i>but you only loved and waited for him.</i>

970
00:52:58.758 --> 00:53:03.197
<i>You know better than anyone how painful that is.</i>

971
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:06.882
<i>That's why you're angry with me. Right?</i>

972
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.135
But Mom,

973
00:53:10.103 --> 00:53:14.056
you can also understand me
better than anyone right now.

974
00:53:15.066 --> 00:53:18.269
<i>You know I'll never get over Kang-ho,</i>

975
00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:21.480
I'll never leave him,

976
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:24.942
and that in the end,

977
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.236
I'll go back to him.

978
00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.530
You know, right?

979
00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:32.366
You're...

980
00:53:32.834 --> 00:53:34.785
my mom,

981
00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:36.829
so you know that.

982
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:40.958
<i>Thank you.</i>

983
00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:46.505
<i>I've always wanted to tell you that.</i>

984
00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:49.925
You never abandoned Dad,

985
00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:53.304
even though you went through so much.

986
00:53:54.147 --> 00:53:56.015
That you let me...

987
00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:01.562
have a dad.

988
00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:07.610
I also want to be a mother
like you to Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

989
00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:11.238
<i>So help me do that, Mom.</i>

990
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.412
You awful brat.

991
00:54:18.838 --> 00:54:23.292
Why do you want to live your life like me?

992
00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:24.695
<i>Fine, you brat!</i>

993
00:54:24.719 --> 00:54:29.325
<i>It's your darned life, so do whatever you want.</i>

994
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:33.746
But don't dare come back to
me crying with regret, okay?

995
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.414
Mom.

996
00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.181
I'm hanging up!

997
00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.936
I can't believe her.

998
00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:47.149
How could she use that against me?

999
00:54:48.868 --> 00:54:50.820
It's all...

1000
00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.850
your fault, Lee Choon-gil!

1001
00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:57.993
If Mi-joo becomes unhappy,

1002
00:54:58.086 --> 00:55:00.579
I'll seriously kill you.

1003
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:02.373
Wait.

1004
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.792
You're already dead.

1005
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.196
Who is it?

1006
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.171
Who's there?

1007
00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:14.927
Young-soon.

1008
00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:19.098
My gosh, Young-soon.

1009
00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:21.642
Goodness, poor Young-soon.

1010
00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:29.400
It sounds like Choi Kang-ho is
with Lee Mi-joo and Bang Sam-sik.

1011
00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:31.652
What now?

1012
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.448
Over there.

1013
00:55:35.623 --> 00:55:37.575
Get that license plate.

1014
00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:47.501
- Three, eight...
- Three, eight, three, five.

1015
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:51.130
It followed us from Seoul.

1016
00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.174
Who?

1017
00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:55.369
Us? Why?

1018
00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:57.720
Let's find out.

1019
00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:31.003
Go slowly so they don't notice.

1020
00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.215
Okay.

1021
00:56:55.787 --> 00:56:57.497
<i><font color="#ffff00">Fairy Brewery, Fairy Real Estate,
Fairy Fortune Telling</font></i>

1022
00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.918
Find them.

1023
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.629
I see a few familiar faces.

1024
00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:30.840
Chairman Song must've sent you here.

1025
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:31.799
Why?

1026
00:57:31.823 --> 00:57:34.593
Did he tell you to get rid
of us after we kill Kang-ho?

1027
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.095
Of course.

1028
00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.265
We do know a little too
much about Chairman Song.

1029
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.224
What?

1030
00:57:40.248 --> 00:57:43.409
I'm only an assistant,
so I don't know that much.

1031
00:57:44.669 --> 00:57:48.357
But you did learn how to dig and bury things...

1032
00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:50.583
while cultivating that lettuce field.

1033
00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:53.961
Which one should I bury first?

1034
00:57:59.392 --> 00:58:01.760
- Nice!
- What are you doing? Get in!

1035
00:58:03.396 --> 00:58:05.556
Okay!

1036
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.059
- Let go!
- You punks!

1037
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:25.603
- My goodness!
- Hey!

1038
00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:27.688
- Who are you thieves?
- You're all dead!

1039
00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:29.148
And we know one more thing!

1040
00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:31.665
What Mr. Yang trusts more than his deity...

1041
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.652
is an anti-theft system.

1042
00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:35.070
- Come quickly!
- Faster!

1043
00:58:35.094 --> 00:58:36.155
These thieves.

1044
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:37.740
- Round them up!
- You punks!

1045
00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:39.241
- Goodness.
- My goodness.

1046
00:58:39.265 --> 00:58:41.076
Gosh, this could've gone badly.

1047
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.162
- How dare you break in?
- Get them away!

1048
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.080
- Take them!
- Round them up!

1049
00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:47.348
- You rat.
- Hurry up.

1050
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.722
- Hey, Kang-ho.
- <i>Is everything all right?</i>

1051
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:34.603
I have way too many bodyguards
for anything to happen.

1052
00:59:35.154 --> 00:59:37.731
They're like the Avengers.

1053
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:43.654
What about you?

1054
00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:45.516
Is everything going well?

1055
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.908
<i>This is only the beginning.</i>

Presidential candidate
Oh Tae-Soo of the Jeilmirae Party...

1058
01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:02.783
visited an aquarium in Ilsung-dong, Seoul,

1059
01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:05.703
to commemorate the second
Marine Life Month today,

1060
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:09.054
and began his campaign
for the welfare of the people.

1061
01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:13.392
Hello, I'm Oh Tae-soo.

1062
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:16.171
Hello, children.

1063
01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:19.174
- Hello!
- Hello!

1064
01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.467
Were you looking at the fish?

1065
01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:23.068
- Yes!
- Yes!

1066
01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:26.390
"Daddy Fish isn't lonely."

1067
01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.810
"Because his babies are asleep..."

1068
01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.521
"in little circular eggs."

1069
01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:35.899
"'Daddy will dance for you every day...'"

1070
01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:39.001
"'until you hatch from your eggs.'"

1071
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.738
"And then..."

1072
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.338
"Crack."

1073
01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.992
<i>Remember what I told you earlier.</i>

"'I love you.'"

1080
01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:06.263
"The happy Daddy Fish..."

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:09.600
"danced his last dance and slowly let out..."

1082
01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.867
"his last breath."

1083
01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:13.604
Song Min-ho.

1084
01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.773
President Oh Tae-soo, let's go!

1085
01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.998
- Go!
- Thank you.

1086
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.444
Goodness, don't say that.

1087
01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:22.363
I'm not President yet.

1088
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:25.658
But now that I've heard your support,

1089
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.576
I'm starting to get ambitious.

1090
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.244
- You'll make it!
- You will!

1091
01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:32.179
Thank you for your support.

1092
01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:36.627
The children's book you read was very touching!

1093
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:39.963
Yes, I was also moved by the story.

1094
01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:41.840
I'll be a politician...

1095
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.927
who's just like a stickleback,
showing love to our people...

1096
01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.195
and making sacrifices
for the sake of our citizens!

1097
01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:51.407
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

1098
01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:52.976
Please shake my son's hand.

1099
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.813
Gosh, you're so adorable.

1100
01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:58.774
Goodness, I don't have a son myself,

1101
01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.749
so I'm jealous.

1102
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.277
- What's his name?
- Tae-yul.

1103
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:05.504
Tae-yul, thank you for coming today.

1104
01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.493
It's great to meet you.

1105
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.495
Thank you. Nice to meet you too.

1106
01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:13.303
Thank you.

1107
01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:18.127
Goodness.

1108
01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.561
- That's all for today.
- That'll be all.

1111
01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.497

It's to catch Chairman Song.</i>

1113

1114
01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:02.157

an arrest warrant...</i>

1115
