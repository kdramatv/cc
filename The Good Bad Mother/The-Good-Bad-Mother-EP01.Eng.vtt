<i>Humans...</i>

15
00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.143
<i>and pigs.</i>

16
00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:14.717
<i>Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,</i>

17
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.942
<i>but that's not the case.</i>

18
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:22.475
<i>Not only do their business in one place
but they also only sleep where it's clean.</i>

19
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.311
<i>They bathe often in mud to cool themselves,</i>

20
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.828
<i>and get rid of bugs.</i>

21
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:34.001
<i>But humans started to lock
them up in tiny pigsties.</i>

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.700
<i>The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,</i>

23
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.204
<i>so they began to rub their
bodies on their own excrement.</i>

24
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:48.224
<i>That's how they grew
dirtier and more aggressive.</i>

25
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.294
<i>Isn't that so sad?</i>

<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

27

28
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.730
<i>Pigs are unable to lift their heads,</i>

29
00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:13.040
<i>so they live their entire
life staring at the ground.</i>

30
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:21.632
<i>There's only one way for
a pig to look up at the sky.</i>

31
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.720
<i>It's...</i>

32
00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.766
<i>to fall down.</i>

33
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.772
<i>That's right.</i>

34
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.717
<i>Falling down...</i>

35
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:43.362

a world you have never seen before,</i>

36
00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:47.616

- Give this to your boss.

Mulberries?

{\an8}What's this?

75
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.870
{\an8}That's red chili powder
made with farm-grown peppers.

76
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.649
{\an8}To heck with that.

77
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.568
{\an8}Of course all red chili powders are from farms.

78
00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.487
{\an8}Then what about these?

79
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.171
{\an8}Were they assembled in a factory?

80
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.119
{\an8}Tell them to stop giving
us these useless things,

81
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.037
{\an8}and pay us what they owe.

82
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:13.122
{\an8}I forgot.

83
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.291
{\an8}There are mulberries in the car.

84
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.377

Ms. Eun-ju?

87

- Are you okay?

131
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:20.791
Have a good one.

132
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:21.902
- There.
- That scared me!

133

- A pig.

134

This way.

140
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.946
- Goodness.
- Where?

141
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.101
One more pork belly, please.

142
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.018
Sure.

143
00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:41.478
What's that noise?

144
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:42.771

- What?

145
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.857

- Where are you?

148
00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.586

149
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.451
Goodness.

150
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.509
This little...!

151
00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.373

152

- Go ahead and eat.

156

- Hey.

159
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.889
Young-soon, one second.

160
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.016
It didn't go as planned,

161
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.894
but next time, I promise
I'll train the pig better...

162
00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:26.148
so it can go directly to you next time.

163
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.984
You're going to get married again?

164
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.944
No, I'm not.

165
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.572
What are you talking about? I...

166
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.130
What?

167
00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:39.593
That means you'll...

168
00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.210
Thank you!

169
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.127
Thank you!

Thank you!

171
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:57.277
No wonder you always came to our
shop when you had nothing to buy.

172
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.181
Hey, wait!

173
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.741
Does this mean you're going to quit?

174
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.353
No!

175
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.063
I don't approve of this marriage!

176
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.648
- What do you mean?
- It's off!

177
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.982
- It can't happen!
- Move it.

178
00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:12.402
I'll take a picture for you. Look over here.

179
00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:14.863
Goodness, you two are cute.

180
00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.298
One, two, say piggy!

181
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.083
The circuits look fine. Your
electrical system looks good.

182
00:09:24.107 --> 00:09:26.250
- Really?
- Sparks are quite dangerous,

183
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.418
so make sure you dust often.

184
00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.003
Be careful when you spray water.

185
00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:31.755
All right. Thank you.

186
00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:33.840
No need to thank me. It's my job.

187
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.425
We're busy at the fire station...

188
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:37.344
- with frequent piggery fires.
- I see.

189
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.221
I'll stop by next time I'm on patrol.

190
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.722
Hold on.

191
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.906
Take this.

192
00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.227
I heard your baby just turned 1!

193
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.645
Your father told me.

194
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.897
- Buy your kid some clothes.
- Goodness, it's okay.

195
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.857
I couldn't even go to your wedding.

196
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.193
Don't say that.

197
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:57.004
I know you spend all your weekends
with your mother at the hospital.

198
00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:59.881
If it bothers you that much,

199
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.760
you can come to my kid's first birthday.

200
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.638
What? That means...

201
00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.766
I'm going to be a dad!

202
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:14.006
- Congratulations!
- My heart is racing!

203
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.259
My gosh. Isn't this great?

204
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.719
When is the baby due?

205
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.305
Next September, the Year of the Dragon.

206
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.098
It's the Year of the Double
Dragon in the year '88...

207
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.036
that only comes around once every 300 years.

208
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.226
Look at this.

209
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.770
I want to give my kid the best name,

210
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.064
so I've been studying this.

211
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.107
Kang-cheol.

212
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.915
Kang-su.

213
00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:34.860
Kang-jun.

214
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.612
Kang is the generational syllable.

215
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.571
Kang-hun.

216
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.655
Kang-sik.

217
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.824
- Kang-min.
- What if the baby's a girl?

218
00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:42.534
Kang-hui. Kang-sun.

219
00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:43.869
Kang-ja.

220
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.120
Kang-mi.

221
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.664
Hey, I'm prepared for everything.

222
00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:49.473
And look at this too.

223
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.298
{\an8}Ta-da.

224
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.259
{\an8}I don't know if it'll be a
boy or a girl, so I got both.

225
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.719
<i><font color="#ffff00">Bongu Farm</font></i>

226
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.639
The baby's not due for a while,
and you're already studying names.

227
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.098
You must be very excited.

228
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.558
Of course I am!

229
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.102
Anyway, why does it take ten months for humans?

230
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.230
Why can't humans give birth
in four months like pigs?

231
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:13.789
Right?

232
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.943
I'll also think of a good name...

233
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:18.987
- that begins with "Kang."
- No, don't.

234
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:19.988
You don't need to.

235
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.073
I'm going to do it.

236
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.840
Don't dare name my kid, okay?

237
00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.161
Thanks, Sang-cheol. Bye.

238
00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.136
Bye now.

239
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:35.769
All right.

240
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.217
Yong-yong, my Double Dragon.

241
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.302
Daddy made this.

242
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.762
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Yong-yong</font></i>

243
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.613
This is all for you.

244
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:49.157
Hae-sik!

245
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.978
- Hae-sik.
- Yes?

246
00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.022
- I need you at the breeding house.
- Why?

247
00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.358
She's doing it again.

248
00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.500
- Again?
- Yes.

249
00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.418
Okay. Let's go.

250
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.617
Hey, piggy. Doesn't it hurt?

251
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.537
What makes you so miserable
that you bang your head?

252
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.012
Think of the babies in your womb.

253
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.266
You shouldn't do that as a mother.

254
00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:17.644
- Here you are.
- Hey, you're here.

255
00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:20.021
She did it again.

256
00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.330
<i>The Ministry of Home Affairs began
environmental improvement projects...</i>

257
00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:27.139
<i>to take a leap into developed nations.</i>

258
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:30.725
<i>More resources have been
allocated to paving local roads...</i>

259
00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:33.103
<i>to complete the project
before the Seoul Olympics,</i>

260
00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:35.397
- <i>hastening the process.</i>
- It's so good.

261
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.567
Our baby is probably only tiny,

262
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.153
but I'm already feeling morning sickness.

263
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.697
But that mother pig carries ten piglets.

264
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.797
It must be so tough.

265
00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.258
That's true.

266
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.328
But I'm worried she'll stress out...

267
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:51.746
the other mother pigs.

268
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.916
It's a sensitive time,
and they need to stay healthy.

269
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.294
Why don't you separate them?

270
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.379
Our storage is empty.

271
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:00.672
Should I do that?

272
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.467
I'll make a pigsty,

273
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.844
feed it every day, and look after it.

274
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.430
Nonsense! You're in early pregnancy.

275
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.599
You need to be the most careful right now.

276
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.976
Don't strain yourself. Don't even do this.

277
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.561
I'll do everything.

278
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.021
- I'm fine.
- No.

279
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.106
It's for our Yong-yong.

280
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.608
Let's see what our baby is up to.

281
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.152
- My gosh.
- One second.

282
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.835
Yong-yong.

283
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.491
We're going to have a chat today.

284
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.132
Here.

285
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.385
Yong-yong, respond, over.

286
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:34.471
Can you say "Daddy"?

287
00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.432
Say "Daddy."

288
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.880
I just heard our baby say it. I mean it.

289
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.007
- One second.
- I can't believe you.

290
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:45.634
What?

291
00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.885
I see.

292
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.137
I have to do that now?

293
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.223
I have to give Mommy a big kiss?

294
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.031
Thank you.

295
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.855
Oh, my.

296
00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:01.399
You might have another
child before that one's born.

297
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.235
Chief.

298
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.903
Is our doorbell broken?

299
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.780
- Have some of this.
- Hello.

300
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.740
- Have a mung bean pancake.
- Goodness.

301
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:13.009
I can get a treat like this,
now that you have a wife.

302
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.206
This is really good.

303
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.139
Right? Isn't it great?

304
00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.627
Anyway, what brings you here, Chief?

305
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.004
I have something to discuss with you.

306
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.214
- I see.
- You know...

307
00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.967
about the Olympics torch relay, right?

308
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.593
Yes, I know.

309
00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.262
For the Seoul Olympics,

310
00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.973
the relay will go through
Bongu-ro and right out front.

311
00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.724
- Right here?
- Really?

312
00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:36.184
What an honor.

313
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:39.020
Does this mean we get
to see the torch relay live?

314
00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:42.232
That's why I thought of
gathering the villagers...

315
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.026
to cheer the runners with
Korean flags and banners.

316
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.486
That sounds great.

317
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.405
That's a wonderful idea.

318
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.783
Then may I make the flags and banners?

319
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.285
I'm a good artist.

320
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.871
Honey, you shouldn't strain yourself.

321
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:59.583
Strain myself? This is all for our country.

322
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:00.500
May I do that?

323
00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:01.877
Of course!

324
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.088
- I'd be grateful!
- No, you can't.

325
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:06.896
Come on.

326
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.135

You're going to demolish my farm...

332

That's just one of the reasons.

333

The marathon will also be held down this road.

334
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.865
Think about it.

335

The whole world will watch it on TV.

336
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:37.454
If the TV captures this dirty, smelly pigsty,

337
00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.957
foreigners are going to think
Korea is a backwater country.

338
00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.709
- Don't you think so?
- Hey.

Who are they?

343
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:54.179
Nobody. Go back inside.

- Let go, you jerks!
- What are you people doing?

351
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.501
Go back inside.

352
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.538
- Who do you think you are?
- Let go!

353
00:16:14.562 --> 00:16:16.451
Quiet down!

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:17.911
Gosh.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:22.207
I told you to explain it to
him quietly and with respect.

356
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.974
What are you doing right now?

357
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.047
What are you doing, you punk?

358
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.772
Darn it.

359
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.302
Goodness, I'm sorry.

360
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:37.347
All he's ever done is fight.

361
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.766
He's not educated.

362
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.491
Well...

363
00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.495
Take this.

364
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.983
So...

365
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:51.987
Have you heard of Major
League Baseball in the U.S.?

366
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.363
<i><font color="#ffff00">Director
Song Woo-byeok</font></i>

367
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:57.117
The best pitcher on the Boston Red Sox,

368
00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:01.177
Roger Clemens smokes these.

369
00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:04.666
We may be able to import Patriot missiles,

370
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.101
but these are really tough
to bring into the country.

371
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.353
Please have a smoke...

372
00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.355
and forgive us.

373
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.024
You smoke foreign cigarettes,

374
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.068
and talk about patriotism?

375
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:20.181
I don't care if it's the
torch relay or the marathon.

376
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:23.977
Even at a snail's pace, our farm
will be on TV for less than 30 seconds.

377
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.785
And the smell?

378
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.523
Do TVs abroad broadcast smells?

379
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:31.317
We've run this farm for generations,

380
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.529
since the days of my grandfather's grandfather.

381
00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.156
I'm going to leave it to my son,

382
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.533
and to his grandson and his grandson too!

383
00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:43.094
So I'll never sign this form!

384
00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:45.874
Don't ever come back here.

385
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.432
Understand?

386
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.714
You must be shocked. Let's go inside.

387
00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.564
Goodbye.

388
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.993
Eat up and get well soon,

389
00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:10.121
so you'll have a healthy delivery.

390
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.876
Yes.

391
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.698
I'm glad we put her in the storage.

392
00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:20.867
- Right.
- She's much calmer now.

393
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:21.785
You're right.

394
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:25.789
So Chief, no matter how
important the Olympics is,

395
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.624
these are lawfully our personal assets.

396
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.627
What can they do about it? We
have to hold out no matter what.

397
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:34.172
We should put together an
anti-demolition committee...

398
00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:36.257
and fight until the end, okay?

399
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.009
I won't condone this.

400
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.429
I'll meet with an attorney right away.

401
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.280
Yes, I'll call you later. Bye.

402
00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.607
Goodness, look at the time.

403
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.859
- I have to feed the pigs.
- Hey.

404
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:55.944
Honey.

405
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.570
I already fed the pigs.

406
00:18:57.594 --> 00:18:59.489
- You did?
- Yes.

407
00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.158
Why did you do that? It's tough on you.

408
00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.551
Things are tougher for you.

409
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.639
Honey.

410
00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.251
Don't worry about it.

411
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.837
You know me, right? I'll never give up.

412
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.562
I won't lose.

413
00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:16.965
Do you know why?

414
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.759
Look, I got you right here,

415
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:22.011
and I got Yong-yong here too!

416
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.279
How can I lose to anybody?

417
00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.032
Everything will be fine.

418
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.136
<i>- Fire!
- Fire!</i>

419
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.014

425
00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.293
Honey.

426
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.487
What is it?

427
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.463
Honey!

428
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.408
What? What's going on?

429
00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:27.133
Where's the fire?

430
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.747
Oh, no! Call the firehouse!

431
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.207
Where's the firetruck?

432
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.458
- No!
- No!

433
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.001
- You can't go in!
- No!

434
00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:36.336
- I have to go in!
- Don't go!

435
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.545
- Let go!
- No, you can't!

436
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.088
- Goodness, no!
- Goodness!

437
00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:40.673
- No!
- Let go!

438
00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:43.635
My pigs are dying in there! This isn't right!

439
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:47.597
Even pigs don't deserve to die like this!

440
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.723
No!

441
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.032
Honey, I'm sorry.

442
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.895
But you can't go in there.

443
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.246
I can't let you go in there.

444
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.070
Why?

445
00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:05.797
Why?!

446
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.913
I saw it with my own two eyes.

447
00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.539
I came out to take a leak earlier,

448
00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:15.792
and I heard the dogs barking,

449
00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:18.711
and saw some dark figures lurking around.

450
00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:21.047
I kept watching to see who they were,

451
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:24.190
and they were those punks
from Yongra Construction.

452
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:27.220
I wondered why they were
here in the middle of the night,

453
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.972
then I suddenly saw these flames.

454
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.181
See?

455
00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.767
- I told you it'd be them.
- Are you sure?

456
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.702
- Are you sure it was them?
- Yes!

457
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.230
Honey.

458
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.816
- Honey.
- Look at this.

459
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.418
It's the American brand
that man was smoking, right?

460
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.972
<i><font color="#ffff00">Evidence 1</font></i>

461
00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:54.789
You're right.

462
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.682
That's the same brand as the ones I smoke.

463
00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.169
Is that a problem?

464
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:02.505
These cigarettes are only sold in the U.S.,

465
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:05.523
and they've never been imported here.

466
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.429
Which means it's not easy for
ordinary people to buy these.

467
00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:13.474
However, this cigarette butt
was found near the victim's farm,

468
00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:17.270
who recently had a dispute with
the defendant over the demolition.

469
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:22.623
It means there's a high possibility
this cigarette belongs to the defendant.

470
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.883
Well, Mr. Kim of Daeil Real Estate.

471
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.287
Me?

472
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:38.583
When I first went to see you,
I gave you a cigarette, didn't I?

473
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.126
I didn't smoke it.

474
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.712
I also gave one to the radio shop owner.

475
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.338
And the village chief too.

476
00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.340
Chief, you got one too.

477
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.509
I smoked it that day!

478
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:52.055
- Silence.
- Who knows?

479
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.389
What?

480
00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:55.058
Are you saying I started the fire?

481
00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.893
I said, silence!

482
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.752
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Witness</font></i>

483
00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:04.290
Well, yes, I did see something.

484
00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:10.922
But come to think of it, I'm not
sure if it was a man or a boar.

485
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:14.717
Right, maybe a wild dog.

486
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.719
Yes, you're right.

487
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:21.334
We had to repaint the roof,

488
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:22.960
but recently it kept raining,

489
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:27.006
so we kept the buckets of
paint and thinner inside the farm.

490
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.133
We only had two buckets!

491
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:31.260
But more than five buckets were at the scene!

492
00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:32.678
This was clearly arson!

493
00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:34.904
Silence!

494
00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:38.935
There's a better chance that the
cause was a short circuit than arson.

495
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:39.936
Actually,

496
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.689
there were a lot of problems with
the electrical system at the farm.

497
00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:47.318
I urged him to get it fixed,
but he never took adequate measures.

498
00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:49.112
Hey, Sang-cheol! What's with you?

499
00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:50.738
Silence!

500
00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:52.296
Sang-cheol...

501
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:57.829
It's difficult to acknowledge
the cigarette butt as evidence...

502
00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:00.623
purely on the presumption of the prosecution.

503
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:04.919
Also, no witnesses or tools of arson
were found to support the claim...

504
00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:07.380
that the defendant started the fire.

505
00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:09.090
For such reasons,

506
00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:12.093
the indictment is ruled as not credible.

507
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:13.886
The defendant is innocent.

508
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.653
That's right!

509
00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.157
Hey, Sang-cheol.

510
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.366
Hae-sik.

511
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.826
I have something to say.

512
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.578
- Stay away from me.
- Sang-cheol.

513
00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.371
- It's not that.
- Don't come near me!

514
00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:41.956
Sang-cheol!

515
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.931
Sang-cheol!

516
00:24:55.994 --> 00:25:00.349
<i>I needed money for my mother's surgery.</i>

517
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:03.019
<i>They said no matter how
much you hold out and resist,</i>

518
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:06.746
<i>it'll be over once the state
decides to bulldoze the pig farm.</i>

519
00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:09.609
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

520
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.110
<i>Hae-sik.</i>

521
00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:12.695
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

522
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:16.365
<i>They knew my daughter's home address,</i>

523
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:19.008
<i>and where she works.</i>

524
00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:21.510
<i>What would you have done?</i>

525
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.873
That must've been tough.

526
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:27.084
This is enough evidence to file an appeal.

527
00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:28.711
I see.

528
00:25:28.735 --> 00:25:30.755
Prosecutor Oh, I'm meeting TV reporters...

529
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:34.342
and international reporters tomorrow.

530
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.984
- Reporters?
- Yes.

531
00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:40.514
I asked around,

532
00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:43.366
and that Director Song...

533
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:47.188
is apparently the heir to Yongra Construction.

534
00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.357
And I found many suspicious incidents.

535
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:51.859
There were many incidents
of fire on demolition sites...

536
00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.960
where Director Song was in charge.

537
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:57.323
Although most incidents were
concluded as short-circuit fires,

538
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:59.492
many details were unclear.

539
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.369
Strangely enough,

540
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:05.456
witnesses and investigators
all changed their testimonies.

541
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.765
Doesn't it sound similar to our case?

542
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.725
Well...

543
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:11.936
Prosecutor Oh.

544
00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.898
Here.

545
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.636
I've been saving up some money...

546
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.097
to build a new home when our baby is born.

547
00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.474
I don't want my child to be ridiculed...

548
00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:26.492
for living in a smelly home next to a pig farm.

549
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.704
But Prosecutor Oh,

550
00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:32.999
I'd feel more shame...

551
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:36.737
to live as a helpless father who
let those jerks have their way,

552
00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:39.213
than to stink like a pigsty.

553
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:42.883
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

554
00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.885
Prosecutor Oh.

555
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:47.930
Please reveal the truth.

556
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.710
But the money...

557
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:53.185
Prosecutor Oh, I...

558
00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.261
I understand for now.

559
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.069

Have a drink.

574

One for me.

575
00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.895
I was watching baseball yesterday,

576
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:04.316
and the game was completely ridiculous.

577
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.679
I mean,

578
00:29:06.703 --> 00:29:08.556
if the fielders got hold of the ball,

579
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.199
the runner should've stopped
at second or third base.

580
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:16.397
This idiot got greedy and
tried to make it to home plate.

581
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.191
And he was tagged out.

582
00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:21.917
Gosh, that idiot.

583
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.762
Baseball...

584
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:37.057
is exactly like life.

585
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:42.590
What's important isn't running,
but knowing when to stop.

586
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:45.441
And you also need to know where to stop.

587
00:29:45.575 --> 00:29:47.553
Anyway.

588
00:29:47.577 --> 00:29:49.528
Everything...

589
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:52.031
is in the past.

590
00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:55.644
Mr. Choi, have a drink...

591
00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.329
and forget all about it.

592
00:29:59.172 --> 00:30:01.916
All right then.

593
00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:08.491
Here. You can eat this on your way.

594
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:12.426
If he stepped on the chair to get up...

595
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.345
Good, right?

596
00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:20.211
No, it should be knocked over.

597
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:23.047
That looks more natural, right?

598
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:25.174

Yes?

620
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.940
I brought the car you sent for repair.

621
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:08.125
The trunk is fully cleaned
out too. Please check.

622
00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:12.004
Excuse me. Hey!

623
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.321
Are you Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo?

624
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:40.324
Yes, hello.

625
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.896
He said he found important evidence,

626
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.660
and he was going to meet with reporters.

627
00:32:45.684 --> 00:32:48.192
So why would he kill himself?

628
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:51.111
And look at this.

629
00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.571
Isn't this weird?

630
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:54.448
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

631
00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:57.660
Even if he was determined to die,

632
00:32:57.684 --> 00:33:01.762
there should be some trace
of struggling due to pain, right?

633
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.887
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Bank Book</font></i>

634
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:19.598
After hearing what you just said,

635
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:22.116
I'm convinced he killed himself.

636
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.062
If he found important evidence,

637
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:28.482
why didn't he bring it to me?

638
00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:32.361
Instead, he stopped by, drunk,
and said he wanted to kill himself,

639
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:35.587
and that if anything happened to him,

640
00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:38.298
I should give this bank book to you.

641
00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:43.846
He was quite drunk and persistent.

642
00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:46.181
So I took it...

643
00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:49.309
and told him to go home.

644
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.399
I didn't know he'd end up like this.

645
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:12.568
{\an8}<i>Why did he do that?</i>

646
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:13.718
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Bank Book</font></i>

647
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:19.131
How frustrated and lost must he
have been to do something like that?

648
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:24.720
I should've done...

649
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.223
everything I could to keep him safe.

650
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.477
I should've...

651
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:34.021
supported him...

652
00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:36.398
and helped him better.

653
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:42.362
But I don't know anything,
and I don't have anything.

654
00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:49.620
One thing I do have is...

655
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:56.919
I won't...

656
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:01.757
let this child live like us.

657
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:09.431
I'll live.

658
00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.185

00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:47.968
Then what have you done as
President of the Women's Association?

714
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.735
- Tell me.
- Hey!

715
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.347
What are you doing?

716
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:55.600
- We can't fight among ourselves.
- He's right.

717
00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:59.730
Last year people in the
next village got into a fight,

718
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:03.457
then someone put pesticide
in the well and everyone died.

719
00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:14.051
Why the heck are you saying
something so horrendous?

720
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:18.013
I'm just saying. Don't mind me.

721
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.877
Someone's there!

722
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:22.961
- What?
- Hey!

723
00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:25.422
Hey! You!

724
00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.674
What the heck is this?

725
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.217
Can't you hear me?

726
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:32.652
- Hey!
- Don't mess with my temper...

727
00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.907
What? A woman?

728
00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:39.603
Her stomach... She's pregnant too.

729
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.772
Did you bring this to shoot her?

730
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:43.565
No, I didn't.

731
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:44.816
- You rat.
- Goodness.

732
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.542
Hey, I'm pregnant too!

733
00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:51.281
I just gave birth to my kid too!

734
00:39:51.305 --> 00:39:52.824
That's wonderful news!

735
00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:55.535
Then our children will be the same age.

736
00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:59.206
It'll be wonderful to see them grow,
play, and go to school together.

737
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.556
Hey, you're right.

738
00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:05.379
Gum-ja, when are you due this month?

739
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:07.839
- Less than half a month.
- What?

740
00:40:07.863 --> 00:40:10.384
Goodness, really?

741
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:14.012
I hope it's a son this time.

742
00:40:14.036 --> 00:40:15.597
She's having a son!

743
00:40:15.621 --> 00:40:16.515
- What?
- What?

744
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.351
I went to this famous fortune-teller,

745
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:21.144
and this time, she's having a son.

746
00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:22.437
- Really?
- My goodness!

747
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:23.730
She's really having a son?

748
00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:26.274
- My goodness, this is wonderful!
- She is!

749
00:40:26.298 --> 00:40:27.901
This is great news!

750
00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:30.070
Congratulations.

751
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.655
I should butcher a pig.

752
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:34.449
- Sounds great!
- Yes, pork is a must for feasts!

753
00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:35.534
- Yes.
- Goodness.

754
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:38.343
- I want some boiled pork.
- Wait!

755
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:43.515
We don't know if your kid and
my kid will go to school together.

756
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:46.768
Because you can't run
a pig farm in this village.

757
00:40:47.194 --> 00:40:49.464
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

758
00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:52.050
We'll keep filing civil complaints to stop you.

759
00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:54.761
And what if the pig catches
some contagious disease?

760
00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:57.431
The entire village will get quarantined.

761
00:40:57.455 --> 00:41:00.350
We can't live with this inconvenience!

762
00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:02.284
Hey.

763
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.647
I'm the village head.

764
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:08.483
An unpleasant facility such as a pig farm...

765
00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:13.295
requires the understanding
and agreement of the villagers.

766
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.908
That's common sense and
it's the right thing to do.

767
00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:18.675
Yes.

768
00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.141
In that case,

769
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.962
may I file a civil complaint too?

770
00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.046
Pardon?

771
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.507
Your dogs bark all day long, and it's so loud.

772
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:34.176
I can't stand it.

773
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.137
And you've occupied state-owned
land without permission, right?

774
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.263
State-owned land?

775
00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:39.598
You dry pepper on the road!

776
00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:42.601
It's very inconvenient,
trying to avoid stepping on it.

777
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:45.479
And you, the village head.
You instigated the villagers...

778
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.230
to vote for a certain candidate.

779
00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:48.940
- That's illegal campaigning.
- Well...

780
00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:51.693
They can vote for anyone
in this democratic country.

781
00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:54.336
That's common sense and
it's the right thing to do.

782
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:57.699
The plastic greenhouse in the
forest should be pulled down!

783
00:41:57.723 --> 00:41:59.701
It blocks my view of the mountains,

784
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:01.828
- and it's very inconvenient!
- Goodness.

785
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:05.165
And you, why do you use so much pesticide?

786
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:07.167
What if you damage the land?

787
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.420
Why do you care if I damage the land I own?

788
00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:13.048
You don't own the frogs
and loaches that live there!

789
00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:14.606
You wench.

790
00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:16.301
What are you doing?

791
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:17.844
- Let her go!
- Stop that!

792
00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.471
That's my husband you're talking to!

793
00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.556
- That's enough!
- You people started this!

794
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.891
- Let go!
- Goodness!

795
00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:24.392
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

796
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.493
- Let go!
- Stop this!

797
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.147
What's wrong?

798
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.650
- What's wrong with her?
- What...?

799
00:42:30.674 --> 00:42:31.525
Goodness.

800
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.333
Are you all right?

801
00:42:34.426 --> 00:42:36.279
- Let go of him!
- Let go!

802
00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:37.781
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

803
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:38.698
Gum-ja!

804
00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.867
- You're making my husband bald!
- Let go!

805
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.411
- Stop pulling his hair!
- Let go of her!

806
00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:44.329
Let go!

807
00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:45.622
One second.

808
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.690
- I think she's about to give birth.
- Goodness.

809
00:42:47.714 --> 00:42:49.125
- Goodness.
- Oh, no.

810
00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:50.585
Goodness, what do we do?

811
00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:52.295
- What's that?
- Goodness.

812
00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:54.381
- Her water broke.
- Goodness.

813
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.799
- We have to hurry.
- Wait.

814
00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:58.385
- Yes?
- Sung-ae, go boil some water.

815
00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.595
- Okay.
- Gum-ja, go to her room...

816
00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:01.930
and lay out the bedding.

817
00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:03.557
I'll grab the tools.

818
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:04.683
- Tools?
- Scissors!

819
00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:05.725
- Scissors, yes.
- Yes.

820
00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:09.062
Move!

821
00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.246
Hey, hop on!

822
00:43:14.883 --> 00:43:18.822
I called you ages ago! Why
the heck aren't you here yet?

823
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:20.949
No, it's Jou-ri!

824
00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:23.368
What do you mean, Cho Yong-pil? Darn it.

825
00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.786
Hello?

826
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.123
- Please look after Jou-ri...
- Hey!

827
00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:29.887
- ...and the unborn child...
- You jerks!

828
00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:33.697
Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

829
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.923
Yes, you're doing well.

830
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.758
Yes, listen to me.

831
00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:42.304
You can't clench your stomach.

832
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:44.014
- Don't do that.
- Right.

833
00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:46.891
Think of this as taking a dump,

834
00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:49.269
- and flex your buttocks.
- Okay.

835
00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.645
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

836
00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:51.730
So...

837
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:54.164
are the scissors ready?

838
00:43:54.256 --> 00:43:56.416
I'm coming!

839
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:01.781
It's nice and sharp.

840
00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:05.076
This is sharp enough to cut down
the wood a woodchuck would chuck.

841
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.676
Goodness.

842
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.788
I can never say that right.

843
00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:11.082
Wood a woodchunk would chunk.

844
00:44:11.106 --> 00:44:13.543
No, wood a woodchuck would chuck.

845
00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:15.133
- Woond...
- A woodchunk could chunk.

846
00:44:15.157 --> 00:44:16.838
- Would chunk.
- Can you do it?

847
00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:19.647
A wood a woodchunk would...

848
00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:22.510
Wood a woodchuck...

849
00:44:22.534 --> 00:44:24.179
- Goodness.
- ...would chuck!

850
00:44:24.203 --> 00:44:25.263
That's right!

851
00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:28.490
Wood a woodchuck would chuck. You're good!

852
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.018
Goodness, quiet down.

853
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:30.935
Quiet down.

854
00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:33.313
All of you, hold her hands.

855
00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:35.774
- Hands.
- Right here.

856
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.025
Here we go.

857
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:40.695
One, two, three.

858
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:44.005
- Push!
- Push!

859
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.034
Push!

860
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:47.994
- Okay, good.
- Goodness.

861
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:51.164
You can't relax like this again.

862
00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.875
You're giving the child a tough time in here.

863
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:55.835
Think of your child,

864
00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.921
and think of this as the last time.

865
00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:00.965
Let's try this one more
time with all your energy.

866
00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:03.635
One, two, three.

867
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:06.903
- Push!
- Push!

868
00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:10.141
- It's coming!
- I see the baby!

869
00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:12.227
- I see the baby!
- More!

870
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:14.536
You still haven't found us?

871
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.775
It's right under the persimmon tree!

872
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:20.610
It's next to Gu Ja-yeong's place!

873
00:45:20.634 --> 00:45:23.613
Hey, you punk. Don't you
know who Gu Ja-yeong is?

874
00:45:23.637 --> 00:45:27.215
You know, his grandpa was
our middle-school principal...

875
00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:34.597
- Is the baby here?
- Yes!

876
00:45:34.857 --> 00:45:38.143
The baby's born! I'm
hanging up, you stinking punk!

877
00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:39.963
- The baby is here!
- The baby's here?

878
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:42.757
- The baby is here!
- The baby is here!

879
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:45.051
- It's here!
- It's here!

880
00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.177
The baby is here!

881
00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:48.403
Your mommy is here.

882
00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:51.683
Goodness.

883
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:54.409
My gosh.

884
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.329
Kang-ho.

885
00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:01.067
"Choi Kang-ho"?

886
00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:03.251
Yes, Kang-ho.

887
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:07.240
A really competent and strong person.

888
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:10.842
I wanted him to be like that,
so that's what the name means.

889
00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:13.913
- I love it. Kang-ho.
- Isn't it nice?

890
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:17.765
And Kang-ho isn't just any strong person.

891
00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:18.960
He's the strongest one.

892
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:20.753
- Choi Kang-ho.
- Choi Kang-ho.

893
00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.604
Look.

894
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.967
Kang-ho, it's me, your father.

895
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:27.692
Choi Kang-ho.

896
00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:31.306
You have to grow up as a
powerful and strong person.

897
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.474
Okay?

898
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.032
Okay.

899
00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:36.159
<i>He just said yes.</i>

900
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:37.729
Honey.

901
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:39.996
He's our Kang-ho.

902
00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:44.209
I'll raise him well.

903
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.363
I'll raise him...

904
00:46:47.387 --> 00:46:49.714
to be the strongest man.

905
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:54.260
His name is Kang-ho.

906
00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:07.148
So?

907
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.484
So which is it?

908
00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:11.277
The delivery was successful.

909
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.473
Which is it?

910
00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:14.599
A boy.

911
00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:16.392
- A boy!
- A boy!

912
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:17.644
- Goodness.
- A boy.

913
00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:20.703
- Is he healthy?
- Of course!

914
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:22.748
- Why are you crying?
- Why are you crying?

915
00:47:22.772 --> 00:47:24.291
- What?
- Why are you crying?

916
00:47:24.315 --> 00:47:26.027
I'm practicing.

917
00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:29.504
- What?
- I'll also have a son very soon.

918
00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.741
Goodness, this guy.

919
00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:33.826
- You surprised us.
- You startled me.

920
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.119
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

921
00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:36.746
- Oh, my.
- What?

922
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.498
What are you doing?

923
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:42.183
Are you practicing too?

924
00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:45.046
- Stop it.
- No, I have a few more days.

925
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.172
- Right?
- Yes.

926
00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.674
What...?

927
00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.175
- Oh, my.
- What?

928
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.261
Goodness, it must be for real.

929
00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.096
Mother, you need to come out!

930
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.848
- What's going on?
- What do we do?

931
00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:57.433
I can't believe this.

932
00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:59.826
Take this. Hurry.

933
00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:03.731
My goodness.

934
00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:05.331
Boil some water.

935
00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:06.818
Get water.

936
00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:08.236
Goodness.

937
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.738
- No, stay with me right now.
- Hello?

938
00:48:10.762 --> 00:48:12.740
It's the same Cho Yong-pil place.

939
00:48:12.764 --> 00:48:15.174
I need your help.

940
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:19.497
On the same day, same hour,
and under the same roof.

941
00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:20.665
Goodness.

942
00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:24.350
What are the chances?

943
00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:27.437
Tell me about it.

944
00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:31.217
There have never been births like this.

945
00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.511
Is this meant to be or fate?

946
00:48:33.535 --> 00:48:35.763
That's a funny saying.

947
00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:39.642
It'll be a huge hit if that
comes out in a movie.

948
00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:41.284
Really?

949
00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:45.621
Anyway, where's your husband?

950
00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:49.625
What's wrong?

951
00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:52.253
He went home.

952
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:55.048
That son of a gun.

953
00:48:57.976 --> 00:48:58.953
Mother.

954
00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:01.721
- Well, I...
- It's fine.

955
00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:05.975
He's a son of a gun.

956
00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:07.810
Son of a gun.

957
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.882
Good, smile.

958
00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:12.467
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

959
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.734
- There, there.
- Goodness.

960
00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.096
We say it's meant to be...

961
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.531
to someone we meet for the first time.

962
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.894
But fate is...

963
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:28.581
what we say to someone who
stays with us until the end.

964
00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:33.112
I'm not sure if this is
just meant to be or fate,

965
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:37.825
but I hope all these babies
who are born in Jou-ri,

966
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:41.120
including Sam-sik,

967
00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:44.415
stay healthy for a very long time,

968
00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:48.226
and be good friends for a long time.

969
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:50.797
Sam-sik, they're like your younger siblings.

970
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.757
- Sam-sik is...
- In that case,

971
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:56.526
are we not kicking out the dirty pig farm?

972
00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:02.907
- That little...!
- Are we kicking her out?

973
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:05.284
Cover your ears.

974
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:10.748
Goodness, look at them.

975
00:50:11.258 --> 00:50:13.334
You can't go this time either?

976
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.657
I can't believe her.

977
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:20.466
You can't skip studying for just one day?

978
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:24.580
Should I ask your mom...

979
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:26.764
to let you go to the picnic?

980
00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:31.629
I'm sorry.

981
00:50:31.653 --> 00:50:33.631
I didn't mean to hit you with it.

982
00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:36.065
Now it'll reek of pig poop.

983
00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:38.359
I'm sorry.

984
00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:42.390
Smell this.

985
00:50:42.414 --> 00:50:43.474
No!

986
00:50:43.498 --> 00:50:45.324
Sam-sik, you jerk!

987
00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:48.813
Why the heck do you keep bullying Kang-ho?

988
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:50.580
Why?

989
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:53.359
Why do you like him?

990
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.710
All that idiot does is study.

991
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.739
But then...

992
00:50:57.763 --> 00:50:59.490
he should study hard.

993
00:50:59.514 --> 00:51:02.008
He's a loser who doesn't have a dad!

994
00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:08.723
You douchebag!

995
00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:10.626
"Douchebag"?

996
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:14.005
Who taught you to swear
at your friend like that?

997
00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:16.841
Where did you learn such foul language?

998
00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:19.719
That douchebag made fun of me first!

999
00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.846
He said I'm a loser with no dad,

1000
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.530
and to get lost because I smell like pig poop!

1001
00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:28.644
Did you just say "douchebag" again?

1002
00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:30.730
<i><font color="#ffff00">Encyclopedia
The Periodic Table</font></i>

1003
00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.398
You don't have to feel ashamed.

1004
00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.373
He's not entirely wrong.

1005
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.668
You don't have a father,

1006
00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:41.172
and a pig farm does smell like pig poop.

1007
00:51:41.306 --> 00:51:43.910
See your first birthday picture?

1008
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:46.078
I put out a stethoscope, money, a microphone,

1009
00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:49.207
and even your favorite robot toy.

1010
00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:51.974
But that gavel is what you picked.

1011
00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.086
Let him say whatever he wants.

1012
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.798
If he insults you, let him.

1013
00:51:56.822 --> 00:51:59.467
Once you study hard and become a prosecutor,

1014
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:02.777
no one will be able to look
down on you or bully you.

1015
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:05.613
That's true power.

1016
00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:08.282
Do you understand?

1017
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:14.288
Is that why I can't go to the school picnic?

1018
00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:17.708
That's right.

1019
00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.529
You can never become successful...

1020
00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:22.547
without sacrifice.

1021
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.412
Stop eating if you're full.

1022
00:52:28.436 --> 00:52:31.472
You'll get sleepy if you're too full.

1023
00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:38.896
You got 3 wrong out of 100.

1024
00:52:38.947 --> 00:52:42.358
Correct your mistakes and
solve the problems until page 130.

It's Grandma's favorite, meat pancakes!

1031
00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.781
Don't touch it before the memorial service.

1032
00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:36.105
This one is torn.

1033
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:40.791
You can't serve a piece like this.

1034
00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.214
What's wrong?

1035
00:53:48.975 --> 00:53:50.786
Mom, are you crying?

1036
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.595
Crazy brat.

1037
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.598
I'm not crying.

1038
00:53:56.566 --> 00:54:00.561
Darn it. The smoke is getting in my eyes.

1039
00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:09.779
Dad!

1040
00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:23.027
What's with you?

1041
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:25.446
- Come on out!
- Let go of me!

1042
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.756
Or I'll report this bar for
opening during the day.

1043
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.837
Goodness.

1044
00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:45.257
Jennifer, you're becoming
a better dancer each day.

1045
00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.759
You're flattering me.

1046
00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:49.735
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

1047
00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:51.931
Have some.

1048
00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.864
My goodness!

1049
00:54:54.165 --> 00:54:56.394
What are you doing here?

1050
00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:58.035
Dad.

1051
00:54:58.211 --> 00:54:59.870
What?

1052
00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:04.125
Good grief.

1053
00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:06.293
Let go, you brat.

1054
00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:11.882
If you don't want to die on
the same day Grandma passed,

1055
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.926
you'd better come out.

1056
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:16.595
Do you want one?

1057
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.285
Let's go.

1058
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:40.938
Mi-joo!

1059
00:55:40.962 --> 00:55:43.441
I'll be home before the sun sets!

1060
00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:46.318
Red fruit on the right, white fruit on the left!

1061
00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:48.487
Dried fish on the left, <i>sikhye</i> on the right!

00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:03.919
♫ <i>I'll give you my heart</i> ♫

1068
00:56:03.943 --> 00:56:05.880
Isn't it enough that Dad's out dancing?

1069
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:07.506
Do you have to do this nonsense?

1070
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.175
What's with you?

1071
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.942
- Stop dancing!
- Why should I?

1072
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:44.642
Where's this darned little brat?

1073
00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:46.560
Lee Mi-joo!

1074
00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:49.882
Hey, you brat!

1075
00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:52.358
Why do you keep doing this to my hand?

1076
00:56:54.285 --> 00:56:55.429
What's that?

1077
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.154
Is she eating <i>gimbap?</i>

1078
00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.766
Oh, my.

1079
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.700
You brat! You little...!

1080
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.730
That was for your school trip!

1081
00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:06.747
Stop right there, you brat!

1082
00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.902
I missed the shot.

1083
00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.403
Hey! Pass!

1084
00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:13.531
- Pass!
- You're so handsome!

1085
00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:15.297
Pass!

1086
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.159
I root for the winning team!

1087
00:57:17.183 --> 00:57:19.635
Pass!

1088
00:57:20.395 --> 00:57:22.847
You're so good-looking!

1089
00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:24.667
Pass.

1090
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:27.101
- Go!
- Let's go!

1091
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:34.066
Oh, my!

1092
00:57:34.325 --> 00:57:36.720
I knew you'd be here.

1093
00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:37.805
How did you know...?

1094
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:41.350
You'd always disappear during lunch and dinner,

1095
00:57:41.374 --> 00:57:44.243
so I tailed you for a few days.

1096
00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:46.564
Right.

1097
00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:48.998
Here, it's your present.

1098
00:57:50.091 --> 00:57:53.821
I mean, you've never been
on a school picnic or trip,

1099
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:56.755
so you probably never
had a chance to eat <i>gimbap.</i>

1100
00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:59.243
I wondered what I should
get you for your birthday,

1101
00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:01.427
then thought of this.

1102
00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:05.723
- For my birthday?
- Today's your birthday.

1103
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.685
And my birthday too.

1104
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.537
Goodbye, Choi Kang-ho.

1105
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:30.414
Good luck.

1106
00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.463
Why are you picking out the carrots?

1107
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:39.190
I don't like carrots.

1108
00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:41.250
Really?

1109
00:58:41.667 --> 00:58:45.912
Kang-ho doesn't like carrots. Noted.

1110
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:51.420
Wait, what?

1111
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:54.256
- Why don't you have some more?
- I'm done.

1112
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.509
You only had five pieces. What do you mean?

1113
00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:58.427
You should have some more.

1114
00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:00.569
No, it's okay. I can't be full.

1115
00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.863
Why not?

1116
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.851
I get sleepy when I'm full.

1117
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.686
If I'm sleepy, I can't study.

1118
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:10.454
If I don't study, I can't become a prosecutor.

1119
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:13.415
That's nonsense.

1120
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:17.294
Right? It does sound like nonsense.

1121
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.283
Like our names, zodiac signs, and blood types,

1122
00:59:21.307 --> 00:59:26.428
I thought everyone was
born under a specific job.

1123
00:59:26.604 --> 00:59:29.708
So when I saw kids switching
dreams every semester,

1124
00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:32.795
- I thought they were ridiculous.
- Right.

1125
00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:36.272
But it turns out, I was the ridiculous one.

1126
00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:41.193
If you don't like that, it's
not too late to do what you want.

1127
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.721
What I want?

1128
00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.363
Yes.

1129
00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:47.074
What is that?

1130
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:53.747
Come to think about it,
I've never thought about that.

1131
00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.335
Kang-ho, you poor thing.

1132
01:00:01.806 --> 01:00:03.951
That's the bell. Let's go for our night study.

1133
01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.509
Okay.

1134
01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.876
What do we do?

1135
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.269
I think it's locked.

1136
01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.965
Hello?

1137
01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.383
- Hello?
- Hello?

1138
01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.120
- Hello? Hey!
- Hello?

1139
01:00:21.145 --> 01:00:23.345
<i>- We're in here.
- Hey!</i>

1140
01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:24.597
Darn it.

1141
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.974
Hey! We're in here!

1142
01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:29.310
Is anybody out there?

1143
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.644
Hello?

1144
01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.661
Kang-ho.

1145
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.247
That's enough.

1146
01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:40.178
<i><font color="#ffff00">Uri High School</font></i>

1147
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:52.231

1149
01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.026
What on earth is going on?

1150
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.029
These kids never caused
any trouble. What's happening?

1151
01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.239
Was he acting differently lately?

1152
01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:25.991
No, not at all.

1153
01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.076
Oh, right.

1154
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.163
Mi-joo took <i>gimbap</i> when she left this morning.

1155
01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.373
- <i>Gimbap?</i>
- Yes.

1156
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.709
Maybe they went to hang out at Bongil Stream.

1157
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.961
Tomorrow is the midterm. He wouldn't do that.

1158
01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:39.505
The midterm is tomorrow?

1159
01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.632
Good grief, that little brat.

1160
01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:42.841
This is bad.

1161
01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:46.276
It won't be good if high-school
kids end up having a child.

1162
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:53.158
Hey! Watch what you say!

1163
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.397
She's quite unwell. Please try to understand.

1164
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.163
I'm unwell?

1165
01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.067
Sam-sik.

1166
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:01.944
- Sam-sik!
- Sam-sik, are you in?

1167
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.028
- Sam-sik!
- Sam-sik!

1168
01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.863
- The lights turned on.
- The lights.

1169
01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:07.381
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1170
01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.035
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1171
01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.954
Why are you here at this ungodly hour?

1172
01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:15.040
Kang-ho and Mi-joo are missing.

1173
01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.307
Kang-ho's missing?

1174
01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.628
Mi-joo too?

1175
01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:21.338
Wait, Mi-joo was in there too?

1176
01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:23.841
In there? Where?

1177
01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.342
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

1178
01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:27.261
- Mom, move.
- Sam-sik!

1179
01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:28.929
- Sam-sik!
- Hey!

1180
01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:31.014
Where are you going? We came down that way!

1181
01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:35.367
No!

1182
01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:49.825
Do we have to stay here all night?

1183
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:53.343
Why do they make us turn in our cell phones?

1184
01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.430
Everyone must be freaking out now.

1185
01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:00.893
I'm hungry. Do we have food?

1186
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.465
I found candy.

1187
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.842
- Kang-ho, I'll give you half.
- It's okay.

1188
01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.859
I don't like candy.

1189
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.362
You dislike a lot of things.

1190
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:18.771
It's okay.

1191
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.482
I only need you to like me.

1192
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.123
Okay?

1193
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:26.695
Hey! Think about it.

1194
01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:29.281
You're locked up in this place with a girl.

1195
01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:32.216
All you can do is study?

1196
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:39.431
What about me? Pay some attention to me.

1197
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:49.551
"Perhaps love is as such."

1198
01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:50.844
Love?

1199
01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:53.612
"Like a rain shower, it suffocates me..."

1200
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.866
"from the head and covers me."

1201
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.691
That rain shower is a simile.

1202
01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:07.584
It might be on the exam tomorrow.

1203
01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:15.118
Forget it.

1204
01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:20.097
I'm going to lose weight, become
pretty, and marry into a good family.

1205
01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:22.459
I can do it.

1206
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:24.837
All you do is study.

1207
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.130
Who cares if you get all As?

1208
01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:30.065
You're an F when it comes to social cues.

1209
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:36.905
Hey, what's wrong?

1210
01:04:37.164 --> 01:04:39.283
Are you choking on the candy?

1211
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.692
This isn't good. Come here.

1212
01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.193
Spit it out on three.

1213
01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:49.820
One, two, three.

1214
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.004
One, two, three.

1215
01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:53.699
Again. One, two, three!

1216
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.741
Three! Again.

1217
01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:56.550
One, two, three!

1218
01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:12.050
You jerk!

1219
01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.218
Goodness.

1220
01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.219
Sam-sik.

1221
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.847
Why did you push him so hard?

1222
01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.599
Are you all right?

1223
01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:21.033
How long have you been here?

1224
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.243
Did you miss your supplementary class?

1225
01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.218
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Key Points of "At the End of Cicada's Cry"</font></i>

1226
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.745
I'm sorry for causing trouble at this hour.

1227
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.678
You.

1228
01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:45.599
I was worried sick about you.

1229
01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.669
Goodness, it's all right.

1230
01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.963
It's fine. Nothing bad happened.

1231
01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:53.315
They're both clothed. Nothing happened.

1232
01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.305
Let's go.

1233
01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.238
Get your backpack.

1234
01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:06.703
Let's go. We'll talk at home.

1235
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.082
I...

1236
01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.027
She's so intense.

1237
01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:16.907
How could she worry about the
supplementary class in this situation?

1238
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.368
Goodness, she's a great woman.

1239
01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.829
But why is she so harsh to her son?

1240
01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:25.624
That's why Kang-ho grew up so well.

1241
01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.918
He's never caused any trouble,

1242
01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.463
and he's the top student in the country.

1243
01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.714
Shut up.

1244
01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:34.800
Well, I guess it'll be great...

1245
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:38.261
if he studies hard and goes into law.

1246
01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:40.514
What's so good about that?

1247
01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:45.394
To be frank, people here could live
an honest life even without the law.

1248
01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.604
Not everyone.

1249
01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:49.606
Sam-sik is an exception.

1250
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.665

- What?

1251
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.446
You cursed woman!

1252
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:58.073
- You and your mouth!
- Come on.

1253
01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:00.200
Let's go. It's late. Come with me.

1254
01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:01.994
How could she say that?

1255
01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.121
You darn punk.

1256
01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:07.249
How could you lock up your friends?

1257
01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:10.934
Do you want to be expelled from school?

1258
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.380
I don't care about school,

1259
01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:15.716
but can you cut off my hands?

1260
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.926
What have I done?

1261
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.053
You darn punk.

1262
01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:25.240
Are you trying to disgrace
your mother and father?

1263
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:32.289
You have exams tomorrow,
so I didn't make seaweed soup.

1264
01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.860
I'll make it after the exams.

I came to show support for my boyfriend.

1288
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.345
Oh, my. Did I just say boyfriend?

1289

Stay still, okay?

1293
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.858
I read your horoscope today,

1294
01:08:56.882 --> 01:09:00.669

for the Year of the Dragon.

And you've never been to the movies

- Yes.
- Good.

Why do I ruin my life because of someone else?

1385
01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:53.670
You taught me to live that way!

1386
01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:56.741
You told me to become a powerful man,

1387
01:13:56.765 --> 01:14:00.093

You just wanted to get that power through me.

You...

1393
01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:17.610
wanted to raise me into a selfish
snob just like those who killed Dad.

1395

at the construction site of
Woobyeok Stay in Sua-dong,

1403
01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:46.824
due to the lack of scaffolding
of the exterior railing.

1404
01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:49.687
He worked in the uppermost site,

1405
01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.981
but there was no safety equipment available,

1406
01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:56.334
such as safety belts or nets,
which could've saved his life.

Defendant Park Cheol-su,
the CEO of the subcontractor,

1408

ignored the constant request...

before his school year began,

1414

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.874
<i>didn't only cause damage to the victim's assets,</i>

1420
01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:56.796
<i>but also irrevocable damage,
that is, the death of a laborer.</i>

1421
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.839
<i>Formal adjudication.</i>

1422
01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.717
<i>The defendant is sentenced
to three years in prison.</i>

1423
01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.525
Prosecutor Choi.

1424
01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.485
I have something to say.

1425
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.808
My husband was threatened.

1426
01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:11.603
They pressured him with the
schedule as soon as they began.

1427
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.786
That's why the construction was rushed.

1428
01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:17.900
He demanded more safety nets
and scaffolds again and again,

1429
01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:20.838
but Woobyeok Construction ignored
him, using the cost as an excuse.

1430
01:17:20.862 --> 01:17:23.072
And when the accident happened,

1431
01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:26.257
they pinned the blame on him.

1432
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.140
This is my husband's old phone.

1433
01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:37.643
There's a recording of a call he
had with Woobyeok Construction.

1434
01:17:38.862 --> 01:17:42.717
Why did you bring this important
evidence to me and not to your attorney?

1435
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.344
Because the attorney...

1436
01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:46.486
works for Woobyeok Construction.

1437
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.783
But you can help him.

1438
01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.659
Please.

1439
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.287
Please help him.

1440
01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:06.366
Thank you for plucking
up the courage to do this.

1441
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.284
I'll be in contact.

1442
01:18:08.308 --> 01:18:09.577
Thank you.

1443
01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:11.677
Thank you, Prosecutor Choi.

1444
01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:13.763
Thank you.

1445
01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:30.580

1446
01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:37.662
This is Choi Kang-ho.

1447
01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:41.916
Things have become troublesome.

1448
01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:05.523
There you are, Prosecutor Choi.

1449
01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:09.402
Hello, Chairman Song.

1451
01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.837
{\an8}<i>Do you want to be my son?</i>

1452
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:45.882
<i>Don't you have a father?</i>

1453
01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.217
<i>How's our prosecutor doing?</i>

1454
01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:50.902
<i>- Tell her I'm not home.
- Tell her you're not home?</i>

1455
01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.889
{\an8}<i>I won't apologize.</i>

1456
01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:56.726
{\an8}<i>Someone like you can never call me "Father."</i>

1457
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.687
{\an8}<i>It's more than just that.</i>

1458
01:19:59.711 --> 01:20:02.580
{\an8}<i>Her social status will change.</i>

1459
01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.527
{\an8}<i>This is a true home run.</i>

1460
01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:09.128
{\an8}<i>Isn't this what you wanted?</i>
