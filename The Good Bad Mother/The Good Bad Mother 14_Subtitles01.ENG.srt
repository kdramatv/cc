14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,214
{\an8}I'm surprised to see you.

15
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,633
{\an8}I heard you were badly injured in an accident.

16
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,177
{\an8}I was surprised too.

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,819
{\an8}I thought it was an accident.

18
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,264
{\an8}But it turns out,

19
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,239
{\an8}it wasn't an accident.

20
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,104
{\an8}Just like how your mistress
Hwang Soo-hyun's corpse was discovered.

21
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,314
{\an8}Are you here to...?

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,872
{\an8}No.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,127
{\an8}I wouldn't have bothered to
come here if I was coming after you.

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,907
If a prosecutor were to
leak damaging information,

25
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,382
your opposing party...

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,660
No.

27
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,038
This entire country would be bent...

28
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,956
on taking you down.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,416
Choi Kang-ho.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,184
I'll be straightforward with you.

31
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,838
I only have one goal.

32
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,590
It's to catch...

33
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,400
Chairman Song, the man who
murdered my father and attempted...

34
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,403
to kill my mother and me.

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,311
I want you to testify against him...

36
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,939
regarding all his crimes and corrupt deeds...

37
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,665
you swept under the rug.

38
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,861
Then I won't disclose your crimes.

39
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,279
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,838
Oh Ha-young.

41
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,882
She's with me right now.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,302
Her resentment and hatred
for you seems quite deep.

43
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,847
If you refuse to testify,

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,739
then Ha-young will take the stand instead.

45
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,285
I'm not asking you for a favor.

46
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,454
I'm giving you a chance.

47
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,835
So what will it be?

48
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,074
Will you take down Song Woo-byeok with me,

49
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,451
and become President?

50
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,495
Or will you side with him...

51
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,971
and go to hell together?

52
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,944
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

53
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,174
Goodness, you're working hard night and day.

54
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,969
Is our food here yet?

55
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,846
<i><font color="#ffff00">Hotel Captain</font></i>

56
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,115
Why did you put it back here?

57
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,563
- What are you doing?
- My gosh, you startled me!

58
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,024
What are you doing to our food?

59
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,066
Give it to me!

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,611
I was just curious about...

61
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,447
what people at the Prosecutors'
Office have for a meal.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,424
But I guess they're no different from us.

63
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,286
Don't tell me...

64
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,122
you spiked our food.

65
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,582
Hey.

66
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,044
Do you think it's that easy to get drugs?

67
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,880
I'd rather spend that money
on buying myself supplements.

68
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,424
I haven't slept well since you guys arrived.

69
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,134
Look at how haggard I am.

70
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,886
Can you tell?

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,930
You should just quit drinking.

72
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,655
Sam-sik.

73
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,531
By the way,

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,854
is this what people call an office romance?

75
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,580
What are you talking about? What romance?

76
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,378
The prosecutor and his investigation officer.

77
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,925
They're on fire!

78
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,373
Why are you crying?

79
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:37,253
Next, tell me what you and your dad
talked about on the day of the accident.

80
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,713
I'm not sure about this.

81
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,465
What? What do you mean?

82
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,400
Even if I claim he made me do it,

83
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,860
I have no evidence.

84
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,655
Then I'll end up taking all the blame.

85
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,479
I know I should pay for what I've done.

86
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,622
But I'm afraid I may not be of any help...

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,375
to Kang-ho.

88
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,781
You're already helping him greatly...

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,215
by doing this.

90
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,287
He said he'll find evidence,

91
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,303
so let's trust him and wait.

92
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,972
<i>Song Woo-byeok has ties with
the prosecution and the court.</i>

93
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,698
<i>So it won't be easy to get a warrant.</i>

94
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,869
If you attack him without being fully prepared,

95
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,164
he'll catch on to your plan.

96
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,833
<i>And that'll put everyone in danger.</i>

97
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,362
When will you return from the U.S.?

98
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,573
If I could,

99
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,743
I'd love to stay and watch the
World Series before coming back.

100
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,872
Are you saying you'll neglect
the Woobyeok Beasts this season?

101
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,430
You're right.

102
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,101
I must be getting senile.

103
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,554
My goodness.

104
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,447
What a killer view.

105
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,618
I get to see this thanks to you.

106
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,913
By the way,

107
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,582
why are you here alone?

108
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,834
Did you have to do that?

109
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,004
I devoted my entire life...

110
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,783
to serving you, sir.

111
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,425
Did you really have to try to kill me?

112
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,344
What are you...?

113
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,002
Are you crying?

114
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,339
A grown man crying is embarrassing.

115
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,273
Sir, we should get going.

116
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,056
Hey.

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,642
If you made it out alive,

118
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,395
you should've fled to
another country to survive.

119
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,358
Why would you come back here
and drive a nail into your coffin?

120
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,027
In any case, I want to thank you.

121
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,671
When I heard you were still alive,

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,367
I was hesitant about
going on this business trip.

123
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,385
But now I can leave at ease.

124
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,388
Goodbye, then.

125
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,185
You asked why I came alone.

126
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,635
Mr. Cha will hear everything you just said.

127
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,095
One of us...

128
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,931
must stay alive to expose you.

129
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,767
You douchebag!

130
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,644
You were crying all this time,

131
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,604
and you start bargaining with me...

132
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,248
when it's almost time for my flight, you jerk?

133
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,532
What do you want?

134
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,951
Tell me! You'll be dead soon enough.

135
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,245
Do you need a home? Or money?

136
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,415
Do you want me to adopt
you as I did with Kang-ho?

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,058
I had the opportunity to farm thanks to you.

138
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,645
Interestingly enough,
I reaped everything I sowed.

139
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,773
You'll also reap what you've sown.

140
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,802
How dare you?

141
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,054
Die, you douchebag!

142
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,405
- Chairman Song.
- What?

143
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,751
Kang-ho.

144
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,073
You're alive?

145
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,450
My goodness.

146
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,551
I don't care about anything else.

147
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,971
I'm completely fine as long as I have you.

148
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,252
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,269
But I've only just begun.

150
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,730
Song Woo-byeok.

151
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,219
You're under arrest for special assault...

152
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,637
and attempted murder.

153
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,804
What are you doing?

154
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,723
You have the right to remain silent.

155
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,935
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

156
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,228
Kang-ho.

157
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,078
Will you be okay?

158
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,830
Please don't skip your meals.

159
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,209
Take him.

160
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,083
<i><font color="#ffa07a">So</font></i>

161
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,462
Hello?

162
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,464
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Let me talk to Choi Kang-ho.

163
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,258
Kang-ho?

164
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,300
Kang...

165
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,234
Hold on.

166
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,654
It's for you.

167
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,685
- Hello?
- <i>Choi Kang-ho.</i>

168
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,285
Run away.

169
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,480
It'll be difficult to obtain
an arrest warrant...

170
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,315
for Chairman Song's past crimes.

171
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,250
That only leaves us with one option.

172
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,238
We need to catch him red-handed.

173
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,825
But I heard he'll be going
on a business trip to the U.S.

174
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,159
When is that?

175
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,869
Here's the plan.

176
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,998
Once I get to the rooftop, I'd
like for you all to accompany me,

177
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,675
and carry out a search-and-seizure
of Woobyeok Group. Got it?

178
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,876
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,769
Now that he's back, I'm motivated to work hard.

180
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,266
Recently a victim claimed to
have received death threats...

181
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,290
from Chairman Song Woo-byeok, and
thus we conducted an investigation.

182
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:28,478
And yesterday at 2 p.m.,

183
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,063
we arrested him at the scene...

184
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,316
at Woobyeok Group's headquarters,

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,876
after he assaulted again and
attempted to murder the victim.

186
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,115
Since the suspect attempted
to destroy the victim's phone...

187
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,826
and was due to fly out to the U.S.,

188
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,996
we deemed it likely that he might
try to destroy evidence and flee.

189
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,332
<i>How will you carry out this investigation?</i>

190
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,000
- Sir.
- <i>A civil servant...</i>

191
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,545
<i>must be impartial when serving the country.</i>

192
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,049
<i>As per the Prosecutor General's
words to carry out fair investigations,</i>

193
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,176
<i>even against the powerful,</i>

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,680
we'll carry out an honest,
transparent, and thorough investigation.

195
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:08,075
- What's the victim's current state?
- Did the suspect admit to the charges?

196
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,362
Sir.

197
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,712
It's me, Oh Tae-soo.

198
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,785
Young-soon, hurry up. It's starting.

199
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,510
Coming.

200
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,875
♫ <i>When did you enter my heart</i> ♫

201
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,002
♫ <i>and make me fall in love?</i> ♫

202
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,670
Come on.

203
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,298
- <i>You're...</i>
- My babies.

204
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,357
I brought you some snacks.

205
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,053
Sweet potatoes again.

206
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,055
You don't like sweet potatoes?

207
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,932
Do you want mung bean pancakes?

208
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,810
- That's enough.
- Come here.

209
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,478
Can we please just watch?

210
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,148
Is that the song that Mr. Baek wrote?

211
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,483
That's right.

212
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:01,336
Apparently the song is very popular
now. What was the title again?

213
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,535
- "Intrusion into My Heart."
- That's right.

214
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,662
- Come here.
- Goodness.

215
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,205
How nice!

216
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,374
You're blocking the TV.

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,000
This is great!

218
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,211
Let us watch the TV.

219
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,894
Hold on.

220
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,882
Move aside! You're blocking the TV.

221
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,384
- What?
- What is it?

222
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,302
- What is that?
- What is that?

223
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,055
Song Woo-byeok from Woobyeok Group was arrested?

224
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,348
What?

225
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,286
<i>Chairman Song has allegedly engaged
in assault and death threats...</i>

226
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,602
{\an8}<i>prior to this incident.</i>

227
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,690
{\an8}<i>People are in an uproar after learning
that there have been many victims.</i>

228
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,280
<i>Recently a victim claimed to
have received death threats...</i>

229
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:42,304
{\an8}<i>from Chairman Song Woo-byeok,
and thus we conducted an investigation.</i>

230
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,212
What am I looking at?

231
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,214
Is that Kang-ho?

232
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,302
Can you slap me?

233
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,667
It's him.

234
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,211
It hurts, so that must be Kang-ho.

235
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,687
It hurts, so that's Kang-ho!

236
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,132
Our son...

237
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,009
Kang-ho is back!

238
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,552
Kang-ho!

239
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,554
That's Sam-sik's best friend,

240
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,265
Kang-ho!

241
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,892
What is this?

242
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,826
Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,162
You didn't trust me?

244
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,191
Answer me!

245
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,317
We're in-laws!

246
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,152
- What?
- What?

247
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,154
- "In-laws"?
- With who?

248
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,421
With me!

249
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,258
Right, Mother?

250
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,955
How about...

251
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,625
we all visit Seoul together?

252
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,544
- Sure!
- We must!

253
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,269
Let's go!

254
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,340
Is your seat belt on?

255
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,133
Do you like fish?

256
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,344
Feel free to rest your head on this.

257
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,110
Move.

258
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,723
We could've gone by ourselves.

259
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,225
Why is he here?

260
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,267
Shut it.

261
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,354
If something happens to you
on the way, he'll suspect me.

262
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,688
Easy on the brakes.

263
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,815
I just had them replaced.

264
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,110
I bought this car to drive
to the award ceremony.

265
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,322
It fits five people perfectly.

266
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,782
You're right.

267
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,952
Gum-ja must've become a widow for this very day.

268
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,078
What did you say?

269
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,372
I'll buy a bigger car soon,

270
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,457
so let's go again another time.

271
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,375
That sounds great!

272
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,752
Your son is still considered a suspect.

273
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,353
We still have an eye on him.

274
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,840
I don't want to hear it.

275
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,967
Just keep your eyes on the road.

276
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,775
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,224
<i>Honey.</i>

278
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,283
<i>Are you watching from above?</i>

279
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,452
<i>The day has finally come.</i>

280
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,168
<i>Our son will carry out the judgment...</i>

281
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,548
<i>we failed to do.</i>

282
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,473
<i>Please help him stay strong.</i>

283
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,088
<i>Please help him not to doubt, falter,</i>

284
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,689
<i>or be intimidated.</i>

285
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,817
<i>Let him stay strong.</i>

286
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,496
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Prosecutor</font></i>

287
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,024
<i>Help him look them in the eye...</i>

288
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,942
{\an8}<i>and state the truth.</i>

289
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,736
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Defendant</font></i>

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,253
{\an8}<i>Just like how you did...</i>

291
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,964
<i>in front of them,</i>

292
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,619
<i>please help Kang-ho...</i>

293
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,845
<i>remain confident...</i>

294
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,431
<i>until the end.</i>

295
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,225
All rise.

296
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,856
<i>With sincerity,</i>

297
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,484
<i>resentment,</i>

298
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,904
<i>and desperation...</i>

299
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,240
<i>I pray to you.</i>

300
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,744
You may be seated.

301
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,233
{\an8}Case 133 of the year 2023.

302
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,626
We'll now begin the trial.

303
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,116
The assault that occurred
in Jou-ri on January 20...

304
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,619
was just a simple fight between colleagues...

305
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,371
{\an8}over their pecking order.

306
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,915
{\an8}Soh Ji-seok's claim that
Chairman Song Woo-byeok...

307
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,335
{\an8}ordered an assault to be
carried out is completely false.

308
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,420
{\an8}The recent incident transpired...

309
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,923
{\an8}due to Mr. Soh's attacking Chairman Song.

310
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,800
And the latter...

311
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,734
simply reacted to defend himself.

312
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:40,141
Did you just say that the
victim attacked the defendant?

313
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,617
{\an8}Are you talking about this?

314
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,078
Please play it.

315
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,235
<i>Mr. Cha will hear everything you just said.</i>

316
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,028
{\an8}<i>One of us...</i>

317
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,906
<i>must stay alive to expose you.</i>

318
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,701
- <i>You douchebag!</i>
- What is that?

319
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,703
<i>You were crying all this time,</i>

320
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,788
{\an8}<i>and you start bargaining with me...</i>

321
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,666
<i>when it's almost time for my flight, jerk?</i>

322
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,725
I'll submit this as evidence.

323
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,299
{\an8}I'd like to question the victim who's
also the witness to that incident.

324
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:18,138
After the assault in Jou-ri, you
came to me for help and claimed...

325
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,100
that the defendant was trying
to murder you. Is this correct?

326
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,018
Yes.

327
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,854
Why did he want to kill you?

328
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,733
Because as his trusted secretary,

329
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,902
I had a great deal of
information about his actions.

330
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,281
{\an8}The defendant spent about 30 years as the CEO...

331
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,075
of Yongra Construction and Woobyeok Group.

332
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,328
He must've had many employees
who worked closely with him,

333
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,041
and they must've known a
lot of private information too.

334
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,933
Are you telling me they're all dead?

335
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,814
Yes.

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,343
Objection, Your Honor.

337
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,139
- It hasn't been verified...
- Right, so I verified his claim.

338
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,640
In the past 30 years,

339
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,060
the defendant had four other secretaries...

340
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,103
who worked closely with him.

341
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,523
Two committed suicide
and one died in a car crash.

342
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:15,084
And the last secretary's body was
recently found near Jemyeon Island.

343
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,031
It was Hwang Soo-hyun.

344
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,284
{\an8}Your Honor, the prosecution is
referring to a case that's irrelevant to...

345
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,079
I'm verifying the witness' statement.

346
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,137
How is that irrelevant?

347
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,932
Prosecution.

348
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,850
You may continue.

349
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,895
That's right.

350
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,216
This USB was found at the defendant's office...

351
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,067
during a search-and-seizure.

352
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,012
Do you know what it contains?

353
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,390
It contains confidential documents
related to Woobyeok's corrupt deeds,

354
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,603
Chairman Song's double bookkeeping,
breach of trust, and embezzlement.

355
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,647
It belonged to Hwang Soo-hyun.

356
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,357
What's he talking about?

357
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,082
Hwang Soo-hyun?

358
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,362
Could you explain this video...

359
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,657
found on your secretary's laptop?

360
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,298
Please play it.

361
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,119
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

362
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,555
<i>I already know the hit-and-run accident
and suicide were in the contract.</i>

363
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,879
A year ago, Chairman Song ordered
me to visit Yang Gu-man's wife,

364
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,589
and retrieve his money.

365
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,690
Gosh.

366
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,469
All right. Then I'd like to ask the defendant.

367
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,388
According to the investigation,

368
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,266
Hwang Soo-hyun was last seen before her death...

369
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,741
on October 3, 2021.

370
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,147
It's the same day the last
video on this USB was saved.

371
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,206
So why was this USB found in your desk?

372
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,322
Look.

373
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,409
How would I know anything
about the USB or that Mr. Yang,

374
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,620
when he's the one who schemed everything?

375
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,583
So you're claiming that the
victim schemed everything himself,

376
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,628
and you never murdered or abetted murder?

377
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,671
Correct.

378
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,646
That's a lie!

379
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,567
He also ordered me to kill people.

380
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,265
He ordered you to kill people?

381
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,600
Who were they?

382
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,728
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant
in the murder case...

383
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,938
that Chairman Song's grandson was involved in,

384
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:18,791
and Park Cheol-su, the defendant in
the Woobyeok construction site case.

385
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,904
So did you carry out your orders?

386
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,573
They were both incarcerated,

387
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,632
so I couldn't.

388
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:32,624
I found a few odd things
during this investigation.

389
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,307
It's the fact that...

390
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,213
not only the defendant's
secretaries, but also many of those...

391
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,216
who raised suspicions about
the defendant or his company,

392
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,302
or were involved in the trials,

393
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,139
suddenly passed away or disappeared.

394
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,060
Objection, Your Honor. The
prosecution is distorting the truth...

395
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,811
solely based on the victim's claims.

396
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,039
Then let me summon another
witness who can verify this.

397
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,917
Approved.

398
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,961
Witness, Mr. Oh Tae-soo,

399
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,811
please come forward.

400
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,591
Oh Tae-soo?

401
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,608
Oh Tae-soo?

402
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,155
What is this?

403
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,589
Why is he testifying?

404
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,456
"I pledge this."

405
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,044
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,"

406
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,504
"and agree to be punished..."

407
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,094
"in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

408
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:06,486
"Witness, Oh Tae-soo."

409
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,428
If Song Woo-byeok is arrested,

410
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,280
Bareun Hanguk Party, the political and
business worlds, and even the media...

411
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,074
will find fault with you.

412
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,562
Because everyone knows about...

413
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,580
your secret ties with him
and how far they go back.

414
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,543
But what if...

415
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,546
you testify against him?

416
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,718
It'd be a perfect chance to
dispel all the suspicions...

417
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:38,124
regarding the relationship between you and him.

418
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,878
{\an8}You have indicted Chairman Song many times...

419
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,255
for 30 years since 1987.

420
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,632
- Is this true?
- Correct.

421
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,427
However, most of these
indictments were dismissed.

422
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,972
The majority of these cases,
13 in total, were dismissed...

423
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,490
due to the victims' deaths.

424
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,018
{\an8}That's correct.

425
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,187
Did you ever find the repeated deaths...

426
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,705
of the plaintiffs or victims rather odd?

427
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,904
{\an8}There was no issue in the
investigation of their deaths,

428
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,074
and the bereaved families
didn't raise any suspicion.

429
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,008
So I didn't find them particularly odd.

430
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,706
However, I found something odd...

431
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,974
in this trial.

432
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,587
It's the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

433
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,188
his secretary.

434
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,718
{\an8}She worked as my secretary...

435
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,971
{\an8}from 2018 to 2020.

436
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,890
Then one day in 2020,

437
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,617
she told me she wanted to quit.

438
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,536
The reason being...

439
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,915
that getting pregnant
had put her life in danger.

440
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,116
Her pregnancy had put her life in danger?

441
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,715
Correct.

442
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,135
{\an8}She said Chairman Song was the father.

443
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,088
If you do this,

444
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,881
all the disgusting work...

445
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:13,302
I forced myself to put up with will go to waste.

446
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,347
I was even willing to serve time in jail...

447
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,058
to make you become President,

448
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,685
you douchebag!

449
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,353
Defendant, please sit down!

450
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,480
How is that baby mine?

451
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,650
Like killing that poor baby wasn't enough,

452
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,028
{\an8}are you trying to turn him into a jerk now?

453
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,530
{\an8}You even plotted...

454
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,866
to kill Choi Kang-ho with your daughter!

455
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,826
- You douchebag!
- Defendant!

456
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,198
- How dare you utter such nonsense?
- Please calm down!

457
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:42,096
You douchebag! I'm not going down.

458
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,793
<i>No, not yet, Honey.</i>

459
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,338
<i>If I waver right now, our son will waver too.</i>

460
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,341
<i>Everything he's done up to now will be ruined.</i>

461
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,218
<i>Please, Honey.</i>

462
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,387
<i>Keep me here for a little longer.</i>

463
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,181
<i>Please...</i>

464
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,849
<i>Just a little longer.</i>

465
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,850
Sit down!

466
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,811
- Sir. Please.
- I ought to kill you.

467
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,411
Darn it!

468
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,878
It's true.

469
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,673
I slipped...

470
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,344
{\an8}Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho sleeping pills.

471
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,052
{\an8}We'll accept the prosecutor's request.

472
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,805
{\an8}We believe verifying the facts
is of the utmost importance.

473
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,658
You may cross-examine the two witnesses.

474
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,649
{\an8}I was deceived into believing that
Prosecutor Choi, my then fiancée,

475
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,958
had another woman and a baby.

476
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,862
And that he even killed them...

477
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,254
so he could marry me.

478
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,534
Who told you that?

479
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,911
It was my father,

480
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,095
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo.

481
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,936
It's all my fault.

482
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,566
I've been threatened by Chairman Song
ever since I decided to run for President.

483
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,737
He wanted me to protect his corrupt company...

484
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,782
and himself.

485
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,354
When I refused, he attempted
to use my daughter...

486
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,080
to get rid of Prosecutor Choi.

487
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,694
Why did Chairman Song want me dead?

488
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,879
That's because 35 years ago, Chairman Song...

489
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,259
murdered Prosecutor Choi's father.

490
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,637
Is that true?

491
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,502
Simply put,

492
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,256
there were two people Chairman
Song needed to get rid of.

493
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,841
Hwang Soo-hyun, his mistress,

494
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,443
and Choi Kang-ho, Choi Hae-sik's son.

495
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,388
That's why he killed her,

496
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,682
and framed Prosecutor Choi for it.

497
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,686
And after that, he ordered my
daughter to kill Prosecutor Choi.

498
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,786
Stop lying.

499
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,543
It was you who wanted him dead.

500
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,699
It was also you who killed
Hwang Soo-hyun and her baby.

501
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,967
They were your mistress and son.

502
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,098
I saw the DNA test result...

503
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,809
with my own eyes.

504
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,282
This is my daughter's medical
record from the mental hospital.

505
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,452
That's right.

506
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,164
My daughter isn't sane.

507
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,416
I've been hiding it...

508
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,238
in fear that my dear daughter would
be caught in political mudslinging.

509
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,048
Dad!

510
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,015
Dad.

511
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,937
What happened to you?

512
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,857
Who made you like this?

513
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,430
Dad.

514
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,265
It's me.

515
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,533
It's me, Ha-young.

516
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,079
I'm Oh Ha-young, your beloved daughter.

517
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,415
I'm so scared right now.

518
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,549
I'm in so much pain.

519
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,097
Dad.

520
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,142
Can you please stop here?

521
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,129
I beg you.

522
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,021
Please come back, Dad.

523
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,566
Please?

524
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,651
Let's stop here.

525
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,319
Please?

526
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,079
Please consider that she qualifies
as an individual with a mental disorder,

527
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,667
as per Article 10, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

528
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,888
{\an8}There's another reason...

529
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,182
{\an8}I helped my father.

530
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,018
It was because...

531
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,008
my father schemed with Chairman Song...

532
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,776
and murdered Choi Hae-sik,
Choi Kang-ho's father, 35 years ago.

533
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,201
Unbelievable.

534
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,496
At that time,

535
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,040
he bribed the detective in charge...

536
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,168
and fabricated the marks on the victim's body.

537
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,407
I believe my daughter is
very unstable right now.

538
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,785
I request that you adjourn this trial.

539
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,385
Witness, please sit down.

540
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,514
The court will decide whether to adjourn.

541
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,343
Taking their testimonies into consideration,

542
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,345
I believe the answer to this case...

543
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,139
lies in the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

544
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,600
Chairman Song's former secretary.

545
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,312
Witness Oh Tae-soo claims
the defendant, Chairman Song,

546
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,564
murdered Hwang Soo-hyun.

547
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,568
But Song Woo-byeok and Oh Ha-young
claim that Oh Tae-soo killed her.

548
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,569
In addition,

549
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,531
the police consider me,
Choi Kang-ho, as a key suspect.

550
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,325
And it's most likely...

551
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,677
that the baby's father killed her.

552
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,096
Then there's only one solution.

553
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,933
We'll see if the baby's DNA...

554
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,812
matches any of ours.

555
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,883
What's he saying?

556
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,567
Prosecution.

557
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,279
You're not allowed to summon any more witnesses.

558
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,716
<i>The baby...</i>

559
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,052
is alive.

560
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,114
Choi Kang-ho.

561
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,771
You said you'd rather be...

562
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,039
Taesocrates dissatisfied
rather than a pig satisfied.

563
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,416
But you're wrong.

564
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,196
No matter how hungry a mother pig is,

565
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,341
she wouldn't move recklessly
so as not to harm her piglets.

566
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,622
Someone like you who used
his child as a murder weapon,

567
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,348
and heartlessly attempted to kill them,

568
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,351
could never fathom such parental love.

569
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,718
Prosecutor Choi...

570
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,612
is trying to taint my reputation
before the presidential election.

571
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:20,557
This is a political maneuver and slander.

572
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,894
I'll find out who's behind this
and hold them responsible.

573
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,145
Please sit down.

574
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,731
- I refuse to testify anymore.
- Witness.

575
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,886
Stop, or I'll consider it an attempt
at destroying evidence and fleeing.

576
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,111
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho!

577
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,877
You jerk.

578
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,255
Oh Tae-soo.

579
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,951
You, and your accomplice Song Woo-byeok,

580
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,386
are under arrest for abetting the
murders of Hwang Soo-hyun and her son,

581
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:46,166
myself and my mother, Jin Young-soon,

582
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,019
and Choi Hae-sik who died in
the 1988 arson case in Bongu-dong.

583
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,232
You have the right to remain silent.

584
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,722
Hurray!

585
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,391
Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

586
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,144
- Hurray for my son!
- Hurray!

587
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,438
- Hurray!
- Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

588
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,939
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

589
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,233
- Quiet down, everyone!
- Hurray!

590
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,360
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

591
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,837
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

592
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,556
<i>Breaking news.</i>

593
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,059
<i>This afternoon, Jeilmirae Party's
Candidate Oh Tae-soo...</i>

594
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,868

of millions of dollars and the embezzlement...</i>

and destroyed evidence.

598
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:59,990
{\an8}<i>And in return, monopolized the
distribution rights for hand sanitizers...</i>

{\an8}<i>This is the CCTV footage of
the culprit in front of the VIP ward.</i>

600
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,956

00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,679
{\an8}and Choi Hae-sik's death.

606
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,907
- Release Assemblyman Oh!
- Release Assemblyman Oh!

607
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,456
They say you shouldn't bark if you can't bite.

608
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
You'll have to resign if
you want to take me down.

609
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,085
So what'll you do?

610
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,045
You're the one who taught me,

611
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,187
"Hit a home run or strikeout."

612
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,799
Now that I've hit a home run,

613
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,775
I'll gladly take a strikeout.

614
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,791
<i><font color="#ffff00">We Believe in You, Assemblyman Oh</font></i>

615
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,418
Excuse me.

616
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,072
Ye-jin.

617
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,117
"Happy" is spelled with a "p."

618
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,301
Turn the "d" letter upright.

619
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,538
Okay? Try it.

620
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,499
- Gosh, they look so happy.
- Here.

621
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,335
- Here, let me.
- All right.

622
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,713
All right.

623
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,840
- You little brat.
- What?

624
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,467
You should've told me
sooner that he'd recovered.

625
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,471
I thought you'd urge me to
marry him if you found out.

626
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,182
What do you mean?

627
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,059
I didn't want to make you look bad.

628
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,186
Goodness.

629
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,937
Hey, did you hear?

630
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,080
Kang-ho and Mi-joo...

631
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,584
You heard?

632
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,794
I watched it.

633
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,699
What do you mean? Watched what?

634
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,133
The JBC drama.

635
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,888
Darn it. Move aside.

636
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,973
Hey.

637
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,629
Sam-sik, let me.

638
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,797
You must be tired from the trial.

639
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,966
You should just rest.

640
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,429
Since Mr. Sam-sik never works,
he can serve the food today.

641
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,808
In other words, he's jobless.

642
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,450
Seo-jin, you...

643
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,649
Sure, laugh while you still can.

644
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,109
Once you find out who Kang-ho really is,

645
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,403
you won't be laughing anymore.

646
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,323
Hey, watch what you say to a kid.

647
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,742
- Sam-sik, why are you idling around?
- Let's go.

648
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,993
What did you say to them?

649
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,495
Goodness.

650
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,330
I don't think I've ever felt...

651
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:59,393
this happy and proud in my life before.

652
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,604
- Prosecutor Choi.
- Yes?

653
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,734
You were absolutely amazing today.

654
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,514
"Oh Tae-soo."

655
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:15,283
"You're under arrest for abetting murder."

656
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,898
Now...

657
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,236
let me introduce the woman who
raised this wonderful prosecutor.

658
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,362
The star of the day!

659
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,572
I bring you...

660
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,408
Ms. Jin Young-soon!

661
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,659
Mom.

662
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,202
- Come on, Mom.
- Gosh.

663
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,871
- Hurray for Jin Young-soon!
- Jin Young-soon!

664
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,724
- My mom!
- Jin Young-soon!

665
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,460
Gosh.

666
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,103
You're embarrassing me.

667
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,692
It's already been 35 years...

668
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,488
since I moved here with
a single pig on my truck.

669
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,702
I had no money or knowledge.

670
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,064
I was just...

671
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:05,167
an unwelcome pregnant woman
who suddenly barged in here.

672
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,462
But you all welcomed me with open arms.

673
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,365
No, we didn't.

674
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,744
We hated the stinky pig
smell and protested your move.

675
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,413
You even carried Sam-sik on your back.

676
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,513
It's true.

677
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,792
You're right.

678
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,253
<i>You barged into my home...</i>

679
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,298
<i>wielding farm tools.</i>

680
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,149
Then I suddenly went into labor.

681
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,844
And you helped me deliver Kang-ho.

682
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,554
Me too.

683
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,597
That's right.

684
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,782
- You were born in that room.
- Yes, Mi-joo too.

685
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,162
Just like how we can't
predict when we'll be born,

686
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,999
we can't predict when we'll die either.

687
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,947
I'd like to thank you all...

688
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,091
while I still have a healthy mind.

689
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,870
People might say...

690
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,348
I'm the most unfortunate woman.

691
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,685
I lost both my husband and my parents.

692
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,315
And then my son was seriously injured,
and I have an incurable illness.

693
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:14,319
I doubt there's anyone
who's more unlucky than me.

694
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,907
But you know what?

695
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:26,331
Life is so fascinating and makes you grateful.

696
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,252
When it takes one thing from you,

697
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,631
it always replaces it with something else.

698
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,454
Losing my parents...

699
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,389
taught me to value my husband.

700
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:47,185
And losing my husband taught me to value my son.

701
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,938
And when my son was unwell,

702
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,592
I learned to value myself...

703
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,610
so I could take care of him.

704
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,947
And because my life was cut short,

705
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,034
I learned to value everyone here,

706
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,705
who'll be in his life in my stead.

707
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,626
Not many people are lucky enough...

708
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,590
to encounter all these
blessings in their lifetime.

709
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,927
I'm truly blessed...

710
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,683
for being able to live this precious life.

711
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,854
Mr. Son.

712
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,064
Yes?

713
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,692
Mr. Bang.

714
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,490
And Sung-ae and Gum-ja.

715
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,539
Thanks to you,

716
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,917
I've never felt lonely,

717
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,169
and lived...

718
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,172
such a chaotic, happy life.

719
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,871
Later...

720
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,096
Much later in life,

721
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,668
when you move into the neighborhood up there,

722
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,629
I'll be the one...

723
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,216
hurrying out and welcoming you with open arms.

724
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,425
Gosh.

725
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,885
Goodness.

726
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,345
Please.

727
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,804
Until then,

728
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,697
I pray you'll be healthy...

729
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,810
for a very long time.

730
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,395
All right.

731
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,940
You'd better welcome us with open arms.

732
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,082
Sing for us too.

733
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,445
Gosh, I'm embarrassing myself.

734
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,572
One, two, three, four.

All right, hop on.

743
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,783
I'll make rounds for getting
into college, passing the bar exam,

744
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,159
and becoming a prosecutor.

745
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,828
- Goodness.
- Yes, Kang-ho!

746
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,720
- Come on.
- You're awesome!

747
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,335
- Oh, no!
- Gosh!

748
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,920
- Gosh!
- Oh, my!

749
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,172
- Goodness.
- You're still very healthy, Mom.

750
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,382
Do it again.

751
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,634
- You should lose some weight.
- Carry me again.

752
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,719
All right. Here.

753
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,153
- All right.
- Let's do it again.

754
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,573
{\an8}This is for getting into college!

755
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,833
Here.

756
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,548
This was the very first ring
your father-in-law got me.

757
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,595
And here.

758
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,725
This was the very first ring I got your dad.

759
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:21,149
People say to love like it's your first time.

760
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,927
But...

761
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,571
I'd like you to love like it's your last time.

762
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:32,118
"These are the last words
they're going to hear from me."

763
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,397
"This is the last image of me..."

764
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,457
"they'll remember."

765
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,363
That mindset will make you
think twice about how you speak...

766
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,214
and act towards each other.

767
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,219
Just like how...

768
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,166
I still remember your
dad's last words to this day.

769
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,601
What were his last words?

770
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,857
"See you later."

771
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,847
He hated saying bye because it implied an end.

772
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,075
That's why he always said,
"See you later," instead.

773
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,619
"See you later."

774
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,955
"See you later."

775
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:22,001
Saying it over and over gave me butterflies,

776
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,464
because it really felt like
we were going to meet again.

777
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,086
Think of each other as gems
and treat one another preciously.

778
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,214
Take good care and love each other.

779
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,050
And live a happy life.

780
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,718
- Okay?
- Okay.

781
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,610
Okay.

782
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:54,102
Come to think of it, both of you were born...

783
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,898
in that room on the same day and time.

784
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,498
Right?

785
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:06,045
Mi-joo, your grandma once said this.

786
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,908
"We say it's meant to be..."

787
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,869
<i>We say it's meant to be...</i>

788
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,262
to someone we meet for the first time.

789
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,624
But fate is...

790
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:22,353
what we say to someone who
stays with us until the end.

791
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,984
Don't you think our kids were
fated to end up with each other?

792
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,566
What?

793
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,375
Why are you here?

794
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,571
Are you going to sleep here?

795
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,463
Of course.

796
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,008
I'm going to sleep next
to you until I get married.

797
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,369
Goodness.

798
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,206
I should start looking for a venue tomorrow.

799
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,373
What?

800
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,542
Do you hate it that much?

801
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,310
It's gross. You're a grown man.

802
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,772
It's not like you're Seo-jin or Ye-jin.

803
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:10,053
Seo-jin's eyes and lips remind me of you...

804
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,737
when you were his age.

805
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,308
And Ye-jin...

806
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,243
is excellent at drawing.

807
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,664
They're definitely your kids.

808
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,987
Whatever. I'm going to sleep with you.

809
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,781
- Lie down.
- Gosh, what are you doing?

810
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,492
Just lie down. Let's sleep side by side.

811
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,785
All right.

812
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,052
- Goodness.
- Here.

813
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,916
There.

814
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,641
All right.

815
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,088
Are you tired?

816
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,589
Yes.

817
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,274
I'm a bit tired.

818
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,886
It's been...

819
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,196
a long journey.

820
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,991
Right?

821
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,526
All right. Let me massage your legs.

822
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,501
Goodness.

823
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,503
That's okay.

824
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,173
Lie down.

825
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,661
Sing me a lullaby.

826
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,013
- What?
- That song.

827
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,002
The song you sang for me...

828
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,353
after our first date.

829
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,607
I want to fall asleep to that song.

830
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,739

You released another new song?

907

"The Lovely Gumja Tower"? Get out.

908
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,309
I told you not to name your songs so obviously.

When will you be visiting again?

911
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,946
Visit at dawn.

912
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,241

913
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,984

What is it? Is something missing again?

921
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,341
He stole my brand-new cashmere longjohns, socks,

922
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,052
and underwear!

923
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,764
What could he possibly use them for?

924
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,850
I'm speaking from experience.

925
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,743
Goods from outside are much better.

926

These are...

927
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,818
cashmere longjohns, so
they're extremely light...

928
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,361
and warm.

929
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,615
And these socks are from a famous brand.

930
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,786
You'll look awfully stylish if you wear these...

931
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,038
under that cobalt uniform.

932
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,347

933
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,501
Would they be too big for you?

934
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,144
My mom does have a big rear end.

935
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,357
Thank you.

936
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,028
Gosh, don't mention it.

937

is that we're meant to be.

Meant to be.

943
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,713
Do you need anything else?

944
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,075
Do you need sesame oil?

945
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,633
Red chili powder?

946
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,164

but they were so delicious.

999

So we've been accepting them all this time.

It's the bank book you gave me.

I wanted to throw this at
your face the next time we met,

what photo to hang next to it.

it'd be nice to hang
something similar to this one.

<i>The connections we build with
others are just as difficult...</i>

1064
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,531
<i>as leading a pig with a thread.</i>

1065
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:27,998
<i>We were connected as mother and son.</i>

1066
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,528
<i>It's such a precious bond,</i>

1067
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,297
<i>so I wanted to become the best mom for you.</i>

1068
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,784
<i>But you only get one life,</i>

1069
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,370
<i>and it was my first time being a mom,</i>

1070
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:44,848
<i>so I'm sorry I wasn't good enough.</i>

1071
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,686
<i>I made a wish before blowing
out my birthday candles.</i>

1072
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:54,900
<i>I prayed that I'd become your mom once again.</i>

1073
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,513
<i>If that ever happens,</i>

1074
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,281
<i>I promise to be a better mom.</i>

1075
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:10,040
<i>I won't tell you not to be
sad about not having a dad.</i>

1076
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:14,628
<i>I won't say that your grades
are all that matters in life.</i>

1077
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:20,008
<i>I won't ignore your talent for drawing.</i>

1078
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,706
<i>I won't turn away...</i>

1079
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,224
<i>when I know you want to eat more.</i>

1080
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,212
<i>I won't hold back my tears...</i>

1081
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,979
<i>when I see you in pain.</i>

1082
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,343
<i>I'll help you get up when you fall.</i>

1083
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,777
<i>I'll embrace you when you're afraid.</i>

1084
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,349
<i>I'll say, "Good job,"</i>

1085
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,116
<i>"thank you,"</i>

1086
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,535
<i>and "I love you,"</i>

1087
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,246
<i>every single day.</i>

1088
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,651
<i>And I won't...</i>

1089
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,544
<i>leave you so soon.</i>

1090
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,172
<i>I love you, my son.</i>

1091
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,121
<i>I hope you live a long, happy life...</i>

1092
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:07,431
<i>with Mi-joo, Seo-jin, and Ye-jin.</i>

1093
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,101
<i>And we'll meet again...</i>

1094
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,271
<i>on the day my prayer is answered.</i>

1095
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,649
<i>From your bad mother.</i>

1096
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,303
Today...

1097
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,682
is the day I propose to Mi-joo...

1098
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,144
to ask her to live a long
and happy life with me.

1099
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,689
But you ruined everything.

1100
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,407
Please watch over me...

1101
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,035
so I won't be too nervous.

1102
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,871
No.

1103
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,583
Protect us.

1104
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,676
Lee Mi-joo!

1105
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,749
You're under arrest for becoming my wife!

1106
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,169
You don't have the right to remain silent.

1107
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,463
You can't ask your mother
for help when we argue.

1108
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,839
How childish.

1109
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,383
This isn't a proposal.

1110
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,859
- Why not?
- What you just said...

1111
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,930
might be used against you later in life.

1112
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,947
So watch out, okay?

1113
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:49,976
- This won't do.
- What?

1114
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,187
All right. I need your help.

1115
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,912
- What?
- All right.

1116
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:58,777
Lee Mi-joo!

1117
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,821
I saved your life three times.

1118
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,739
So even if I get so annoying,

1119
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,241
even if we argue,

1120
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,300
and even if I get downright childish,

1121
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:12,514
promise to live with me
happily the rest of our lives.

1122
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,506
All right, go ahead.

1123
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,882
- Come here.
- Go to mommy.

1124
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,359
- No!
- Oh, no!

1125
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,261
- Kang-ho! Hang on, I...
- We have to look good.

1126
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,723
Come on, think of our age.

1127
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,059

1130

{\an8}I don't even eat marinated crab,

1131
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,670
{\an8}because it's so good I'd steal to eat them!

1132
01:10:23,694 --> 01:10:24,912
{\an8}I hate stray cats even more.

1133
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:26,698
{\an8}They're like little thieves.

1134
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,242
{\an8}Do you know how shocked I was...

1135
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,578
{\an8}when "The Thieves" was released?

1136
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:34,012
{\an8}Hey!
