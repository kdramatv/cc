{\an8}This year's kimchi will be delicious.

14
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,289
{\an8}Of course.

15
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:08,669
{\an8}It's due to these fully-ripened red chilies.

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,255
{\an8}We couldn't sun-dry the chilies last year...

17
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,631
{\an8}because of all the rain.

18
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,092
{\an8}I'm glad the weather's nice this year.

19
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,844
{\an8}Hello.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,387
{\an8}You're here.

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,906
{\an8}Oh, my. Look at the color
of the red chili powder.

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,603
Wait.

23
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,063
That's her, right?

24
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,122
You're right.

25
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,571
Grandma!

26
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,573
That lady who came with Kang-ho last time...

27
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,866
is getting married.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,367
- What?
- What?

29
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,453
- Oh, my.
- What are you talking about?

30
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,871
What?

31
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,164
- What?
- Let me see.

32
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,958
- What?
- Oh, my. She's right.

33
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:52,129
So she was Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

34
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,923
Does that mean Kang-ho...

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,217
almost became the President's son-in-law?

36
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,468
- Goodness.
- My goodness.

37
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,236
That's not what's important right now.

38
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,473
Goodness, that cursed brat.

39
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,183
It hasn't been that long
since Kang-ho's accident,

40
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,947
and she's already marrying someone else?

41
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,480
If it were the son of Dosang Group,
I'd get married in an instant too.

42
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,483
Don't say something like
that in front of your husband.

43
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,110
Knock on wood right now.

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,048
- Knock, knock, knock.
- Knock, knock, knock.

45
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:18,405
Young-soon's already so stressed out.

46
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,908
She'll be really upset when she finds out.

47
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,034
What are you saying?

48
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,912
We can never let her find out, okay?

49
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,581
- Make sure you all keep it a secret!
- Okay.

50
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,749
I already know.

51
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,084
- What?
- Goodness!

52
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,670
Everyone has the right to live their own life.

53
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,297
{\an8}She's right. The living have to go on living.

<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

55
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,507
{\an8}That's enough.

56
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,151
Mr. Bang, may I speak with you?

57
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,945
Me?

58
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,057
- Push it in until it clicks.
- Yes.

59
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,143
- Then you'll see this window.
- Right.

60
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,853
Put the cursor right here.

61
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,896
- Do you see the cursor?
- Yes.

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,690
Click twice quickly,

63
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,693
then you can see it like this.

64
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,444
Thank you so much.

65
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,780
It wasn't anything.

66
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,409
If you have any further questions,

67
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,161
- call me anytime.
- Okay.

68
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,038
Kang-ho, I'll be going now.

69
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,498
Okay. Thank you.

70
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,167
- My goodness.
- My back.

71
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,878
All right.

72
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,172
Click here twice, right?

73
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,799
Click-click.

74
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,634
What's this?

75
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,594
Password.

76
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,929
- Password.
- Password.

77
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,114
Password. 0907, my birthday.

78
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,325
That's for our bank account.

79
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,704
But you never know.

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,612
Zero, nine, zero, seven.

81
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,821
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Enter Password</font></i>

82
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,798
Of course. It wouldn't be this easy.

83
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,535
What could it be?

84
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,537
What could it be, Kang-ho?

85
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,914
Any numbers you remember?

86
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,332
Numbers?

87
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,641
Numbers...

88
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,354
Numbers...

89
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,762
- Mom.
- Yes?

90
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,279
Isn't your birthday on March 12?

91
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,017
Oh, my.

92
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,534
Do you remember my birthday?

93
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,439
Mom, this is weird.

94
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,733
This was written on September 7,

95
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,277
but it says I'll see you
next week on your birthday.

96
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,086
You're right.

97
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,742
"I'll see you next week on your
birthday." Could this mean...?

98
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,592
Zero, three, one, two.

99
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,478
- It's correct!
- We did it, Mom!

100
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,315
You're so smart. How did you catch that?

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,278
All right. Let's see what's in here.

102
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,643
Kang-ho,

103
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,994
this looks like your journal.

104
00:04:55,753 --> 00:05:00,040
"March 3, 2008."

105
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,404
<i><font color="#ffa07a">March 3, 2008

<i><font color="#ffff00">Welcome, Freshmen of 2008

107
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,175
<i>I finally got into SNU School of Law.</i>

108
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,680
Choi Kang-ho, the top student
in this year's entering class.

109
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,061
Tell us why you chose law school.

110
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,345
Korea is a constitutional state
that protects liberal democracy.

111
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,472
Law is meant to provide public welfare...

112
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,642
for the happiness and benefit of the majority,

113
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,118
as well as justice for all...

114
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,375
As well as justice for all...

115
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,489
For what reason did your dad die?

116
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,090
I need to know that!

117
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,054
Actually,

118
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,557
I wanted to find out for myself.

119
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,127
What?

120
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,171
I want to find out the reason...

121
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,189
I had to attend law school.

122
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,719
That's why I'm here.

123
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,845
Kang-ho!

124
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,638
<i><font color="#ffff00">Detective Unit 1</font></i>

125
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,530
Kang-ho.

126
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,683
What...?

127
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,742
What happened to you?

128
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,729
What happened to my son?

129
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,607
They got into an argument over grades at school,

130
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,526
and Mr. Choi initiated a physical altercation,

131
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,780
so he'll be booked on charges
unless they can reach a settlement.

132
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,546
Settlement?

133
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,715
I don't want to settle.

134
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,620
He didn't attend class, take
tests, or complete homework,

135
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,079
yet he's at the top of our class.

136
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:39,249
How could they fabricate his
grades and award him a scholarship,

137
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,043
just because his mother's a judge?

138
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,769
- And at a law school at that.
- Darn it.

139
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,131
I'd like to add defamation...

140
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,316
and dissemination of false information.

141
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,221
No, wait.

142
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,724
Let me apologize on his behalf.

144
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,476
He's always earned scholarships...

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,394
to help out his mom who's a pig farmer,

146
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,462
and was probably disappointed to
not come out as the top of the class.

147
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:03,065
Please.

148
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,873
Darn it.

149
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,378
Darn, I was wondering what that smell was.

150
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,090
If it seemed so unfair, why didn't
you major in livestock production?

151
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,702
Then your farmer mom could've helped you.

152
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,454
You jerk.

153
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,096
Ma'am!

154
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,308
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,145
Please forgive him just once.

156
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,883
Come here and beg.

157
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,442
Tell him you were wrong.

158
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,181
Beg him, or you'll go to jail!

159
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,100
- Beg for forgiveness!
- Mom.

160
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,602
- Beg him for forgiveness!
- Mom.

161
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,995
- Do it!
- Mom!

162
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,416
So you're saying...

163
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,253
I have to beg this jerk?

164
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,314
You're telling me to kneel
before this douchebag...

165
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:56,633
because I can't take
the bar exam if I go to jail.

166
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,969
Right.

167
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,722
That's what you want.

168
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,226
You want me to become a cowardly
snob who'd do anything to get my way.

169
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,735
Hey.

170
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,182
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,241
I didn't know my place and got cheeky.

172
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,564
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me just this once.

173
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,358
Please let me take the bar exam.

174
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,736
Please forgive me.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,197
No, please forgive me, sir.

176
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,589
- <i>On that day,</i>
- Just this once.

177
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,327

182
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,936
Excuse me. I'm the bereaved.

183
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,980
I'd like to see my father's
trial record and the ruling.

I can only view the ruling?

187
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,199
I followed the procedure to get his
trial and witness examination records.

188
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,450
So why can't I see it?

189
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,702
Trial records and witness examination records...

190
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,888
include sensitive contents,
so we can't release them.

191
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,501
But my father has already passed.

192
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,835
Disclosure of trial records...

193
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,164

the bereaved family is entitled

206
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,935
This is a dereliction of duty.

What?

208
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,923
Dereliction of duty?

209

Are detectives a joke just

- No, that's not...
- Forget it.

213
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,602
You need to leave.

214
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,811
Take the bar exam,

become a prosecutor,

- Get out of here.
- Detective.

He is? Instead of becoming
the prosecutor general?

261
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,723

340

made a statement against the victim in court.

342
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,848
Why did he do that?

343
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,448
Wait.

344
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,686
The prosecutor must've called that witness...

345
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,562
- to help the victim, right?
- Yes.

346
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,914
But the witness testified against the victim?

347
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,404
That means the witness changed their mind.

348
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,947
- Exactly.
- Hey.

349
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,991
Then it's obvious.

350
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,244
The witness could've held
a grudge against the victim.

351
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,746
Or they purposely decided to mess them up.

352
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,708
Or something must've changed
their mind before the trial.

353
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:09,060
For example, they could've
been threatened or bribed.

354
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,105
Right?

355
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,316
That's obviously the case, right?

356
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,639
<i>Kwak Sang-cheol.</i>

357
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,446
<i>A firefighter who was close to my father,</i>

358
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,548
<i>and often came to inspect
his farm for fire prevention.</i>

359
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,565
<i>But during the trial,</i>

360
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,818
<i>he gave a questionable testimony
that there were many problems...</i>

361
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,753
<i>with the electrical facility
at my father's farm.</i>

362
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,883
Excuse me.

363
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,912
Are you Mr. Kwak Sang-cheol?

364
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,097
I never should've done that to Hae-sik.

365
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,685
I'm so sorry.

366
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,024
But I thought we'd all be in
danger if I continued to resist.

367
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,487
Danger? What do you mean?

368
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,199
Mr. Kwak, you're a civil servant, right?

369
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,770
If a civil servant hinders a state project,

370
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,271
it makes them a communist.

371
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,067
I get that it's for our country,
but how could you set his farm on fire?

372
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,501
Right? I agree with you.

373
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:19,631
I shouldn't have burned his farm down.

374
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,161
If I set his home on fire,

375
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,221
we wouldn't be in so much trouble, right?

376
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,127
<i><font color="#ffff00">Yongra</font></i>

377
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,436
A fire begins without warning.

378
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,548
It can start at your home,

379
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,635
or even at your mother's hospital.

380
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,803
Right?

381
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,262
Always beware of fire.

382
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,404
Let's not let down our guard!

383
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,142
You have a great place here.

384
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,867
Goodness.

385
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,149
<i>I thought something was off when
I heard Hae-sik had passed away.</i>

386
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,569
I had a feeling that those men were behind it.

387
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,740
But there was absolutely no
evidence after the investigation,

388
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,617
and I had to keep my mouth shut,

389
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,134
afraid of Director Song's retaliation.

390
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,414
<i>By Director Song, you mean...</i>

391
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,666
<i>You're right.</i>

392
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,734
<i>Director Song Woo-byeok of Yongra Construction,</i>

393
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,893

00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,402
- Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,528
How have you been?

399
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,128
Fine.

400
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,847
Your mother is coming to your
appointment ceremony tomorrow, right?

401
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,224
No.

402
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,711
What?

403
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,437
She's not coming? Why not?

404
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,940
You didn't tell her about it?

405
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,470
Kang-ho, you shouldn't...

406
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,029
Mi-joo.

407
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,825
All right.

408
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,873
What about me? When and
where should I go tomorrow?

409
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,486
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,031
I should go alone tomorrow.

411
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,200
I have to be somewhere right after.

412
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,759
- It's important.
- But...

413
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,459
All right then.

414
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:39,228
It'll be weird for me to go if your
mother won't be there either, right?

415
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,525
Instead, let's have a party tomorrow night.

416
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,527
Let's do that.

417
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,073
I'll wash up.

418
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,436
<i>And now...</i>

419
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,022
the parents and families of new prosecutors...

420
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,108
may come up and put the gown on them.

421
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:03,029
Please show your support by putting
the untainted black gown on them,

422
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,032
a symbol for them to maintain
fairness and impartiality...

423
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,076
in their journey as prosecutors.

424
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,663
Newly-appointed prosecutors shall
relay a warm regard to your parents...

425
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,873
for supporting you over a long period of time.

426
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,750
Please encourage one another.

427
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,918
Congratulations.

428
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,128
<i>Prosecutor's oath.</i>

429
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,546
- Our oath!
- Our oath!

430
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,466
As of this moment, I accept the
call of my country and people,

431
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,693
and receive the honor to serve as a prosecutor.

432
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,112
<i>So you're a prosecutor?</i>

433
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,392
Your mother must be quite disappointed.

434
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,535
I heard about your baby. Congratulations!

435
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,357
Hae-sik is so thrilled that he's
already wondering whether it'd be...

436
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,121
a son or daughter and thinking of names.

437
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:44,487
I'll be happy with either a girl or a boy.

438
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,879
I just want our baby to be healthy,

439
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,702
and raise them to be a painter.

440
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,261
- A painter?
- Yes.

441
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,264
I always wanted to be a painter.

442
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,544
My parents passed away while
I was preparing for art school,

443
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,644
so I had to give up.

444
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:07,775
I have a feeling that our baby will
take after me and be good at drawing.

445
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,179
Isn't that true?

446
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,322
I'll courageously lift
the darkness of injustice.

447
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,255
I'll stay warm-hearted for those
who are weak and underprivileged.

462
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,273
There was no evidence of murder.

463
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:48,501
And the autopsy result showed it
was suffocation due to airway blockage.

464
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,461
It was a suicide.

00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,234
Yes, that's correct.

00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,778
Who was the detective in charge?

470
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,812
These are photos of the
victim taken at the scene.

471
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,371
Doesn't it seem odd?

472
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,248
I'm not sure.

473
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,627
Take a close look at his neck.

474
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,614
The only wound you can see...

475
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,284
is the pressure from
the rope, the ligature mark.

476
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,245
It means there was no struggle...

477
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,790
until the moment he suffocated to
death although his hands were free.

478
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,975
Well, that's possible.

479
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,548
There are cases where a suicide
victim dies from a broken neck,

480
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,610
depending on the weight of the
victim and the height of the noose.

481
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,323
Then what do you think about this?

482
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,977
{\an8}This is from his autopsy.

483
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,939
The nail marks that were absent at the scene...

484
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,166
suddenly appear clearly during the autopsy.

485
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,293
I'm not sure.

486
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,532
This is...

487
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,468
Someone must've questioned
whether it was truly a suicide.

488
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,413
<i>Look at this.</i>

489
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,040
Isn't this weird?

490
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,334
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

491
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,018
Even if he was determined to die,

492
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,132
there should be some trace
of struggle due to pain, right?

493
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:37,777
His neck was too clean for
someone who suffocated slowly...

494
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,029
to his death.

495
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,228
Of course one could've argued
he died from a broken neck.

496
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,105
Unfortunately, the victim
wasn't found at a scene...

497
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,025
high enough for him to die instantly.

498
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,526
Therefore...

499
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,571
there was a high possibility
the victim's suicide was staged...

500
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,242
after he was murdered or made unconscious.

501
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,869
Someone was afraid the truth
might leak, so they created...

502
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,221
such false resistance marks before the autopsy.

503
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,182
Who was it?

504
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,768
Sorry?

505
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,089
Goodness.

506
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,591

507
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,843
I noticed you were promoted...

508
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,805
right after this case was closed.

509
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,531
And you also bought a home and some land.

510
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,951
As I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

511
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,621
So you don't know?

512
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,670
I heard you'll be retiring in a month.

513
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,116
I guess I'll find out within a month...

514
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,160
whether you'll retire or be dismissed.

515
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,578
What's with you?

516
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,247
It's been over 30 years!

517
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,082
Yes, it has!

518
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,375
It's been over 30 years.

519
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,143
But I still have to bring
justice to the wronged!

520
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,854
It may have been over 30 years,

521
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,315

531
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,860
All right, we're here.

532
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,014
Let's go.

533
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,017
- I'm hungry.
- Goodness, I'm hungry,

534
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,353
and I want a drink too.

535
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,412
Let's hurry inside.

536
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,962
Do you want to know...

537
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,827
what I want to do?

538
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,761
If you tell me,

539
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,639
will it change anything?

540
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,435
No.

541
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,814
Then I also say...

542
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,817
no.

<i>don't ever let her find out...</i>

550
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,690

551
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,777
<i>Let her loathe and resent me...</i>

552
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,557
<i>as she forgets me...</i>

553
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,740
<i>and erases me from her memory.</i>

554
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,328
<i>Let her forget that she must forget me,</i>

555
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,331

561
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,344
I received a tip about drugs.

562
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,610
It was my first time clubbing.

<i>Kang-ho, buy me a drink.</i>

567
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,076
Let me call you back.

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,218
<i>No. Wait, don't hang...</i>

Let go of me, you crazy scumbag!

573
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,975
Hey! Let go!

574
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,858
Hey, get up.

575
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,862
Get up.

576
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,698
What's this?

577
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,452
The CCTVs near Woo Mi-jeong's
incident were either broken or wiped,

578
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,829
so the case was almost abandoned.

579
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,598
Thankfully, I found one nearby
installed to monitor littering.

580
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,309
So what do you want to show me?

581
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,007
Do you see this car?

582
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,177
If you consider the time
and location of the incident,

583
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:37,348
there's a high chance this car's
dashcam recorded the incident.

584
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,824
It'll take a while to process
the license plate number,

585
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,646
but I'll reveal the truth soon.

586
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,164
Kang-ho, let's just let this one slide.

587
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,501
Is it because of Yoon Jae-min?

588
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,590
He might dispose of Jung Jong-gu?

589
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,204
He'll stage Jung Jong-gu's
suicide like he did it out of guilt.

590
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,041
He'll think it's the easiest
way to tie up loose ends.

591
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,086
He'll go as far as to kill an innocent man?

592
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,129
Don't you know what Chairman Song is like?

593
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,647
He can do much worse things.

594
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,933
Sir, let me take on this case.

595
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,059
What?

596
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,301
You're about to become
the deputy chief prosecutor.

597
00:33:24,325 --> 00:33:28,487
You want to avoid getting tangled
up in a messy case like this.

598
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,859
Please allow...

599
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,822
your junior prosecutor the
opportunity to run with this case,

600
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,948
Sir.

601
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,325
I mean, Deputy Chief.

602
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,218
I'll oversee this case with care.

603
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,976
I didn't kill Mi-jeong.

604
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,881
But even my lawyer doesn't believe me.

605
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,982
Mr. Jung,

606
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,526
you didn't kill Ms. Woo.

607
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,765
I'll find the evidence.

608
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,059
So until then,

609
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,493
you must stay alive in here.

610
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,790
You must trust me and do as I say...

611
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,252
until I find indisputable evidence.

612
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,450
I'll save you at all costs, Mr. Jung.

613
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,008
Do you understand?

614
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,135
Yes.

615
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,891
{\an8}Why did Woo Mi-jeong forget her
lipstick and leave your stall in a hurry?

616
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,726
Because...

617
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,254
she was angry with me.

618
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,354
{\an8}Why was she angry?

619
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,648
Because...

620
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,471
I tried to wipe the <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce off of her,

621
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,806
but she suddenly hit my face.

622
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,517
You must've been offended.

623
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,144
{\an8}You were just being considerate.

624
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,869
{\an8}Yes.

625
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,690
{\an8}I mean...

626
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:55,069
Despite that, you went out to
give the lipstick back to her,

627
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,948
all the way into an alley
250 feet from the main road.

628
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,715
{\an8}However,

629
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,704
{\an8}when you saw Woo Mi-jeong with another man,

630
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,331
you returned to your stall...

631
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,625
in case you incur a misunderstanding, correct?

632
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,709
Yes.

633
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,378
If you didn't have any feelings for her,

634
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,506
{\an8}you should've returned the lipstick...

635
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,925
even if you saw her with another man.

636
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,135
So why did you return to your stall?

637
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,111
And why did you go back to the alley?

638
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,102
It shows the defendant didn't
go out to find Woo Mi-jeong...

639
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,411
{\an8}just to return the lipstick.

640
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,065
{\an8}Jung Jong-gu, the defendant,

641
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,819
was assaulted by Woo Mi-jeong,
who he liked, as he showed kindness.

642
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,279
While he was ashamed and humiliated,

643
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:44,633
he saw her with another man
and decided to commit this crime.

644
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,495
Defendant.

645
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,871
Do you admit to the crime?

646
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,748
That's absurd!

647
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,999
Goodness!

648
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,793
Jong-gu!

649
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,670
You didn't kill her!

650
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,255
Tell him you didn't.

651
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,714
- Jong-gu!
- Tell him no!

652
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,148
- Please be quiet.
- Defendant.

653
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,151
Do you admit to the crime?

654
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,728
- Mom, I want to go home!
- Jong-gu, say it!

655
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,814
- Defendant, calm down!
- I want to go home!

656
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,248
- Defendant.
- That is all.

657
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,988
Sir, he's here.

658
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,880
You're here.

659
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,260
Leave this letter on my desk.

660
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,430
Goodness, thank you for coming a long way.

661
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,085
Please excuse my clothes.
Things have been hectic lately.

662
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,686
You look nice and comfortable.

663
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,678
This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.

664
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,555
It's a pleasure.

665
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,723
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho...

666
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,008
with the Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

667
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,023
Your grandson's name won't be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

668
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,125
Prosecutor Choi will ensure
discretion throughout it.

669
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,071
<i>This trial, I mean.</i>

670
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,089
<i>Are you after money or power?</i>

671
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,259
If I want it,

672
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,720
can you give it to me?

673
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,791
You just saved my grandson.

674
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,975
So why not?

675
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,773
In that case, both.

676
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,848
In return,

677
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,532
you'll be a part of my family now.

678
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,662
Thank you.

679
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,025
Thank you.

680
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,735
Thank you very much.

681
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,403
That's enough.

682
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,546
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

683
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,995
Find out the plate number of the car...

684
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,581
and recover the dashcam footage, no matter what.

685
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,431
Kang-ho.

686
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,418
How about this one?

687
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,170
You should wear this today.

688
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,937
Okay?

689
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,803
No, I'll wear the one you gave
me for our first anniversary.

690
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,847
No, that's too flashy.

691
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,641
This is perfect.

692
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,866
Let's go with this one.

693
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,953
Yes, this is perfect.

694
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,331
Dad.

695
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,945
Happy birthday.

696
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,697
Thanks.

697
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,714
I'm glad my daughter...

698
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,013
Who is he?

699
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,100
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

700
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,438
You must be surprised.

701
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,547
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Ha-young</font></i>

702
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,046
<i>You reek of something.</i>

703
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,757
<i>Ever since we first met.</i>

704
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,618
<i>What could it be?</i>

705
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,888
Is it the smell of dirt since
you came from the bottom up?

706
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:23,143
Someone like you can never call me "Father."

707
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,773
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

708
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,581
Sir, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

709
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,963
It's good.

710
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,622
Have some of this.

711
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,430
That's it. Good.

712
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,682
It's good.

713
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,189
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo used to
cover things up for Woobyeok Group.

714
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,261
Why is he suddenly siding with Dosang Group?

715
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,655
You really don't know?

716
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,226
Hey.

717
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,728
Chairman Song used to be a thug.

718
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,271
Think about all the shady acts...

719
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,108
they've committed in their 30 years together.

720
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,524
There are rumors that those
two are behind the death...

721
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,818
of the chairman of Yongra Construction,
which is now Woobyeok Group.

722
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,157
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
He's cleaning up after himself...

723
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,659
before it becomes a problem.

724
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,677
But if Assemblyman Oh runs for President,

725
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,935
Chairman Song wouldn't just sit by and watch.

726
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,167
Did you seriously think Oh Tae-soo
wasn't prepared for that...

727
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,794
when he dropped this bomb?

728
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,131
If things go sour, only
Woobyeok will get destroyed.

729
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,841
That's why Chairman Song...

730
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,734
is dying to take down Oh Tae-soo.

731
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,820
Anyway,

732
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,850
Chairman Song is a tactless brute to the bone.

733
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,645
All he did was bribe and seduce him with women.

734
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,857
A sly man like Oh Tae-soo
would never fall for such tricks.

735
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,957
I'd be a sucker for that.

736
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,547
Who are you?

737
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,843
Are you Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun?

738
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,457
Chairman Song was always anxious that...

739
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,709
Oh Tae-soo might betray him.

740
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,170
Corporate sales...

741
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,965
have actually increased by
21.5% compared to last year.

742
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,133
<i>That's why...</i>

743
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,011
<i>he sent me to work as Oh Tae-soo's assistant...</i>

744
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,403
<i>to keep an eye on him.</i>

745
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,782
<i>At first I was just doing my job.</i>

746
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,911
I'll move abroad and live quietly.

747
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:50,317
No, can you please tell
him we're both already dead?

748
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,958
"Both"?

749
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,167
Okay then.

750
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,210
Let's do this.

751
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,518
I'll keep you...

752
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,881
and your baby safe.

753
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,523
I give you my word.

754
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,861
To do that, I must get
Oh Tae-soo under my thumb,

755
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,114
and I can only do that through Chairman Song.

756
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,326
Can you share with me the
confidential files you have...

757
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,412
regarding Woobyeok Group?

758
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,340
<i>In return, please do as I asked you.</i>

759
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,929
Your baby is adorable.

760
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,913
I'm going to show the DNA test
result to Chairman Song tomorrow.

761
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,540
<i>The day has finally come.</i>

762
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,710
The moment Oh Tae-soo finds out about the baby,

763
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:36,214
you, your mother, and those
around you might be put in danger.

764
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,675
<i>You know that, right?</i>

765
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,277
<i>Prosecutor Choi, please be careful.</i>

766
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,112
Okay.

767
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,325
<i>You have a call from the lobby.</i>

768
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,229
Yes?

769
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,524
<i>Hello, sir. This is the security office.</i>

770
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,485
<i>Your mother is here.</i>

771
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,210
Tell her I'm not home.

772
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,941
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Happy Farm</font></i>

773
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,549
Please take me in as your real son.

774
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,552
- What did you say?
- I want to become...

775
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,861
your legal son.

776
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,182
Then as your son,

777
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,991
I'll marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

778
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,978
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

779
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,245
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

780
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,374
And I'll have a father.

781
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,904
None of us will be able to betray one another.

782
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,254
We'll become a true family.

783
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,742
- Hello.
- Hello.

784
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,842
Take a look at this.

785
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,541
Woobyeok Group set up this paper
company in Singapore two years ago...

786
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,141
Pack up.

787
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,102
Sorry?

788
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,071
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

789
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,205
No one will be able to find you.

790
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,778
Don't worry about it. It'll all work out.

791
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,130
Thank you for doing as I asked.

792
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,038
Ms. Hwang.

793
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,584
We're here.

794
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,812
Over there.

795
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,859
Here.

796
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,056
He's the owner of a
restaurant where I used to work.

797
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,450
He'll take you to a stowaway ship
that'll take you to the Philippines.

798
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,898
You may get seasick on the boat,

799
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,441
but hang in there for an hour.

800
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,833
The larger ship will be more stable.

801
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,571
Also,

802
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,129
here.

803
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,618
This is the address to your
home in the Philippines, passports,

804
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,718
and money for living expenses.

805
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,461
Oh Tae-soo may look for you,

806
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,005
so try to remain out of sight, okay?

807
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,840
Thank you so much.

808
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,300
Don't worry.

809
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,260
If my plan goes well,

810
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,570
you can return and live happily with your baby.

811
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,476
I'm counting on you, sir.

812
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,103
Don't worry. I'll see her off
and get in touch with you.

813
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,870
Okay.

814
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,982
All right.

815
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,624
This way.

816
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,037
I took care of it.

817
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,930
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Sillim Fresh Raw Fish</font></i>

818
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,521
Be polite to his mother.

819
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,843
And remember what I told you earlier.

820
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,443
Okay?

821
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:40,476
You must be feeling uneasy to
share difficult news with your mother.

822
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,563
The moment Chairman Song accepted me as his son,

823
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,872
she became a stranger to me.

824
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,902
I'm only going there to
seal the legal procedure,

825
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,669
so I feel at ease.

826
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,131
We'll get going.

827
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,952
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Sillim Fresh Raw Fish</font></i>

828
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,787
I got this at the biggest jewelry shop in town.

829
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,624
They're diamonds.

830
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,294
Take a look.

831
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,700
Can you wait outside?

832
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,743
Okay.

833
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,135
Why?

834
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,545
May I have something to drink?

835
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,521
Sure. Give me a moment.

836
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,271
Goodness.

837
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,758
Come to think of it,

838
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,886
your fiancée was born in the Year of the Pig.

839
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,154
It must be destiny.

840
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,557
Who am I?

841
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,934
I'm a pig farmer.

842
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:49,036
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

843
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,504
What is this?

844
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,889
"Adoption Agreement"?

845
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,959
What is this?

846
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,852
Are you going to adopt a child?

847
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,548
Why?

848
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,467
She can't get pregnant?

849
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,444
I'll be adopted by Chairman Song
who's been raising me all along.

850
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,489
Please stamp your seal there.

<i>I can't fight against them with Father's case,</i>

<i>Someday when everything ends...</i>

<i>and I can return to you,</i>

<i>I wish to lie in your arms...</i>

Don't do it.

872
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,846
Don't do anything now.

873
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,723
Mom.

874
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,229
Mom.

875
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,342
Mom, where are you going?

876
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,108
Mom.

877
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,280
No.

878
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,176
Mom.

879
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,970
Mom, are you okay?

880
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,584
Mom, what's wrong?

881
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:42,687
So that's why you were so cold to me?

882
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,649
To pursue revenge by yourself?

883
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,985
To take all the risks by yourself?

884
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,411
My poor boy.

885
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:04,208
It must've been so tough.

886
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:10,297
It must've been so scary and lonely.

887
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,422
You have to stop everything.

888
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,063
Okay?

Goodness.

892
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,237
Their son is about to die any day now.

893
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,088
How long do these old geezers want to live?

894
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,994
"Prostate Medicine"?

895
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,845
I might end up getting a sibling.

896
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,432
Good grief. I made a mess.

897
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,434
Darn it.

898
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,937
What's that?

<i>I don't accept credit cards.
Only wire transfer or cash.</i>

Goodness!

903
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,760
Darn it.

904
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,876
Mom, what are you doing?

905
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,003
- Give it to me.
- These are mine!

906
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,546
You said these were mine!

907
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,104
Choi Kang-ho!

908
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,342
Listen very carefully.

909
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,094
These are bad things.

910
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,180
It'll put you in danger if you keep it.

911
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,933
You might end up like your dad.

912
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,075
Like Dad?

913
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,745
What happened to him?

914
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,164
We have to get rid of them.

If you destroy yourself in revenge,

917
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,239
that isn't revenge.

918
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,435
True revenge...

919
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:47,371
is forgetting everything completely,
even the reason you wanted revenge,

920
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,166
and living a good life.

921
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,544
Let's forget.

922
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,839
Let's forget it all now.

00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,368
You,

you too.
