{\an8}- You punk.
- What the...?

12
00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.911
{\an8}- You punk. How could you do that?
- What's wrong with you?

13
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.455
- How could you?
- What's with you?

14
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.956
- Calm down.
- I mean,

15
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.083
of all people,

16
00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.919
how could you do that to Kang-ho,

17
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.046
that poor kid?

18
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.173
Why do you pity him?

19
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.341
- What?
- He got all the attention...

20
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.011
for being smart and getting good grades.

21
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.222
And now he's getting all the
attention because he's become an idiot.

22
00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.141
Like his mom's love isn't enough,

23
00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:25.811
even the lady next door dotes on him.

24
00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:30.191
You were always too busy with
the mill to make me a birthday meal,

25
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.817
but when Kang-ho got into SNU,

26
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.362
you even closed the mill and threw him a feast!

27
00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.239
Darn it, I'm your kid, not him.

28
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.174
Why do you think I did that?

29
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.411
I thought you'd benefit a little...

30
00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.040
if you were around a smart kid like him.

31
00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.391
It was humiliating and frustrating,

32
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.353
but I still put up with everything.

33
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.340
That's...

34
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.316
That's how I held out.

35
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.031
Why are you crying? You're
breaking my heart. It's all right.

36
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:09.105
Hey, you punk. Why are you making my woman cry?

37
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.941
I needed some money.

38
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.484
I wanted to work,

39
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:16.403
but I couldn't get a job
anywhere with my criminal record.

40
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.073
How much do you need?

41
00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.173
Tell me!

42
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.331
- 2...
- What? $2000?!

43
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.332
$2000?!

44
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.642
You cursed punk! $2000?!

45
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.801
{\an8}Look who it is.

46
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.651
{\an8}My love Mi-joo...

47
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.155
{\an8}Mom, where are we going?

48
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.118
{\an8}Where is she going this early?

49
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.793
Hello?

50
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.155
What?

51
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.839
Kang-ho.

52
00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.759
Let's eat and get ready.

53
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.430
We'll be having a guest soon.

54
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.019
You're upsetting me right now.

55
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.856
Mom, where are we going?

56
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.533
This is Mr. Kang-ho's place.

57
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.952
Ye-jin.

58
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.500
Seo-jin.

59
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.404
Mom?

60
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.824
Mom!

61
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.938
Mom?

62
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.689
Mom.

63
00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:16.774
Mom!

64
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.457
Mom!

65
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.158
Excuse me.

66
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:29.411
Is this Mr. Choi Kang-ho's place?

67
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.496
Yes.

68
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.206
This is it.

69
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.516
Don't give out his personal
information to a stranger!

70
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.255
Who are you and why are you looking for him?

71
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.591
My name is Hoang.

72
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.301
I'm supposed to meet him today,

73
00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.027
but I couldn't get in touch.

74
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.489
Mom.

75
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.978
Mi-joo, my mom...

76
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.938
- What?
- Mom...

77
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.663
What's going on?

78
00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.957
Mom.

79
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.861
Ms. Jin!

80
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.488
- Mom, please.
- Ms. Jin, wake up.

81
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.073
- Mom.
- Ms. Jin!

82
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.616
- Oh, no.
- No...

83
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.952
- Don't shake her like that. Please move.
- Sorry?

84
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.719
Okay.

85
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.312
She's in hypovolemic shock.

86
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.842
Hello? I'm calling from Jou-ri.

87
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.302
We have a medical emergency.

88
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.179
Kang-ho, bring me a thick blanket and pillows.

89
00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:31.015
Okay, a blanket and pillows.

90
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.933
- A blanket...
- How long will it take?

91
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.810
It's an emergency.

92
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.311
Please come quickly.

93
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.856
- Yes.
- Lift up her legs, so the blood...

94
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.165
- can get to her heart.
- Legs.

95
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.027
- Higher.
- Higher.

96
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.237
- Okay.
- You two wait at home.

97
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.448
Is Ms. Jin dead?

98
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.117
No. Don't worry.

99
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.161
Seo-jin, go home with Ye-jin.

100
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.620
Okay?

101
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.430
Good. Get home safely.

102
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.500
Ms. Hoang.

103
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:02.186
- Can you stay with her for 20 minutes?
- Yes, of course.

104
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:04.631
Kang-ho, where's the car key?

105
00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.273
The car key?

106
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.826
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Happy Farm</font></i>

107
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.227
<i>License plate 6169, pink truck.</i>

108
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:20.788
<i>Pull over to the right. You're speeding.</i>

109
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.358
<i>License plate 6169, pull over!</i>

110
00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.834
- Pull up next to them.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.325
What are you doing?

112
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.826
- Pull over.
- Can't you hear me?

113
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.286
You're speeding!

114
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.371
Sir! Please help us!

115
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.665
- What?
- My mom just collapsed.

116
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.875
It's hy...

117
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.126
Hy...

118
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.295
Hypovolemic shock.

119
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.546
Hypovolemic... What?

120
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.090
- Hypovolemic shock.
- Hype?

121
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.549
What are you saying?

122
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.551
Hypovolemic shock!

123
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.096
- What?
- She's in hypovolemic shock!

124
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.555
- Hurry up and go.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.225
<i>We're escorting an emergency patient.</i>

126
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.867
<i>Please make way.</i>

127
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.191
- Put her on IV.
- What's wrong with my mom?

128
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.526
Why is she sick?

129
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.820
I'm sorry, but please wait outside.

130
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.446
No, I want to stay here.

131
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.406
Let's wait outside...

132
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.673
so she can be treated.

133
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.459
Thank you.

134
00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:24.086
We arrived safely...

135
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.504
thanks to your first aid.

136
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.382
I should thank you.

137
00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.844
You drove her here without
waiting for the ambulance,

138
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:36.446
so my mother-in-law could be treated quickly.

139
00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.532
I see.

140
00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.354
- Hey.
- Here.

141
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.621
You must be in shock.

142
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:49.168
We're at the hospital now, so you can relax.

143
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.295
Thank you.

144
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.507
By the way, who are you?

145
00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:01.346
I didn't get to introduce
myself in the midst of this chaos.

146
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:06.977
My name is Hoang, and we
were supposed to meet today.

147
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.008
Ms. Jin Young-soon's guardian?

148
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.941
- Yes?
- Yes?

149
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.180
You wanted to open a clothing store, didn't you?

150
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.890
I'll open one for you,

151
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.560
but make a small space
in a corner for a nail salon.

152
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.853
It's not for you!

153
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.438
It's for Mi-joo!

154
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.774
I'll sell my garlic field and
whatever else to fund it,

155
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:31.236
so take Mi-joo and the
twins and look after them.

156
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.003
Your sister...

157
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.908
will be ruined if she stays here.

158
00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.507
Goodness.

159
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.306
Goodness, it smells rotten.

160
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.351
It smells like an old man.

161
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.728
Hoon-ah?

162
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:52.564
Are you here?

163
00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.610
My goodness, this place reeks.

164
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.741
What's all this?

165
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.857
Baek Hoon-ah!

166
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.985
Goodness! What are you doing?

167
00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.529
Serves you right.

168
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.864
You're being punished.

169
00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.116
Right, that pig lady.

170
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.077
How's she doing these days?

171
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.996
The foot-and-mouth disease took a toll on her,

172
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.831
but she's doing better now.

173
00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:26.208
Not that.

174
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.626
Then what? Her son?

175
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.254
That woman.

176
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.214
Good grief, how frustrating!

177
00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.382
What?

178
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.967
She hasn't told anybody?

179
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.567
She's still keeping it a secret?

180
00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.695
What are you talking about?

181
00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.072
A secret?

182
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.200
She's extremely sick?

183
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.145
She has stage four stomach cancer.

184
00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.816
The cancer cells have metastasized
to her peritoneum and lungs,

185
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.651
so there's...

186
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.626
Excuse me.

187
00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.240
I'm sorry, Doctor,

188
00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.340
but please speak with me.

189
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:05.721
It's tough for him to understand
what you're saying right now.

190
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.459
I'm a friend of his and...

191
00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:11.461
No.

192
00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.855
Please speak with me. I want to hear it.

193
00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.592
I'm...

194
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.359
I'm my mom's guardian.

195
00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:27.242
Kang-ho, wait.

196
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.457
Kang-ho!

197
00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.760
Mom, get up.

198
00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:48.540
Mom, get up. Come with me.

199
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.417
Mom, let's go home.

200
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.976
Kang-ho, don't do this.

201
00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.547
Come home with me, Mom.

202
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.190
Mom, open your eyes!

203
00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:03.487
Mom...

204
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.867
Mom, I'm sorry.

205
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.271
I'll start doing as you say.

206
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:12.439
I won't...

207
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.691
I won't be a prosecutor anymore.

208
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.651
Mom, please get up.

209
00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.070
- Kang-ho, stop it.
- Mom.

210
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:22.130
Mom, I won't like Mi-joo
anymore, just as you wanted.

211
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.576
I won't like Mi-joo anymore.

212
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.969
Mom, so please wake up.

213
00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:32.641
Wake up, Mom.

214
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.190
Hey, Andrea.

215
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.261
I think...

216
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.988
you set me up with the wrong guy.

217
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.034
Is anybody...

218
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.914
up there?

219
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.292
Is anyone...

220
00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:02.504
really up there?

221
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:07.217
I know you can be cruel,

222
00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.303
but this is way too harsh.

223
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.348
Wasn't it enough...

224
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.642
to take her husband,

225
00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.229
and make her son like that?

226
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:24.678
What did that good woman ever do?

227
00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.444
Goodness.

228
00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:30.157
How could you try to take her life too?

229
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.450
Grandma!

230
00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.108
Grandma, where have you been?

231
00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:40.861
We looked everywhere for you.

232
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.822
Ms. Jin collapsed!

233
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.073
She collapsed?

234
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.074
When?

235
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.033
This morning.

236
00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:51.678
Mom and Mr. Kang-ho took her to the hospital.

237
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.234
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Youngest Daughter Mi-joo</font></i>

238
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.424
<i>Gimbap</i> with no carrots.

239
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.274
Eat some.

240
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.446
Everyone Mom made <i>gimbap</i> for...

241
00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.657
never returned home.

242
00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:16.661
Grandma, Grandpa,

243
00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.206
and Dad too.

244
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:23.293
That's why she never let
me go on a school picnic.

245
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.546
She was afraid I wouldn't return.

246
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.497
So my mom isn't a bad person.

247
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.305
You're right.

248
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.225
She's not a bad person.

249
00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:41.186
Then why is she sick?

250
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.360
I'm being punished because I'm a bad person.

251
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.947
But why is my mom being punished?

252
00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.659
No, Kang-ho.

253
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.703
Neither of you...

254
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.790
are being punished.

255
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.417
This is...

256
00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:08.505
something nobody wants,

257
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.133
but something that can happen to anybody.

258
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:15.887
Just as Ms. Jin was there for you...

259
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.099
when you were unwell,

260
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.044
it's your turn...

261
00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:23.687
to stay strong with her.

262
00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:26.856
Okay?

263
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.869
She's going to be fine.

264
00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:42.107
She'll be okay.

265
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.748
Hey!

266
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:46.084
Hey, get away from him!

267
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.114
What are you two doing in broad daylight?

268
00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:50.824
Mom.

269
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.825
Hello.

270
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.384
I'm afraid I don't have
time to exchange greetings.

271
00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:56.803
Where's your mom?

272
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.918
I'll stay here.

273
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:04.504
You should go home and look after your kids.

274
00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:06.354
Listen, Mom.

275
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.177
Go home.

276
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.263
You darn brat.

277
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.822
You crazy wench.

278
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.366
I ought to...

279
00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.869
Lead the way.

280
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.630
Ma'am, what are you doing?

281
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.466
You can't do this.

282
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.677
Let go of me!

283
00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:39.664
Doctor.

284
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:43.001
Will I live if I get this IV shot?

285
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.685
Will I live if I stay in bed?

286
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.256
If not, let me go.

287
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.716
Help me make the best use...

288
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.762
of the time I have left.

289
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.930
I have...

290
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.641
I have no time to be here.

291
00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.560
I was supposed to meet
my son's future bride today.

292
00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:03.188
What time is it right now?

293
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.773
Goodness.

294
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.623
Oh, no.

295
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.334
My goodness.

296
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.403
Goodness.

297
00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:13.406
My goodness, why is this happening?

298
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.507
My goodness.

299
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.452
My goodness.

300
00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.996
My goodness. Oh, no.

301
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.790
My goodness.

302
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:26.059
Things were finally
beginning to look up for you.

303
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:30.882
Do you see the tear here?

304
00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:33.635
And you dare sell this as an authentic item?

305
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.721
I thought of reporting
you but decided to refrain.

306
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:37.931
I want a refund.

307
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.600
I'm so sorry,

308
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:44.187
but how do I know if there was
something wrong with the stitch work...

309
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.605
because of what I did,

310
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.064
- or what you...
- I'll report it.

311
00:16:47.088 --> 00:16:50.624
I'm not looking to nitpick over that.

312
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:55.171
I need cash to give you a refund,

313
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.326
but as you can see, I don't have...

314
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.786
You have exactly $2000.

315
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.621
Sorry?

316
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:02.896
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Balance $2000</font></i>

317
00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.275
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Park Sung-ae</font></i>

318
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.922
<i>I'm busy. What do you want?</i>

319
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:14.050
Why did you deposit money without my permission?

320
00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:17.360
- <i>Pay it back.</i>
- Okay.

321
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:21.948
Mom, while you're at it,
can you lend me some more?

322
00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:28.413
Gosh, my mom can be so cool.

323
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.529
It looks brand new.

324
00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.005
Who did this to the bag?

325
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.468
What is this?

326
00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:44.387
What the...?

327
00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.224
What is this?

328
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.609
"DNA Test Result"?

329
00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.725
Hello, Ms. Hoang.

330
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.754
It's me, Kang-ho's mom.

331
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:36.216
I didn't have my phone
with me so I couldn't call you.

332
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.193
I'm so sorry about this morning.

333
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:44.489
I heard from my son that you
came to the hospital with him.

334
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.142
Sorry?

335
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.451
What do you mean?

336
00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.329
Nonsense.

337
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.998
It's a misunderstanding.

338
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:57.487
Mi-joo is just a childhood friend.

339
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.197
Don't be like that. Let's meet.

340
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.157
Let's talk in person.

341
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.368
Ms. Hoang?

342
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.134
Ms. Hoang?

343
00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:18.898
Mom, where are you going?

344
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:20.885
Stay here.

345
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:23.570
No, Mom. You're very sick right now.

346
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.781
Yes.

347
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.784
You heard it from the doctor, right?

348
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:31.729
I'm very sick right now.

349
00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:33.523
So please...

350
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.415
just stay here.

351
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.094
Did you tell him?

352
00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.372
What?

353
00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:53.126
Didn't you go to tell him he's
Ye-jin and Seo-jin's father?

354
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.851
I did.

355
00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:59.007
At the very least,
I thought Ms. Jin should know.

356
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.717
Goodness.

357
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.442
This is bad.

358
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.569
But...

359
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.432
I couldn't tell her,

360
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.782
because she collapsed.

361
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.728
You couldn't?

362
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:12.937
Wait.

363
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:15.204
You didn't tell her?

364
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.650
Goodness gracious.

365
00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:20.668
Thank you, deities of heaven and earth.

366
00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.864
What a relief.

367
00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.422
You should...

368
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.759
take the kids and go
live with your eldest sister.

369
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.455
I talked to her, and she agreed.

370
00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.890
You can open up a nail salon there.

371
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.794
Listen.

372
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:40.006
It's not just Kang-ho anymore.
His mom is unwell too.

373
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.009
Do you want to waste your
life looking after people?

374
00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.844
- Mom, come on!
- Yes.

375
00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:47.722
I'm your mom.

376
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:51.684
And my daughter is about to ruin her life,
so what wouldn't I say to stop you?

377
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.368
Mom.

378
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.064
You must be mistaken.

379
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.997
Listen carefully.

380
00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.359
I'm...

381
00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:02.085
never getting back with him.

382
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.948
What you're imagining
right now will never happen.

383
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.547
Yes.

384
00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.827
I plan to live happily with my kids.

385
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.511
Right?

386
00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:12.580
You will, right?

387
00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.263
But...

388
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.668
I won't run away either.

389
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.461
Why should I?

390
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:21.130
Why should Ye-jin and Seo-jin do that?

391
00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:22.772
Mi-joo.

392
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.652
Mi-joo, are you there?

393
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:30.306
- Mi-joo.
- Yes?

394
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.601
Do you remember that young
lady who came to the hospital?

395
00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.770
Yes. Ms. Hoang, right?

396
00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.981
Yes, that's her.

397
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:40.081
She's going to...

398
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.251
marry Kang-ho.

399
00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.920
Yes, I know.

400
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.339
You do?

401
00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.034
You already knew?

402
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:52.385
Then why did you do that?

403
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:55.039
Sorry? What did I do?

404
00:21:55.063 --> 00:21:56.958
I mean,

405
00:21:56.982 --> 00:22:00.253
what did you do to make her say...

406
00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.730
she won't marry him because of you?

407
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.675
Mi-joo.

408
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.692
I asked you to help me.

409
00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.512
I told you about my situation,

410
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:12.071
and asked you to help me.

411
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:15.158
Then you shouldn't have ruined this.

412
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.618
Why do you...

413
00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:21.456
always ruin Kang-ho's future?

414
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.862
Who's ruining whose future?

415
00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:26.904
Mom.

416
00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:29.630
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

417
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.328
How could you torment my
kid for the sake of your kid?

418
00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:36.247
Mom, stop it.

419
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:37.415
You also did that...

420
00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.792
when she got into that accident!

421
00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:41.502
How was it her fault...

422
00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.379
that Kang-ho didn't take the exam?

423
00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:45.423
She was hurt badly!

424
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:48.024
Why do you blame everything on my child?

425
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:51.194
But I still put up with you,

426
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:54.932
because I knew what you
went through raising him.

427
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.934
Yet you're going this far?

428
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.145
Do you have any idea...

429
00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:01.397
- who ruined whose future?
- Mom! Stop!

430
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:03.983
Go back inside. Please!

431
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.459
- Darn it.
- Go inside.

432
00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.461
Go.

433
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.700
Go inside.

434
00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:15.828
Take a good look. Don't you remember this bag?

435
00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:17.080
I don't know.

436
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.665
Hey, sit back down.

437
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:23.169
Don't be so half-hearted again. Goodness.

438
00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:25.880
You gave this bag to your mom...

439
00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.466
on the day you brought your
fiancée to introduce to her.

440
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.759
Assemblyman Oh's daughter.

441
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:32.887
Why do you have the bag I bought for my mom?

442
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.930
Did you steal this too?

443
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:36.349
Of course not.

444
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:39.700
Your mom gave it to my mom.

445
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.479
I'm serious!

446
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.022
You don't trust me?

447
00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:45.942
- Should I call my mom?
- So what do you want to say?

448
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.318
Yes, right.

449
00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:50.378
What I wanted to say was...

450
00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.631
Do you know what this is?

451
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.259
Take a good look.

452
00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:58.121
I do.

453
00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:00.248
- Do you know whose this is?
- No.

454
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:02.723
Right, you don't.

455
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.671
Well, while we're on the subject...

456
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.297
Ta-da!

457
00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:10.216
We're about to look at this together.

458
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.067
Why should I do that with you?

459
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.363
Well, because...

460
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:21.477
Kang-ho, you said you wanted to be a prosecutor.

461
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:22.854
Take a look.

462
00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:24.689
"DNA Test Result."

463
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:26.899
It's a test result.

464
00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:30.611
It's a test that shows if you have the DNA...

465
00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.071
to be a prosecutor.

466
00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:34.699
And the result is right in here. Got it?

467
00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:36.534
I'm not going to be a prosecutor anymore.

468
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.844
- My mom doesn't approve.
- Darn it.

469
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.831
Yes, right.

470
00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:42.790
You won't, right?

471
00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:46.419
So let's find out if your DNA says
you don't have to be a prosecutor.

472
00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:48.588
Please just do the thing.

473
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:50.673
When I click this file here,

474
00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:53.176
I have to type in a password.

475
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.219
- Do you know it?
- Zero, nine, zero, seven.

476
00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:57.069
Zero, nine, zero, seven?

477
00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:01.184
I didn't expect it'd go so smoothly...

478
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:03.117
I knew it, you punk.

479
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.521
- That's not it.
- Zero, three, one, two.

480
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:07.607
Zero, three... Okay, zero, three, one, two.

481
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.675
I have a good feeling...

482
00:25:08.699 --> 00:25:09.605
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Enter Password</font></i>

483
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.110
...about nothing.

484
00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:13.070
Darn it, that's not it either.

485
00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:14.739
Get it together!

486
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:17.173
Think again. Hurry.

487
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.851
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Captain Bae</font></i>

488
00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:27.266
Keep trying.

489
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.296
Goodness, sir.

490
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.008
I was about to give you a call just now.

491
00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.233
<i>I'll let you talk alone then.</i>

492

493
00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:06.639
Darn it, what the heck?

494
00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:09.126
Move aside.

495
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.003
Sam-sik, look.

496
00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:12.088
What?

497
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:14.257
- No way! You opened it?
- I...

498
00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:16.842
My gosh, Kang-ho! My dear Kang-ho!

499
00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:19.068
My smart fiancée.

500
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.388
Good.

501
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:23.239
All right, let's take a look.

502
00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:25.700
<i>Before we do that,</i>

503
00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:27.645
<i>we should get rid of everything...</i>

504
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:28.980
- <i>that can hurt us.</i>
- What?

505
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.815
It's a voice recording, not a video.

506
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:35.194
<i>Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?</i>

507
00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:38.155
- <i>Come on. Getting rid of that paper...</i>
- This guy.

508
00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:39.919
- <i>...won't change anything.</i>
- Who's this?

509
00:26:39.943 --> 00:26:41.158
This guy.

510
00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:44.287
<i>He'll get rid of them like they never existed.</i>

511
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.247
<i>My son will do that.</i>

512
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:47.888
<i>Right?</i>

513
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:49.834
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

514
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:52.837
That's your voice, Kang-ho. Right?

515
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.521
<i>I'll let you talk alone then.</i>

516
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.975
Is that all?

517
00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:09.186
<i>Are you suggesting we kill Hwang Soo-hyun?</i>

518
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.746
<i>We can't just get rid of the mother.</i>

519
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.025
<i>The kid must go too.</i>

520
00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:16.292
This won't cause trouble, right?

521
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:20.948
The mighty Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
is scared of something like this?

522
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:22.491
Don't worry.

523
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:24.493
Even if it does cause trouble later,

524
00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:27.428
Kang-ho will take the fall.

525
00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:30.041
That's why I keep him around.

526
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.002
Then I'll be counting on you, Chairman Song.

527
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:34.810
<i>Sure.</i>

528
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.647
What are they talking about?

529
00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.596
So this...

530
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.280
belongs to Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

531
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.325
Yes!

532
00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:50.978
This is it.

533
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.229
Sam-sik.

534
00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:54.899
What is this?

535
00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:57.818
Who are they? Why am I talking
about this stuff with them?

536
00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:00.321
I already told you.

537
00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:01.947
You were going to marry...

538
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:04.673
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

539
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:10.247
Then who's Hwang Soo-hyun?

540
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:12.166
Did I do something to her?

541
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.127
You said you'd take care of her.

542
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:18.896
So what did you do to her?

543
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.257
You didn't...

544
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.817
kill her or anything, right?

545
00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:28.641
Hey.

546
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:29.767
What are you doing?

547
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.409
- This is mine.
- So what will you do?

548
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.399
I don't know.

549
00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:39.694
But I feel like I need to find out what this is.

550
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:42.488
- My mom might know.
- No.

551
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:45.131
Hey, you idiot. Are you stupid?

552
00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.326
If your mom knew about this,

553
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.429
would she have given this bag to my mom?

554
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:54.250
I understand how you feel.

555
00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:57.601
Of course you'd want to know.

556
00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.562
Okay.

557
00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:01.549
Let's do this.

558
00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.467
I'll find out for you.

559
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:05.219
- You will?
- Yes.

560
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:09.348
I'll meet and ask them myself.

561
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.599
Think about it.

562
00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:14.645
There's a possibility you
really did something very bad.

563
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:18.065
And if you did and your mom finds
out, she'll be greatly shocked.

564
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.832
Don't you think so?

565
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:26.464
- What are you doing?
- Listen up.

566
00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:28.826
I have to know what this is.

567
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.303
So if you deceive me and
do something weird again,

568
00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.805
I won't let it slide, okay?

569
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:37.016
Okay.

570
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:44.216
Here's the password.

571
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.317
Okay.

572
00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:50.321
D, K, Q...

573
00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:54.533
That spells "father."

574
00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.419
<i>Mom is sick.</i>

575
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:08.422
By the way, Dad,

576
00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:12.259
who are you?

577
00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:19.391
Why was I reminded of you...

578
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.312
when I heard those scary words?

579
00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:28.484
I've never even met you.

580
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:36.116
So why do I miss you?

581
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.498
Why does my heart...

582
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.087
ache so much?

583
00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:08.983
Who are you, Dad?

584
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.822
And who am I?

585
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.245
What do I have to do?

586
00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:43.892
There you were, Kang-ho.

587
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.222
How are you?

588
00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.364
Are you happy?

589
00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:05.858
Your dad was really in love with me.

590
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:08.542
What? It's true.

591
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:12.406
He used to follow me around,

592
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.575
asking me to hug and kiss him.

593
00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.967
Gosh, it was so bothersome.

594
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.679
He'd never spend a second away from me.

595
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.600
Just like you, Kang-ho.

596
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:31.607
Come to think about it,
you take after your dad a lot.

597
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:33.719
Your stubbornness...

598
00:32:33.743 --> 00:32:36.862
and strong determination all come from him.

599
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.074
But your dad...

600
00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:43.494
wasn't always that strong.

601
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:46.231
He cried very easily.

602
00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:47.191
He'd always...

603
00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:51.835
rub my big belly while you were in my womb,

604
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:54.323
and cry saying he missed you,

605
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.824
loved you,

606
00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:58.342
and was sorry.

607
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:05.099
Then you'd begin to kick in there.

608
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.462
"Mom, Dad, I'm here."

609
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:11.855
"I can see everything from here!"

610
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:14.274
It was like you were answering.

611
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:24.284
I wanted to...

612
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.246
grow old together with him.

613
00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:33.669
But our time was cut very short.

614
00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:38.340
Kang-ho.

615
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:40.426
Later on,

616
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:45.097
when I die, please bury me next to your dad.

617
00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.728
I want to be with him a long time.

618
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.756
- Mom.
- Kang-ho.

619
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:57.192
When you get married and have kids,
will you visit us with them?

620
00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.154
I'm sure they'll be adorable.

621
00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:05.701
Your child will grow up,
go to school, and get married.

622
00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:13.876
And you'll grow older and
become a dad, and then a grandpa.

623
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.654
Mom and Dad...

624
00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:18.255
will watch over you...

625
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.924
from this round mound.

626
00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:24.928
No, we'll protect you.

627
00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:30.419
So Kang-ho,

628
00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:34.396
don't feel lonely even when I'm gone.

629
00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:37.676
You aren't alone.

630
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.526
Okay?

631
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:42.696
Mom, why are you so mean?

632
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.161
I know, Mom.

633
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.831
I know everything.

634
00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:58.113
But do you have to say that?

635
00:34:58.137 --> 00:34:59.698
Just say,

636
00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:03.133
"It's all right. This is nothing."

637
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:06.747
"I can fight this and win. I'll get better."

638
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.431
Why can't you just say that?

639
00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:13.310
Why do you always...?

640
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.672
Why...?

641
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:19.691
Why do you always say things
that hurt me right here?

642
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:24.112
Why do you always make me do tough things?

643
00:35:25.873 --> 00:35:29.701
Why do you always do everything your way?

644
00:35:32.088 --> 00:35:34.650
Cooking, doing the laundry,

645
00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:37.236
farming, and banking.

646
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.197
After you teach me everything like a mother pig,

647
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:43.048
you'll go somewhere nice without me.

648
00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:47.219
I don't want that!

649
00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:50.347
No!

650
00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:53.725
Then I won't do anything.

651
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:56.672
No, I'd rather not know how to do anything.

652
00:35:56.696 --> 00:36:01.149
I'm just going to live my life like an idiot.

653
00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:04.653
So Mom, you can't leave me!

654
00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.701
Mom, please.

655
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:14.580
Please don't leave me, Mom.

656
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.361
Mom.

657
00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:22.045
Mom, just...

658
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.242
Just a little...

659
00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:27.843
Just stay a little longer.

660
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.226
Mom...

661
00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.687
Okay.

662
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.441
I'll take my time.

663
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.735
I'll leave...

664
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:47.988
very, very slowly.

665
00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:51.643
So let's not be sad,

666
00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:54.786
and let's not cry.

667
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:57.456
Let's not be like that.

668
00:36:59.759 --> 00:37:02.878
I want to spend every minute
and second I have left...

669
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:06.757
being happy with you.

670
00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:08.383
Okay?

671
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.688
Who is it?

672
00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:40.624
Gum-ja.

673
00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:42.709
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:47.214
I felt sorry for Kang-ho for
growing up without a dad.

675
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.051
I didn't want him to feel his dad's absence,

676
00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:53.804
so I've been selfish.

677
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:56.723
After he became the way he is,

678
00:37:57.024 --> 00:38:00.852
I finally realized my love
for him was misguided.

679
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.481
But I haven't really changed.

680
00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:07.177
You were right.

681
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:10.862
Your child is as precious as mine.

682
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.533
I've hurt Mi-joo...

683
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:18.161
very deeply.

684
00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:22.332
Even after everything you've done for me.

685
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:26.154
I'm sorry for hurting you.

686
00:38:26.178 --> 00:38:28.171
Please forgive me.

687
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.050
Goodness.

688
00:38:34.228 --> 00:38:37.264
There's no need to kneel.

689
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.392
You aren't even well.

690
00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:42.796
Get up.

691
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.006
Stand up.

692
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.300
Stand up, already.

693
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.066
Get up.

694
00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.220
Gum-ja.

695
00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:52.946
Am I really going to die?

696
00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:56.450
I'm scared.

697
00:38:57.293 --> 00:38:59.354
What do I do?

698
00:38:59.378 --> 00:39:01.273
What do I do, Gum-ja?

699
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.817
Please let me live.

700
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.668
Please let me live.

701
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:09.114
Please help me live.

702
00:39:09.138 --> 00:39:11.298
Goodness, you poor thing.

703
00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:20.083
Please let me live.

704
00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:23.185
Please let me live.

705
00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:30.093
Someday you're going to die by my hands.

706
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:33.638
I'll probably die of anxiety before then.

707
00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:35.599
- Goodness!
- Hey!

708
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.392
- This is amazing!
- Excuse me.

709
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:39.144
Please give the brewery...

710
00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.396
- a lot of time on air.
- Are you wearing makeup?

711
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.164
I heard you need to put on makeup to be on TV.

712
00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:48.904
We've never had such a joyous occasion before.

713
00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.823
I can't believe our village will be on TV!

714
00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:54.368
I'm sorry to say this,

715
00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.496
but I don't think we can be seen on TV.

716
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.137
See?

717
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.084
I knew it. I was right, wasn't I?

718
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.544
I was suspicious of you from the moment we met.

719
00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:07.005
They're here to hide because
they did something bad.

720
00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:09.508
What's wrong with you?

721
00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:12.511
Don't say something so dreadful
about these wonderful men...

722
00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:14.528
who brought honor to Jou-ri.

723
00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.598
Look at them.

724
00:40:16.622 --> 00:40:19.017
Does he look like someone who's up to no good?

725
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:22.813
His eyes are so kind, just like cow eyes.

726
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:25.440
And his last name also means cow.

727
00:40:25.464 --> 00:40:29.042
See? He's just like a cow.

728
00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:33.824
Anyway, we don't have a particular secret.

729
00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:35.951
All we ever did was water them.

730
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.661
Right?

731
00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:39.719
We didn't...

732
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.498
just water them.

733
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:44.793
"As <i>makgeolli</i> ferments,
the soil becomes aerobic..."

734
00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:48.145
"and grows many beneficial
bacteria and prevents diseases."

735
00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:52.092
You were so cool. How did you come up with that?

736
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.942
Just pack up.

737
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.264
We have to beg the chairman for forgiveness...

738
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.391
before the program goes on air.

739
00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.560
Otherwise we'll become manure for the lettuce.

740
00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.702
♫ <i>Let's go</i> ♫

741
00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:08.540
♫ <i>Let's go to Seoul</i> ♫

742
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.418
Just go.

743
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.838
Just drive by.

744
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.424
Just go.

745
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.411
Just go.

746
00:41:19.435 --> 00:41:21.678
Just go!

747
00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:24.556
Mr. Cha!

748
00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.501
We'll look suspicious if we just go.

749
00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:28.560
Let's say bye before we go.

750
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.341
Hello.

751
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:34.926
So and Cha, where are you going?

752
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.929
We have to go to Seoul for business.

753
00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:40.182
- Seoul?
- Yes.

754
00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:41.990
Should I play some music?

755
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:44.618
Sorry, sir.

756
00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:48.190
I was on my way to Seoul too.

757
00:41:48.214 --> 00:41:50.609
Isn't this great?

758
00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:53.153
Do you know where Seongbuk-dong is?

759
00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.822
I know it rather well. Are you headed there?

760
00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:58.048
Yes, to Assemblyman Oh's place.

761
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:02.454
What's wrong with you?

762
00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:03.580
You scared me.

763
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:05.707
Why are you going there?

764
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:08.960
I'm a huge fan and supporter,

765
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.129
so I wanted to show him my support.

766
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:14.940
Right here. This is where I'm going.

767
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.316
Hey, fiancée.

768
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.750
What happened? Did you meet him?

769
00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.127
Yes, I just met him.

770
00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.156
I'll call you once I'm done.

771
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.741
Sam-sik.

772
00:42:39.765 --> 00:42:41.159
You'd better not mess it up.

773
00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:42.759
I won't.

774
00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.694
Congratulations on your wedding tomorrow.

775
00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:23.216
Help!

776
00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.538
Are you all right?

777
00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:27.914
- I'm sorry.
- Help!

778
00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.499
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
- Goodness.

779
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.641
Should I call an ambulance?

780
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:33.235
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">DNA Test Result</font></i>

781
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:38.925
This is going to scar.

782
00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.985
My mom never let anything
like this happen to me.

783
00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:44.598
What's this?

784
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.224
It says it right there.

785
00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:50.327
"DNA Test Result."

786
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:52.787
Even an idiot can read it.

787
00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.541
Exactly.

788
00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:58.278
So what is this?

789
00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:02.839
I'm about to let you listen
to what this is all about.

790
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:11.473
<i>Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?</i>

791
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:17.771
She's using earphones,
so I can't confirm the content.

792
00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:24.429
I was torn between giving this to your father...

793
00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:28.058
and handing it over to Bareun Hanguk Party,

794
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:30.518
who's dying to take him down.

795
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.562
I pondered it deeply.

796
00:44:32.586 --> 00:44:33.813
But I decided to give you...

797
00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:37.749
a chance to be a good daughter
right before your wedding.

798
00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.988
Hey.

799
00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:44.422
What are you trying to pull?

800
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:49.511
What are you doing? That's mine!

801
00:44:50.312 --> 00:44:52.514
You just said it was my dad's.

802
00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.465
Choi Kang-ho had this.

803
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:05.068
A prosecutor like him
wouldn't keep a fake, would he?

804
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:10.198
What do you want?

805
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:16.871
So I had to mention him to get your attention.

806
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:21.292
I want $200,000.

807
00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.905
<i>Right, I have to pay Mom back.</i>

808
00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:25.407
And $2000.

809
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:28.341
I want $202,000 in cash.

810
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:36.042
You know what will happen if
you have another copy, right?

811
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.518
I'll probably be found dead...

812
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.728
in some mountains.

813
00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.819
I'll see you here in an hour.

814
00:46:03.635 --> 00:46:04.946
Hey, fiancée.

815
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.489
I just talked to her.

816
00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:08.074
She was taken aback at your name.

817
00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:10.216
There's definitely something going on.

818
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.995
I'll look more into this and call...

819
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:13.580
Darn it.

820
00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.555
Okay, Sam-sik.

821
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:18.433
Okay, bye.

822
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:21.936
What are you doing?

823
00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:23.548
Sam-sik.

824
00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:25.106
Sam-sik?

825
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:28.303
Mom. I'll do it.

826
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:29.596
Let me.

827
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.279
Okay.

828
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:34.824
Mom, I'll do it.

829
00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:42.358
Mom!

830
00:46:42.382 --> 00:46:44.152
Mom, I'll do it.

831
00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:45.820
What's the number?

832
00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:47.489
All right.

833
00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:49.407
You said you wouldn't do anything.

834
00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:51.659
But you're unwell.

835
00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:54.219
Don't worry. I'm fine.

836
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:56.137
Ms. Jin!

837
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:58.556
Ms. Jin!

838
00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:01.461
You're here. I was about to call you.

839
00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.921
What did the vet say?

840
00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:05.215
Those are signs of MMA.

841
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.425
Give them these anti-inflammatory shots,

842
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:11.569
and the prospects are that they'll
get well in a couple of days.

843
00:47:11.703 --> 00:47:13.097
- That's a relief.
- Mom.

844
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:15.448
Give it to me. I'll do it.

845
00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:17.435
But you're afraid of giving shots.

846
00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:21.162
I'll just grit my teeth and stick it in at once.

847
00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:23.539
I'll go with you.

848
00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.243
Excuse me.

849
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:36.538
Have you seen the man who was sitting there?

850
00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.680
No, I haven't.

851
00:47:43.402 --> 00:47:45.338
Please don't hit me!

852
00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.006
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Recents
Fiancée</font></i>

853
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.424
I didn't hit you.

854
00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.900
You didn't?

855
00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:52.387
I'm...

856
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:54.070
I'm sorry.

857
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.602
So Choi Kang-ho had this?

858
00:47:59.626 --> 00:48:01.437
Yes.

859
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:05.164
That idiot wouldn't have sent you here.

860
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.026
Who was it?

861
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.043
Who sent you here?

862
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.070
You must be Woobyeok.

863
00:48:13.095 --> 00:48:14.694
No, sir.

864
00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:16.122
I'm Sam-sik.

865
00:48:16.147 --> 00:48:17.828
Samsik?

866
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.372
Hey, what's Samsik?

867
00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:21.472
Look it up.

868
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.169
No, sir.

869
00:48:25.193 --> 00:48:27.839
My name is Sam-sik.

870
00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:29.605
Bang Sam-sik.

871
00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.819
So you'll keep your mouth shut?

872
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.491
Okay, take it to the grave.

873
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.604
- Sir.
- Get rid of him.

874
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.731
I just opened my mouth! What do I...?

875
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:47.498
Knife!

876
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.919
So...

877
00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.644
Soh and Cha?

878
00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:22.992
What the heck?

879
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:27.163
What the...?

880
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.586
Darn it!

881
00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:46.682
So and Cha?

882
00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.354
Darn it.

883
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:05.436
Drop the weapons.

884
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.412
Drop the weapons!

885
00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:33.146
Darn it.

886
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:41.597
Are you okay?

887
00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:43.307
Darn it.

888
00:50:43.331 --> 00:50:45.199
Darn it.

889
00:50:55.093 --> 00:50:56.919
Darn it!

890
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.075
My goodness.

891
00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:03.244
I'm sorry you're hurt because of me.

892
00:51:03.268 --> 00:51:07.623
Why did those rotten jerks have to use knives?

893
00:51:07.647 --> 00:51:09.459
I was scared to death.

894
00:51:09.483 --> 00:51:11.753
I almost wet myself.

895
00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:15.980
Goodness, speaking of which, let me take a leak.

896
00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:21.068
<i>Kang-ho will take the fall.</i>

897
00:51:21.661 --> 00:51:23.863
<i>That's why I keep him around.</i>

898
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.108
{\an8}Are you sure it was Song Woo-byeok?

899
00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:35.067
{\an8}Yes, sir.

900
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.502
I saw Mr. Soh.

901
00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:42.256
That wicked old snake.

902
00:51:44.392 --> 00:51:46.511
Where is Ha-young?

903
00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:05.363
What's that?

904
00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:16.582
I won't make excuses.

905
00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:18.903
It was a mistake.

906
00:52:18.927 --> 00:52:21.364
Killing an innocent woman
and her baby was a mistake?

907
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.490
Choi Kang-ho did that.

908
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:25.216
You put him up to it.

909
00:52:25.892 --> 00:52:28.511
You're a terrifying person.

910
00:52:28.603 --> 00:52:31.499
You kill and get rid of
everyone who gets in your way.

911
00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:33.099
And Kang-ho...

912
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:37.270
He ended up like that after being used by you.

913
00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:45.236
Ha-young, you must be quite scared.

914
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.656
Yes, of course you are.

915
00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:52.618
Since you slipped Kang-ho sleeping
pills and tried to kill him.

916
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.649
- That was...
- Are you going to say...

917
00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.833
I put you up to that too?

918
00:52:59.134 --> 00:53:00.194
No.

919
00:53:00.218 --> 00:53:01.362
You took...

920
00:53:01.386 --> 00:53:03.823
revenge on him because you felt betrayed...

921
00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:06.576
when you found out he was
using you to take me down.

922
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.010
It was your decision...

923
00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:11.178
to do it.

924
00:53:20.155 --> 00:53:21.981
But Ha-young,

925
00:53:22.657 --> 00:53:25.067
it's all in the past.

926
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.846
Besides,

927
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.057
the evidence that could be used
against me is now in my hands.

928
00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:32.101
With Kang-ho in that state,

929
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:34.910
no one can prove it...

930
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.539
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

931
00:53:39.799 --> 00:53:41.876
Do you understand?

932
00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.659
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

933
00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:50.593
You came.

934
00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.664
Thank you for coming.

935
00:53:53.688 --> 00:53:56.390
Goodness, congratulations.

936
00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:03.841
You came. I didn't invite you
thinking it'd be uncomfortable for you.

937
00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:05.092
Right?

938
00:54:05.116 --> 00:54:08.304
If you texted me the wedding invitation,

939
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:11.223
I would've just sent you
the congratulatory money.

940
00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:16.160
I didn't know how else to give it
to you, so I brought it here myself.

941
00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:22.333
The husband is quite tall
and handsome, isn't he?

942
00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:26.504
So do you like your future son-in-law this time?

943
00:54:27.013 --> 00:54:27.990
Yes.

944
00:54:28.014 --> 00:54:29.867
Good, you should.

945
00:54:29.891 --> 00:54:32.411
That way they can live happily...

946
00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:35.971
without getting into an
unexpected accident, right?

947
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.419
I'll be heading inside now.

948
00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:42.171
The steak here is amazing.

949
00:54:42.195 --> 00:54:44.480
You must know that.

950
00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:49.929
- Hello.
- Hello.

951
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.737
Thank you for coming.

952
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.725
The bride looks so stiff.

953
00:54:54.749 --> 00:54:56.978
Please relax and smile a little.

954
00:54:57.002 --> 00:54:58.869
Come on, smile.

955
00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:02.748
<i>Here comes the groom.</i>

956
00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:05.403
- Congrats!
- Looking good!

957
00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:06.821
Congrats!

958
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:07.905
Next,

959
00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:10.533
please welcome the beautiful bride.

960
00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:13.259
Here comes the bride!

961
00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:26.757
Excuse me!

962
00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:29.567
When will you serve the steak?

963
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.111
Goodness gracious.

964
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.819
Ha-young, here.

965
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.404
Oh my, Ji-u.

966
00:55:48.428 --> 00:55:49.864
Is this for me?

967
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:51.282
Thank you so much.

968
00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:54.925
It's not from me. It's from that man over...

969
00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:57.845
What? Where did he go?

970
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:04.670
The bride is gone.

971
00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:07.354
I'll look for her once again.

972
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.578
Are you ready?

973
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:24.607
I just need to get dressed.

974
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:27.208
By the way, where are we going?

975
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.611
On a date.

976
00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:30.446
- A date?
- Yes.

977
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.282
So you need to look your best.

978
00:56:33.306 --> 00:56:36.008
- My best.
- Yes.

979
00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.674
Ma'am?

980
00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:53.219
- Yes?
- Your payment went through.

981
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:55.486
- Okay.
- Thank you.

982
00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:48.858
<i>Please leave your message after the beep,</i>

983
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:51.417
<i>and press the asterisk once you're done.</i>

984
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:54.029
Sam-sik, why aren't you picking up?

985
00:57:54.053 --> 00:57:56.630
Is something going on?

986
00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:01.177
Give me a call, okay? I'll be waiting.

987
00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:21.655
What's this?

988
00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.631
Kang-ho.

989
00:58:39.557 --> 00:58:41.368
Mom, you look...

990
00:58:41.392 --> 00:58:43.802
What do you think? Don't I look pretty?

991
00:58:44.729 --> 00:58:46.415
Yes.

992
00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:48.098
Very pretty.

993
00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:51.337
It's cold.

994
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.339
- I'm fine.
- It's not fine.

995
00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:56.148
You have to keep warm.

996
00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:58.317
Like this.

997
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.821
All set. Let's go.

998
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.039
Did you want to go on a date with me?

999
00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:17.211
I realized...

1000
00:59:17.262 --> 00:59:21.173
I never had a chance to eat out with you.

1001
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.494
We've never been to the movies,

1002
00:59:23.518 --> 00:59:25.621
a karaoke room,

1003
00:59:25.645 --> 00:59:27.846
or on a trip.

1004
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:30.724
So we're going to do everything now.

1005
00:59:32.277 --> 00:59:34.144
Look.

1006
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.021
I made a list...

1007
00:59:36.197 --> 00:59:38.440
of everything I want to do.

1008
00:59:40.868 --> 00:59:42.054
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Things to do with my son</font></i>

1009

What do you think?

1010
00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:44.848
Will you do them with me?

1011
00:59:44.872 --> 00:59:47.393
Yes, I'll do everything.

1012
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.978
Okay.

1013
00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:50.646
Excuse me!

1014
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.607
Give us two more servings...

1015
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:55.776
of your best ribeye please.

1016
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.987
Also a bottle of <i>makgeolli,</i> please.

1017
00:59:58.011 --> 00:59:58.946
What?

1018
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.864
Come on, Mom.

1019
01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.741
I'm an adult.

1020
01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:05.634
I'm your guardian.

1021
01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.413
But you can't drink.

1022
01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.054
Never.

1023
01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.250
Okay.

1024
01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.559
Yes, you're my guardian...

1025
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.920
and an adult.

1026
01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.839
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1027
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.398
We'll take a large bottle of <i>makgeolli.</i>

1028
01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:24.930
Then just one glass with
the large bottle please.

1029
01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:28.767
- I want some too.
- No, just have the meat.

You nasty brat.

1036

Stop it!

1037
01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.460

Lock her up in a hospital,

1043
01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:11.867
Yes, sir.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.499
- Sir.
- Yes?

1045
01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:20.959
We checked,

1046
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.197
and it was Hwang Soo-hyun.

1047
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.407
The police began the investigation...

1048
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.424
as a possible murder case.

1049
01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.261

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:11.844
Mom?

1057

I want to sleep here tonight.

Yes?

Thank you for our date today.

1064
01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.914
It made me very happy.

1065
01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.501
Your wish is my command.

Yes.

1069
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:53.886
In that case,

1070
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.000
sing for me.

Yes.

I can't.

What? You said you'd do anything for me.

1076

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.904
Let me check your fever.

1095
01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:39.116
What a relief. It went down a little.

1096
01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:41.979
I'm sorry.

1097
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.231
It must be because I brought
you out in the cold...

1098
01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.859
before I dried your hair properly.

1099
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.570
- Mom.
- Yes?

1100
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.753
I already know.

1101
01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:52.990
About what?

1102
01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:56.091
About Dad.

1103
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.912
- Dad?
- Yes.

1104
01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:03.432
So you can be honest with me.

1105
01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.936
Did you hear something?

1106
01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:12.149
I don't have to hear it
to know. It's obvious to me.

1107
01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.359
Ye-jin.

1108
01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.972
Well, the thing is...

1109
01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:18.765
Dad...

1110
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:21.268
had an affair, right?

1111
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:22.269
What?

1112
01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:25.022
This is why a married
couple shouldn't live apart.

1113
01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:28.165
What are you talking about?

1114
01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.334
It's nothing like that.

1115
01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:33.030
It is.

1116
01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.948
He's never called us once...

1117
01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:36.533
since that brief visit.

1118
01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:39.870
Doesn't he miss us at all?

1119
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:40.871
Ye-jin.

1120
01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.888
That's because...

1121
01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.973
But you know,

1122
01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:48.295
I don't miss him that much either.

1123
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.296
What?

1124
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.314
Maybe it's because we've been apart for so long.

1125
01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:56.136
He feels like a stranger.

1126
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.654
I don't feel attached to him.

1127
01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.948
So I wanted you to know that...

1128
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:06.188
you don't have to put up with him because of us.

1129
01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.372
Just get a divorce.

1130
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.860
Being divorced isn't a big deal these days.

1131
01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:15.045
There are three divorced families...

1132
01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:17.032
in my kindergarten.

1133
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.952
At first they threw a fit
and even refused to eat,

1134
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:23.205
but now they run about happier than ever.

1135
01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.806
It's such a mess.

1136
01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.725
So...

1137
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.881
stop worrying about us,

1138
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:35.482
and start living your own life.

1139
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.514
If there's one thing I learned in all my years,

1140
01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:43.225
it's that there isn't much to life.

1141
01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:46.118
You just have to live happily...

1142
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.413
with the people you love, right?

1143
01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:52.541
You love us.

1144
01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.627
And we love you too.

1145
01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:58.004
So please,

1146
01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:02.259
let's just live happily by ourselves.

1147
01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:06.388
I'll marry Mr. Kang-ho in the future...

1148
01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.015
and take good care of you.

1149
01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:15.716
Come here, my baby.

1150
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.275
Goodness, come here.

1151
01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.139
You little thing.

1152
01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.349
You must've been worried sick.

1153
01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.826
It must've been so hard for you.

1154
01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:30.579
I'm sorry.

1155
01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.331
I'm...

1156
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.959
such a bad mom.

1157
01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:39.880
I'm such a bad mom.

1158
01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.492
You're crying again.

1159
01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:44.038
- What?
- You haven't smiled once...

1160
01:07:44.062 --> 01:07:47.056
since you've come back here.

1161
01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:51.349
I want to see you smile.

1162
01:07:51.692 --> 01:07:54.463
Because you're not a bad mom,

1163
01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.980
but a pretty mom.

1164
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.333
Hello?

1165
01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.294
What?

1166
01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:23.200
There's smoke coming from the farm?

1167
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.509
Yes, okay.

1168
01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:27.761
Yes, I'll check now.

1169
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.350
Kang-ho.

1170
01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.920
Kang-ho, wake up.

1171
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.270
There's smoke coming from the farm.

1172
01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.894
Mom.

1173
01:08:50.918 --> 01:08:52.911
Oh, no!

1174
01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.149
- Mom.
- Our pigs!

1175
01:08:56.173 --> 01:08:58.625
Guys, wake up!

1176
01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.320
We need to leave.

1177
01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:02.030
- We have to get out.
- No.

1178
01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:04.005
We have to get out!

1179
01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.618
- Mom, no.
- Our pigs.

1180
01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.036
- Mom, we have to go!
- Let go!

1181
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.955
- We have to go!
- Let go!

1182
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.375
- No!
- We have to go now!

1183
01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.892
No!

1184
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.737
Mom.

1185
01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.228
- No!
- It won't open.

1186
01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:35.036
Why won't it open?

1187
01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.831
Mom.

1188
01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:55.542
Mom, come here. This way.

1189
01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.587
Mom, we have to get out of here.

1190
01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.630
- Mom, get out of here. Now.
- No.

1191
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:03.258
- Mom, we have to leave now!
- No.

1192
01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.259
Come on.

1193
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:05.886
Mom!

1194
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.971
Kang-ho, you go first.

1195
01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.556
- You go...
- No, Mom.

1196
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.074
You have to get out first. Mom!

1197
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.855
You have to leave. I'll follow you out, okay?

1198
01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.106
Come on.

1199
01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:20.832
Hurry.

1200
01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:23.126
Mom.

1201
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.464
Mom.

1202
01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:58.870
<i>Yong-yong, have you been well?</i>

1203
01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.274
<i>Yong-yong.</i>

1204
01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:02.692
<i>Do you copy, Yong-yong?</i>

1205
01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:04.960
<i>Do you remember Daddy's voice?</i>

1206
01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.504
What are you up to?

1207
01:11:07.554 --> 01:11:09.381
Are you still asleep?

1208
01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.785
<i>It's time to get up.</i>

1209
01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.995
<i>Wake up and play with me.</i>

1210
01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:16.164
<i>My dear son,</i>

1211
01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:19.391
<i>it's time to wake up.</i>

1212
01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:41.672
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1213
01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:02.961
<i>Fire!</i>

1214
01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.047
<i>Are you saying Kang-ho is in there?</i>

1215
01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:10.275
<i>Was it you? Were you the girl
he wrote about in his journal?</i>

1216
01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:13.346
<i>Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?</i>

1217
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.056
{\an8}<i>I really need to see Ha-young.</i>

1218
01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.116
{\an8}<i>Did you have that much fun with her?</i>

1219
01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:23.955
{\an8}<i>Mr. Choi, you're under arrest on
suspicion of murdering Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun.</i>

1220
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:26.750
{\an8}<i>I'm going to protect Kang-ho.</i>

1221
01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:30.822
{\an8}<i>Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years...</i>

1222
01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.073
{\an8}<i>because of you.</i>

1223
01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:33.908
{\an8}<i>Do you think she's really here?</i>

1224
01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:36.968
{\an8}<i>She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.</i>
