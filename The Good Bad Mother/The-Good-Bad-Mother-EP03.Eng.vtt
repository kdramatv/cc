- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.122
- Did you...?
- Bring it up.

Hey, come on.

16
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.917
- Here.
- Is it burned there?

17

Push it.

- Yes.

Wake up, Kang-ho.

Kang-ho...

23
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.654
No!

No!

25
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:05.976
No, Kang-ho!

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.895
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Kang-ho!

27
00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.537
Kang-ho!

28
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.067
Please save him!

29
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.485
My son!

30
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:15.820
My baby!

31

My baby! Please save him!

32
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.089
Please!

we successfully stopped the hemorrhaging.

35
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.999
But his brain and body remain swollen.

36
00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.127
His cervical spine was fractured,

37
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.212
<i>and he suffered an injury to his spinal cord.</i>

38
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.964
<i>Even if he gains consciousness,</i>

39
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:39.775
<i>I'm afraid he won't be able to return
to his normal life for some time.</i>

40
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.720
<i>Food?</i>

41
00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.697
You're inviting me to eat,

42
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.909
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

43
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.547
You're dozing off because
you're full and it's warm.

44
00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.843
Study.

45
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.891
You got it wrong again.

46
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.839
Learning Chinese characters
is mandatory for the bar exam.

47
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.774
Rewrite the ones you got wrong a
hundred times and memorize them again.

48
00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.472
Run!

49
00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.266
Darn it.

50
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.158
What is he...?

51
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.619
Mom...

52
00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.987
You'll doze off on a full stomach.

53
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.671
I told you a million times.

54
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.506
Okay.

<i><font color="#ffff00">Dowon Hospital</font></i>

56
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.763
You should eat.

57
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:10.741
How could she have an appetite
when her child is dying?

58
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.660
Dying?

59
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.981
Who's dying?

60
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.832
He's still breathing.

61
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.130
Both his pulse and blood pressure are stable.

62
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.993
His hands and feet are warm.

63
00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.761
His body is still functioning.

64
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.015
My son won't die.

65
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.601
No.

66
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.104
I won't...

67
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.566
I won't let him die.

71

{\an8}Yes!

72
00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.204
{\an8}Good throw. Nice play!

73
00:04:57.588 --> 00:05:00.290
{\an8}- Well done.
- It's all thanks to you.

74
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.947
{\an8}This is how our team made
it to the Korean Series...

75
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.908
{\an8}after only two years in the league.

76
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.120
{\an8}You were terrific today! Applause!

77
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.579
{\an8}You were incredible!

78
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.596
{\an8}Goodness. Yes?

79
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.251
{\an8}Prosecutor Choi was in an accident.

80
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.269
{\an8}He's in the ICU at Dowon Hospital.

81
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.771
What?

82
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.440
What a mess.

83
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.583
He could've just forged the document.

84
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:46.920
Yet he went all the way
there just to get that seal?

85
00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:50.775
What about the other driver?

86
00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.619
They haven't been identified yet.

87
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.914
The roads are blanketed with
CCTV cameras these days,

88
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.666
yet they can't find the guy?

89
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.335
The truck was a burner vehicle.

90
00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.713
Also, it was found after it'd been set on fire,

91
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.716
and no fingerprints were recovered.

92
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.675
What?

93
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.734
A burner vehicle?

94
00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:10.986
It was a burner vehicle?

95
00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.974
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.893
Right. Hold on.

97
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.036
What happened to Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

98
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:50.526
It's okay.

99
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.034
What happened?

100
00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.748
He most likely won't make it.

101
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.674
Well done.

102
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.595
Kang-ho.

103
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.191
Hold on.

104
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.667
That means...

105
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.713
he's still alive.

106
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.075
What do we do?

107
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.633
What if...

108
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.678
they find out?

109
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.524
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Chairman Song</font></i>

110
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:12.384
I'll take care of that, so don't worry.

111
00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.860
Just rest up for a few days.

112
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:34.948
Hello, Chairman Song.

113
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:37.451
Goodness. Thank God.

114
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:41.595
I heard your daughter wasn't
in the car when it happened.

115
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.082
<i>What a relief.</i>

116
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.085
My heart is still heavy when
I think of Prosecutor Choi.

117
00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:48.837
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

118
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.883
I just saw him, and it broke my heart.

119
00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:57.054
Anyway, both you and your
daughter must be shocked.

120
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.139
Take care of yourselves.

121
00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:03.393
Let's catch up in person soon.

122
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:05.118
Goodbye.

123
00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:08.273
He has a heavy heart?

124
00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:11.583
Find that hit-and-run driver this instant.

125
00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.297
Darn it! Everything's ruined!

126
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.595
Of course.

127
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.000
Everything else is fine.

128
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:30.477
But he hurt his leg,

129
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.131
so it'll take some time for him to recover.

130
00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:37.511
I asked them to find an experienced farmhand.

131
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:41.238
But it's hard to hire anyone
since it's farming season.

132
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:44.142
Thank you in advance, Mr. Son.

133
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.187
Don't worry about the pigs,

134
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.772
and just focus on Kang-ho.

135
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:53.083
Yes. All right, bye.

136
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.321
What did she say?

137
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:57.489
How is Kang-ho?

138
00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:59.783
He must've broken his leg.

139
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:01.910
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

140
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.246
He broke his mom's heart when he left.

141
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.039
He's being punished for it.

142
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:09.251
Gosh, don't say something
like that about our neighbor.

143
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.962
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

144
00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.979
She's a fool.

145
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.883
She was always fixated on his studies.

146
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:20.137
All her hard work only made
him into such an impudent son.

147
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.139
As a parent,

148
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.350
you shouldn't bad-mouth another parent's child.

149
00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:30.120
Honestly, Sam-sik is the
most impudent one of all.

150
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.944
What do you mean?

151
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.821
Why are you bringing him up right now?

152
00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.381
I mean, it's not like he did anything serious.

153
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.912
Are you serious right now?

154
00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.289
Let's be frank.

155
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:51.251
Raise your hand if you've
never been robbed by him.

156
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:53.962
From watermelons and red peppers to rice wine...

157
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:58.967
I still don't get why he stole
that talisman from Mr. Son's gate.

158
00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.261
- Gosh.
- Even a talisman?

159
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:04.196
Have you gone insane?

160
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.559
I'm going to kill you with my own hands today!

161
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.269
- Stop it.
- Goodness!

162
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.646
- Gosh!
- What are you doing?

163
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.897
Gosh, that's enough!

164
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.690
- That's enough!
- Hello.

165
00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:16.860
Why did you bring that dog when we're eating?

166
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:18.904
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

167
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.129
Is the food ready?

168
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.493
You're having the awful spicy noodles.

169
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.245
- What?
- What did you just say?

170
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.789
The food is what?

171
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.972
Awful.

172
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.002
What? You said the same thing.

173
00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:37.646
You said Sung-ae couldn't cook to save her life.

174
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.966
Don't eat it.

175
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.218
- Don't eat it.
- What?

176
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.260
Don't eat it!

177
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.261
- Come on.
- Sung-ae.

178
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.846
- Bring it back!
- Bring it back!

179
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.823
Why are they always fighting?

180
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.352
They're setting an awful example for us.

181
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.729
At least we'll learn how to fight well.

182
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.538
Goodness me.

183
00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.166
Excuse me.

184
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.627
Hello?

185
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.033
We're fully booked for the next two days.

186
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.050
One minute.

187
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.372
There's an opening this Friday at 8 p.m.

188
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.500
Okay. I'll reserve it for you.

189
00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.475
Thank you. Goodbye.

190
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.546
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.231
You're raking in all the
money in this neighborhood.

192
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.469
I wish Bo-bae would quit her studies...

193
00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.430
and learn some useful skills like this.

194
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:27.806
She's always hanging out...

195
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.142
with her friends at night,
saying she's studying.

196
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.227
She needs to be more careful.

197
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:36.815
A rape and murder case occurred
in the next neighborhood.

198
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.191
Right. I heard.

199
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:41.027
He followed her knowing she lives alone,

200
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.280
and attacked her as soon as she opened the door.

201
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.032
Really? So did they catch him?

202
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:47.909
No. That's why everyone is panicking.

203
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.536
You guys live alone too, right?

204
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.288
You should be careful.

205
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.931
They ought to catch and grind him up.

206
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.979
That's pretty.

207
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.761
<i>It's a miracle he can breathe on his own.</i>

208
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:10.307
<i>Let's move him to a general
ward and monitor him.</i>

209
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:14.603
In the general ward, you're
responsible for taking care of his waste.

210
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.646
The drainage bag is connected here.

211
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.857
This is the suppository.

212
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.651
He could get an infection without proper care,

213
00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:23.778
so please pay close attention.

214
00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.462
Okay.

215
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:39.768
<i>The number you have called
does not exist. Please check...</i>

216
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:46.927
Excuse me.

217
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.387
Can I confirm her number again?

218
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:52.140
You've already done so three times, ma'am.

219
00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:55.602
Then why does it say that
the number doesn't exist?

220
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:56.770
Maybe it doesn't.

221
00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.579
Or maybe she changed her number.

222
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.819
Then could you give me
her home number or address?

223
00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:08.615
Ma'am, we aren't allowed to disclose
such information to strangers.

224
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.174
I'm not a stranger.

225
00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:14.538
She's my son's fiancée and my daughter-in-law.

226
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.164
Ma'am.

227
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.793
Mothers don't usually ask a
hospital's administration office...

228
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:23.019
for their daughter-in-law's number.

229
00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:09.899
- Mom!
- Mom!

230
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.554
Really?

231
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.764
Ms. Jo taught you English?

232
00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:16.573
What did you learn?

233
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:29.002
Why did that woman teach
them such terrifying words?

234
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.072
Guys, don't meet her anymore.

235
00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.157
No.

236
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.993
We need to learn English
if we want to see you soon.

237
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.345
<i>I love the U.S.</i>

238
00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.837
All right.

239
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:50.357
<i>I hope you learn English
quickly so we can live together.</i>

240
00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:56.348
By the way, who's that guy behind you?

241
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.073
What?

242
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:08.443
Stop pranking me and go to bed, okay?

243
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.669
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

244
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.911
<i>A rape and murder case occurred...</i>

245
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.804
in the next neighborhood.

246
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:34.067
Mi-joo.

247
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.865
What are you doing?

248
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.411
Mi-joo!

249
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.208
Bang Sam-sik?

250
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.669
Darn it.

251
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.618
You have all those normal
clothes, and you gave me this?

252
00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.219
What? Do I?

253
00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.208
You should've just gone
home after you wer released.

254
00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:07.559
Why did you come here?

255
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.394
Goodness.

256
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.856
I'm seriously regretting it myself.

257
00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:18.430
Right. I'm supposed to give you
tofu since you've been released.

258
00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.432
- You already gave me something.
- What?

259
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.323
A good beating.

260
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.868
A painful one.

261
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.706
By the way, how did you know I lived here?

262
00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:32.709
Well...

263
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.447
A long time ago,

264
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.532
you said it was your dream...

265
00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.160
to open up your own nail salon.

266
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.119
Right.

267
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:44.497
You said the name would be Nail & Nail,

268
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.999
and how brilliant the idea was.

269
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:48.710
So I looked up the name just in case.

270
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.712
And guess what? I found it.

271
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.298
You're incredible. You remembered that?

272
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.690
Of course I did.

273
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:58.887
I remember watching you being
born while I was being carried...

274
00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.488
on my mom's back.

275
00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:04.642
I'm the first guy who saw you naked.

276
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.102
- You lunatic.
- Goodness.

277
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.062
You were pretty.

278
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.870
Gosh.

279
00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:16.211
I never visited you while you were incarcerated.

280
00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:18.573
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.784
Why would you visit me...

282
00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:23.286
when I was incarcerated for committing a crime?

283
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.288
You didn't commit a crime.

284
00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:27.999
You were used by those bad guys.

285
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:30.350
You were merely a victim.

286
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.419
Mi-joo.

287
00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.046
Yes?

288
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.090
I realized being like that...

289
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:38.551
was the worst sin you could commit.

290
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.109
What?

291
00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.695
Letting others use you.

292
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.782
And...

293
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:49.104
not being able to do anything
about it because you have no power,

294
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.204
money, or connections.

295
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.529
Just take it.

296
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.337
It's free.

297
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.743
From what I heard,

298
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:06.871
working on fishing vessels is hard work.

299
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.289
Take care of yourself.

300
00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.974
And don't get caught stealing things again.

301
00:19:11.608 --> 00:19:14.435
If I ever steal anything again,

302
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.146
it's going to be your heart.

303
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.401
- Bye.
- Do you still like Kang-ho?

304
00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:23.972
- What are you talking about? Go.
- Do you?

305
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.057
What's with you? Go!

306
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.783
Just go. Go home safely.

307
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.870
Let's be honest, I'm way more handsome than him.

308
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.523
Yes, you're right.

309
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.150
You're more handsome.

310
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.527
Thanks for today and this gift. Go now.

311
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.112
- You're handsome.
- But...

312
00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.837
Bye.

313
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:51.315
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Release</font></i>

314
00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.559
Goodness.

315
00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:59.355
Goodness. Look at the size of this gem.

316
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.800
Goodness.

317
00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.611
This is bigger than Mr. Son's tomatoes.

318
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.808
You're supposed to buy your parents
longjohns with your first paycheck.

319
00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:11.144
But you can't flaunt that,

320
00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:13.855
and you like to show off.

321
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.607
I also felt bad...

322
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:19.444
that you lost your wedding ring ages ago.

323
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.362
I never lost it.

324
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.698
I hid it in the <i>doenjang</i> crock...

325
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.575
so you wouldn't steal it.

326
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.177
But you still found it and sold it.

327
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.348
I felt so happy back then.

328
00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.876
- What?
- Because...

329
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.228
I truly despised the ring
your dad had gotten for me.

330
00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:43.593
The gem was so tiny, it was barely visible.

331
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.261
What?

332
00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:48.473
You'd gained a lot of weight back then,

333
00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.350
so the fat was covering the gem.

334
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.742
Thank you so much, Sam-sik.

335
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:54.187
Goodness, Sam-sik.

336
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.688
- My baby.
- What are you doing?

337
00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:56.689
- Come here.
- What...?

338
00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:58.608
Goodness, my baby.

339
00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.069
I can't believe you got me a ring.

340
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:05.046
- Gosh, you precious thing.
- Goodness!

341
00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.450
It's nothing.

342
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:09.786
Just live a long life.

343
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.705
I'll make tons of money so
you can live comfortably.

344
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:14.832
- Gosh, my baby.
- Anyone home?

345
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:15.959
Let me go!

346
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.212
I didn't steal it! I got it as my paycheck!

347
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.005
All right. Let's talk at the station.

348
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.799
Can you please just hear him out?

349
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:25.775
He said they gave it to him!

350
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.595
Was he going to steal things...

351
00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.555
to make our lives comfortable?

352
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.781
Was that it?

353
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.467
Bye.

354
00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:52.745
- Bye.
- Dad.

355
00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:54.330
- Hey.
- Gosh.

356
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:56.222
Goodness.

357
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:02.672
Excuse me!

358
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.675
Our son hasn't come out yet.

359
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.276
- What's his name?
- Bang Sam-sik.

360
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.557
He's...

361
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.975
not on the list.

362
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.936
- What?
- That can't be.

363
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.398
He said he needed money for a release deposit,

364
00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:24.125
so I transferred it to him yesterday.

365
00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:25.778
A release deposit?

366
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.697
You know,

367
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:31.841
it's to guarantee he'll behave once he's out.

368
00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.927
There's no such thing.

369
00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:39.640
Release deposits don't exist!

370
00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:42.503
My goodness!

371
00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:45.146
Do you know a Bang Sam-sik?

372
00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:46.466
Of course I do.

373
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.384
- He was released a week ago.
- What?

374
00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:50.344
- A week ago?
- Yes.

375
00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:52.221
I was totally speechless.

376
00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:55.516
He stole the penitentiary's
towels, soap, and toothpaste.

377
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.241
Let's go.

378
00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.104
- Darn it!
- Wait.

379
00:23:00.128 --> 00:23:03.623
How much did you send him?

380
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:05.958
$5000...

381
00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:16.135
You son of a gun!

382
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:22.627
Then is it Ms. Jung's fault for laying
out the pesticide bottles by the road?

383
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:29.190
Or is it Mr. Son's fault for
running over them on his bike?

384
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:42.245
My son is a prosecutor at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

385
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.941
He got the top score on the bar exam.

386
00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:46.999
Goodness.

387
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:54.382
Look. My eyes aren't even.

388
00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:57.995
Can I retrieve the land even if
it's under my brother's name?

389
00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.831
- This is about your land?
- Correct.

390
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:01.874
She'd taken out a dozen insurances.

391
00:24:01.898 --> 00:24:04.961
- He turned out to be married.
- Oh, dear.

392
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.588
Please put in a good word
for me once he wakes up.

393
00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.674
- Please.
- Okay.

394
00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:10.842
- Thanks.
- Goodness.

395
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.260
No, I'm sorry.

396
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.761
- That's it for today.
- But...

397
00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.720
Come again tomorrow.

398
00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:16.097
What about just me?

399
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.056
Gosh.

400
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.156
She's done for the day.

401
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:26.566
Kang-ho.

402
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.291
Look at this.

403
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:32.044
They're all waiting for you to wake up.

404
00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.798
So...

405
00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:38.718
wake up soon, okay?

406
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:52.231
Your fingernails have grown so much.

407
00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.829
Nurse.

408
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.207
Nurse!

409
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.904
Nurse!

410
00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:57.073
Kang-ho woke up!

411
00:25:57.097 --> 00:26:00.034
My son woke up!

412
00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.759
Kang-ho!

413
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:05.790
Kang-ho. It's me, Mom.

414
00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.875
Do you recognize me?

415
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:10.378
Kang-ho! It's me.

416
00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.103
Your mom.

417
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.717
What's wrong?

418
00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:20.027
It's me, Kang-ho.

419
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:26.352
As of now we've given him
all the immediate treatments.

420
00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.768
The rehabilitation department...

421
00:26:27.792 --> 00:26:29.939
will take over...

422
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:32.149
and monitor him.

423
00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:33.818
Doctor.

424
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.571
He'll be able to walk again, right?

425
00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:40.074
As long as we keep up with the treatment.

426
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.158
Right?

427
00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:45.204
Let's hope for the best as
he receives his treatment.

428
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:48.499
I've seen many patients
walk again after rehabilitation.

429
00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:50.850
- I see.
- However,

430
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:54.880
you need to understand
he'll be very different...

431
00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:57.633
from the person he used to be.

432
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:59.343
When you injure your head,

433
00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:03.347
you sometimes lose most of
the memories prior to the accident.

434
00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:06.350
And as for your son, he only has memories...

435
00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.394
of his childhood.

436
00:27:08.418 --> 00:27:11.814
So it's like he's become a child once again.

437
00:27:11.838 --> 00:27:15.359
He also lacks cognitive ability right now.

438
00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.820
We call that retrograde amnesia.

439
00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:20.046
He's like...

440
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.325
a seven-year-old right now.

441
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:25.926
A seven-year-old?

442
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.664
Simply put, he's...

443
00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:30.473
- ...stupid?
- ...stupid.

444
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:34.712
Well, maybe not to that extent, but...

445
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:37.688
Anyway, let's keep an eye on him.

446
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.690
Okay.

447
00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:45.139
Thank you.

448
00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.849
- You should go now.
- Yes, ma'am.

449
00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:50.186
And could you keep the siren off?

450
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.994
Okay.

451
00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:28.057
Ms. Jin?

452
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:29.865
Yes.

453
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.936
Hey, you're back.

454
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.479
You're back.

455
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:36.539
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Not at all.

456
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.276
Pour our guest a drink first.

457
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.420
I refuse to drink alcohol.

458
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:44.490
Goodness.

459
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:47.576
He flew in from Canada six months ago.

460
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.247
He understands Korean but can't speak it.

461
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:55.126
You're majoring in Korean
at Chungjin University, right?

462
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.836
You're correct.

463
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.921
- Right.
- You said...

464
00:28:58.945 --> 00:29:01.924
you needed help with your farm.

465
00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:05.720
His father runs a pig farm back in Canada.

466
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:08.639
He wanted to learn about Korean pig farms...

467
00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:12.893
and the language itself,
so he's working part-time here.

468
00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.562
Your name is Andrea, right?

469
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:15.688
Yes.

470
00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:17.189
That's his name.

471
00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:18.816
I don't know what your name means,

472
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.861
but if I had to guess, I'd say
it means something like "impolite."

473
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.572
Because you're not pouring me a drink!

474
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.548
- Pour him some.
- Pour me some.

475
00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:30.926
It must be so tough for you all.

476
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:36.390
Don't regard it as a hardship.

477
00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:42.298
What kind of jerk is teaching
you such difficult words?

478
00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:43.924
This jerk.

479
00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.742
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffa07a">Korean: Don't Regard It as a Hardship</font></i>

480
00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:48.429
Gosh.

481
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.181
By the way,

482
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:53.934
has Kang-ho been discharged from the hospital?

483
00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.534
Yes.

484
00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:57.146
Goodness.

485
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.692
It must've bothered him to
have treated you so harshly.

486
00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:05.211
That's why he drove recklessly
and got into an accident.

487
00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.908
I can't tell you when it'll be,

488
00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:13.621
but when they set their date again,
make sure you're there at the wedding.

489
00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:18.265
You must do that as his mom.

490
00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:21.170
Okay.

491
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.380
Why did she plant so many?

492
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:27.066
This saves her money from buying pig feed.

493
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.930
She's always been hard-working.

494
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:34.225
What good is that when she has an impudent son?

495
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:37.660
Gosh. There you go again.

496
00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:42.289
But then again, I'm in no
position to bad-mouth her son.

497
00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:46.961
- When is Sam-sik being released?
- When is Mi-joo coming?

498
00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:52.174
Let's get back to work.

499
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.468
Let's do that.

500
00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:59.291
- I'm sorry.
- What?

501
00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:01.767
- Goodness.
- Don't be.

502
00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:03.838
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

503
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.549
- It's been a while.
- This is killing me.

504
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.676
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

505
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.970
Gosh, I guess it was strenuous.

506
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.888
I'm sore all over.

507
00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:14.098
Of course.

508
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:16.350
- Gosh, I'm exhausted.
- Gum-ja, here.

509
00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:18.227
Goodness. What are you doing?

510
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:19.603
I don't need that.

511
00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.772
I'm doing this for my sake.

512
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:23.315
You must be insane.

513
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:26.667
You're making us feel bad.

514
00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:30.990
Gosh, you're making me feel bad.

515
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:33.576
We didn't even visit Kang-ho at the hospital.

516
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.744
Right. Where is he?

517
00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:37.746
Is he here with you?

518
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.831
Well...

519
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:39.874
No.

520
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:42.251
Why would he be here?

521
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.253
He's probably back at his own home.

522
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.130
He's a successful prosecutor.

523
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:49.174
He must have work piled up after
months of being at the hospital.

524
00:31:49.198 --> 00:31:50.551
Thank goodness.

525
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.846
I was worried sick.

526
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.946
Is he all better now?

527
00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:58.073
Yes.

528
00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:08.959
Kang-ho, aren't you hungry?

529
00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:10.878
Let's eat.

530
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:27.978
Do you remember this?

531
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.673
This was your first birthday.

532
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:32.801
You're holding a gavel.

533
00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:35.888
You were destined to become a prosecutor.

534
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:37.488
Don't you agree?

535
00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:41.477
And this was your elementary-school graduation.

536
00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:45.564
We had our first heavy snow in 30 years,
so the graduation took place in the gym.

537
00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:48.484
And this was your middle-school graduation.

538
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:51.487
You received an award
in front of the entire school.

539
00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:53.781
I was on cloud nine.

540
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:56.408
And this was your high-school graduation.

541
00:32:56.432 --> 00:33:00.928
And this was taken at the institute
after you passed the bar exam.

542
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:05.474
After the ceremony, we
ate at the cafeteria there.

543
00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:10.229
We had seasoned <i>deodeok, bulgogi,</i>
and winter-cabbage-<i>doenjang</i> soup.

544
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.899
You really enjoyed them.

545
00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.158
Ta-da.

546
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:32.626
Here.

547
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.586
Open up.

548
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.410
What's the matter?

549
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.829
You're off the IV fluids, so you need to eat.

550
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.164
Come on. Just one spoon.

551
00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.848
Here.

552
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.850
What...?

553
00:33:48.443 --> 00:33:50.921
What's the matter with you?

554
00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:54.398
Kang-ho, just one spoon.

555
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.071
Young-soon.

556
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.240
Hey.

557
00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:05.159
You were home.

558
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.229
What brings you here?

559
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:09.023
You've been away for months.

560
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:11.832
Your kimchi must've gone bad,

561
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:14.168
so I brought some <i>geotjeori.</i>

562
00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:16.822
This is beef-bone soup.

563
00:34:16.846 --> 00:34:21.493
You must've been sick of eating hospital food.

564
00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:24.580
So enjoy this hot meal.

565
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:25.664
Gosh.

566
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:27.973
You didn't have to.

567
00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:31.462
Is someone here?

568
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:32.963
Sorry?

569
00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:34.256
What do you mean?

570
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.523
There are two sets of utensils.

571
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:38.385
- Well...
- You're right.

572
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:42.029
What's going on? Are you
hiding someone in there?

573
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.599
No.

574
00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:45.449
This smells fishy.

575
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.061
Don't tell me...

576
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.146
you seduced a young doctor.

577
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.371
Of course not.

578
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.070
Wait! Hold on!

579
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.821
Who's there?

580
00:34:57.845 --> 00:35:00.574
What? It's Kang-ho.

581
00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:03.077
People will say it's punishment.

582
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.578
Young-soon.

583
00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:07.304
They'll say it would've been better...

584
00:35:08.147 --> 00:35:10.793
if he'd died instead of living like that.

585
00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:12.419
Who'd say such a thing?

586
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:14.144
I did.

587
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:18.300
I thought that way when I saw
others in similar situations.

588
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:19.843
But you know what?

589
00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.735
I was wrong.

590
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:24.154
Now that I'm going through it,

591
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.699
I know I was wrong.

592
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.118
I'm just...

593
00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:34.373
so grateful he's still alive.

594
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.625
My Kang-ho.

595
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.878
My one-and-only child.

596
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.549
I'm just...

597
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:46.051
truly thankful he survived...

598
00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:49.721
the accident.

599
00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.686
I really am.

600
00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:03.762
What? Kang-ho?

601
00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:05.821
I'm telling you.

602
00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:11.186
She used to always gloat...

603
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.522
that her son was a prosecutor.

604
00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:17.943
You really never know what can happen to you.

605
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:21.155
You should watch what you say.

606
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.866
When did she ever gloat?

607
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:28.760
It may not have been obvious, but she did.

608
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:32.457
I can't believe you. What's the matter with you?

609
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:35.309
Whatever.

610
00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:38.812
I'm just upset about it.

611
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.474
Gosh.

612
00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:52.978
Either stop dieting or stop eating meat.

613
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:54.771
Choose one!

614
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:56.622
Be quiet!

615
00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.652
You'd better not...

616
00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:03.488
run your mouth at the mill.

617
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:05.616
What? Run my mouth?

618
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.701
Unbelievable.

619
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:10.495
What do you take me for?

620
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.289
I'm not like you.

621
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:15.209
You have no idea how tight-lipped I am.

622
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:20.088
If I was born during the Japanese colonization,

623
00:37:20.112 --> 00:37:24.176
I would've been someone like Mr. Kim Gu.

624
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:30.098
Mr. Kim Gu once said this.

625
00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:36.828
"In the end, everything stems from yourself."

626
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:39.149
So you'd better not run your...

627
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:41.944
I mean, you'd better not tell a soul about this.

628
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.028
Got it?

629
00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:46.198
Anyway, this is a secret.

630
00:37:46.222 --> 00:37:48.158
So you can't tell anyone.

631
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:52.287
♫ <i>Kang-ho is stupid</i> ♫

632
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:54.456
♫ <i>It's a secret</i> ♫

633
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.627
♫ <i>so you can't tell anyone</i> ♫

634
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:02.854
♫ <i>Kang-ho is stupid</i> ♫

635
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.970
What?

636
00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:11.181
I thought he just injured his leg.

637
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:14.142
Did you take your evening
medication before you heard that?

638
00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:15.477
Of course.

639
00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:17.479
If I misheard them,

640
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:20.649
you can chop off my ears with a chainsaw.

641
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:23.694
What are you talking about?

642
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.612
And why would I do that?

643
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:28.240
I'd just burst your eardrums.

644
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:31.368
Hold on. That's not important right now.

645
00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:34.579
Then what will happen to Kang-ho?

646
00:38:34.603 --> 00:38:36.707
Nothing more will happen to him.

647
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.307
He's already stupid.

648
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:57.909
I'm sorry for keeping you out here by yourself.

649
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.246
I just don't want you...

650
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:04.583
to see him...

651
00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.794
in that condition.

652
00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:11.381
But...

653
00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.369
you know me, right?

654
00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:16.970
I'll never give up.

655
00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:22.684
Everyone had lost hope.
They said he'd never wake up.

656
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.228
But look.

657
00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:27.939
He survived.

658
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.318
And since he survived,

659
00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.196
I'm going to make him live.

660
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:38.518
He'll get up, walk, and even run.

661
00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.911
He's seven now.

662
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:46.458
He'll be eight next year
and nine the year after.

663
00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:51.129
I'll raise him all over again.

664
00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:56.218
Just watch and see.

665
00:39:56.602 --> 00:39:58.413
Our son...

666
00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:00.764
will walk out of that room.

667
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.974
He'll stand here...

668
00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.936
and look at you.

669
00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:08.730
I'll make sure he does.

670
00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:11.608
No matter what.

671
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.591
<i><font color="#ffff00">Clean and Odor-Free
Korean Smart Piggery</font></i>

672
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:33.990
You're so handsome.

673
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:36.800
Did you sleep well?

674
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.273
Doesn't this look tasty?

675
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.066
Here.

676
00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:54.678
It's tasty.

677
00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:55.971
Cluck, cluck.

678
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.530
Knock, knock.

679
00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.878
Lord!

680
00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:29.087
I pray...

681
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:32.132
- My Kang-ho...
- My son started his own business.

682
00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:34.384
I pray it'll flourish.

683
00:41:34.408 --> 00:41:36.720
Can you hear me?

684
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:41.114
- I pray to you, Lord.
- Please save my son!

685
00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.602
You're a mother too.

686
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:47.162
So I'm sure you can empathize with me.

687
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.626
<i>Please.</i>

688
00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:55.530
<i>I pray...</i>

689
00:41:55.554 --> 00:41:58.048
<i>that he'll at least eat.</i>

690
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:01.578
Ta-da.

691
00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:03.163
Here.

692
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.804
Just one bite.

693
00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:13.063
They made pumpkin porridge for you.

694
00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:15.982
Just one bite.

695
00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.737
It's so tasty.

696
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.407
It's a fish.

697
00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.330
Come on.

698
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:42.676
You need to eat this.

699
00:43:09.169 --> 00:43:11.371
What's all this?

700
00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:13.066
There's sesame oil,

701
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.735
ricecake, red chili powder...

702
00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.320
Where's the rice?

703
00:43:17.344 --> 00:43:19.546
Hold this for me.

704
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.423
What is this?

705
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.769
It's dead.

706
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.106
Is it?

707
00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:42.944
Goodness me.

708
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.432
Darn it.

709
00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:48.727
What kind of a lunatic
put an eel in a rice bowl,

710
00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:50.312
and put it out here?

711
00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:51.911
It was me.

712
00:43:52.004 --> 00:43:53.106
What?

713
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.108
Your wife caught it...

714
00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:58.778
by the stream while taking a walk.

715
00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:02.157
She told me to bring it here
because it was a wild eel.

716
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.076
She scared me to death a few
days ago when she brought home...

717
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.093
a wild rattlesnake.

718
00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:10.832
Since we're here,

719
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:13.585
shouldn't we go inside and check on them?

720
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:16.311
Right, we should.

721
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:18.772
Gosh.

722
00:44:21.116 --> 00:44:23.360
Young-soon.

723
00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.528
Young-soon?

724
00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:28.740
What are you doing there?

725
00:44:28.874 --> 00:44:31.102
Goodness. There you were.

726
00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:33.813
Come here.

727
00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.081
We just came...

728
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:38.860
to give you this.

729
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:42.530
This tea is made with mulberry
branches. He should try it.

730
00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:44.115
- Mulberry branches?
- Yes.

731
00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:49.788
Apparently this is helpful for
people who suffer from paralysis.

732
00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:53.541
We all suffer from paralysis
at least once in our lifetime.

733
00:44:53.565 --> 00:44:55.126
Don't you agree?

734
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.253
Right. I may not catch the flu,

735
00:44:57.277 --> 00:45:00.438
but I get paralyzed every now and then.

736
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.691
What is that?

737
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.805
I was at a bookstore in town today.

738
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:10.308
This was recommended as a bestseller,

739
00:45:10.332 --> 00:45:12.727
so I bought one.

740
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:15.203
You like to read.

741
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:18.191
I also got these.

742
00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:23.071
You can watch them when you're alone and lonely.

743
00:45:23.095 --> 00:45:26.032
Make sure you watch them by yourself.

744
00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:27.975
<i><font color="#ffff00">Barefoot Ki-bong</font></i>

745
00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.479
<i><font color="#ffff00">Marathon</font></i>

746
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:40.019
Don't do this.

747
00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:43.857
If you keep doing this,

748
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.651
I'll become weak.

749
00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:50.113
I'll want to rely on others.

750
00:45:50.622 --> 00:45:52.323
But...

751
00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:54.993
But I can't do that.

752
00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:57.439
I need to stay strong.

753
00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.122
So please...

754
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.972
There's a saying.

755
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.726
"A mother..."

756
00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:24.564
"can replace anything in this world."

757
00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.692
"But nothing..."

758
00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:32.488
"can replace a mother."

759
00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:41.024
We aren't asking you to rely on us.

760
00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:44.417
Yes, you should stay strong.

761
00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:47.879
You're a mom, after all, right?

762
00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.983
<i><font color="#ffff00">Choi Kang-ho</font></i>

763
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:23.757
<i><font color="#ffff00">Yong-yong</font></i>

764
00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.709
"Mom"?

765
00:47:27.135 --> 00:47:28.154
"Mom"?

766
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:31.256
Well done. "Mom."

767
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.790
Walk.

768
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:41.417
That's it.

769
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:42.961
Come here.

770
00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:45.728
My Kang-ho. Good boy.

771
00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.433
- Is this me?
- Yes.

772
00:47:57.457 --> 00:48:00.410
Gosh, I look pretty. Thank you.

773
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.317
This is you.

774
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:08.418
<i>And this is me.</i>

775
00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:16.518
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Korean

776
00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:26.144
Well done.

777
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.574
This is a slingshot.

778
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.728
This is a <i>ddakji.</i>

779
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.536
This is a top.

780
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:48.333
Your dad bought this robot
for you before you were born.

781
00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.570
You were always playing with it.

782
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:53.489
It was your favorite robot.

783
00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:55.340
Do you remember?

784
00:48:57.809 --> 00:48:59.245
Come on.

785
00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.512
Are you sleeping again?

786
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.834
Kang-ho, you should eat something.

787
00:49:04.858 --> 00:49:08.019
You haven't eaten anything for days.

788
00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:11.981
Kang-ho.

789
00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:15.526
Kang-ho?

790
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:18.598
What's wrong with you?

791
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.224
Kang-ho.

792
00:49:20.248 --> 00:49:22.143
Kang-ho!

793
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:25.647
It's common for patients who
are paralyzed from the neck down.

794
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:28.524
They suddenly lost the ability to move.

795
00:49:28.548 --> 00:49:32.085
They lose the will to live
because of the sense of loss.

796
00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:35.546
Do your best to take care of him.

797
00:49:35.722 --> 00:49:37.992
If he still doesn't improve,

798
00:49:38.016 --> 00:49:42.220
you should consider admitting him to a facility.

799
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.347
Can a seven-year-old...

800
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.225
feel suicidal?

801
00:49:47.275 --> 00:49:48.893
Sorry?

802
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:51.062
What do you mean?

803
00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:54.148
Can a seven-year-old...

804
00:49:54.366 --> 00:49:58.069
lose the will to live
because of a sense of loss?

805
00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:02.031
Eat.

806
00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.868
Eat!

807
00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:07.578
Eat.

808
00:50:08.296 --> 00:50:10.692
Eat!

809
00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:12.860
Eat! Why won't you eat?

810
00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:15.420
Do you seriously want to die?

811
00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:32.812
You get sleepy...

812
00:50:33.155 --> 00:50:34.939
when you're full.

813
00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:38.818
And if you get sleepy,

814
00:50:39.494 --> 00:50:41.696
you won't be able to study.

815
00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.408
What?

816
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.829
You get sleepy...

817
00:50:50.797 --> 00:50:52.623
when you're full.

818
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:55.877
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

819
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.675
You get sleepy...

820
00:51:03.101 --> 00:51:04.969
when you're full.

821
00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:09.724
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

822
00:51:29.544 --> 00:51:31.370
Is that why...?

823
00:51:34.841 --> 00:51:37.960
Is that why you haven't been eating?

824
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.383
You get sleepy when you're full.

825
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.595
And if you get sleepy,

826
00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.139
you won't be able to study.

827
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.311
No.

828
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:57.980
No, Kang-ho.

829
00:51:58.365 --> 00:51:59.509
You can eat.

830
00:51:59.533 --> 00:52:02.151
You can eat now.

831
00:52:03.912 --> 00:52:05.473
Look.

832
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:07.031
Look.

833
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.534
I'm eating too, right?

834
00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:13.829
So you can eat too.

835
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:16.025
You can sleep if you're sleepy.

836
00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:18.918
You don't have to study.

837
00:52:26.434 --> 00:52:29.720
So please eat.

838
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.974
I...

839
00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.269
love you so much, Kang-ho.

840
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.356
I did that because I loved you so much.

841
00:52:41.741 --> 00:52:44.235
I wanted you to be happy.

842
00:52:45.036 --> 00:52:48.322
I didn't want you to end up like Dad and me.

843
00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.869
Please forgive me.

844
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.678
Thank you.

845
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.807
Thank you.

846
00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:28.639
Look. I understand Chairman
Song ordered you to do this.

847
00:53:28.663 --> 00:53:30.391
But I'm on duty right now.

848
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:32.366
I'm also on duty.

849
00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:38.122
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

850
00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:41.375
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

851
00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.530
Of course he won't open it.

852
00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.464
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

853
00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:52.219
You can't do that. That's breaking in.

854
00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:54.347
Move.

855
00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:02.021
Mr. Yang.

856
00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:04.148
Mr. Yang.

857
00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:09.889
Darn it. Open it.

858
00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.223
Hurry. Darn it.

859
00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:13.851
Mr. Yang!

860
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.618
Mr. Yang.

861
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:17.578
Darn it.

862
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.865
What? He committed suicide?

863
00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:29.423
Yes, sir.

864
00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:43.422
He crippled Kang-ho who
had his fate in his hands.

865
00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:47.149
Then he killed the sole witness
and disguised it as suicide?

866
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.095
Gosh, Oh Tae-soo.

867
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.472
He must really despise
joining together as a family.

868
00:54:51.496 --> 00:54:53.155
Oh Tae-soo?

869
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:01.006
<i><font color="#ffff00">Diaper</font></i>

870
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.029
The truck driver's family
lives in Yanbian, right?

871
00:55:07.053 --> 00:55:08.879
Yes, sir.

872
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:12.714
Find out when and where I should
announce my presidential bid...

873
00:55:12.738 --> 00:55:14.648
to make it most effective.

874
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:16.679
Before you do that,

875
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:20.584
get rid of all businesses or people...

876
00:55:20.608 --> 00:55:22.962
who are related to Woobyeok Group.

877
00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.687
Yes, sir.

878
00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:27.982
Also, about Yang Gu-man...

879
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.302
"Yang Gu-man"?

880
00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.887
Who's that?

881
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.238
The truck...

882
00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.575
I'm sorry, sir.

883
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.860
What's the matter?

884
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:47.543
That...

885
00:55:47.635 --> 00:55:49.363
Why is that here?

886
00:55:49.387 --> 00:55:50.906
Why is that here?!

887
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:55.036
I found it in the trash can.

888
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.038
I washed it and put it here.

889
00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:58.831
It's your favorite scarf.

890
00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:01.792
Who? Who said it was my favorite?

891
00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:03.893
Who said that?

892
00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:10.900
Goodness, ma'am!

893
00:56:13.244 --> 00:56:14.972
What's the matter with you?

894
00:56:14.996 --> 00:56:18.309
Get rid of it this instant.

895
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:20.811
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ha-young!

896
00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:23.120
Snap out of it!

897
00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:27.708
Why aren't you taking proper
care of your traumatized daughter?

898
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.403
Throw away all her old belongings.

899
00:56:29.427 --> 00:56:33.449
Replace everything single thing with new ones.

900
00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:34.617
Understand?

901
00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.175
Okay.

902
00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:38.135
Let's go out.

903
00:56:47.278 --> 00:56:49.021
You're okay.

904
00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.981
You're okay, my daughter.

905
00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.984
Nothing will happen...

906
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:56.305
to you...

907
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:58.823
or me.

908
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:03.410
Kang-ho, look.

909
00:57:03.837 --> 00:57:07.274
That man used to be paralyzed too.

910
00:57:07.298 --> 00:57:10.402
But he received rehabilitation and exercised.

911
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:14.588
And now he's healthy like
that. Isn't that incredible?

912
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.493
You can do it too.

913
00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:20.079
Let's get treated, and exercise...

914
00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.456
until you can move your fingers again.

915
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.014
Okay?

916
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:29.478
Gosh, your eyes are going to be sore.

917
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:40.698
Here.

918
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:50.624
Hello?

919
00:57:51.342 --> 00:57:52.445
Yes.

920
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:55.656
<i>Hello, this is Hannuri Rehabilitation Center.</i>

921
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.492
<i>Did you submit an application
for Mr. Choi Kang-ho?</i>

922
00:57:58.516 --> 00:57:59.952
Yes, I did.

923
00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.371
<i>But we're completely full,</i>

924
00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:05.207
<i>so I'm afraid we can't admit him right now.</i>

925
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:08.684
<i>What would you like to do?
Would you like to wait?</i>

926
00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:12.047
How long will I have to wait?

927
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.966
I was told...

928
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.969
that he should start rehab
before his bones become stiff.

929
00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:21.474
<i>I'm afraid I can't give you an exact date.</i>

930
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.351
<i>We need to wait until a spot opens up.</i>

931
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:29.315
Then could you please give me
a call when there's an opening?

932
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.941
Please.

933
00:58:30.965 --> 00:58:34.501
Thank you. Goodbye.

934
00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.855
Kang-ho, your dinner is here.

935
00:59:56.634 --> 00:59:58.279
I can't do it.

936
00:59:58.303 --> 00:59:59.196
Why?

937
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.823
Why not?

938
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.533
Kang-ho, just once more.

939
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.342
Okay? Let's give it one last try.

940
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.480
- I can't do it.
- You can!

941
01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:19.967
You did it earlier.

942
01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:21.343
You did it.

943
01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:23.902
All by yourself.

944
01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:27.448
You can do it.

945
01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:30.227
Okay. Here's the robot.

946
01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:32.411
Push it over again.

947
01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.789
- I can do it.
- That's right.

948
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.947
See? You're doing it!

949
01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:42.906
Flex!

950
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.757
Flex!

951
01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:48.177
Feed me!

952

<i>Your call will be charged after the beep.</i>

953
01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.876
Why aren't you picking up?

954
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.961
Are you still unwell?

955
01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.797
I made abalone porridge for you.

956
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.065
Anyway, give me a call.

- Where?
- There.

961
01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.576
- Is no one here?
- What's going on?

962
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.119
Those brats must've run away.

963
01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:31.330
They took our membership money.

964
01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.706
I heard the owner changed.

965
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.667
- What do we do?
- Me?

966
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:35.959
There you are!

967
01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:38.253
Yes. It's you.

968
01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:41.340
You should pay us back before selling the shop.

969
01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.258
This is so ridiculous!

970
01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.719
This isn't right. Give us our money back!

971
01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.137
Give me back my money.

972
01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:49.056
- Give it back!
- Please explain.

973
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.433
I have no idea what you're talking about.

974
01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:52.892
I heard you sold your nail salon.

975
01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:55.688
- That woman says she's the new owner.
- What?

976
01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.190
I see. Did you run this place with her?

977
01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:01.610
You were supposed to
clean out the shop yesterday.

978
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:05.170
The interior contractors will
be here soon. Open the door now.

979
01:02:05.346 --> 01:02:06.990
Hurry up.

980
01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:09.159
- Please wait a minute.
- Wait for what?

981
01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:10.703
This can't be. No.

982
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.641

- Where are you going?

983
01:02:12.665 --> 01:02:14.373
- I need to make a call.
- Don't go far.

984
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.333
- Okay.
- We're watching you.

985
01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:19.086
<i>The number you have called does not exist.</i>

Should we have some <i>soju</i> to celebrate this?

You drink when it's raining.

992

You drink when you feel lonely.

993

You'll soon become an
alcoholic and get the shakes.

994
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:43.861
Then you won't be able to work.

995
01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:46.837
- Come on. Don't be like that.
- But...

996

Fine.

997

- Yes?

Then can I go home now?

1001
01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:04.006
You'd better go straight home.

What was the incident that just occurred?

1009

You're right.

1014
01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.648

- Yes.
