11
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.827
Pull yourself together.

12
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.178
You need to be strong.

13
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.123
Get up.

14
00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.098
You're a mom.

15
00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:11.964
Your piglets are all looking for you.

16
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:17.234
You need to get up, feed
them, and look after them.

17
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.062
{\an8}So is Young-soon doing better?

18
00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.523
{\an8}You didn't have to...

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:38.949
{\an8}She worked through the

22
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.452
{\an8}It's fortunate that someone
was there to help out.

23
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.829
{\an8}It would've been really tough.

24
00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:49.058
{\an8}By the way, who were they and
what were they doing at the pig farm?

25
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.420
{\an8}They came to buy your field.

26
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.755
What?

27
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.799
They bought our cornfield?

Oh, my.

32

33
00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.363
Something smells good.

34
00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.572
Hi, Sam-sik.

35
00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.449
- Hello.
- Hey.

36
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.326
Who are they?

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.161
These men?

38
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.454
Well, they're...

39
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.249
You know, they're here...

40
00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.933
because they're moving...

41
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.711
to our village soon.

42
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.047
They came to order ricecake to present as gifts.

43
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:35.965
I see.

44
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.050
How many <i>mals</i> would you like?

45
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.885
Well, I'm not sure.

46
00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.362
About three <i>maris</i> will do.

47
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.990
Three "maris"?

48
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.659
Oh, right.

49
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.106
- There are more people than that.
- Right?

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.040
- Exactly.
- Then I'll go big.

51
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.167
30 <i>maris</i> will do.

52
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.713
- Goodness.
- 30...

53
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:05.828
- Well, that's quite a lot of ricecake.
- What is this?

54
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:10.389
Something seems odd.

55
00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.669
Are you sure you came for ricecake?

56
00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.589
Yes, of course.

57
00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.133
- Let's make it three.
- Okay.

58
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.050
By the way,

59
00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:23.429
your seated height seems
taller than normal today.

60
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.723
- What?
- What do you mean?

61
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.059
Hey, I heard we sold our cornfield!

62
00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.352
What?

63
00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:34.330

You wish to leave the farm to your son?

And if anything happens to me,

96
00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.587
he'll have to make a living by himself.

But as you know,

100
00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.406
my son isn't well, so I wonder if he'll manage.

101
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.477
In that case,

102
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:02.272
you should hire a trustworthy farm manager.

103
00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:05.609
And I can help him with
medicines and vaccinations,

104
00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.126
so don't worry about that.

105
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.822

They're always getting angry.

113
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.547
That's because you bought...

114
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.566
$200 worth of items for a game on her phone.

115
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.194

116
00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.516
What about Ms. Jin?

117
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.408

118
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.621

Mi-joo doesn't like us hanging out.

a tiny village like this one.

128

Town?

132
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.804
When? Did she take her wallet?

133
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.347
That's not what's important.

134
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.240
So how is Ms. Jin weird?

135
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.938
She doesn't talk as much.

136
00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:27.065
She doesn't talk as much?

137
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:31.528
Shouldn't you be glad then?
She won't nag you as much.

138
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:34.630
She's low on energy and doesn't smile anymore.

Please say hi to her for me.

147

We'll be going now.

148
00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.322
All right, let's go!

149
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.496
Didn't he say she's not talking as much?

150
00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.276
You're back.

151
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.611
You said you'd return.

152
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.655
I didn't sell these just in case.

153
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.907
I'm actually looking for boots today.

154
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.283
Not those?

155
00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:20.994
These are a bit short.

156
00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:22.329
Is there anything higher?

157
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.498
I have ones that go to the waist. One second.

158
00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.848
They don't need to be that high.

Excuse me.

166
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.358
Isn't this Tiger?

167
00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.401
What?

168
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.084
Tiger?

169
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:58.740
It looked just like Tiger,
so I thought it was him.

170
00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.091
- Hi.
- What's with him?

171
00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:05.762
Goodness, it's all right.

172
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.351

- Are you selling it?

177
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.528

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.233
No, I put it in here.

181
00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:34.791
There it is.

182
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.502
You punks.

183
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.822
What the heck?

184
00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:41.006
You're too young to smoke.

185
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.967
Here.

186
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.138
Don't smoke, okay?

187
00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.019
Hey, wait.

188
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.897
I gave you $50.

189
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.067
You gave me $5.

190
00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:03.013
That's a bunch of bull.
I definitely gave you $50.

191
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.097
That's a bunch of bull.

192
00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:06.183
Give him back his money, you idiot.

193
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.824
- Seriously.
- Darn it.

194
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.019
I'm not an idiot.

195
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.896
I just went back to my childhood.

196
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.205
This is a chance given from above.

197
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:17.069
That's one heck of a stupid chance.

198
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:18.904
You're not going to give me my money?

199
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.197
You leave us no choice then.

200
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.698
- Search him.
- No, stop it.

201
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.241
- Pull them down.
- Come on.

202
00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:24.242
You're dead.

203
00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:25.577
I'm telling my mom.

204
00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.079
Wait, is that a gift?

205
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.455
Give it to me.

206
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.088
It's not a gift. It's a phone, idiot.

207
00:11:30.112 --> 00:11:31.875
I know that, idiot.

208
00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:34.851
- You're the idiot, idiot.
- Give it to me, you...!

209
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.547
You rotten jerks!

210
00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:40.148
- What the...?
- Darn it.

211
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:41.760
Hey, run!

212
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:42.761
You...!

213
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.930
- Run!
- Stop right there!

214
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.780
You douchebag!

215
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.033
You douchebag!

216
00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:52.536
Repeat after me!

217
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.913
You douchebag.

218
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.859
You douchebag.

219
00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.668
Louder!

220
00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:01.947
You douchebag!

221
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:02.948
That's it.

222
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.658
Good.

223
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:08.370
If anyone calls you an idiot or a cripple,

224
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.847
tell them, "You douchebag!" Got it?

225
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.683
- But I'm not allowed to...
- You are!

226
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:24.886
Here.

227
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.265
These are all yours now.

228
00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.266
Mine?

229
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.685
These are all very important,

230
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.744
so don't show them to anyone, okay?

231
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:37.858
"Kang-ho, let's exchange this for that."

232
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.651
"Kang-ho, stamp your seal here."

233
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:42.404
"Kang-ho, can you stand surety for me?"

234
00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.614
"Kang-ho, let me borrow your house deed."

235
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:46.464
What do you say then?

236
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.093
- What should you say?
- You douchebag!

237
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.845
Good.

238
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.722
Very good.

239
00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.933
Also,

240
00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:01.756
this is a bank account your dad set up for you,

241
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.510
and I've been saving up to
give to you when you get married.

242
00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.804
This is very important,

243
00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:10.599
so I'll hide it here.

244
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.268
Don't tell or show anybody, okay?

245
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.603
Okay.

246
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.396
Like my lunch money.

247
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.314
What?

248
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.608
You hid it in my bag.

249
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.068
"Don't lose your lunch money."

250
00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:25.071
This is your lunch money.

251
00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.616
You could lose it or get it stolen,

252
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.202
so keep it safe until you
give it to your teacher.

253
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.843
Okay.

254
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.184
Yes, you're right.

255
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:41.963
I hid it in the bottom of your bag, right?

256
00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.632
Yes.

257
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.982
What a smart boy.

258
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:47.969
Yes.

259
00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.971
You're doing well.

260
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:53.433
You can slowly regain your memory
and learn one thing at a time.

261
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:56.243
- Okay?
- Okay.

262
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.148
You must be hungry.

263
00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.191
Let's eat.

264
00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.916
Okay.

265
00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.030
Aren't we going to eat?

266
00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:08.323
We will.

267
00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:12.717
But if we want to eat, we need rice.

268
00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:17.013
To buy rice, we need money.
And for money, we raise pigs.

269
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.934
And now I'll teach you how to do that.

270
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.299
Twice a day, morning and night.

271
00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:28.552
When you're hungry,

272
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.486
come to the farm before you eat,

273
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:35.031
and check if the pigs are eating well.

274
00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.143
If the feed gets wet...

275
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.229
or freezes in cold weather,

276
00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.147
it clumps and clogs the feed tube.

277
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.525
When that happens,

278
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.527
tap here a few times.

279
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.904
Bang, bang, bang.

280
00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:50.907
You must always keep it neat and disinfected...

281
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:54.634
so our pigs don't get sick, okay?

282
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.596
Make sure...

283
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.791
the pigs are happy at our farm.

284
00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:02.726
Yes, Happy Farm.

285
00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:06.464
You can take pig manure...

286
00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:09.065
and use it as fertilizer for the potato field.

287
00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:11.484
Okay.

288
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.224
First spread the manure over the field,

289
00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:19.978
then cover it with plastic to
block weeds from growing.

290
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:20.937
And then...

291
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.899
make holes in the plastic
to plant seed potatoes.

292
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.457
Like this.

293
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.728
Nice shot.

294
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:51.066
Choi Kang-ho! Focus.

295
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:58.433
When the humidity reads over 60,
it means it's too humid.

296
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.158
Use this app...

297
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.911
to turn the fans on.

298
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.499
If the pigs...

299
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:10.362
develop a cough, get diarrhea,

300
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.280
or collapse for no reason...

301
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:15.367
"Hello, I'm calling from Happy Farm in Jou-ri."

302
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.911
"My pigs are coughing or having diarrhea,"

303
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.913
"so please come quickly."

304
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:24.099
But if the vet can't come because
of an outbreak of infectious disease?

305
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:29.896
Then you need to buy the
medicine yourself and inject them.

306
00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:33.983
If you don't, the contagion will spread.

307
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.471
I don't want to. Shots are scary.

308
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.306
- I can't do this.
- No.

309
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.766
It's easy.

310
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.659
Just stab it like this.

311
00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:48.748
Mom, you're the best. That's so cool.

312
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.071
When mother pigs have piglets,

313
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:56.047
she feeds and licks them.

314
00:16:56.515 --> 00:17:00.370
She teaches them everything,
where to eat and poop,

315
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.664
how to scratch an itch,

316
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.266
and how to grunt when they're angry.

317
00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:12.397
Then after 25 nights, you wean them.

318
00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.468
I'd like the newly-released knit gel polishes,

319
00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:17.470
a set of semicircular pearls in all sizes,

320
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:19.264
and a box of nail tinctures.

321
00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:22.559
And ten bottles of moisturizing cream too.

322
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:23.727
Yes.

323
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:28.398
Tomorrow's the grand opening,
so I need them by 9 a.m.

324
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.608
Yes, okay. That'd be great.

325
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.834
Thank you. Bye.

326
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.090
The charms came off.

327
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.496
You're going to open a nail salon
in the agricultural chemicals shop?

328
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.497
Yes.

329
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.957
The rent is cheap,

330
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.294
and there's lots of foot traffic,
so I think it'll be great.

331
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:50.754
That's not a bad idea.

332
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:55.774
People may buy pesticides
to take their own life,

333
00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:59.596
then get their nails done and feel better.

334
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.973
What if they get their nails done...

335
00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:05.366
and see pesticides and
want to take their own life?

336
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:11.664
I was just joking. Don't mind me.

337
00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.237
A nail salon in a shop that
sells agricultural chemicals.

338
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.171
That's kind of novel.

339
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.950
So don't come here...

340
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:23.745
and ask her to do this for free anymore.

341
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.804
Go to her nail salon.

342
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.751
Where is Sung-ae?

343
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.754
She left in a hurry to go to the bank.

344
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.380
The bank?

345
00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.757
Wait.

346
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.400
Is she borrowing money to
settle Sam-sik's trouble again?

347
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:45.391
♫ <i>It's time for us to say goodbye</i> ♫

348
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:48.186
♫ <i>until we meet again</i> ♫

349
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.896
Get $100,000 ready.

350
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.065
If you fail to do that,

351
00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.958
you'll end up...

352
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.613
donating your organs...

354
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.216

355
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.884
Okay?

356
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.909
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Mi-joo</font></i>

357
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.445

Honey?

359
00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:27.433
Where are you?

360
00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:29.269
<i>What do you mean, where am I?</i>

361
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.187
<i>I'm obviously out in the Pacific.</i>

362
00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:32.730
Right?

363
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.233
You haven't returned and
gotten in trouble, have you?

364
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.902
Don't say that to someone
who's turned over a fresh leaf...

365
00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.503
and working hard catching fish.

366
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.074
Hey, Mr. Kim!

367
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:46.050
<i>Can you pull on the nets?</i>

368
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.122
<i>I'm practically made for this job.</i>

369
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:53.099
I even caught a mermaid yesterday.

370
00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.378
<i>Where are you?</i>

371
00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:57.881
You aren't drinking alone
after getting fired, right?

372
00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.257
<i>Fired?</i>

373
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.551
I'm opening up my own nail salon.

374
00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:03.803
I finished decorating the place today.

375
00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:05.138
<i>Really?</i>

376
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.765
I knew it, Mi-joo.

377
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.867
You got back on your
feet after that tough ordeal.

378
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:15.857
I felt really bad when you
said you wanted to give up...

379
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.291
and go back to our hometown.

380
00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:21.279
<i>You're too talented to lurk in the countryside.</i>

381
00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.005
You should do nails for rich ladies in...

382
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.286
Hello?

383
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.539
Let me call you back.

384
00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.556
Okay, sure.

385
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.142
What was that?

386
00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.606
Lee Mi-joo?

387
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.775
Wait.

388
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.097
Sam-sik!

389
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:49.891
Hey, Bang Sam-sik!

390
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.517
Is that you?

391
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:54.187
When did you get back?

392
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.731
When did you come back?

393
00:20:56.755 --> 00:21:00.568
You said you'd surprise me when we met again,

394
00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.418
and you were right.

395
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.965
Were you beaten up by the mermaid you caught?

396
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.828
You see, out there in the Pacific,

397
00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:14.639
there's a world of men you don't know about.

398
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.835
- Gosh.
- What do you know...

399
00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:20.046
♫ <i>about a man's heart</i> ♫

400
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.465
- What's with you?
- Sorry.

401
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.800
You must be insane.

402
00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:29.320
What about you? You're doing nails
for country ladies, not rich ladies?

403
00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:31.557
What do you know...

404
00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:34.158
♫ <i>about a woman's heart</i> ♫

405
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.954
What are you doing?

406
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.416
Right.

407
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.986
Since we both ended up here,

408
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.322
let's try not to judge each other.

409
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:48.825
Who are we to criticize one another?

410
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:51.551
We both messed up.

411
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.499
But still, we're better off than Kang-ho.

412
00:21:56.523 --> 00:21:59.002
He used to be so haughty
like he owned the world.

413
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.586
Did you see? He became an idiot.

414
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.964
- Hey!
- Goodness, you startled me.

415
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:07.427
How could you say such a thing
about someone who's unwell?

416
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:11.237
The anger is bringing out your dialect.

417
00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:14.350
That's my Mi-joo. You're so cute, as always.

418
00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:16.227
Gosh, you idiot.

419
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:18.938
All right.

420
00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:20.523
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:23.791
You didn't have to get so worked up.

422
00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:25.737
Hold on.

423
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:30.465
Do you still like Kang-ho?

424
00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.493
- You're insane.
- Do you?

425
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.510
Gosh, move!

426
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:38.416
You're suddenly dodging my question.

427
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.043
You do.

428
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:41.642
You still do.

429
00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:43.880
People avoid poop...

430
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:46.257
not because it's dirty,

431
00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:48.316
but because it's scary.

432
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.850
You're scared of poop?

433
00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.643
Mi-joo, why?

434
00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:00.161
Why are you scared of it?

435
00:23:09.012 --> 00:23:10.573
Seo-jin, what's wrong?

436
00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:12.283
What is it? Why are you crying?

437
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:13.785
Did you hit him again?

438
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.870
- Come here.
- I didn't hit him.

439
00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:19.457
He's crying because he doesn't
want to go to the public bath.

440
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.141
- What?
- Mom.

441
00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:26.047
Do I have to go to the public bath?

442
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:30.843
I really hate going to the women's bath...

443
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:33.861
with Grandma and Ye-jin.

444
00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:41.577
Last week, he ran into Yun-ji
and Da-hyeon from kindergarten.

445
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.315
Stop crying! It's not your fault.

446
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.735
You're allowed in the
women's bath until you turn 4.

447
00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:49.278
Mom.

448
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.614
- Yes?
- I want to go to the men's bath...

449
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:54.867
with my dad like other boys.

450
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:57.927
Can you tell him to come back?

451
00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.122
Can you?

452
00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.055
Please.

453
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:03.960
Seo-jin, come here. Stop crying.

454
00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:07.144
There, there. Is that why you're upset?

455
00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.380
Mom.

456
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:41.679
Mom.

457
00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:44.390
Mom, let's go.

458
00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:46.669
What?

459
00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:48.838
- Where?
- I'm hungry.

460
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.673
When I'm hungry,

461
00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:52.758
I should feed the pigs before I eat, right?

462
00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:54.317
Yes.

463
00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.944
- I'll be outside.
- Okay.

464
00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:04.270
Ultimately, it's better for us.

465
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:08.539
Now that we own that cornfield,
we won't look out of place here.

466
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:11.152
The problem is our home.

467
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.835
Do you really think...

468
00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:16.339
our problem is getting a home?

469
00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.159
Oh, right.

470
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.344
Come to your senses!

471
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:25.681
If we don't find anything
by the end of the election,

472
00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:27.501
we're both doomed.

473
00:25:27.525 --> 00:25:29.143
Yes, sir.

474
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:33.341
It's not in the farm.

475
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.177
It must be somewhere in her home.

476
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.862
Let's first find out if anybody is inside.

477
00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:41.697
Okay.

478
00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.699
Hey.

479
00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:53.277
A couple of guys who don't even
know the measurement unit for rice...

480
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.947
suddenly turn up at a country village...

481
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:59.200
and pay twice the price for
land, in cash, to start farming.

482
00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.790
There are only two reasons for that.

483
00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:03.162
One, because you're very sick.

484
00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:05.539
Two, because you're very sick.

485
00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:09.543
Or you could be running away from
trouble or planning to cause trouble.

486
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.670
Excuse me.

487
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:14.647
You said there are only two
reasons, but you listed four.

488
00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.175
Right.

489
00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:17.802
There must be a misunderstanding.

490
00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.513
We just want to farm, that's all.

491
00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:22.974
Okay then. Let's do this.

492
00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:25.643
I'll help you find a home,

493
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.728
and provide consulting services,

494
00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.189
from choosing crops to
learning farming techniques.

495
00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:32.108
- No, you don't have to...
- All right.

496
00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:35.319
In that case, why don't we discuss this...

497
00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:38.239
over a glass of <i>makgeolli?</i>

498
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.908
There's a brewery nearby
that's been around for 35 years,

499
00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.159
and it's amazing.

500
00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:43.119
Really?

501
00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:44.620
You must like <i>makgeolli.</i>

502
00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:46.330
- Yes.
- Let's go.

503
00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:49.432
- Wait, sir. Hey!
- It's really good.

504
00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.879
Hey.

505
00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:57.091
Let's say one mother pig costs $300.

506
00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.092
Okay.

507
00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.510
But a buyer comes and says,

508
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:01.679
"Goodness, sir."

509
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.639
"Only summer pigs cost that much."

510
00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:06.767
"There's an increase in supply now,
so the price has dropped a lot."

511
00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.478
"I'll give you $250."

512
00:27:09.502 --> 00:27:10.688
What should you do?

513
00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:13.873
Hey, you thief! I'm not selling it to you!

514
00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:16.235
Yes, good job.

515
00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:19.253
- Next, the sawdust distributor.
- Okay.

516
00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:21.407
The sawdust distributor...

517
00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:25.676
wants 22 cents per kilo
when it used to be 19 cents.

518
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:29.749
Then he says, "This was made
with red pine tree from Russia,"

519
00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:31.417
"so it's much better quality."

520
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.253
"If you make compost out of
this and use it to grow potatoes,"

521
00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:36.964
"they'll grow as big as watermelons."

522
00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:38.814
Then what should you do?

523
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.724
A shameless beast like you must leave!

524
00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:48.783
My goodness.

525
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.021
Where did you learn such words?

526
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:53.788
Over there.

527
00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:59.431
<i><font color="#ffff00">Happy Farm Must Be Demolished!

528
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:10.939

529
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.433
- Andrea.
- Yes?

530
00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.310
Please put Kang-ho in working clothes.

531
00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:33.119
Sure.

532
00:28:33.461 --> 00:28:36.482
I'll manipulate your movements now.

533
00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:39.333
You must put up with the inconvenience.

534
00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:47.326
What's wrong?

535
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.787
Why are you barking so much?

536
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:51.929
Is there a rat?

537
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.251
What are you doing here,

538
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.502
like a rat?

539
00:28:56.526 --> 00:29:01.215
The people in this village
won't believe a word I say.

540
00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:04.385
I took a video of wastewater leaking out...

541
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.095
from the back.

542
00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:08.556
That's not wastewater.

543
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.683
It's just water dripping from the water tank.

544
00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:11.809
As if.

545
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.103
You did this too, didn't you?

546
00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.438
Yes, I did it. So what?

547
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:19.692
I presented the idea to the
villagers to close down this place.

548
00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:23.779
Everyone agreed with me, but no one showed up.

549
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:25.588
They're the worst!

550
00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:28.784
Darn it.

551
00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:31.177
Do you want to die?

552
00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:34.081
Do I want to die?

553
00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.098
Do I want to die?

554
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.560
Nobody in this world wants to die, you jerk!

555
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.339
Why should I die?

556
00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:44.467
Why should I die?

557
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.010
Why?

558
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.344
- Why should I die?
- Mom!

559
00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:48.721
- Let go!
- No, Ms. Jin!

560
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:49.930
- Ms. Jin!
- Hey!

561
00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.990
- This behavior is improper.
- Mom.

562
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.394
- Stay away!
- You.

563
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:57.411
Listen carefully.

564
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:59.231
This farm...

565
00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:02.026
cost my husband his life.

566
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.862
No matter how much you try to shut it down,

567
00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:07.213
I'll never give it up.

568
00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:10.659
If I die, my son will run it.

569
00:30:10.683 --> 00:30:12.995
Then his son and grandson!

570
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:16.096
It's going to get passed on through generations.

571
00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:18.807
If you do something like this again,

572
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:21.712
then I'll kill you no matter
the consequences. Got it?

573
00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:24.021
Darn it!

574
00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.801
Ms. Jin!

575
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.442
Ms. Jin!

576
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:29.553
Ms. Jin!

577
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:31.013
This is bad.

578
00:30:31.037 --> 00:30:33.405
We're in trouble!

579
00:30:34.524 --> 00:30:36.024

581
00:30:39.212 --> 00:30:40.773
- Goodness.

582
00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.566
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

583
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.735
- Goodness.
- How can this happen?

584
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:46.237
What's all this?

586
00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:49.532
What on earth is happening?

587
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.158
Foot-and-mouth disease?

588
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.869
I heard Mr. Kim's goat farm had an outbreak.

589
00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:58.040
Why are the civil servants
headed to the pig farm?

590
00:30:58.064 --> 00:31:02.503
If foot-and-mouth disease breaks out,
cows and pigs within a 2-miles radius...

591
00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.880
must be culled by law.

592
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:05.881
What?

593
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:09.760
Then Young-soon's pigs will be
culled even though they aren't sick?

594
00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:12.555
That's the law.

595
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:15.516
Thankfully, Tiger isn't affected.

596
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.309
Darn it!

597
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.979
Who cares about the dog right now?

598
00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.647
Then...

599
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:24.498
What will happen to that family?

600
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.333
For now,

601
00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:28.612
they have to shut down the farm.

602
00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:32.867
Those goats have been going around
doing all kinds of goat things...

603
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:34.952
all around the village,

604
00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:37.538
and they finally ended up causing trouble.

605
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:41.056
Goodness.

606
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.476
I feel so bad for Young-soon.

607
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:52.151
Sir, please don't. Please don't kill our pigs!

608
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.138
Mom, do something.

609
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:56.765
Stop them!

610
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:58.392
Andrea, please.

611
00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:01.201
Andrea, do something.

612
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:11.071
Leave her alone!

613
00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:14.006
She's feeding her piglets!

614
00:32:14.057 --> 00:32:16.342
Just leave her there.

615
00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:39.740
- Spread out.
- This way.

616
00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:42.478
Be careful.

617
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:44.286
This way.

618
00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:49.041
Why?

619
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:56.215
Why?!

620
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.345
No.

621
00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.832
No!

622
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:05.334
No!

623
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.211
No!

624
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.587
- Mom.
- Ms. Jin.

625
00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:10.756
- No, stop it, Mom.
- Ms. Jin.

626
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.523
No, Mom.

627
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:13.842
No.

628
00:33:13.866 --> 00:33:18.445
- You can't do this to them.
- Ms. Jin.

629
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.059
They don't deserve to die like this!

630
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:24.353
You can't do this to them!

631
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.563
You can't!

632
00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:28.330
No.

633
00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:30.985
Those poor things.

634
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:34.086
Those poor things!

635
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:38.674
Those poor things!

636
00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:41.051
No!

637
00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:44.581
Those poor things!

638
00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:46.250
- No!
- Don't do that!

639
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:49.837
- Those pigs aren't sick!
- Goodness.

640
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:53.298
- I can't watch.
- I'm sorry!

641
00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:56.135
Isn't this too harsh?

642
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:58.012
Please be reborn as humans...

643
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.139

644
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:03.267
- Goodness.
- Human? Life will be tougher.

645
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:05.185
- My goodness!
- Hey, Mr. Choi.

646
00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:08.814
I'm glad you called.

00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:12.249
Hello. It's me, Sam-sik.

648
00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:17.254
No.

649
00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:19.324
I don't have the money yet.

658
00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:45.684
Who drank my alcohol?

659
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.186
I got you, you punk.

660
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.646
What? It's you, Sam-sik.

661
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.608
Goodness, Mr. Yang.

662
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:55.903
Your security system is
still cutting-edge technology.

I took a few bottles of
<i>makgeolli</i> to drink with my friends.

You can put it under my dad's tab.

00:35:03.643 --> 00:35:06.622
Hey, tell him to pay his tab.

668
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:08.457
- Okay.
- Hey.

669
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:12.711
And I put aside those bottles
to use for my ritual tomorrow.

670
00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.379
How could you take them?

671
00:35:14.403 --> 00:35:17.007
- All right. Where were we?
- Goodness, that punk.

672
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:19.051
Yes, farming funds.

673
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:24.306
Call the agricultural technology
center to apply for the fund.

674
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.934
- Once you call...
- And listen.

675
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.728
Do you know Kang-ho's family is in big trouble?

676
00:35:29.752 --> 00:35:31.730
It's worse than big trouble.

677
00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:33.899

00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:34.817
You punk.

679
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:37.736
Not Kang-ho. I'm talking about the farm.

680
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.197
The poor pigs were all culled...

681
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:44.284
because of the outbreak of
the foot-and-mouth disease.

682
00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:46.286
- What?
- <i>Foot-and-mouth disease?</i>

683
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.747
They sacrificed all those pigs...

684
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:51.557
who were squealing and struggling to survive.

685
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.311
It was painful for me to watch.

686
00:35:56.612 --> 00:35:57.798
Imagine how she felt.

687
00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.801
She fed and raised them like they were her own.

688
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.761
She must be heartbroken.

689
00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:05.055
What about Lion?

690
00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:07.224
Is Lion dead too?

691
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:09.434
Kang-ho's home...

692
00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:12.146
is over 2 miles from the goat farm,

693
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.981
so Lion is still alive.

694
00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.567
- What a relief.
- What a relief.

695
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.527
What's a relief?

696
00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.654
This is absurd.

697
00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.656
Some had to die,

698
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.173
while others lived...

699
00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.593
by a matter of a few yards.

700
00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:29.303
Goodness.

701
00:36:30.938 --> 00:36:33.682
Thankfully, this one must've survived.

702
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:38.213
But what's the point?
She lost all the other pigs.

703
00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:40.507
She must be very shocked.

704
00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:43.483
She hasn't returned from the farm.

705
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:45.277
Shut up.

706
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.767
And start searching.

707
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.326
Yes, sir.

708
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:58.650
I don't think it's in here.

709
00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:01.919
I don't see any files. There
are just clothes and shoes.

710
00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:07.382
Look, more clothes and shoes.

711
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:14.056
Mr. Soh.

712
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.843
Thank you for coming to the family meeting...

713
00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:28.764
for our children's wedding
despite your busy schedule.

714
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:33.018
It's to prepare my dearest
daughter and a great man like him...

715
00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:35.938
for their new journey together.

716
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:39.831
I'd rather miss out on a campaign.

717
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:46.990
Thank you for considering
my humble son a great man.

718
00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.909
I'm very grateful.

719
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.370
We can tell a lot about
a person by their parents.

720
00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:53.205
Think of who you are, sir.

721
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:56.583
You were born into a poor farm,
then later founded Dosang Group,

722
00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:59.836
the top corporation that's the
backbone of our country's economy.

723
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.772
People often tease me, calling
me a rags-to-riches story.

724
00:38:05.741 --> 00:38:06.802
Sir.

725
00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:10.222
That's why I wish to become President.

726
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:12.975
A world where one can rise from the bottom up.

727
00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.435
These days, social injustice seems permanent,

728
00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.562
and wealth and poverty are inherited.

729
00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:20.065
Therefore no one can rise from the bottom up.

730
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:24.945
That's why the disadvantaged
don't make an effort to grow,

731
00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:28.865
and continue to just live
in this hopeless society.

732
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:30.549
I'll...

733
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.138
make Korea a place where one can rise.

734
00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:38.792
And...

735
00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.794
the future of my politics...

736
00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:44.104
is you, sir.

737
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.373
Mom.

738
00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:06.418
We should go now.

739
00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:12.424
Yes.

740
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.555
We should go.

743
00:39:24.153 --> 00:39:25.714
{\an8}Have you heard the news?

744
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:27.716
About Jou-ri.

745
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.001
I heard it's a huge mess
after the disease outbreak.

746
00:39:30.025 --> 00:39:32.095
Goodness, I heard.

747
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:33.764
I can feel her pain.

748
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.141
We aren't talking just one or two pigs.

749
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.560
Where did they bury all those pigs?

750
00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:40.979
The goats were buried in the yard of the farm,

751
00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:44.775
and the pigs were buried in the potato field.

752
00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.401
The potato field?

753
00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:49.002
Then she can't grow potatoes either.

754
00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.322
Goodness.

755
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:52.366
Potatoes?

756
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.867
Wait.

757
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.161
Then why did she buy herbicide?

758
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.704
What?

759
00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:58.872
Herbicide?

760
00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.873
Yes.

761
00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.125
When did she come by to buy it?

762
00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:04.976
As soon as I opened today.

763
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.716
You haven't finished my nails yet!

764
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.926
What...?

{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">Ungryeol Agricultural Chemicals</font></i>

766
00:40:26.298 --> 00:40:27.958
Kang-ho.

767
00:40:28.008 --> 00:40:30.127
Say hi to your dad.

768
00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:34.840
Dad...

769
00:40:37.184 --> 00:40:38.927
Hello.

770
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.103
Honey.

771
00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:52.315
I brought Kang-ho with me.

772
00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:54.928
I wanted to bring him to you...

773
00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:58.280
after he starts walking again, but...

774
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.492
I'm sorry.

775
00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:05.453
I'm sorry.

<i><font color="#ffff00">Here Rests Choi Hae-sik</font></i>

777
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.366
Mom.

778
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.661
Have we picnicked here in the past?

779
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:21.803
I don't remember.

780
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:25.515
This is a picnic, right?

781
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:30.145
No, it's not. We need <i>gimbap</i> for a picnic.

782
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.223
My son, this bad mother of yours...

783
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:43.950
never let you go on a picnic like everyone else.

784
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:49.289
Long ago,

785
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:53.335
my mom and dad...

786
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:56.379
I mean,

787
00:41:56.514 --> 00:42:00.175
your grandma, grandpa,

788
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.719
and uncle...

789
00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:08.725
went on a picnic with <i>gimbap</i> I made for them...

790
00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:11.728
and passed away.

791
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.440
And your dad...

792
00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:19.361
also went out with the <i>gimbap</i> I made,

793
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:22.489
and never came back.

794
00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:26.201
I was scared of that.

795
00:42:27.169 --> 00:42:29.037
That's why I never let you go.

796
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:33.959
I was scared by the thought...

797
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.587
of becoming alone again.

798
00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:54.020
Mom.

799
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.030
I'll open it for you.

800
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:12.357
In return, after we drink this,
we have to go down and eat.

801
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.040
I'm hungry.

802
00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.986
And what do we do before we eat?

803
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.461
Feed the pigs first.

804
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:20.964
We have to feed Lion.

805
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.951
Lion will grow up,

806
00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:25.161
have piglets, more piglets,

807
00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:27.178
and more.

808
00:43:27.229 --> 00:43:30.473
Then we'll be able to run
our pig farm again, right?

809
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.436
I'll help you out a lot, Mom.

810
00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:42.971
Ms. Jin!

811

Ms. Jin!

814
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:51.062
Look at this. I knew it.

815
00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:53.189
You're here to see Kang-ho because
you heard about the outbreak, right?

816
00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:54.858
Have you seen Ms. Jin and Kang-ho?

817
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:55.900
They aren't home?

818
00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:59.502
Their farm is closed off now. Where did they go?

819
00:44:00.846 --> 00:44:02.073
Ms. Jin!

Hello, Ms. Jin.

823
00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:12.265

<i><font color="#ffff00">Ungryeol Agricultural Chemicals</font></i>

826

This.

827
00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:30.825
I should take the herbicide to
my mom at the garlic field, right?

828
00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.870
Right?

829
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.457
Yes.

830
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.251
Goodbye then.

831
00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.966

00:44:47.393 --> 00:44:48.370
Yes?

Can you go to the public
bath with Seo-jin tomorrow?

834

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.544
Why would I...?

837
00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:59.005
I should go, right? Of course.

838
00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:01.257
Sounds great. I'd love to.

839
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:04.150
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

840

Goodbye, ma'am.

841
00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:12.450
I'll get going too then.

842
00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:19.040
What's going on?

843
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:25.088
Tell me. What is it? Why do
I have to go bathe with Seo-jin?

844
00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:31.454
Wait. Are you crying?

845
00:45:31.478 --> 00:45:35.223
Something serious must be going on.

846

What is it?

847
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.378
Tell me now!

848
00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:40.255
Nothing's going on.

849
00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:41.840
It's just a bath.

850
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.591
Everyone should bathe!

851
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:46.192
Don't you wash up?

852
00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:51.891
I'll wash up!

853
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.741
I will.

854
00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:56.146
Her son...

855
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.940
must've told her he wants to bathe with his dad,

856
00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:01.109
and it must've broken her heart.

857
00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:02.485
Goodness.

858
00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:04.362
I see she was too shy to tell me,

859
00:46:04.386 --> 00:46:08.131
so she dragged that idiot in to make me go.

860
00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:09.742
At any rate,

861
00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:12.844
you were cute today, as always, Mi-joo!

862
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:33.823

Young-soon, are you home?

864
00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:40.079
It's heartbreaking.

865
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:43.583
What are those?

866
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.029
Please take this.

867
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.490
What is this?

868
00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:50.241
Wait, this is from that time.

869
00:46:50.265 --> 00:46:53.495
- You're right.
- Why are you giving these to us?

870
00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:56.095
Thanks to you two,

871
00:46:56.605 --> 00:47:00.433
I was able to get through some difficult times.

872

I know this is nowhere
enough to show my gratitude,

873
00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:08.733
but please take it.

874
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:10.762
What are you doing?

875
00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:13.139
- Are you crazy?
- You must be.

876
00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.642
This is wrong. Don't do this.

877
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.852

878
00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:19.479
Hey.

879
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:20.730
Oh, no. Never mind.

880
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:22.914
You're right.

881
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:26.292
That's why I feel awful...

882
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.836
whenever I see these.

883
00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:31.366
But...

884
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.535
if you don't want them, I'll throw them out...

885
00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:38.221
It'd be such a waste to throw them out.

886
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:43.002
Seo-jin! Ye-jin!

887
00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:45.770
- Kang-ho!
- Kang-ho!

888
00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.899
Let's go to the bath.

889
00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:54.028
Over here!

890
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.225
Hey, didn't you bring any toiletries?

891
00:47:57.249 --> 00:47:58.601
They have everything there.

892
00:47:58.625 --> 00:47:59.686

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.745
Good grief.

You must be the famous twins.

Nice to meet you.

That hurts.

900
00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:15.159
He really is in pain.

901
00:48:15.183 --> 00:48:16.244
He is.

902
00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:19.664
I don't know who he is, but he's quite a guy.

903
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:22.417
He's my friend, Sam-sik.

904
00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:24.210
Sam-sik?

905
00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.795
The famous thief?

906
00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:27.046
No, let's go.

907
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.840
We'll return safely.

908
00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:30.690
Okay.

909
00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:33.303
Get yourself washed up and have a good time.

910
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:34.679
Okay.

911
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:36.514
Okay, time to go!

912
00:48:36.538 --> 00:48:38.641
- You don't want to end up like him.
- Let's go.

913
00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:40.825
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

914
00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:43.104
- That punk.
- Sorry, Sam-sik!

915
00:48:43.128 --> 00:48:45.496
His memory must've come back.

916
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.957
Goodbye.

917
00:48:48.967 --> 00:48:50.710
Wait up!

919
00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:58.634
My health will worsen by the day,

920
00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:02.013
and I might die any day.

921
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:07.226
I'll only end up becoming
a burden to my unwell son.

922
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.089
Have you found a rehab center for your son?

923
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.856
Yes.

924
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:17.695
The fee will be deducted from
this bank account every month.

925
00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:22.727
If my son ever returns to normal,

926
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:25.688
please grant him the rest.

927
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:30.792
If that never happens,

928
00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:34.712
please handle everything according to my will.

929
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:43.581
<i>So are you saying Choi Kang-ho was the one...</i>

930
00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:45.973
<i>who's been exposing Woobyeok?</i>

931
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.227
Look how pretty the wig is.

932
00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:51.839
And those shoes are so cute.

933
00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:54.273
Do these fit him?

934
00:49:54.449 --> 00:49:56.969
Why don't we just get rid of Choi Kang-ho?

935
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.388
What do you mean?

936
00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:02.115
If he returns to normal,
he may pose a threat to you.

937
00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:05.326
Threat?

938
00:50:05.877 --> 00:50:07.814
Hey, look.

939
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:11.067
Kang-ho exposed everything himself,

940
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.611
then went around patching it up.

941
00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:15.154
Why do you think he did that?

942
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.824
That poor kid without any connections...

943
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:22.135
worked desperately to make some kind of a tie.

944
00:50:22.227 --> 00:50:26.040
In a wig like this, no less.

945
00:50:26.064 --> 00:50:31.227
This is what a man should be like
when he has ambition in his heart.

946
00:50:35.323 --> 00:50:37.343
Mr. Soh, you just pitched...

947
00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:41.472
a four-seam fastball.

948
00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:44.308
But something isn't right.

949
00:50:44.332 --> 00:50:46.868
Don't you think so?

950
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.356
Don't bring something on me,

951
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.457
but on him.

952
00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:54.500
Okay?

Ye-jin, did you have a good bath?
Seo-jin, what about you?

978
00:52:09.334 --> 00:52:10.520
It's Mom!

979
00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:12.855
- Hello, Ms. Jin.
- Seo-jin, come here.

980
00:52:12.879 --> 00:52:15.164
- Mom.
- Give me your hand.

981
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.945
It must've been tough to help
both Seo-jin and Kang-ho bathe.

No, it's no trouble at all.

984
00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:26.759
You're right. Thank you, Sam-sik.

985
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:31.249
Kang-ho and I have an appointment.
We'll be on our way.

live here and be treated now.
