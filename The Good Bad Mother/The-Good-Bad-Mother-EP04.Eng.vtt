11
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.009
- Goodbye, piggies.
- Goodness.

12
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.372
You still feel sad every time
you send them away, don't you?

13
00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.041
Of course I do.

14
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.559
I lived with and fed them
longer than my husband and kid.

15
00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.797
Goodbye.

16
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.759
I'll take good care of your piglets.

17
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.761
Don't worry about a thing.

18
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.387
I'll get going then.

19
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.029
- One second.
- Yes?

20
00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:25.144
These potatoes are plump and
delicious. Eat them with your kids.

21
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.370
Goodness, you're always so kind.

22
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:32.416
By the way, how's your son doing?

23
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.043
- Ready or not!
- Ready or not!

24
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.763
{\an8}- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

25
00:01:51.787 --> 00:01:53.395
{\an8}- Shoot!
- Shoot!

26
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.525
{\an8}All right! I won!

27
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.777
{\an8}Okay!

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.911
{\an8}Here we go!

29
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.461
{\an8}Mom!

30
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.559
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

31
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.039
Are you done?

32
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.667
Yes, it's good as new.

33
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.418
- Goodness.
- It's perfect.

34
00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:35.005
My gosh, you're such a crafty handyman.

35
00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.218
Your family is skilled with your hands.

36
00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.386
You know,

37
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.598
I'm feeling sort of offended to hear that.

38
00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.560
Is it because I have a delinquent son?

39
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.437
Don't take things that far.

40
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.191
Anyway, I'm relieved that nobody got hurt.

41
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.652
- Yes.
- This could've been much worse.

42
00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.279
Push me.

43
00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.447
- Here I go.
- It's smooth.

44
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.673
- This is nice.
- Yes.

45
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.136
They said you'd love it...

46
00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.455
if I exercised.

47
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.264
Who did?

48
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.877
Goodness.

49
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:17.965
Goodness, Mommy's little
boy wanted to make her happy.

50
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.259
What a wonderful son.

51
00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.137
Of course he is.

52
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:26.807
And those clever twins went after his weakness.

53
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.726
Kids.

54
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.812
How many times do I have
to tell you this is dangerous?

55
00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.566
That's not a toy. That's his legs.

56
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.542
That's not my legs. It's a wheelchair.

57
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.200
Anyway, don't ever play
around with it again, okay?

58
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.995
It's not for muddy roads, icy
roads, bumpy stony paths, waterways,

59
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.496
rice paddy ridges, banks,

60
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.582
and especially anywhere up high.

61
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.791
Okay?

62
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.772
And it's not for three people to ride, right?

63
00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:55.878
Of course not!

64
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.603
See?

65
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:02.551
What about using the rubber tube as a hula hoop?

66
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.510
What?

67
00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.553
Kang-ho.

68
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.305
Goodness, Kang-ho...

69
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.598
Goodness. Hey!

70
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.266
You darned...

71
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.143
little twins!

72
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.394
You rascals!

73
00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.646
- Goodness.
- Stop.

74
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.897
Don't do that.

75
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.190
I already talked to them.

76
00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:20.110
Why did you drag him out and bully him?

77
00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.654
We didn't bully him!

78
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.864
We helped him exercise!

79
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.340
How are you going to help him do that?

80
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.160
Look at him!

81
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:31.288
And you can't treat him like that!

82
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.665
He's not your friend!

83
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.750
What? We weren't friends?

84
00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.001
I thought we were friends.

85
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.336
You said you were seven!

86
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.504
I am!

87
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.214
The doctor said I'm seven!

88
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.106
Right, Mom?

89
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.087
Beans will grow from your tummy.

90
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.393
35.

91
00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.811
Repeat after me.

92
00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.854
35.

93
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.522
That's right.

94
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.874
Kang-ho, you're 35.

95
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.946
But you became a little sick.

96
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.424
So you became seven for a short while.

97
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.619
I know what that means.

98
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.163
What?

99
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.096
I'm stupid, right?

100
00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:59.543
No! Who said that?

101
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.935
- Who said that to you?
- You did!

102
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.255
What?

103
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.799
You and the doctor said that.

104
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.301
"Simply put, he's..."

105
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.136
"Simply put, he's..."

106
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.387
...stupid?

107
00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:12.404
"...stupid."

108
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.163
No, Kang-ho.

109
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.333
I said that because I didn't know any better.

110
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.361
So here's the thing.

111
00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.045
Yes.

112
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:29.865
Kang-ho,

113
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.633
you went back to your childhood.

114
00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:37.081
Everyone wants to be young again.

115
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.557
I do too. I want to go back too.

116
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.353
Because if I could, I'd be
able to change many things.

117
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:49.900
But nobody in this world can turn back time.

118
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.070
Yet you did, Kang-ho.

119
00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.155
This is...

120
00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.491
a chance given from above.

121
00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:01.078
A chance to start all over again.

122
00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.332
"A chance given from above"?

123
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.877
Yes, that's right.

124
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.493
So you should be happy.

125
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.636
Don't be sad or devastated.

126
00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.721
Be happy.

127
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.432
- Happy?
- Yes.

128
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.518
Your return...

129
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.479
makes me feel...

130
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.733
happy.

131
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.321
Happy.

132
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.995
That's right.

133
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.536
Hello.

134
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.748
Squid and mackerel are extra fresh today.

135
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:04.209
- What would you like?
- Well...

136
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.879
Are you Sun-young's mother?

137
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.422
- I...
- What is it?

138
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:12.357
Did that wench run off with your money too?

139
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.320
- Sorry?
- That crazy wench!

140
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.684
I can't live like this!

141
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.618
Good grief!

142
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:27.774
She met this gigolo somewhere,

143
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:31.111
and gave him every single penny she had.

144
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:35.532
Then she even took out a private
loan to pay back his gambling debt.

145
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.257
Good grief.

146
00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.077
She put up her home, salon,

147
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:42.289
and even her father's
fishing boat as collateral.

148
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:45.307
Goodness me.

149
00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.085
That darned brat...

150
00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.755
never even called me once after that,

151
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.466
then texted me saying she
was going to Los Angeles,

152
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.510
or whatever, to make money.

153
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.886
Good grief.

154
00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.405
All she left was that one
message before she disappeared.

155
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.397
- What do I do?
- I raised her wrong.

156
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:10.025
Who else is to blame?

157
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.152
You can just take me.

158
00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:14.878
Just take me away!

159
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.798
No.

160
00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:22.427
It must've been so tough for you.

161
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.374
You're much better than my daughter.

162
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.502
Just be my daughter!

163
00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.645
Mom!

A warm welcome to Petit Nail, Sillim Branch!

178
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.599
How many years of experience do you have?

179
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.434
I got certified in school,

180
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.937
and worked at the Ewha Branch
for three and a half years.

181
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.857
And I'm joining this branch
because I moved to Sillim-dong.

182
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:13.690
Welcome.

183
00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.233
Your manager told us...

184
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:19.196
you were popular among college girls
for your quick hands and nail arts.

185
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.906
I look forward to working with you.

186
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.839
Yes, I'll do my best.

187
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.826
- My gosh.
- It's here.

188
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.286
The raw fish here is delicious.

189
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.498
The owner catches the fish himself.

190
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:32.641
So this is caught in the wild?

191
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.505
Kang-ho?

192
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.173
No, not kelpfish. It's rockfish.

193
00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.591
Wild rockfish.

194
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.176
A bottle of <i>soju,</i> please.

195
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.219
Mi-joo?

196
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.402
No, not Mi-joo. <i>Soju.</i>

197
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:02.379
Where have you been, you jerk?

198
00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:17.310
I can't believe you've never
called after moving to Seoul.

199
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.132
I waited for so long.

200
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.759
Why didn't you call first?

201
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.262
I didn't have your number.

202
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.514
Your mom wouldn't tell me either.

203
00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:29.307
You knew the school I was attending.

204
00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.825
I wanted to look for you.

205
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.828
But I couldn't.

206
00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:38.150
You ruined your exam because of me.

207
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.333
I couldn't ruin anything more.

208
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.255
Wait.

209
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.677
Did you give up on the bar exam?

210
00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:54.374
I took the first test yesterday.

211
00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:57.127
Isn't it a little too early to give up?

212
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.977
I see.

213
00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.856
Then what are you doing here?

214
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.035
Working a part-time job.

215
00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:06.511
Shouldn't you be studying every second?

216
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.680
I'm doing this to survive.

217
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.765
I have to make a living too.

218
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:14.284
What do you mean? Doesn't your mom help you?

219
00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:18.440
I'm old enough to look after myself.

220
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.817
But every second counts for you.

221
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:23.403
If I fail the exam because of a part-time job,

222
00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:26.129
it means I'm just not good enough.

223
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.200
Don't worry.

224
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.452
It's a restaurant, so I get free food,

225
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.220
the lady here sometimes helps with my laundry,

226
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:36.264
and on weekends, I get to go fishing too.

227
00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.558
Above all,

228
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.729
I like looking at these fish.

229
00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:46.385
What's great about staring
at fish that are about to die?

230
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.277
Exactly.

231
00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.931
They might die any moment now,

232
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.934
but no matter how painful or scary it is,

233
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.368
they're unable to cry or scream.

234
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.330
I think judicial officers must be like that.

235
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:05.168
You hated how your fate was
decided the moment you were born.

236
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.755
I guess you've changed your mind.

237
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.966
No.

238
00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.468
Nothing's changed.

239
00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.748
I still hate it, and it's still a heavy burden.

240
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:21.434
But I hate this heavy burden so
much that I'll make sure I make it.

241
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.382
That's the revenge for my fate,
which was already decided...

242
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.816
the moment I was born.

243
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.578
So Mi-joo, how are you doing? How's your job?

244
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.154
Things have never gone well for me,

245
00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:51.006
and I never had a reason to be successful.

246
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.550
But I'm going to start doing well.

247
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.220
I just found something I want to do.

248
00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.500
You just focus on your studies.

249
00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:04.087
You might be able to pass it
with the top score if you don't work.

250
00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:06.313
Let me invest in you.

251
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:10.609
I don't have much right now,
so I'll start with myself.

252
00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:14.988
Let me help you get your revenge.

253
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.455
Thank you for everything.

254
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.166
We never had any kids,

255
00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.069
so you were like a son to us.

256
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.878
This is so sad.

257
00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.781
Don't be so sad.

258
00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:35.508
He'll study hard and become a judicial officer.

259
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.954
Visit me...

260
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.539
when you need to blow off steam.

261
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:41.207
I'll give you a ride.

262
00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.543
Yes, I'll do that. Thank you.

263
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.295
Future judicial officer, Kang-ho!

264
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.937
You got this!

265
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.220
Did you talk to them?

266
00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:57.447
Yes, it went well.

267
00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.949
- Wait, they'll see us.
- What?

268
00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:03.495
Wait for me!

269
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.804
Focus!

270
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.515
Mi-joo.

271
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.194
Kang-ho, I'll wash these too.

272
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.433
- No! It's okay.
- Let me.

273
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.644
- No!
- There's another one.

274

275
00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:47.649
Mi-joo.

276
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.249
Yes?

Gosh, look at those two.

285
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:22.449
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

286
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.103
Don't forget your bar exam meal.

287
00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:27.036
- Bye.
- Okay.

288
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.332
- Have a great day.
- Okay!

289
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.836
That looks good.

You know what?

294
00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:23.426
You already saved me twice.

295
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.373
Once when I choked on candy,

296
00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.000
and...

297
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:31.851
when I got into a motorcycle accident.

298
00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:36.674
If you save me one more time,

299
00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:40.610
then I'll let you marry me.

300
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.868
- That's weird.
- What?

301
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.913
Why am I punished for doing something nice?

302
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.541
Punished?

303
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.862
- Come here. What did you say?
- I was joking.

304
00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.948
- I'll teach you a lesson!
- No, it was a joke.

305
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.674
- Okay?
- It was a joke.

306
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.219
- Mi-joo.
- Yes?

307
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:08.847
You should be grateful...

308
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.876
to someone who makes you want to live,

309
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.686
not someone who saved you.

310
00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.443
I want to live...

311
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.196
a very long time with you.

312
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:10.518
All right.

313
00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.368
I got him.

314
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.988
Okay, you're all set.

315
00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.907
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

316
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.575
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

317
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.828
Goodness, do you feel bad?

318
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:30.622
Then get well soon.

319
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.583
That'll comfort your mom, you, and all of us.

320
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:38.296
It's a relief he can go back and forth
instead of staying at the rehab center.

321
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.173
- He's much better, right?
- Yes.

322
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.925
- Here.
- Goodness.

323
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.968
You like abalone porridge, so I made some.

324
00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:45.762
I also packed water kimchi,

325
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:48.223
so have a bite while he exercises.

326
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.307
Don't skip your meals.

327
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.142
You didn't have to.

328
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.477
You didn't have to.

329
00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.605
You feel sick in your stomach because of stress.

330
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.858
You have so much to look after every day.

331
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:01.653
And you always eat in a hurry in the kitchen.

332
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.571
That's why you feel sick!

333
00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:04.572
She's right.

334
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.908
Kang-ho has gotten much better now,

335
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.826
so you need to relax a little.

336
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.302
You need to relax a little.

337
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.707
- See you later.
- Okay, go on.

338
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:17.225
Wait!

339
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.629
- Oh, my.
- Wait!

340
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.797
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

341
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:21.839
Wait.

342
00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:25.343
I was worried that you'd already left.

343
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.443
Kang-ho, give me your hand.

344
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:29.305
Here.

345
00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.239
Goodness, what's that for?

346
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:34.769
You'll find a homemade snack store for pets...

347
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.522
near the back exit of the hospital.

348
00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.483
Can you pick up an Alaskan salmon tart,

349
00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:43.486
ricotta cheese cookies, and oatmeal dog chews?

350
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.155
- Please get me...
- I knew it.

351
00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:47.073
Go.

352
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.200
Mom, go.

353
00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:50.925
Go on.

354
00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.370
Go!

355
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:53.830
Go.

356
00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.164
Just go.

357
00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:56.723
Go!

358
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.938
That's it.

359
00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:08.067
Next, left foot.

360
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.781
Two more steps. One, two, three.

361
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.977
That's it.

362
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.535
Good.

363
00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.246
One more time.

364
00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:22.483
Last one.

365
00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.569
- Excuse me.
- Last one.

366
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:25.528
Excuse me.

367
00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:28.740
Where can I get some digestive medicine?

368
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.923
- Please follow me.
- Okay.

369
00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:33.411
<i><font color="#ffff00">Physical Therapy Room</font></i>

370
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.329
- Bye, Kang-ho.
- Goodbye.

371
00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.096
Get some rest.

372
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.435
Mom?

373
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.862
Mom.

374
00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:00.203
Mom.

375
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:02.955
Mom!

376
00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:10.323
Mom...

377
00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:11.741
Mom.

378
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:13.201
Mom.

379
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.911
Mom.

380
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.120
Mom!

381
00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:17.720
Kang-ho.

382
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:20.583
- Mom!
- Kang-ho.

383
00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:22.293
Mom!

384
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:25.463
- What's wrong?
- Mom!

385
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.465
Kang-ho, look at me.

386
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.842
- Mom!
- Look at me!

387
00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:32.193
Look at me!

388
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.055
When you don't see me,

389
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.364
where did I say you could find me?

390
00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.033
Pig farm.

391
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.521
Potato field.

392
00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:42.438
And?

393
00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:44.413
Bathroom.

394
00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:45.858
Kitchen.

395
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:48.835
And? If you don't see me there?

396
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.420
I should call you.

397
00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.382
You're right.

398
00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:56.619
I'll...

399
00:23:56.643 --> 00:23:59.997
never go anywhere without you, okay?

400
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.640
- Never.
- Okay.

401
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:05.977
Okay?

402
00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:12.135
The results of the presidential
preference poll this month showed...

403
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:16.597
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo as
the leading candidate by 42.5%.

404
00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.558
- Yes.
- This shows...

405
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:22.520
many people are showing their
support for your candidacy.

406
00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.397
If you do declare your candidacy,

407
00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:28.317
is there a pledge you'd like to make?

408
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.361
If I run for the presidential election,

409
00:24:30.385 --> 00:24:33.588
I'll only abide by one principle.

410
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.424
"Come empty, return empty."

411
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:39.287
I, Oh Tae-soo, will come empty-handed...

412
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.454
<i><font color="#ffff00">Encountering A New Era, A New Person</font></i>

413
00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:42.331
...and leave empty-handed.

414
00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:43.583
I see.

415
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:46.627
That was Assemblyman Oh's
principle when it comes to politics.

416
00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.603
If he declares candidacy, that is.

417
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:53.301
Let's look forward to seeing
the rise of a new political leader.

418
00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:56.679
This time, I'd like to ask a casual question.

419
00:24:56.703 --> 00:25:01.407
Who gives you the most strength when you need...

420
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.436
<i>What did you just say?</i>

421
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.662
<i>You want the money back?</i>

422
00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:10.610
<i>The term was for him to leave
Korea right after the accident.</i>

423
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:14.447
<i>But Mr. Yang Gu-man suddenly took his own life,</i>

424
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:16.365
<i>which led to a police investigation,</i>

425
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:19.216
<i>and ended up putting us in danger.</i>

426
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.621
<i>This is a breach of contract.</i>

427
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:25.958
I already know the hit-and-run
accident and suicide were in the contract.

428
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:28.628
As soon as I received a huge
amount of money in the bank,

429
00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:31.130
I got a call about my husband's death.

430
00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:34.607
And the day after that,
I received his suicide note.

431
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:36.761
<i>It was all written there.</i>

432
00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:40.514
<i>Where he got the money, who made him do it,</i>

433
00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:43.783
<i>and why he had to take his own life.</i>

434
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.118
<i>Where is...</i>

435
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.855
<i>Mr. Yang's suicide note?</i>

436
00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:51.582
If you lay a finger on my child or me,

437
00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:55.252
<i>that note will be sent to the police.</i>

438
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.089
<i>I must save myself too.</i>

439
00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.428
All right.

440
00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:07.890
Would you like to continue watching?

441
00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:11.796
It took me a lot of effort...

442
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.215
to find all these.

443
00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.940
Do you know that?

444
00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.438
Apparently at the time of the accident,

445
00:26:19.462 --> 00:26:23.766
Kang-ho was asleep in the car.

446
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.601
How does that make any sense?

447
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.478
He'd just cut ties with his mother,

448
00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.329
but managed to sleep peacefully afterward?

449
00:26:29.353 --> 00:26:34.766
Does this mean Kang-ho is
the worst jerk in history?

450
00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:37.697
Or did someone slip him...

451
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.366
sleeping pills or something?

452
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.008
Oh, right.

453
00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:46.747
The day before the accident, your daughter...

454
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:50.084
got a prescription for sleeping pills.

455
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.168
Mr. Song!

456
00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:53.671
Right, I enjoyed your show.

457
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.381
You were eloquent.

458
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:58.858
"I'll come empty-handed and leave empty-handed."

459
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.568
How wonderful.

460
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:04.015
Who'd watch that and imagine that...

461
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:08.409
you had your future son-in-law murdered?

462
00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:28.304
Do you remember...

463
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:30.291
Choi Hae-sik?

464
00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.667
Choi... Who?

465
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:33.127
Back in 1987,

466
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.628
during the urban improvement,

467
00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:38.132
the man who was running
a pig farm in Bongu-dong.

468
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.384
That Choi Hae-sik.

469
00:27:40.408 --> 00:27:43.262
Goodness, I don't even
remember someone I met yesterday.

470
00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:45.556
A man from 30 years ago? Anyway, what about him?

471
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.450
Do you know how my daughter
came to meet Choi Kang-ho?

472
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:52.563
My daughter was arrested by him...

473
00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:55.274
for carrying illegal drugs.

474
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:56.734
It was odd, so I checked.

475
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:59.695
But they didn't receive any order or report...

476
00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:02.088
regarding illegal drugs.

477
00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:04.033
That's right.

478
00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:07.259
He approached her on purpose.

479
00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:10.221
I'm sure...

480
00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:13.167
it was to use my daughter...

481
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:16.852
to eventually approach me.

482
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:20.674
<i>Choi Kang-ho already knew everything.</i>

483
00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:25.986
<i>He knew who killed his father...</i>

484
00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:28.614
<i>30 years ago.</i>

485
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.104
Who killed his father?

486
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:35.398
He's Choi Hae-sik's son.

487
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.774
Choi Kang-ho.

488
00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:38.499
Exactly.

489
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:43.587
Who killed Choi Kang-ho's father, Choi Hae-sik?

490
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.840
Did you kill him?

491
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:48.577
You did.

492
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.594
Oh, my.

493
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.680
Did I kill him?

494
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:54.723
Really?

495
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.352
I didn't know because there was no evidence.

496
00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.216
But isn't this odd?

497
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.344
A kid who wanted to take
revenge on his father's killer...

498
00:29:05.368 --> 00:29:09.613
came to work for me, without
hiding that he's Choi Hae-sik's son?

499
00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:12.518
That's crazy.

500
00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:13.728
Are you saying...

501
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.204
you already knew who Choi Kang-ho was?

502
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.333
Look, Mr. Oh.

503
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:22.820
Do you really think...

504
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:26.365
I wouldn't have checked before I took him in...

505
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.799
to do the dirtiest of jobs for me?

506
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.557
She said she'd give me drugs, but it was a lie!

507
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.977
So...

508
00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.314
I killed her.

509
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.390
No, Chairman Song.

510
00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:54.310
I didn't hear anything.
Please, sir. Don't kill me!

511
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:57.897
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant and
owner of a street <i>tteokbokki</i> stall,

512
00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:00.566
went to an alley nearby to return lipstick...

513
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.026
Woo Mi-jeong had left behind,

514
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.779
where he found her dead.

515
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:07.573
The defendant checked
to see if she was conscious,

516
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.742
then a passerby saw it and made a report.

517
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:13.802
He was soon arrested on
the scene by nearby officers.

518
00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:17.916
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Livestock Industry Permit
Jin Young-soon, Choi Hae-sik</font></i>

519
00:30:18.477 --> 00:30:21.337
<i>This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.</i>

520
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.005
It's a pleasure.

521
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.173
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho...

522
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.524
with the Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

523
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:32.515
Your grandson's name won't be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

524
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:36.951
Prosecutor Choi will ensure
discretion throughout it.

525
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.950
I'm really curious...

526
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:55.663
about your parents, who brought you
up to be such a promising prosecutor.

527
00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:58.472
What are your parents like?

528
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.501
So...

529
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:04.520
what does your father do?

530
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.023
He passed away.

531
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.345
Goodness.

532
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:14.029
I shouldn't have asked.

533
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:16.016
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.601
It's all right.

535
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:19.603
He passed away before I was born.

536
00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.647
I don't have any memory of him.

537
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.664
He passed away...

538
00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.901
even before you were born?

539
00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:28.737
He must've passed away at a very young age.

540
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.546
What happened?

541
00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:35.411
I heard he took his own life.

542
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:37.136
Suicide?

543
00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:38.747
Why did he do that?

544
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.876
His farm went under after a fire,

545
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.170
and he was apparently under a lot of stress.

546
00:31:45.194 --> 00:31:47.605
I don't know anything more.

547
00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:50.816
Well...

548
00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:55.154
To be frank, I don't want to know.

549
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.058
To me, my father...

550
00:31:58.082 --> 00:32:01.395
was just an irresponsible man...

551
00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.954
who abandoned his wife and unborn child.

552
00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:11.045
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

553
00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.881
Have a drink with me.

554
00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:28.756
Prosecutor Choi, let me ask you something.

555
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.898
What's the reason?

556
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:34.386
- Sorry?
- This trial, I mean.

557
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.738
Are you after money or power?

558
00:32:39.165 --> 00:32:41.033
If I want it,

559
00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.577
can you give it to me?

560
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.649
You just saved my grandson.

561
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:48.832
So why not?

562
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.630
In that case, both.

563
00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:57.868
Man.

564
00:32:57.892 --> 00:33:00.719
You're a man, aren't you?

565
00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:02.805
Mr. Soh.

566
00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:07.768
Go on.

567
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:18.472
In return,

568
00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.115
you'll be a part of my family now.

569
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.327
Thank you.

570
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.649
Thank you.

571
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.332
Thank you very much.

572
00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:32.376
That's enough.

573
00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:35.322
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

574
00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:39.785
I don't care what Kang-ho had on his mind...

575
00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:41.328
when he approached me.

576
00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:44.763
I don't care if it's ambition or wrath.

577
00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:48.210
Because his hands are now also dirty.

578
00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:52.229
All I want to do is use his talent,

579
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.150
and then I'll abandon him.

580
00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:10.691
Goodness, Mr. Son.

581
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:13.986
What on earth are you doing? It's been an hour.

582
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.158
It's because my breathing rhythm is off.

583
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:20.117
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:23.635
This time, I'll really insert it.

585
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.552
Darn it.

586
00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.904
Even fish don't breathe like that.

587
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:43.891
Mr. Son.

588
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:47.561
Are you really a licensed doctor?

589
00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.271
I'm getting a bit anxious.

590
00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:51.330
Goodness.

591
00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:55.235
- Oh, my! What are you doing?
- Kang-ho.

592
00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.737
My mom feels anxious.

593
00:34:56.761 --> 00:35:00.255
No, Kang-ho. That's dangerous. Give it to me.

594
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:01.784
Are you really licensed?

595
00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:05.302
I really am! What's with you?

596
00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.623
Honey, tell him.

597
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:09.124
He is.

598
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:12.586
He'd never forge a license.

599
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.839
Although he's forged his
resident registration card before.

600
00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:18.023
- What?
- What?

601
00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.776
I did it because I love you!

602
00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:23.764
I thought that was how I could have you!

603
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.531
You're my woman!

604
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:28.477
I thought you might not like
me because of our age gap.

605
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:32.162
Oh, my. Is that really why?

606
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.957
Did you want me that badly?

607
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.362
Good grief.

608
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.462
How is that relevant right now?

609
00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.658
He'll bleed if you stab him.

610
00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:46.510
That'll make me sad. Do you want me to be sad?

611
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.585
Good boy.

612
00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:55.295
- Good boy.
- Good, Kang-ho.

613
00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:58.146
- Good boy.
- You must've been startled.

614
00:35:58.573 --> 00:35:59.716
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

615
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.343
No, it's fine.

616
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:05.362
You can feel that way if he
doesn't seem very trustworthy.

617
00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:11.687
By any chance, do you know...

618
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:15.581
a man named Choi Mun-sik,
who owns a carp farm in Negi-ri?

619
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.964
Hello?

620
00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.341
The realtor?

621
00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:28.829
Yes, one second.

622
00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.956
Was it Choi Mun-sik?

623
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.916
- Isn't it Yoo Mun-sik?
- Not Lee?

624
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.418
No, he's Choi Mun-sik.

625
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.337
Yes, that huge carp farm
in Negi-ri. Of course I know.

626
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.521
I've heard of him too.

627
00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:42.301
We know. Go on.

628
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.026
What's with him?

629
00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:48.265
Mr. Son, go on and talk.

630
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.726
Go on and talk, Mr. Son.

631
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.227
Mr. Son...

632
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:53.353
What's with him?

633
00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:56.440
So that Choi Mun-sik...

634
00:36:56.464 --> 00:36:59.026
I have to go to Seoul tomorrow.

635
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.628
Seoul? What for?

636
00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:07.326
I'm sorry I keep asking
you guys for favors like this.

637
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.121
Don't say that. We're neighbors.

638
00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.456
Don't worry.

639
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.891
We'll give the pigs their
meals and Kang-ho his feed...

640
00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:24.509
We'll make sure Kang-ho has his
meal and the pigs their feed.

641
00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:26.818
Don't worry about a thing.

642
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.765
Okay. Andrea has the farm covered,

643
00:37:29.789 --> 00:37:32.017
so please just look after Kang-ho.

644
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.742
I'll get going then.

645
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.105
Right.

646
00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:39.566
Kang-ho, I'll come back soon...

647
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.626
after I get your stuff.

648
00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:45.489
I'll go with you and come back with you.

649
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.130
Kang-ho.

650
00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.118
I told you, didn't I?

651
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:54.081
The place is really dusty
because people are moving things.

652
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.849
If dust gets into your body, you'll get sick.

653
00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:00.420
And that'll make me really sad.

654
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.589
Do you want me to be sad?

655
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.231
No.

656
00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:11.113
How soon will you come back?

657
00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.143
Around five o'clock.

658
00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:17.327
- Five o'clock.
- Yes.

659
00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:21.066
So be good and do as they say, okay?

660
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.583
Make sure you study and exercise.

661
00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:26.238
- Okay.
- Good.

662
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.431
<i><font color="#ffff00">We're All Jou-ri Family</font></i>

663
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:47.092
I told you, didn't I?

664
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.943
I told you he'd be doing something stupid.

665
00:38:50.202 --> 00:38:51.555
Why are you here?

666
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.282
I heard Ms. Jin is coming back at five o'clock.

667
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.200
Yes.

668
00:38:57.376 --> 00:39:00.772
So what time is five o'clock?

669
00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:04.318
We're only seven, so we can't read the clock,

670
00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:08.488
but I do know we have a
lot of time to play with him.

671
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:10.324
- Yes!
- Yes!

672
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:13.076
No, I can't play today.

673
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.746
I have to study and exercise.

674
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.138
Study? We'll help you.

675
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.166
Exercise?

676
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.169
You know we're experts at that.

677
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:23.754
- Let's play!
- No! I can't!

678
00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:26.089
- Let's play!
- No! I can't play right now!

679
00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:27.507
No!

680
00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:30.275
No!

681
00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:56.927
<i>I left everything as it was,
because I thought you'd return soon.</i>

682
00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:01.124
But the realtor called and
said your lease has expired.

683
00:40:01.148 --> 00:40:02.709

684
00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.935
{\an8}I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

685
00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:15.987
I've always wanted to visit this place.

686
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.408
And I'm finally here.

687
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.296
Are you taking this painting?

688
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:36.049
This is...

689
00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:38.426
- Sure.
- Okay.

690
00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:54.693
He had some things here too.

693
00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:10.819
He doesn't have a lot here.

694
00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:15.073
I put his personal belongings in here.

695
00:41:15.097 --> 00:41:16.283
And... Right.

696
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.925
That plant pot is his too.

697
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.540
It looks dead, so you can
leave it. We'll throw it out.

698
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:25.292
No.

699
00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:28.253
It's not dead.

700
00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:30.714
The stem looks perfectly fine.

701
00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:32.981
I'll take it.

702
00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:35.734
Why didn't anyone water this?

703
00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:39.473
You can't go in there. Ma'am, please leave.

704
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.099
Please.

705
00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:44.436
Where is Choi Kang-ho? Where is he?

706
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.438
Woobyeok Group bought him off, right?

707
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:47.981
That's why the case was acquitted!

708
00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.441
My daughter is the evidence!

709
00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:52.152
So why was the case
dismissed for lack of evidence?

710
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.862
Ma'am, you can't do this here!

711
00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:56.781
If you don't stop, we'll arrest
you for obstruction of justice.

712
00:41:56.805 --> 00:41:57.908
Come on.

713
00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.451
Where is Choi Kang-ho?

714
00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:00.744
Please leave.

715
00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:02.746
Where is he?

716
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.512
Please leave.

717
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:09.726
What was that woman talking about?

718
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.926
<i><font color="#ffff00">My Son, Jung Jong-gu, is Innocent!</font></i>

719
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.618
{\an8}<i><font color="#ffff00">I Denounce Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho!</font></i>

720
00:42:27.169 --> 00:42:28.745
Excuse me.

721
00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:31.456
Why are you doing this?

722
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:35.335
What did my son do so wrong
for you to do this here?

723
00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:38.573
Are you Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's mother?

724
00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:41.091
Yes, I'm his mother.

725
00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:42.744
If you feel something is unfair,

726
00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:45.664
{\an8}you should go through the
legal process and get a retrial.

727
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:49.599
{\an8}Why on earth are you
condemning my son so harshly?

728
00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:54.130
{\an8}What's wrong with you? Give it back!

729
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:55.897
Give it back!

730
00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.013
My son...

731
00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:04.656
has a physical disability.

732
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:09.187
He couldn't even hurt a fly.

733
00:43:09.211 --> 00:43:14.025
Your son knew that, but he
took a bribe from a rich man...

734
00:43:14.049 --> 00:43:16.486
and turned my son into a murderer.

735
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.489
When my husband asked to hear him out,

736
00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:22.826
he said such harsh things and made him collapse.

737
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.953
Your son is such a horrible person.

738
00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:28.456
Why did you give birth to such scum?

739
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.499
Darn it!

740
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:32.419
I'll make your son pay for it!

741
00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:36.146
I may forget to eat,

742
00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:41.026
but I won't forget to pray that...

743
00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:44.139
your son is punished and dies!

744
00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:46.474
You got that?

745
00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:49.200
Why should my son be punished?

746
00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:52.272
Your son should be punished for his crime.

747
00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.482
He was bribed?

748
00:43:54.506 --> 00:43:57.068
Why would he? What more could he want?

749
00:43:57.092 --> 00:44:00.128
Did you see him take it?

750
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:03.700
If you say anything of this sort again,

751
00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:06.119
I'll make you pay for it.

752
00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.203
Understand?

753
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:08.788
All right.

754
00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.040
Kill me.

755
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.890
Just kill me.

756
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:14.184
Kill me!

757
00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:17.464
My poor son...

758
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.342
Now the next one is a science question.

759
00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:22.859
This insect lives in a flower.

760
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.346
Butterfly.

761
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.029
Wrong.

762
00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.766
- Bee.
- Wrong.

763
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.184
What?

764
00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:32.812
Silverfish, cabbage
caterpillars, fleas, and aphids.

765
00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.356
Correct!

766
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.608
I was actually talking
about napa cabbage flowers.

767
00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:39.125
Okay, ten points to Lee Seo-jin.

768
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:42.447
Hey, Ye-jin, that's not right.

769
00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:45.632
He mentioned four. That means he gets 40 points.

770
00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:51.054
Okay. He can get 40 points.

771
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:52.999
That could've been bad, right?

772
00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:56.017
Right, sure.

773
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.422
Okay, the next one is a math question.

774
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:02.967
Seo-jin had five apples.

775
00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:06.903
But Ye-jin stole three. How many are left?

776
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:09.239
Kang-ho was faster.

777
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:13.436
Simple larceny shall be
punished for up to six years,

778
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.623
or by a fine under $10,000, under
Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

779
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:24.379
What's simple larceny?

780
00:45:25.305 --> 00:45:26.965
What?

781
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:29.384
What's simple larceny?

782
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:34.514
Catch it!

783
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:37.517
Oh, no. She's angry.

784
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:42.799
You should've caught it.

785
00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:45.135
My mom sent it to us from the U.S.

786
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.637
You almost lost it!

787
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:49.639
- The U.S.?
- Yes, the U.S.

788
00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:50.557
Look.

789
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.808
It's written in English.

790
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.242
"From the U.S."

791
00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:55.937
Sorry.

792
00:45:55.961 --> 00:46:00.358
Anyway, I'll get really angry
if you miss the ball again.

793
00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:01.818
- Okay.
- All right.

794
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:03.626
Play ball!

795
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:11.161
Strike!

796
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.245
Hey, Ye-jin.

797
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:15.138
- That's a strike?
- Yes.

798
00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:18.293
You're really good at baseball.

799
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:20.185
Did your dad teach you?

800
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.508
Don't ever mention my dad again,

801
00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:27.775
especially in front of my grandma.

802
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:28.970
Why not?

803
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:31.529
This is a huge secret.

804
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.199
Actually, my dad is...

805
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.747
What? Your dad is a horrifying jerk?

806
00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.526
I'm sure of it.

807
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.921
My grandma said that countless times.

808
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:50.506
But what's a horrifying jerk?

809
00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.930
Tell him.

810
00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:02.518
Do you know what horrifying means?

811
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:06.174
It means scary in other words.

812
00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:11.554
So it means our dad is
someone who's really scary.

813
00:47:11.578 --> 00:47:13.431
- I see.
- He's so scary,

814
00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:15.892
my grandma shudders...

815
00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:18.811
whenever she mentions him.

816
00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:22.732
I even saw her eyes turn white.

817
00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:25.026
He must be really scary.

818
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.904
So you'd better behave.

819
00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:30.740
If you don't, we'll tell on you...

820
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:33.409
to our horrible jerk dad!

821
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:34.702
Understood?

822
00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:35.662
Yes, ma'am.

823
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:39.374
Come on. You don't have to be so polite.

824
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:40.416
Okay.

825
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.378
All right, let's get back to baseball.

826
00:47:43.402 --> 00:47:45.311
All right.

827
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.408
No!

828
00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:09.028
- All safe?
- Yes, I'm fine.

829
00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.738
I'm talking about the ball!

830
00:48:10.762 --> 00:48:13.074
Is my bouncy ball safe?

831
00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:14.632
No way.

832
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.829
Choi Kang-ho!

833
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:22.125
How dare you lose my bouncy ball?

834
00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:23.668
My...

835
00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:24.877
My dad...

836
00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:27.755
will come and teach you a lesson!

837
00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.924
Ye-jin, wait!

838
00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:31.691
Seo-jin!

839
00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:35.179
<i>Kang-ho would never do something like that.</i>

840
00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:38.600
Things like that happen from time
to time when a trial doesn't go well.

841
00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:40.366
Don't worry about it.

842
00:48:45.714 --> 00:48:47.457
No.

843
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.180
Goodness.

844
00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:05.418
Are you all right?

845
00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.727
Of course not. How can I be fine?

846
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.968
What are you doing?

847
00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:16.471
Lady, what do you think?

848
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:18.598
I'm taking a photo of the assailant.

849
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.308
What do you mean?

850
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:24.646
Look how much damage
your beat-up truck caused...

851
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.065
to my expensive foreign car.

852
00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:29.442
You hit me from the back.

853
00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:32.445
I don't want to hear it.

854
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.238
I'll settle for $50,000.

855
00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:36.991
If anything, I should be saying that!

856
00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:38.618
Forget it. I'll call the police.

857
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.662
The police? Listen, lady.

858
00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:42.372
Do you really want to go to prison?

859
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:44.457
Why would I go to prison?

860
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.959
You should keep a safe distance when you drive!

861
00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:49.379
Safe distance, my foot.

862
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:53.341
If you can't drive, you should
just cook for your kids at home,

863
00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:58.846
and just online shop with your husband's money.

864
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.433
Why the heck do these women
have to drive on the road,

865
00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:06.953
and get in the way of a great man?

866
00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:13.194
I don't have a husband who makes money,

867
00:50:13.218 --> 00:50:16.364
but I still need to feed my kid.

868
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:18.032
So I drive this smelly truck...

869
00:50:18.056 --> 00:50:20.493
- to make money...
- I see.

870
00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:22.328
So you don't have a husband.

871
00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:23.886
Lady.

872
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:28.668
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

873
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.628
The way you talk back to me...

874
00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:34.674
shows just how tough your life must be.

875
00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:35.633
My gosh.

876
00:50:35.657 --> 00:50:38.636
How could you be so brazen and yell at me?

877
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.528
I can't believe this.

878
00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:43.266
Goodness.

879
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.659
Goodness, look at you.

880
00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:50.830
I told her she didn't have
to worry about a thing.

881
00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:54.193
But look at him now. What do I do?

882
00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.127
Goodness.

883
00:50:57.764 --> 00:50:58.740
Darn it!

884
00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:02.508
Those darned twins.

885
00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:05.344
My gosh.

886
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:07.221
Goodness.

887
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:09.348
Wait.

888
00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.476
Shouldn't he...

889
00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.463
wash his lower body too?

890
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.590
Right.

891
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:19.093
Just strip him naked and wash him.

892
00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:22.236
Just pretend he's a seven-year-old.

893
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:25.349
But still, his body isn't
that of a seven-year-old.

894
00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:29.771
Then what do we do? Do we just
leave him covered up in mud?

895
00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:33.649
Then you do it. Think of him as Sam-sik.

896
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:37.543
Why would I bathe that rotten kid?

897
00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:40.880
Then I'll do it.

898
00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:43.868
I bathe my husband too.

899
00:51:43.892 --> 00:51:46.996
- Oh, my.
- Sparkling clean.

900
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.290
He gets sulky and refuses to eat...

901
00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:51.542
if I don't bathe him.

902
00:51:51.566 --> 00:51:54.310
He's such a whiny baby.

903
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:58.356
All right. Here we go.

904
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.399
Oh, my.

905
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:04.278
- It's all right. I'll be gentle.
- Well...

906
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.224
- Hey, she's back.
- Mom!

907
00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.558
Mom!

908
00:52:07.582 --> 00:52:09.200
Mom!

909
00:52:35.777 --> 00:52:37.311
Mom.

910
00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:41.607
May I go out for a moment?

911
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:48.864
I lost Ye-jin's bouncy
ball while we were playing.

912
00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:51.200
No.

913
00:52:51.293 --> 00:52:52.353
We weren't playing.

914
00:52:52.377 --> 00:52:53.813
We were exercising.

915
00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.773
I studied too, Mom.

916
00:52:55.797 --> 00:52:58.526
Silverfish, cabbage caterpillars, fleas,

917
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.820
and aphids live in a flower.

918
00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:03.963
This flower is actually a napa cabbage flower.

919
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:07.633
But I didn't know that.

920
00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:14.640
I have to find that bouncy ball.

921
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:19.422
She's going to tell her dad.

922
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:24.010
And their dad is a horrifying
jerk, so he's really scary.

923
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.137
Mom, please, just once.

924
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.514
It'll only be a moment. I'll be quick.

925
00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:31.657
Right, why don't we go together?

926
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.855
Why did you live like that?

927
00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:38.205
Why did you live like that?

928
00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.791
What's all this?

929
00:53:41.009 --> 00:53:44.128
Did you take money and bribes and do bad things?

930
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:47.074
No, right? Say you didn't.

931
00:53:47.098 --> 00:53:48.409
Say you didn't!

932
00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:51.427
Say you didn't!

933
00:53:54.606 --> 00:53:57.126
You brought tears and pain...

934
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.685
into other people's lives!

935
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.605
Did you think you'd live a good life?

936
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.608
Did you think you'd be fine?

937
00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.152
Look.

938
00:54:08.453 --> 00:54:11.599
Look how you've been
punished for what you've done!

939
00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:13.616
Look!

940
00:54:13.833 --> 00:54:15.910
Look, you punk.

941
00:54:29.808 --> 00:54:32.009
It's all my fault.

942
00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:36.889
I told you to help those in need.

943
00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:40.893
I told you to save those who've been wronged.

944
00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:44.146
But I ended up raising you like this.

945
00:54:45.865 --> 00:54:49.512
I locked you up in a pigsty
and didn't even let you breathe,

946
00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:52.321
telling you to only study!

947
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.166
I wanted to make you rich and powerful,

948
00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:09.046
but instead, I made you
into a cold-hearted monster!

949
00:55:13.393 --> 00:55:15.204
It's my fault.

950
00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:18.764
- It's my fault!
- Mom.

951
00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:22.962
Mom.

952
00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.548
Mom, I'm sorry.

953
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:28.733
Mom, I was wrong. I won't do that again.

954
00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:31.861
Mom...

955
00:55:33.788 --> 00:55:38.200
But I really don't remember, Mom.

956
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:45.416
Am I a bad person, Mom?

957
00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:48.669
Is that why I was punished?

958
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.839
Was this a punishment from above,

959
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.759
and not a chance?

960
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:58.679
No.

961
00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:00.765
No.

962
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.725
No.

963
00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.894
Mom.

964
00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:08.799
Mom, I'm sorry.

965
00:56:08.823 --> 00:56:10.524
No.

966
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:13.027
No.

967
00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:24.622
All done.

968
00:56:25.298 --> 00:56:26.832
Come over here.

969
00:56:27.258 --> 00:56:28.959
It stinks.

970
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.505
You're right.

971
00:56:32.972 --> 00:56:36.967
That's why you hated this place so much.

972
00:56:37.018 --> 00:56:41.123
And I also didn't want to bring you...

973
00:56:41.147 --> 00:56:43.474
to such a smelly, dirty place.

974
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:47.228
But...

975
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.566
there's something I really want to show you now.

976
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:05.940
There are two animals that
are useful from their head to toe.

977
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.040
Do you know what they are?

978
00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:11.126
Humans...

979
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.462
and pigs.

980
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:18.577
Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,

981
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:20.719
but that's not the case.

982
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:24.166
They not only do their business in one place,

983
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.517
but they also only sleep where it's clean.

984
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:29.922
They bathe often in mud to cool themselves...

985
00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:32.523
and get rid of bugs.

986
00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:34.593
But humans...

987
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:38.946
started to lock them up in tiny pigsties.

988
00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:43.894
The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,

989
00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:47.955
so they began to rub their
bodies on their own excrement.

990
00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:52.668
That's how they grew
dirtier and more aggressive.

991
00:57:55.054 --> 00:57:57.089
Isn't that so sad?

992
00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:59.300
It is.

993
00:57:59.934 --> 00:58:02.595
However, what's really sad is this.

994
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:04.957
Pigs are unable to lift their heads,

995
00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:08.309
so they live their entire
life staring at the ground.

996
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:13.898
There's only one way for
a pig to look up at the sky.

997
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.318
It's...

998
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.570
to fall down.

999
00:58:20.705 --> 00:58:22.057
Fall down?

1000
00:58:22.081 --> 00:58:22.975
Yes.

1001
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.950
That's right.

1002
00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.896
<i>Falling down...</i>

1003
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.998
<i>is a way for you to see another world,
a world you've never seen before,</i>

1004
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.667
both for pigs...

1005
00:58:33.968 --> 00:58:35.878
and people.

1006
00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:48.626
We've fallen over right now.

1007
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.518
Both Mom and you, Kang-ho.

1008
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:54.813
That's how we got to see this new world.

1009
00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:59.235
A world we've never seen
and we couldn't see before.

1010
00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:02.404
A precious world...

1011
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:05.449
we were meant to see.

1012
00:59:07.085 --> 00:59:09.370
A precious world.

1013
00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:26.095
I'm sorry.

1014
00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:29.416
- Hello?
- <i>Hey!</i>

1015
00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.918
<i>Where are you?</i>

1016
00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:33.519
<i>When will you pay me back...?</i>

1017
00:59:34.362 --> 00:59:37.523
I'm sorry. Goodness.

1018
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.844
Is this it?

1019
00:59:40.868 --> 00:59:43.570
- I'm sure of it.
- It's here.

1020
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:46.141
Excuse me.

1021
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:48.102
Lee Mi-joo is here, right? Where is she?

1022
00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:50.854
- Where is Lee Mi-joo?
- What are you doing?

1023
00:59:50.878 --> 00:59:51.939
Are you the owner?

1024
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:54.650
- Yes. What's the matter?
- Where is Lee Mi-joo?

1025
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:56.652
That wench ran off with our membership fees.

1026
00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:59.947
And that wench Baek Sun-young
took $2000 from me!

1027
00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:02.074
She's not here, so please leave.

1028
01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.701
- Leave.
- Call the police!

1029
01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.244
- Look around!
- Okay.

1030
01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.662
- Stop this.
- I'm not leaving!

1031
01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:07.955
- Start looking!
- Stop it!

1032
01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:09.373
- Stop it!
- Move aside!

1033
01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:11.515
- Move!
- Hey!

1034
01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:12.585
There she is.

1035
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.794
It's her.

1036
01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:15.921
Please give me some more time.

1037
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.689
I'll pay you back soon.

1038
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:23.178
So Mi-joo, are you drinking <i>soju?</i>

1039
01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.264
It's too early to be drinking.

1040
01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.099
<i>You must not know.</i>

1041
01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.185
<i>Soju</i> tastes best after you get fired.

1042
01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.244
Right.

1043
01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.981
I got fired again.

1044
01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.692
I got fired because I was too old.

1045
01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.902
I got fired because of my bad credit.

1046
01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:41.795
I got fired because of my creditors.

1047
01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.455
Should I just go back to
my kids and start farming?

1048
01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.540
Do you think farming's a joke?

1049
01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:53.584
<i>Do you know how hard it is?</i>

1050
01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:57.269
Do you know what the adequate
distance between rice plants is?

1051
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.839
<i>When do you spray sterilizers,</i>

1052
01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:01.508
<i>pesticides, and nutrients for peppers?</i>

1053
01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.302
Why don't you...

1054
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.778
just go to the U.S. with me?

1055
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.557
<i>Let's find Sun-young,</i>

1056
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:11.950
and that scumbag who abandoned
you and left for the U.S.

1057
01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:15.439
You should find him and get alimony.

1058
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.316
<i>What do you say?</i>

1059
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.583
Do you think we can get a visa?

1060
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:23.447
I have bad credit, and you're an ex-convict.

1061
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:25.589
You're smart.

1062
01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:33.165
How are you? How's working on a fishing vessel?

1063
01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:34.890
Where are you?

1064
01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.142
Me?

1065
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.091
I'm, well, somewhere in the Pacific.

1066
01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.734
Goodness, look at the dolphins jumping.

1067
01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.475
Can you hear the dolphins?

1068
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:52.726
Yes.

1069
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.396
You're far away, but you have great reception.

1070
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.414
It's because my heart is always with you.

1071
01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:05.489
Anyway, I'm glad you got your act together.

1072
01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.006
Do you know why I did that?

1073
01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.284
<i>Just hang in there.</i>

1074
01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.786
<i>I'll earn a lot of money...</i>

1075
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.846
and pay off all your debt.

1076
01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.792
But until then,

1077
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.962
please remain the Lee Mi-joo I've always known.

1078
01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:23.590
<i>The Mi-joo who never loses to anybody,</i>

1079
01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:27.067
whether it be to a boy,
your dad, or your sisters.

1080
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.306
Thanks, Sam-sik.

1081
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.766
<i>Take care.</i>

1082
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.518
Okay.

1083
01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.769
I'll call you again.

1084
01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:37.578
Bye.

1085

1086
01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:44.278
Let me know if you need anything.

1087
01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.988
- Hurry.
- I need beer.

1088
01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.255
Sure, coming.

1089
01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.159
Two large beers.

1090
01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:53.302
- A pack of cigarettes.
- Cigarettes.

1091
01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.847
Blow.

1092
01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.876
How gross.

1093
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.601
Mom.

1094
01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.592
Mom.

1095
01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.233
Mom.

1096
01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:13.223
I'm going to feed the pigs.

1097
01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:16.366
Have some snacks and watch TV, okay?

1098
01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.021
And if anything happens...

1099
01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.996
"Remember to call, okay?"

1100
01:03:21.173 --> 01:03:22.149
Yes.

1101
01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.291
I'll be quick.

1102
01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:44.686
She didn't say I couldn't go out.

1103
01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.981
Right?

1104
01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.476
What do you mean, "plagiarized"?

1105
01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.064
Similar lyrics isn't plagiarism.

1106
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.190
Hey, look.

1107
01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.692
What Na Hoon-a's mother
loved was ripe persimmon,

1108
01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:08.904
but what my mother loved was firm persimmon.

1109
01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.656
Listen to this.

1110
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.283
♫ <i>Gingers grow</i> ♫

1111
01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:16.662
Na Hoon-a sang about thinking,
but I'm singing about ginger.

1112
01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.373
♫ <i>when firm persimmons grow</i> ♫

1113
01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.098
Hello?

1114
01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:23.141
Darn it!

1115
01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.193
What is that?

1116
01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.114
Hey.

1117
01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:39.157
Who are you?

1118
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.311
Hello. I'm Choi Kang-ho.

1119
01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:43.814
What's Choi Kang-ho doing here?

1120
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.983
Right, well...

1121
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:48.402
I'm looking for Ye-jin's bouncy ball.

1122
01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:49.570
Have you seen it?

1123
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.128
It's pink...

1124
01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.715
and it's this big.

1125
01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:57.050
This is so ridiculous.

1126
01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:59.928
This is intrusion upon habitation.

1127
01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.124
Leave before I report you!

1128
01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.835
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

1129
01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.713
"A person who intrudes upon
one's residence, guarded building,"

1130
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.216
"structure, ship, or occupied
room, shall be punished..."

1131
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.901
"for up to three years or
by a fine under $5000."

1132
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.822
But what's an intrusion upon habitation?

1133
01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.104
You're just a village idiot, aren't you?

1134
01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:25.912
Get out of here!

1135
01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:34.713
Goodbye, then!

1136
01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.454
But you know,

1137
01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.512
I'm not an idiot.

1138
01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.958
I just returned to my childhood.

1139
01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:47.419
This is a chance given from above.

1140
01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.212
I'll also give you a chance.

1141
01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:51.772
You get three seconds...

1142
01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.508
to get lost!

1143
01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:55.317
One.

1144
01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:57.361
Two.

1145
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.474
Wait, darn it.

1146
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:03.492
Three! I challenge you to a duel!

1147
01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.872
Where did he...?

1148
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.291
Did he fall?

1149
01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.158
Hi, Kang-ho.

1150
01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:20.342
Are you looking for something?

1151
01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.864
Kang-ho!

1152
01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:52.586
Kang-ho!

1153
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.603
Kang-ho!

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.360
I'm dead.

1157
01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.581
Found it.

1158
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.376
I found it!

1159
01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.074
Ye-jin, Seo-jin! I found it!

1160
01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:47.841
I found it!

1161
01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:01.021
One, two, three.

1162
01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.481
I found it.

1163
01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:07.777
I can do it. I can take it down.

1164
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.790
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!
