Darn it.

13
00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.509
- Hurry up and find it.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.187
Be quiet.

15
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.740
Lion.

16
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.204
Hide in there!

17

Lion.

18
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.757
I'm here!

19
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.262
Oh, no!

20
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.875
Lion...

21
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.684
Lion!

22
00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.395
What have you...?

23
00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.845
How did you open that?

24
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.389
That's my mom's favorite...

25
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:47.992
Stop pooping, or we'll both get kicked out!

26
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:49.687
Come here.

27
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.537
Come here, Choi Lion.

28
00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.065
Come here.

29
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.441
All right.

30
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.652
My mom is going to get angry.

31
00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.695
Wait.

32
00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.045
Sit, Lion.

33
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.825
What's all this?

34
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.552
What did you eat so much, you idiot?

35
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.306
All right.

36
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.334
{\an8}Should we go out now?

37
00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.272
{\an8}- What if his mother comes too?
- Stay still.

38
00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:16.623
{\an8}What did you have for dinner?

39
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.564
{\an8}Skate.

40
00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.567
Wait there. Gosh.

41
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.076
Don't come out.

42
00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.462
I can't believe this.

43
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.831
Lion isn't that tall.

44
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.515
That was close.

45
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.270
I should put this...

46
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.190
in the closet.

47
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.612
I'm sure it was...

48
00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.372
That can't be.

49
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.525
Come out.

50
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.043
I know you're in there.

51
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.011
I knew it.

52
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.040
It was Lion.

53
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.583
You're dead meat.

54
00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.351
My mom is going to kill you.

55
00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.854
This...

56
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.653
All right.

57
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.533
Done.

61
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.002
{\an8}Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

62
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.769
You're going to get kicked out.

63
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.234
Mom.

64
00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.278
Mom?

65
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.613
No!

66
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.368
No.

67
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.382
Who are you?

68
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.737
- Are you okay, sir?
- No, I'm not!

69
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.227
Get him!

70
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:19.995
Get him!

71
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.923
- Get the car!
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.078
Step on it!

73
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.917
Pass that car!

74
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.250
No, don't follow him. Go straight.

75
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.850
Go straight!

76
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.492
Turn now!

77
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.403
It's me, sir.

78
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.947
There were people hiding inside.

79
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.755
I'm sorry...

80
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.786

Mom...

83
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.657
- What's all this mess?
- It's...

84
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:41.788
Some scary men suddenly
barged in and made a mess.

85
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.208
At this hour? Who came from where?

86
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.475
I don't know either.

87
00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.421
They were inside the closet.

88
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:52.633
And another guy came in from that door.

89
00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.358
I saw it.

90
00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.473
- So you're saying some scary men...
- Yes.

91
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.350
- ...came out of the closet...
- Yes.

92
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.519
...and they made a mess...

93
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.229
and pooped in here, right?

94
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.813
Yes. It's the truth.

95
00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:07.773
He...

96
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.024
He even had a knife.

97
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:11.944
This guy had a knife, and
these guys suddenly came out.

98
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.197
He was going to stab me,
but these guys lunged at him.

99
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.532
Then he lunged back at them.

100
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.076
They crashed and everything.

101
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.744
They fought in this small room?

102
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.469
Yes.

103
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.249
Clean up right now.

104
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.042
Or I'll kick you and Lion out.

105
00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.752
It's the truth, Mom!

106
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.894
Clean it up!

107
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.564
So what happened?

108
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.858
He disappeared at the hospital.

109
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.654
I wasn't asking about him.

110
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.975
We're still looking for it.

111
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:48.063
But it's such a small village,
and it's hard to avoid the neighbors.

112
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.789
It's difficult to be inconspicuous.

113
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.534
I'll find it at all costs!

114
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.301
That's right.

115
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.012
That's the right answer.

116
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:12.129
I told you...

117
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.631
Oh Tae-soo would betray me.

118
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:17.134
He'll get more desperate as the election nears.

119
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.736
He'll get rid of everyone who gets in his way!

120
00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:23.697
Who do you think will be next after Kang-ho?

121
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.284
Make sure Kang-ho is safe...

122
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.938
until we find the original copy.

123
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.440
Understand?

124
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.998

and severance.

the compensation I gave to the customers,

to close the business last night.

- $100,000?
- Why?

141

You don't have the money?

142
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.957
I'm an idiot! I didn't think that far.

143
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.251
What do we do then?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.202
Do you know me?

185
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:15.622
It's me, Son Yong-rak!

186
00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:19.599
We went to the same elementary school.

187
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:23.880
Let's see. You were in 2nd
grade when you moved to Seoul.

188
00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:26.648
- You were probably 9.
- Right.

189
00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:30.887
You were always good at singing.

190
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.848
No wonder you became a composer.

191
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.324
Shouldn't he have become a
singer if he was good at singing?

192
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.619
Perhaps his looks got in the way.

193
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.402
You can rest if you're done with that.

194
00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.544
I'm not done yet.

195
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.964
I'll eat the peel too.

196
00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.217
Okay.

197
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.379
If you're going to live in this village,

198
00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.798
it's best not to listen to what she says.

199
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.134
Come on. I lived in Seoul a long time.

200
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:12.110
I've been downright ignoring her.

201
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.518
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.

202
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.770
Are you here for good?

203
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.413
Well, you see...

204
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.694
Yong-rak.

205
00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.878
Yong-rak.

206
00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:33.992
<i>The foot-and-mouth disease has spread
throughout North and South Jeolla Province,</i>

207
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.869
<i>as well as South Chungcheong Province.</i>

208
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.763
<i>The Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs has decided...</i>

209
00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:41.958
<i>to cull 3000 pigs at the farm
where the disease was detected,</i>

210
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:47.812
<i>and take preventive measures at
eight farms within a 2-mile radius...</i>

211
00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.134
Why are they tormenting the pigs?

212
00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:55.320
They're not tormenting them.
It's because they're sick.

213
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:58.224
One sick pig could transmit
disease to the entire farm,

214
00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:00.769
and it could spread to other nearby farms.

215
00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.729
So they must kill them.

216
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.412
Kill them?

217
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:06.900
Then will our pigs be killed too?

218
00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.276
No.

219
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.862
Our pigs have been vaccinated,

220
00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.572
and there are no farms nearby.

221
00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.714
So you don't need to worry.

222
00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.534
But...

223
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:18.870
you need to keep Lion on the farm.

224
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.038
Okay?

225
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.540
It can't catch a disease.

226
00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.099
Okay.

227
00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:28.254
The market is opening today,
so I'll be going into town.

228
00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:29.923
I'll see you later then.

229
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.258
What's gotten into you?

230
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:34.678
You always begged me to take you with me.

231
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.444
Well...

232
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.848
The place will be crowded with people.

233
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:41.935
It won't be easy to get around in
my wheelchair, so I'll stay home.

234
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.452
I'll eat and exercise.

235
00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:48.832
I know you just want to
play with Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

236
00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:53.753
Promise me you won't get
into trouble like last time.

237
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.423
Okay. I won't.

238
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.383
I promise.

239
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.094
Promise.

240
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:04.180
Here.

241
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:08.545
Pick up herbicide for the garlic field.

242
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.229
Okay. Do you need anything else?

243
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:17.694
Use this to start your shop.

244
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.226
I saved up to give this to
you on your wedding day.

245
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.311
Make sure you look for a good place.

246
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:27.355
Mom...

247
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:31.026
This is the last time I'll be
helping you out. Got that?

248
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.902
- Gosh.
- Mom.

249
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.404
Thank you so much.

250
00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:39.674
I'll work really hard and pay
you back handsomely. Okay?

251
00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:43.595
Get it together, okay?

252
00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.749
- Go.
- Okay.

253
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.375
I'll see you later.

254
00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:50.393
Ye-jin. Seo-jin.

255
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.297
Hi, Juni.

256
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.467
Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon.

257
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:58.526
<i>Okay. It's scheduled to arrive soon.</i>

258
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.834
Gosh.

259
00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.508
Mi-joo!

260
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.886
Oh, no.

261
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.278
Taxi.

262
00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:44.280
Taxi!

263
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.558
Taxi!

264
00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:47.310
Hello.

265
00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:50.313
I wanted to ask you something.

266
00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:55.375
About that old lady who's protesting
in front of the Prosecutors' Office...

267
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.752
Jung Jong-gu's mother.

268
00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.574
What are the contents?

269
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.535
It's red chili powder, sesame seeds,

270
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:06.761
a few potatoes, sesame oil, and perilla oil.

271
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.722
Please deliver them safely.

272
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.406
<i><font color="#ffff00">Bando Real Estate</font></i>

273
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.946
- Hello.
- Come on in.

274
00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.769
Please give me this pair in 10.5.

275
00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:32.203
All right, one minute.

276
00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.200
You have a keen eye.

277
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:46.286
Those shoes were newly released.

278
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.679
They're comfortable and don't smell.

279
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.709
There's this air cushion back here,

280
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.420
so they're great for jogging or working out.

281
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:58.506
They lessen the stress on your
knees, calves, and cartilage.

282
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.049
I'm wearing them right now.

283
00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:02.177
Do you want to see a pair in 10.5?

284
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.053
No, it's okay.

285
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:05.305
Then just this one.

286
00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:07.071
Yes, please.

287
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:11.409
- How much is it?
- It's $15, but just give me $10.

288
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.705
- Thank you. Come again.
- Thank you.

289
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.792
But later...

290
00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.378
Someday...

291
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.841
I'll come back for those shoes.

292
00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.786
Just wait and see.

293
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.511
All right.

294
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:34.000
Baek Hoon-ah, the Nightingale of Jou-ri?

295
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.168
That's right.

296
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.463
Goodness. It's been ages.

297
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.063
Gum-ja.

298
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.883
So you still live here.

299
00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.888
I was wondering who it was
that moved here from Seoul.

300
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.681
I'm so glad to see you.

301
00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:51.699
Are you here for good?

302
00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:58.149
Goodness.

303
00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.109
What's wrong?

304
00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:03.294
Goodness.

305
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:04.948
Goodness.

306
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.659
The rent is pretty high
despite its being a rural area.

307
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.786
This is the only town around here.

308
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.079
The land value has soared...

309
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.249
because a semiconductor
company will be moving here.

310
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.224
I see.

311
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.212
Anyway, thank you. I'll call you later.

312
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.896
- Okay.
- Thank you.

<i><font color="#ffff00">Bando Real Estate</font></i>

314
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.187
Are these supplements the best ones?

315
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:38.079
Of course.

316
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.525
- I'd like eight boxes.
- Okay.

317
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.027
And do you have any medicine...

318
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.405
for indigestion or stomach cramps?

319
00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.949
Do you want three days' worth?

320
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.133
A bit more than that please.

321
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.745
I'd like three months' worth.

322
00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:55.054
Yes, ma'am.

I see. It's Ms. Jung from Jou-ri.

347

Herbicide for your garlic field?

348

All right. Bye.

349
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.423
- Okay.
- Right.

350
00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:11.759
I'll get it from the storage.

351

You're still in pain.

355
00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:27.441
You should see a doctor.

356
00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:29.417
Does your finger hurt?

357
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.904
Well...

358
00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:35.700
I think it's irritation
from pesticides or grass.

359

Let me take a look. Hold on.

360
00:24:38.518 --> 00:24:40.136
What?

361
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.889
Let me see.

362
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:50.438
One minute.

363
00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:15.239
You have an ingrown nail.

364
00:25:15.263 --> 00:25:18.910
Don't cut your nails too close or round.

365
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:22.705
But cut it so it's a square shape.

366
00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:25.082
Old people don't know about that.

367
00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:28.127
We aren't particular about cutting our nails.

368
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:31.631
If it's too hard to do it,
you can go to a nail salon.

369
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.717
Isn't that where you get your nails colored?

370
00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:36.385
They do that,

371
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:39.695
but they also help fix problematic nails.

372
00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.475
He's back with the herbicide.

373
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:44.185
Ma'am, how's your finger now?

374
00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:48.356
Goodness, it feels much better.

375
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.859
Nail salon, was it?

376
00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:54.654
Is there a nail salon in town?

377
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:58.241
There was one, but it
closed down a few months ago.

378
00:25:58.265 --> 00:25:59.242
Goodness.

379
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:02.218
Living in a rural area is so inconvenient.

380
00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:05.748
By the way, why don't you open up a nail salon?

381
00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:06.916
You'd be so good at it.

382
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.168
I've been looking into it,

383
00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:11.837
but the rent is too high.

384
00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:14.814
I can't find a decent shop-in-shop either.

385
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.218
What's a "shop-in-shop"?

386
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:20.429
It's opening up another
small shop inside a shop.

387
00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:23.322
That's why it's called a "shop-in-shop."

388
00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:25.935
Then open one here.

389
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:28.479
Lots of people frequent
this place all year 'round.

390
00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:31.482
Most of us need hand care,

391
00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:35.111
and often wait around like this for the bus.

392
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.862
- That'd be great.
- Come on.

393
00:26:36.886 --> 00:26:40.408
Who'd open up a nail shop in a place like this?

394
00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:41.909
Gosh.

395
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.662
My wife would be glad to hear that news, though.

396
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:47.972
She's been sulking about
the nail salon closing down.

397
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:50.334
Can I really do that?

398
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.378
How much would the rent be?

399
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:54.463
What rent?

400
00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:57.717
That corner has always been empty.

401
00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:59.176
She's right.

402
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.347
We'll convince everyone to buy seeds,
fertilizer, and everything else here.

403
00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:04.932
- So let her have it.
- Seriously?

404
00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.642
I have a truck driver's license too.

405
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:09.353
I can fetch products from
the storage when you're busy,

406
00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:10.771
and deliver them too.

407
00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.830
- Seriously?
- Yes.

408
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.359
In that case...

409
00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.293
Then...

410
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.238
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

411
00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:20.656
- A big welcome.
- Thank you.

412
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.074
- Gladly.
- Thank you.

413
00:27:22.098 --> 00:27:24.592
- Thank you.
- Good for you.

414
00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:53.537
Let's see.

415
00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.668
That's Mi-joo's!

416
00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:12.723
- That little...!
- Darn it.

417
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.017
Move!

418
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.385
Out!

419
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.610
Hit a home run or strikeout.

420
00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:30.601
Hit a home run...

421
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.769
Or strikeout.

422
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.536
...or strikeout.

423
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.543
Catch that thief!

424
00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.279
You thief!

425
00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:43.447
You punk.

426
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:46.450
- How dare you steal this?
- No, I didn't steal it.

427
00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:47.910
This is from our shop.

428
00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:50.121
- I didn't steal it.
- How dare you?

429
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:52.206
- Then why do you have our item?
- Sorry?

430
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.749
I saw it. Why do you have it?

431
00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:56.419
I just tried it on.

432
00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:58.087
- Don't lie.
- It's the truth.

433
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.005
- How dare you?
- Wait...

434
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:01.340
What's going on?

435
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.524
What's the matter?

436
00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:04.635
It's Mi-joo!

437
00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:07.680
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I do.

438
00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:09.056
No, I...

439
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.307
No.

440
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:12.393
Anyway, he's unwell.

441
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:14.353
Please let go of him.

442
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:16.772
I'm telling you, he stole this.

443
00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:18.691
- What?
- He stole our apple too.

444
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:19.608
Goodness.

445
00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:21.944
We'll have to throw all
this away. What'll you do?

446
00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:23.988
I...

447
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:25.754
The thing is...

448
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:30.342
Someone stole this, so...

449
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.220
Why do you have that?

450
00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:34.874
"Hi, Juni."

451
00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:38.794
"Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon."

452
00:29:38.818 --> 00:29:42.229
You dropped it while you said that.

453
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.844
I'm so sorry.

454
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:50.306
I'll compensate you for everything. I'm sorry.

455
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.698
What do I do?

456
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.700
- I'm sorry.
- Kang-ho.

457
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.695
Goodness.

458
00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:06.947
How did you come all the way here?

459
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.256
You don't even know the way.

460
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:12.328
You can't buy anything if
you don't have your wallet.

461
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:15.456
But still, there are many cars,
so it could've been dangerous.

462
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.085
If you pick up anything,
give it to Mr. Son or me, okay?

463
00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:21.378
Okay.

464
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:25.549
And no matter what, you shouldn't
touch someone else's stuff.

465
00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:27.259
Why did you take the bag?

466
00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:29.902
The owner must've been startled.

467
00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:34.448
Bar Exam Meals.

468
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:35.851
What?

469
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.895
What did you say?

470
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.897
- Put him behind bars?
- What?

471
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.690
- No.
- You...

472
00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:43.236
- You need to be scolded!
- No, I...

473
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.403
How dare you say that about an elder?

474
00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:47.863
- Mi-joo.
- Gosh!

475
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:48.906
How dare you?

476
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.909
- You impudent brat!
- That hurts! Mi-joo!

477
00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:55.469
- Bye, Mi-joo.
- Thank you for the ride.

478
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.207
Mi-joo, wait.

479
00:30:58.231 --> 00:30:59.765
Yes?

480
00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:09.858
These are supplements. Give them to your mom.

481
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:13.138
And tell her I'm sorry that
Kang-ho ruined her field.

482
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:15.516
I'm the one who should be sorry.

483
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.325
Ye-jin just lost her grip on the pig.

484
00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.706
You must've been surprised.

485
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:25.651
I was.

486
00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:28.362
We could've lost the pig.

487
00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:30.087
No.

488
00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:32.506
I mean Kang-ho.

489
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.383
Sorry?

490
00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:41.250
I couldn't talk to you with him in the truck.

491
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:43.726
But you looked quite upset.

492
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.312
That's not why.

493
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:49.925
Mi-joo.

494
00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:53.053
I treated you harshly back then,

495
00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:56.473
blaming you for Kang-ho not taking his CSAT.

496
00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:59.184
I even refused to tell you
his contact information.

497
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:01.577
I'm really sorry about that.

498
00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:06.540
I think I'm being punished right now...

499
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.918
because of what I did to you back then.

500
00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:12.489
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

501
00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:14.992
Ms. Jin, don't be like this.

502
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.426
Don't apologize.

503
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.470
I'm happy...

504
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:22.541
that I got to see him again.

505
00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:24.308
But...

506
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:34.985
You know very well how strong he is.

507
00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:36.805
Just wait.

508
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:38.849
He won't give up that easily.

509
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.033
He'll walk again.

510
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.619
Thanks.

511
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:46.121
Thanks, Mi-joo.

512
00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.496
Hoon-ah.

513
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.055
Are you really...

514
00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:05.334
Hoon-ah?

515
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:08.754
Won-hyung, you bed-wetter. You've grown so much.

516
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.131
- Gosh.
- Hoon-ah.

517
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.300
Sing me a song.

518
00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:16.178
- What song?
- The song you used to sing back then...

519
00:33:16.202 --> 00:33:18.028
about a magpie.

520
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.572
Should I?

521
00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:22.810
♫ <i>Who</i> ♫

522
00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:25.229
♫ <i>does the magpie</i> ♫

523
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:29.733
♫ <i>play with?</i> ♫

524
00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:33.946
♫ <i>They play among themselves</i> ♫

525
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:38.298
♫ <i>in the field</i> ♫

526
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:42.371
♫ <i>Who does Won-hyung the bed-wetter</i> ♫

527
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:46.291
♫ <i>play with?</i> ♫

528
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:50.462
♫ <i>Won-hyung the bed-wetter</i> ♫

529
00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:54.481
♫ <i>plays with Hoon-ah</i> ♫

530
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.888
Let's get rid of the pig farm.

531
00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:00.848
But...

532
00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.475
- Come on. That's absurd.
- What's he saying?

533
00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:06.478
I love you with all my heart,

534
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:08.689
but I'm against that!

535
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:11.025
- Me too.
- Now, now.

536
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.125
Hear me out.

537
00:34:13.342 --> 00:34:16.378
If you help me out,

538
00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.365
I promise...

539
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.077
to replace the pig farm with
the biggest trot concert hall...

540
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:24.121
in this country.

541
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.914
- I will.
- A concert hall?

542
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:27.852
- A trot concert hall?
- A trot concert hall?

543
00:34:27.876 --> 00:34:30.586
Look. Korea's in the grip of trot music fever.

544
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.590
I'll bring Young-woong, Young-tak, and Dong-won,

545
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.051
and hold a concert every week.

546
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.135
Think about it.

547
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.763
People will swarm into this village.

548
00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:41.930
Then...

549
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:43.724
Gosh, it'll be so noisy and chaotic.

550
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:46.018
Goodness. It'll be so hectic.

551
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:46.935
Right.

552
00:34:46.959 --> 00:34:51.148
If the biggest trot concert hall is built here,

553
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:54.500
we'll need security.

554
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.779
Who should be in charge?

555
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.989
- Me?
- No.

556
00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:00.407
Sam-sik.

557
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.576
- Sam-sik?
- Not him.

558
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.829
Hold on. What will Sam-sik do again?

559
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.998
No one...

560
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:12.252
is more well-versed in security than him.

561
00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.253
That's true.

562
00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:16.507
When it comes to security,

563
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:19.551
- he's like an FBI agent.
- That's true.

564
00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:21.887
Was it when he was in 5th grade?

565
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:23.806
He went to a police station...

566
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.767
- and stole a pair of handcuffs.
- Right.

567
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.478
Must we ignore such a hidden gem?

568
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:31.605
It'll be a waste of talent.

569
00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.940
Goodness.

570
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.225
- I wouldn't say he's a hidden gem.
- On top of that,

571
00:35:35.249 --> 00:35:37.528
the singers will need someone...

572
00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:40.072
to do their hair and makeup.

573
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:41.615
And as it happens,

574
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:46.176
we have a professional in this village.

575
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.595
- Who?
- Who?

576
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.290
Mi-joo?

577
00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:53.293
What will all those people want
to do here? They'll want to eat.

578
00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.796
We'll serve various cuisines.

579
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.923
What will they do during their waiting time?

580
00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:59.133
Coffee, right?

581
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.244
I'm talking about a café.

582
00:36:00.268 --> 00:36:01.385
- A café?
- A café?

583
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.262
Someone will manage the parking space,

584
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.098
clean, and run a bed and breakfast.

585
00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:09.935
- I have the biggest home around here.
- Right.

586
00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:11.103
That's right!

587
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:12.604
And each room has a bathroom.

588
00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:14.648
- Not every room.
- You still...

589
00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.817
don't get the big picture?

590
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.778
Mr. Son Yong-rak,

591
00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:21.029
the town head?

592
00:36:21.053 --> 00:36:22.447
- Gosh.
- He's a village head.

593
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:24.074
I'm a village head.

594
00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.868
People will gather here,

595
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:28.370
and the village will grow.

596
00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:29.830
There'll be more residents.

597
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:34.376
Then the village will become a town in no time.

598
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.629
Better yet, should I call
you a governor instead?

599
00:36:37.653 --> 00:36:41.091
I'd like to introduce you to our governor,

600
00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:42.509
Mr. Son Yong-rak!

601
00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:44.803
- A governor?
- He's a governor!

602
00:36:44.827 --> 00:36:46.523
- That's great!
- You just got promoted!

603
00:36:46.547 --> 00:36:47.848
A round of applause!

604
00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.809
Hi, Juni. Show me the direction to my home.

605
00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:52.144
<i>Starting navigation.</i>

606
00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:55.314
- It works. Look, Mom.
- Right.

607
00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:59.708
If you ever lose your
way home, you can use that.

608
00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:01.793
No.

609
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.824
You shouldn't be in a situation where
you lose your way home to begin with.

610
00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:07.534
Got it?

611
00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.134
Okay.

612
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.638
Mr. Son.

613
00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:15.223
Mr. Son?

614
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:19.019
Mr. Son?

615
00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:21.882
Mr. Son.

616
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.440
Mr. Son.

617
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:31.949
That's strange. Where is everyone?

618
00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:34.910
Hi, Juni. Where is everyone?

619
00:37:35.002 --> 00:37:37.663
<i>I can't think of an answer.</i>

620
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.836
Hey, Andrea.

621
00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:49.257
Really? Okay, I'll be there soon.

622
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.928
Kang-ho, one of our pigs is about to give birth.

623
00:37:54.814 --> 00:38:00.045
Give this one to Mr. Kim who runs the goat farm.

624
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:02.714
This is for the persimmon tree
house, this is for Ms. Choi.

625
00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:05.217
And these two are for Ms. Park.

626
00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:07.067
- Ms. Park.
- Yes.

627
00:38:07.494 --> 00:38:08.470
Also,

628
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:12.823
I won't be home until tomorrow morning
because I have to be there for the birth.

629
00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.394
So make sure you feed Lion.

630
00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:19.273
There's rice in the rice cooker
and side dishes in the fridge for you.

631
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.358
Exercise for an hour...

632
00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:23.026
before going to bed.

633
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.987
Can you do that?

634
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:26.545
Yes.

635
00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:29.157
But come home as soon as possible,

636
00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:33.135
because those scary men might come back.

637
00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:37.624
Let's not call those scary men ever again.

638
00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.808
Okay? Bye.

639
00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:44.438
I didn't call them.

640
00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:53.056
Hi, Juni. Find the goat farm for me.

641
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.199
<i>I found 70 goat farms.</i>

642
00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.103
What?

643
00:38:58.127 --> 00:39:01.756
<i><font color="#ffff00">Jou-ri Café</font></i>

644
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.333
There they were.

645
00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:10.630
I wrote up a petition.

646
00:39:11.974 --> 00:39:14.202
Let's gather in front of
the pig farm tomorrow...

647
00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:16.413
and shout, "We're against it!"

648
00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:18.665
We should protest.

649
00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:23.170
The pig farm was kind of an
inconvenience. We can't deny that.

650
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.047
Right.

651
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:28.315
Especially in the summer,
more bugs gather there,

652
00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:29.843
and the smell worsens.

653
00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.847
But most of all, I'm worried about Young-soon.

654
00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:35.390
I mean, she's unwell.

655
00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:39.353
I don't think she should be running the farm.

656
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:42.537
Darn it.

657
00:39:43.422 --> 00:39:45.582

But your piglets will

666
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:29.251
So hang in there just a little longer, okay?

667
00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:32.838
I'll do the same.

00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:35.590

Okay. I got it.

- ...and clink our glasses.
- What?

679
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.223
- All right.
- Choi Kang-ho?

680
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:41.308
Cheers to...

681
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.680
Assistant Chief Prosecutor Lee!

00:41:42.704 --> 00:41:44.227
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

683
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:47.481
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

684
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:50.373
Hey. It's you, isn't it?

685
00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:52.876
Hello.

686
00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:57.282
Gosh, you really became a prosecutor.

687
00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:59.993
It's me, Sam-sik. Your childhood friend.

688
00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.927
We're childhood friends.

689
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.373
Gosh, you look really good.

690
00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:08.126
Goodness, you're even wearing cologne.

691
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.380
Remember how kids used to make fun of
you because you reeked like your pig farm?

692
00:42:12.404 --> 00:42:15.300
Gosh, they'd bawl if they
had to sit next to you.

693
00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:17.093
Those jerks.

694
00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:18.678
Let's talk outside.

695
00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:20.305
- Please excuse us.
- What?

696
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:21.848
- Let's talk outside.
- You punk.

697
00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.434
You hated pigs, but you're having pork rinds?

698
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:25.894
Hey.

699
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:28.703
My friend is a prosecutor now.

700
00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:33.068
By the way, did you get plastic surgery?

701
00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:35.445
You look even better than you used to.

702
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:37.531
I'm considering it too.

703
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.715
So how have you been?

704
00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.930
What's this for?

705
00:42:50.693 --> 00:42:52.504
Wait. What is this?

706
00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:54.813
Isn't this why you approached me?

707
00:42:55.864 --> 00:42:57.732
You little...!

708
00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:04.432
Thanks, my friend.

709
00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.768
How much did you give me?

710
00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:08.436
$300?

711
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.021
Hey, thanks!

712
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:11.705
Thanks!

713
00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:18.989
{\an8}Kang-ho.

714
00:43:19.013 --> 00:43:22.284
{\an8}All I did was do as I was told,

715
00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:24.619
and sell what I got as my payment.

716
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:28.790
I had no idea they were stolen
from an assemblyman's home.

717
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:32.836
So could you talk to the prosecutor in charge?

718
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.062
You have that power, don't you?

719
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:40.677
Kang-ho.

720
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:44.362
It's me, Sam-sik. Your friend.

721
00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:49.659
- Sam-sik.
- Yes?

722
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.495
We're no longer friends.

723
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.697
All right.

724
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:02.616
I was wrong.

725
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.492
I sincerely apologize...

726
00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:06.911
for all the things...

727
00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:09.789
I did and said to you back then.

728
00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:11.791
So please help me out this once.

729
00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:14.252
If you do, I promise to start fresh.

730
00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:15.211
Please?

731
00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:18.048
It's over for me if I go to jail again.

732
00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:22.067
Please help me this once
for my poor mother's sake.

733
00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:27.390
No, wait. Please help me, sir.

734
00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:29.934
Please help me.

735
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.576
Sam-sik.

736
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.120
I can't help you.

737
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:38.777
Kang-ho.

738
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:41.461
Please help me.

739
00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.880
Please...

740
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.308
Can you please be quiet and leave?

741
00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:09.030
Look who it is.

742
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:11.783
It's Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho.

743
00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:16.162
Oh, dear. You must've hurt your legs.

744
00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:17.872
Who are you?

745
00:45:18.173 --> 00:45:19.958
Who am I?

746
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:23.488
Unbelievable.

747
00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:27.799
Fine, I get it. You don't
want to associate with me.

748
00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:29.994
But too bad,

749
00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:32.095
because I know you very well.

750
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:35.708
No matter how hard I tried to forget you,

751
00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:38.393
I just couldn't.

752
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.629
So tell me.

753
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:43.133
How did it feel to keep
me behind bars for months,

754
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:44.941
my friend?

755
00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:47.193
"Friend"?

756
00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:49.279
Are we friends?

757
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:53.184
Sorry. Gosh, my bad.

758
00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.769
How dare a petty thief...

759
00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:57.871
try to befriend a great prosecutor?

760
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:05.670
Be quiet.

761
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:09.257
What? "Be quiet"?

762
00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:13.261
I see.

763
00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:15.832
Shut up, you jerk.

764
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:19.127
"I didn't know they were stolen goods.
All I did was do as I was told."

765
00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:21.296
"So please help me this once."

766
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.381
I begged on my knees, but you said,

767
00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:25.899
"We're no longer friends."

768
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:28.443
"Can you please be quiet and leave?"

769
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:30.763
You haven't changed.

770
00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:33.531
You haven't changed one bit.

771
00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:38.536
How dare you have the audacity
to face me, you douchebag?

772
00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:40.106
"Douchebag"?

773
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.107
Yes, you douchebag.

774
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:44.292
- "Douchebag"?!
- Yes, you douchebag!

775
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:46.029
You!

776
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:47.739
You just cursed.

777
00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:50.506
I'm going to tell my mom.

778
00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:53.495
Right. She's tending to the pigs.

779
00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:56.122
Right. You!

780
00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:57.999
I'm going to tell Ye-jin's dad.

781
00:46:58.023 --> 00:47:00.168
You have no idea how scary he is.

782
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:02.977
He's a horrifying jerk!

783
00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:07.565
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

784
00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:12.028
Ye-jin!

785
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:14.891
Seo-jin!

786
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.100
Hi, Kang-ho.

787
00:47:16.124 --> 00:47:17.602
I mean, Kang-ho, sir.

788
00:47:17.626 --> 00:47:19.270
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

789
00:47:19.294 --> 00:47:21.689
I need your dad's help.

790
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:24.108
You don't need him as much as we do.

791
00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.735
But what for?

792
00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:30.281
A stranger called me a douchebag.

793
00:47:30.305 --> 00:47:33.535
What? How dare they say that to our friend?

794
00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:34.494
What are you doing?

795
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.329
I told you to wash your hands and...

796
00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.123
Someone cursed at Kang-ho.

797
00:47:39.147 --> 00:47:41.042
I won't let this slide.

798
00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:42.418
All right, let's go!

799
00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:45.395
You're not going anywhere. Come here.

800
00:47:45.445 --> 00:47:48.800
It's almost dinnertime, so go home.
Your mom will be worried.

801
00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:51.010
She's not home.

802
00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.012
One of our pigs is giving birth,

803
00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:55.431
so she won't be coming home tonight.

804
00:47:55.455 --> 00:47:56.975
What? Then what about dinner?

805
00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:59.284
I can have rice...

806
00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:02.438
with the side dishes in the fridge.

807
00:48:02.462 --> 00:48:05.984
Why don't you just eat with us?

808
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:08.027
We already have the table set.

809
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.070
Ye-jin.

810
00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:10.238
No, Mom.

811
00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:12.073
- Seo-jin, what are you doing?
- No.

812
00:48:12.097 --> 00:48:13.866
- But...
- What are you doing?

813
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.217
Let's go.

814
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.664
Goodness, he left them there.

815
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:22.792
<i><font color="#ffff00">Sam-sik's Mill</font></i>

816
00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:24.168
By the way,

817
00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:27.922
I don't know if we should do this to her...

818
00:48:27.946 --> 00:48:30.815
as fellow parents.

819
00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:34.152
As fellow parents,

820
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:37.682
let's do this for our Sam-sik.

821
00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:41.200
He'll become head of security...

822
00:48:41.376 --> 00:48:44.981
at the biggest concert hall in Korea.

823
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:46.316
You're right.

824
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.861
Our son is struggling to
land a job as an ex-convict.

825
00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:52.530
He should be our top priority.

826
00:48:52.554 --> 00:48:55.006
- Exactly.
- Right.

827
00:48:57.142 --> 00:49:00.803
Why is our gate open?

828
00:49:01.188 --> 00:49:02.889
Beats me.

829
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:15.735
Could it be a thief?

830
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:19.197
A thief robbing a fellow thief's home?

831
00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:22.825
In that case...

832
00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:48.017
You darn thief!

833
00:49:48.403 --> 00:49:49.379
You thief!

834
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:51.214
Mom!

835
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.799
It's me, Sam-sik!

836
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.717
- Sam-sik?
- What?

837
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:56.275
Goodness!

838
00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:00.056
It really is you!

839
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.225
It really was a thief.

840
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:03.643
Goodness, Sam-sik.

841
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.661
- Goodness. Oh, no.
- Blood.

842
00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.359
What?

843
00:50:11.383 --> 00:50:12.610
It's true.

844
00:50:12.634 --> 00:50:15.071
How is that possible?

845
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:17.573
I know it's unbelievable, but it's true.

846
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:19.701
Gosh.

847
00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:23.761
I had no idea and gave him an earful today.

848
00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:28.141
Who knew such a smart
kid would end up like that?

849
00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:31.352
I feel bad for Ms. Jin.

850
00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:34.632
He's her one-and-only son.

851
00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:36.676
She dedicated her entire life...

852
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.987
to supporting him by running that pig farm.

853
00:50:41.788 --> 00:50:46.117
How dare you say that
after getting out of prison?

854
00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:50.481
Do you think I didn't work hard to support you?

855
00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.607
You jerk.

856
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:53.776
Where's my release deposit?

857
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.361
How dare you...

858
00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.071
- scam your own mother?
- That hurts!

859
00:50:57.095 --> 00:50:58.781
Dad, help me!

860
00:50:58.805 --> 00:51:01.242
I was just about to help out.

861
00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:02.577
Stop it! It hurts!

862
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:04.829
Where did you spend that money?

863
00:51:04.853 --> 00:51:07.498
- Come here! Where's the money?
- It hurts!

864
00:51:07.522 --> 00:51:08.875
- Get up!
- Gosh.

865
00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.586
- Goodness. Let me see.
- What happened?

866
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.103
- It's nothing.
- Goodness!

867
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:19.358
Rice is a staple for Koreans,

868
00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:22.278
but we're having bread for dinner?

869
00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:26.866
The color reminds me of diarrhea.

870
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.771
It's called "tomato stew."

871
00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:33.149
She learned the recipe to cook it for us.

872
00:51:33.173 --> 00:51:34.942
Just eat it.

873
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:38.211
Where did she learn this ridiculous recipe?

874
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:45.787
Anyway, doesn't it feel like we're family,

875
00:51:45.811 --> 00:51:48.387
since we're eating together?

876
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:51.933
Dad.

877
00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:54.560
Mom.

878
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:57.647
Seo-jin, stop that nonsense and eat.

879
00:51:58.532 --> 00:51:59.759
I'm done.

880
00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.177
You didn't eat the carrots.

881
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:02.470
I don't like carrots.

882
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:04.847
Eat them if you want to be healthy.

883
00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:08.533
I want Kang-ho to be healthy.

884
00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:11.229
Here.

885
00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:14.121
Do you want me to scold you?

886
00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:32.875
Why are you taking them back?

887
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:34.517
You don't eat carrots.

888
00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:37.228
How did you know that?

889
00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:41.941
Were we friends too?

890
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.700
We went to school together.

891
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:56.622
So that's why I kept thinking of you.

892
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:05.700
You're done eating, right? Then you should go.

893
00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:08.259
No, I'm not done yet.

894
00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.274
I'm sorry.

895
00:53:28.163 --> 00:53:29.640
For what?

896
00:53:29.664 --> 00:53:32.199
I couldn't catch any fish.

897
00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:33.686
Fish?

898
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.120
You like fish.

899
00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:38.858
So I wanted to catch one for you.

900
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:42.084
But someone suddenly cursed at me.

901
00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.532
Where is Ye-jin and Seo-jin's dad?

902
00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.174
I want to meet him.

903
00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:52.219
I heard he's a horrifying jerk.

904
00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:03.799
I don't like fish, so you
don't need to catch any for me.

905
00:54:03.823 --> 00:54:06.093
And don't come back here again.

906
00:54:06.117 --> 00:54:08.903
Don't meet my kids again.

907
00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:12.281
I don't want to see you anymore.

908
00:54:12.999 --> 00:54:15.076
Are you done eating?

909
00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:20.247
Was I...

910
00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:23.542
a bad person to you too?

911
00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:30.007
I hope I wasn't.

912
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.553
But I guess I was.

913
00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:44.799
Goodness, I'm so late.

914
00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:47.274
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

915
00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:50.012
Hello.

916
00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:53.531
Hi. What are you doing here?

917
00:54:53.707 --> 00:54:58.104
He ate with us because Ms. Jin was
tending to her pig that was giving birth.

918
00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.690
Right. Who's feeding Lion?

919
00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:03.165
Right. Lion.

920
00:55:03.216 --> 00:55:05.501
I need to feed him.

921
00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:09.115
Thanks, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

922
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:11.632
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

923
00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.260
And...

924
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.929
Mi-joo...

925
00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:41.022
I feel bad for Young-soon.

926
00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:45.082
She lost her husband, and
her son ended up like that.

927
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:52.214
And now she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.

928
00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:56.051
Don't put it that way.

929
00:55:56.561 --> 00:56:00.624
She's not young anymore, so we
want her to have a comfortable life.

930
00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:01.709
It may sound easy,

931
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:06.213
but running a farm singlehandedly
as a woman isn't easy at all.

932
00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:10.176
So you all gathered together,

933
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.985
and schemed to make her close down the farm...

934
00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:15.264
so she'd live a comfortable life?

935
00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:16.557
My goodness.

936
00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:21.854
You guys are really something.

937
00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.621
Goodness.

938
00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:37.843
- Check in there.
- Yes, sir.

939
00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:52.983
All right.

940
00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:57.530
Goodness. She gave birth to 13 piglets.

941
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:02.895
You displayed exceptional work...

942
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:05.246
all night long.

943
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:07.274
Not at all.

944
00:57:07.298 --> 00:57:09.917
She was the one who worked hard.

945
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:17.133
Well done.

946
00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.039
- Good work, Andrea.
- Thank you.

947
00:57:22.063 --> 00:57:23.749
I'll wrap up here.

948
00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:24.875
You can go now.

949
00:57:24.899 --> 00:57:26.460
That's not right.

950
00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:30.506
It's only right for you to go home now.

951
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.801
I have to write up the daily record.

952
00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:36.887
I need to do it, so go home.

953
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:40.266
If that's what you want,

954
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.075
then I have no choice but to comply.

955
00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:45.911
Go on.

956
00:57:57.474 --> 00:58:00.619
<i>Sir, the worker is headed your way.</i>

957
00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.261
Got it.

It's me.

963
00:59:09.462 --> 00:59:12.066
- Who's left?
- His mother probably went home,

964
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.652
and the worker went home too,
so it's probably empty.

965
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.278
Good.

966
00:59:16.302 --> 00:59:17.655
Let's go down there.

967
00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:19.338

"Fight"?

973
00:59:36.781 --> 00:59:39.149
Gosh, he's so annoying.

974
00:59:39.784 --> 00:59:43.195
I wish I could hit him on the head.

975
00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:48.951
Let's fight for it!

976
00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:54.898
- It's a manure facility.
- What about the other storage?

977
00:59:54.922 --> 00:59:57.069
There's a smaller storage up there.

978
00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.029
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

979
00:59:59.053 --> 01:00:00.754
Gosh.

980
01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:05.175
Goodness.

981
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:09.957
Who are you? What are you doing here?

982
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.309
- Well, we...
- We need some manure.

983
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.962
Manure?

984
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.213
So we're...

985
01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:18.591
We're planning to start our own farm,

986
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.734
and heard that pig manure
was better than fertilizers.

987
01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:26.974
But you can't just cover your field with it.

988
01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:31.937
You need to add sawdust and probiotics
to turn it into an organic fertilizer.

989
01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.413
I've used up what I already made.

990
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.459
I'll give you some when I make more.

991
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.879
I understand. Thank you.

992
01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:46.410
It's really nice to hear that
young men like you want to farm.

993
01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:49.413
This village is full of old people.

994
01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:51.415
Where's your field?

995
01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.599
It's over there.

996
01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.812
That's ours.

997
01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:03.469
We bought one behind the field
that's two fields down from that one.

998
01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.986
You bought the field?

999
01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.599
Ms. Park was worried
that the price was too high,

1000
01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.976
since no one wanted it.

1001
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.728
I guess she eventually sold it.

1002
01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.229
Yes.

1003
01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:18.025
Anyway, I'll let you know
once I get more manure.

1004
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:19.318
Where do you live?

1005
01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.044
- We...
- We're about to build one.

1006
01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.255
I see.

1007
01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.384
I hope we see each other often.

1008
01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.287
And I'm sorry,

1009
01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:33.931
but this is a restricted area.

1010
01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.126
Especially with the disease going around.

1011
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.977
We're truly sorry. Goodbye then.

1012
01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:41.715
Have you gone crazy?

1013
01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:45.052
Now we might have to buy a
field, farm, and build a home.

1014
01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:47.429
I was flustered by her unexpected questions.

1015
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.321
Darn it.

1016
01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.375
Mom.

1017
01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.716
Mom.

1018
01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.555
Mom?

1019
01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:25.441
<i>Was I a bad person to you too?</i>

1020
01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:29.069
<i>I hope I wasn't.</i>

1021
01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:32.072
But I guess I was.

1022
01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.590
<i>You're probably worried...</i>

1023
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:07.441
about how you'll raise him, right?

1024
01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:11.695
Don't worry and just follow my lead.

1025
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:14.781
I've done this before, so I know a thing or two.

1026
01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:33.717
You don't have to hold it in.

1027
01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.806
I've done this before, so I know a thing or two.

1028
01:03:40.691 --> 01:03:42.434
Goodness.

1029
01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.944
<i>Young-soon, we're leaving.</i>

1030
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:08.669
One minute!

1031
01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.323
Mom, here.

1032
01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:12.991
Goodness.

1033
01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.201
What is this?

1034
01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.078
It's Dad's first company picnic,

1035
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.387
so I made some <i>gimbap.</i>

1036
01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.765
It'd be nice if you could come too.

1037
01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:25.712
I know. I'd go if it wasn't for
the practical test next week.

1038
01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:27.381
Don't worry.

1039
01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.758
You'll pass no matter what.

1040
01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:31.343
I'll do my best.

1041
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.928
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

1042
01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.071
- Let's go then.
- Bye.

1043
01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.642
All right.

Bye, Young-soon.

1046
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.391
Are you awake?

1047
01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.712
Why am I here?

1048
01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.005
You fainted at your farm,

1049
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:11.383
and two men carried you here.

1050
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:13.635
You need to see the doctor now.

1051
01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.861
Can you walk?

1052
01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:17.779
Yes.

1053
01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:23.243
She's not in the kitchen or the bathroom.

1054
01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.371
And I can't go to the farm.

1055
01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.792
Then I can call her, right?

1056
01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:37.341
You just told me to, okay?

I don't think this is right.

1067
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.669
- Goodness.
- Be gentle.

1068
01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:15.155
You darn brat.

1069
01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:18.992
Our hearts break even when our
son gets injured in the tiniest bit.

1070

So imagine how Young-soon must feel.

1071
01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.706
Anyway, we won't be a part of it.

1072
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.626
I need to spray herbicide
on my garlic field. Okay?

1073
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.586
I need to thin out the cabbages.

1074
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.505
I have so much to do.

1075
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:34.314
I have no time to protest. Darn it.

1076
01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:35.717
Hang up.

1077
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:39.012
Listen, you punk. I know you came
here after ending up dirt poor...

1078
01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:41.139
because of gambling and plagiarizing.

1079
01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.163
And you're telling me you're going to build...

1080
01:06:43.187 --> 01:06:44.927
the biggest concert hall in the country?

1081
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:46.478
How am I supposed to believe that?

1082
01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.079
I'm busy right now. Bye.

1083
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.377
Mr. Son!

1084
01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:59.339
Mr. Son!

1085
01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.968
You really don't have a guardian?

1086
01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.680
Husband, children,

1087
01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.625
or siblings?

1088
01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.767
No, I don't.

1089
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:13.562
Don't make me repeat myself.

1090
01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:16.189
So just tell me.

1091
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:20.569
What's wrong? Is it serious?

1092
01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:25.282
The biopsy results came out.

1093
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.493
It's stage 4 stomach cancer.

1094
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:33.331
We'll have to do more tests to confirm.

1095
01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.111
But judging by this scan,

1096
01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.838
it's metastasized to your peritoneum.

1097
01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:46.636
What are you talking about?

1098
01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:52.294
I only came here due to indigestion.

1099
01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:55.380
The pain is usually unbearable at this stage.

1100
01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.272
Look.

1101
01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.151
I'm really not in any pain.

1102
01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.555
I just have indigestion every now and then.

1103
01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:07.616
But I feel better every time I tend to it.

1104
01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.647
Anyway, I don't have cancer.

1105
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:14.581
Don't be absurd.

1106
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.069
Ma'am.

1107
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.321
Are you sure the result is correct?

1108
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.380
Is the patient's name Jin Young-soon?

1109
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.090
No.

1110
01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.302
That's not important.

1111
01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:34.309
To tell the truth,

1112
01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:40.023
my son is quite unwell right now.

1113
01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.237
So I...

1114
01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.906
I...

1115
01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.369
I...

1116
01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.790
I can't...

1117
01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:01.795
Doctor.

1118
01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.909
Please save me.

1119
01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:07.786
This is...

1120
01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.289
This is curable if I get surgery, right?

1121
01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:15.627
I recently saw on the news that...

1122
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:20.564
they've developed medicine
to cure last-stage cancer.

1123
01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.526
Doctor, I'll...

1124
01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.931
I'll do as you say,

1125
01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:30.392
and get treated.

1126
01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.784
I promise.

1127
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.620
Doctor.

1128
01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.789
I can't...

1129
01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:41.418
I can't die.

1130
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.212
My son...

1131
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.923
Kang-ho...

1132
01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:56.433
Mom!

1133
01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.568
Are you okay?

1134
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:09.988
Kang-ho.

1135
01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.073
Get up.

1136
01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.118
I...

1137
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.384
Mom.

1138
01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.142
Get up.

1139
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.448
Kang-ho.

1140
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.559
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1141
01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.526
<i>My mom is acting weird.</i>

1142
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:33.265
<i>She's low on energy and doesn't smile anymore.</i>

1143
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.727

and learn one thing at a time.</i>

1144

{\an8}<i>Who are we to criticize one another?</i>

1145
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.357
{\an8}<i>We both messed up.</i>

1146
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.693
{\an8}<i>Why should I die?</i>

1147
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:47.362
{\an8}<i>Why should I die?</i>

1148
01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.364
{\an8}<i>I feel so bad for Young-soon.</i>

1149
01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:52.242
{\an8}<i>What will happen to that family?</i>

1150
01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:54.953
{\an8}<i>Then after 25 nights,</i>

1151
01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.913
{\an8}<i>you wean them.</i>

1152
01:11:56.937 --> 01:12:02.142
{\an8}<i>I'll only end up becoming
a burden to my unwell son.</i>

1153
01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.769
{\an8}<i>Mom!</i>
