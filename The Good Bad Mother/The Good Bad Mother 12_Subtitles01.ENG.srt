14
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,464
Did you watch the news?

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,105
The news?

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,567
Hang on a second.

17
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,097
Are you here...

18
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,059
to talk about Hwang Soo-hyun?

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,186
So that's why you're here.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,022
I thought you never wanted to see me again.

21
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,191
This is no time to be so casual.

22
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,194
Even her bereaved family
member is so nonchalant.

23
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,988
- So why shouldn't I be?
- "Bereaved family"?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,657
She was your son's mother.
That makes you her family.

25
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,201
Are you serious right now?

26
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,093
You're the one who started it!

27
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,666
If the police start investigating this case,

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,100
both of us will be done for.

29
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,145
Let's end this...

30
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,566
by making Kang-ho the baby's father.

31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,318
But of course...

32
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,155
we'll have to take care of him before that.

33
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,867
That's right.

34
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,606
This is how a President
should manage his affairs.

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,248
Right.

36
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,570
Sometimes you have to appease the masses,

37
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,214
and sometimes you have to
sacrifice some for the greater good.

38
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,411
A man like you should be President.

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,538
But then...

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,013
Hwang Soo-hyun appears out of nowhere.

41
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,792
What a shame.

42
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,876
Right?

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,518
Mr. Song!

44
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,023
Did you have that much fun with her?

45
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,513
You douchebag!

46
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,099
Do I look like a pushover
because I worked with you?

47
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,267
Did I have fun with her?

48
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,893
Do you have proof?

49
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,186
Because I do!

50
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,064
I have proof you killed Choi Hae-sik!

51
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,942
I have proof of all the
dirty deeds you committed...

52
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,486
to turn Yongra Construction into Woobyeok Group!

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,281
I also have proof you ordered Choi Kang-ho...

54
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,700
to kill Hwang Soo-hyun just
to have something on me!

55
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,050
Do you get it?

56
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,781
As of today,

57
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,951
I'm cutting ties with Dosang Group.

58
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,647
This country will now...

59
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,123
protect Woobyeok Group.

60
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,494
{\an8}There are so many boats.

61
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:52,666
{\an8}Wouldn't it be so beautiful to
see them all floating out there?

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,517
{\an8}They'd look like Christmas lights.

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,588
{\an8}Come on.

64
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,382
{\an8}You've been checking your phone all day today.

65
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,884
{\an8}Are you expecting a call?

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,525
{\an8}No.

67
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,889
{\an8}You must be cold. Come here.

68
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,224
{\an8}It's okay.

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,574
{\an8}You need it. Put it back on.

70
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,895
Listen to your guardian.

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,912
Gosh, you're scary.

72
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,025
Okay, Mr. Guardian.

73
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,750
All right.

74
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,795
Here you go.

75
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,005
- Kang-ho.
- Yes?

76
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,245
Look at the name of that boat.

77
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,579
It's my name.

78
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,263
- It's my name, Mom.
- No way.

79
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,516
It's "Choikangho."

80
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,921
Stand next to it. I'll take a photo.

81
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,729
A photo?

82
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,010
Say "piggy" on the count of three.

83
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,011
Piggy.

84
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,222
One, two, three.

85
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,364
Piggy.

86
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,059
That looks great.

87
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,827
- Take one of me too.
- Okay.

88
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,496
Unbelievable.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,707
All right.

90
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,533
Hwang Soo-hyun.

91
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,091
What did you say?

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,677
What?

93
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,372
It's nothing.

94
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,873
I'll take it now.

95
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,085
One, two, three.

96
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,394
Piggy.

<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

98
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,078
Hello?

99
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,789
What?

100
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,793
There's smoke coming from the farm?

101
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,129
Yes, okay.

102
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,423
Yes, I'll check now.

103
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,469
Kang-ho.

104
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,122
Kang-ho, wake up.

105
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,473
There's smoke coming from the farm.

106
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,900
Kang-ho...

107
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,887
Shouldn't we call 119...

108
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,056
if the farm is on fire?

109
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,516
It could be a prank call, so let's check first.

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,241
Can you open the gate?

111
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,452
Kang-ho!

112
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,662
Kang-ho!

113
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,461
Kang-ho!

114
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,555
Kang-ho.

115
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,169
A fire?

116
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,421
Their farm is on fire?

117
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,173
Wait. Kang-ho.

118
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,717
- Kang-ho!
- No, Sam-sik!

119
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,052
What is it?

120
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,694
What's the matter?

121
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,072
Is Sam-sik home?

122
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,142
I don't think so.

123
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,852
I had a nightmare.

124
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,063
Goodness. What did he do this time?

125
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,690
- Goodness.
- What's wrong?

126
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,667
Did you dream that he stole something again?

127
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,404
Where are you going?

128
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,491
You don't think he reported it, right?

129
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,077
Of course not. He lost the evidence.

130
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,303
If anything, he'd be accused
of threatening Oh Ha-young.

131
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,500
Do you think he's on to us?

132
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,627
That's why he ran away.

133
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,754
We must get him before things get out of hand.

134
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,437
Yes, sir.

135
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,273
Kang-ho!

136
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,802
Kang-ho!

137
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,720
Wait. Isn't that Bang Sam-sik?

138
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,264
Get him!

What did they just say?

00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,106
"Threatened"? "Ran away"?

142
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,567
They couldn't have been
talking about our son, right?

143
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,361
What did that punk do this time?

144

Goodness.

Fire!

Who are you?

152
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,564
Did you do this?

Hey, get them!

- Help...

00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,439
Help me...

What?

Isn't that Sam-sik?

164
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,408
- Sam-sik! Goodness!
- Sam-sik!

165
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,743
Goodness, Sam-sik!

Call 119!

There's a fire!

173
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,815
You guys are such a loving couple.

174
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,098
Were you guys having a late-night date?

175
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,308
How romantic.

176
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,936
Romantic, my foot.

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,106
We were tossing and turning in bed,
so we decided to get some fresh air.

178
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,859
In this cold weather?

179
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,751
It's 14° F tonight.

180
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,865
It's already past the season to make kimchi.

181
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,867
Why do you have all this garlic?

182
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,994
I heard black garlic is good for your stomach,

183
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,287
so I'm going to make some.

184
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:26,515
For who? Does someone have a bad stomach?

185
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,228
Look, Mr. Son.

186
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,772
Actually...

187
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,303
She just wants to take good care of her health.

188
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,029
Black garlic is good for you.

189
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,310
Could you give us some too?

190
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,228
Sure.

191
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,730
But why? Do you guys have a bad stomach too?

192
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,899
Our stomachs are fine,
but his area down there...

193
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,150
What?

194
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,904
It says that black garlic is good for men.

195
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,365
He may look fine, but he's very weak.

196
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,701
You darn woman.

197
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,761
Enough with that nonsense of yours.

198
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,374
- Fire!
- Fire!

199
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,417
- Fire!
- What?

200
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,544
- Fire!
- Fire?

201
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,921
What are you talking about? A fire?

202
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,506
Here you were.

203
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,882
What were you doing?

204
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,343
It's a disaster! There's a fire!

205
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,179
Where's the fire? I don't see it.

206
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,724
I was praying in the mountains...

207
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:28,103
when I saw a fire blazing from Kang-ho's farm.

208
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,062
What?

209
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,355
Oh, dear!

210
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,456
Goodness!

211
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,818
Goodness, Mr. Son!

212
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,946
Mr. Son! This is bad!

213
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,532
Goodness, what's going on?

214
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,825
- Oh, dear!
- Call 119!

215
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,286
- Okay!
- Isn't this Sam-sik?

216
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,538
What's wrong with him?

217
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,582
Did he set this fire?

218
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,334
Shut your mouth!

219
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,461
Where are Kang-ho and his mom?

220
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,962
Her truck is here,

221
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,423
- but she won't pick up.
- Oh, no!

222
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,759
We don't have time!

223
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,177
Let's put out the fire!

224
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,136
- Okay!
- Over there!

225
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,763
Hurry!

226
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,473
- Goodness.
- Why are you lying here?

227
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,974
- Goodness!
- Stay with him!

228
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,061
What about our Sam-sik?

229
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,328
Go on. Pull it out.

230
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,606
Who's that?

231
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,441
Isn't that Young-soon?

232
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,567
- Ms. Jin!
- Goodness!

233
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,860
- Goodness!
- Young-soon!

234
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,112
What's going on?

235
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,614
Goodness!

236
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,240
- Oh, dear!
- Be careful!

237
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,743
Be careful!

238
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,286
- You're okay now.
- Kang-ho.

239
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,615
- Where's the water?
- Kang-ho.

240
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,789
- Kang-ho?
- Kang-ho?

241
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,000
- Where is he right now?
- Kang-ho...

242
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,002
He's in there.

243
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,003
- What?
- What?

244
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,506
Are you saying he's in there?

245
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,174
- Kang-ho!
- Oh, no.

246
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,425
- No!
- Kang-ho!

247
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,802
- No!
- No!

248
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,261
- Kang-ho!
- No!

249
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,154
- Oh, dear!
- Kang-ho...

250
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,159
- Mi-joo!
- Mi-joo!

251
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,188
Stay here.

252
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,831
Sam-sik, are you okay?

253
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,652
- What?
- Mr. Yang.

254
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,820
Turn on the water.

255
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,987
- Right.
- Turn it on!

256
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,155
- Turn it on!
- Turn it on!

257
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,907
Stick it in there!

258
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,075
- Goodness!
- Hey!

259
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,868
What are you doing?

260
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,745
Goodness me!

261
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,470
Goodness!

262
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,642
You lunatic! What are you doing?

263
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,299
Spray it in my direction.

264
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,024
What?

265
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,262
Okay.

266
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,514
- No!
- Sam-sik!

267
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,057
- Sam-sik!
- Sam-sik!

268
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,392
Sam-sik!

269
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,018
Don't go in there!

270
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,521
- Don't do it!
- Don't go in!

271
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,038
No, Sam-sik!

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,861
Kang-ho!

273
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,028
Sam-sik!

274
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,531
- What do we do?
- Sam-sik!

275
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,158
- Goodness!
- Sam-sik!

276
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,325
Sam-sik!

277
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,536
There they come!

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,871
They're here!

279
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,873
- Goodness!
- Over here!

280
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,166
Hurry up!

281
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,500
Wait!

282
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,545
Look! Someone's coming out!

283
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,924
Goodness! Sam-sik is
carrying Kang-ho on his back!

284
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,510
- Well done, Sam-sik!
- Well done!

285
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,839
- I'm so proud of...
- Sam-sik!

286
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:08,680
Hold on!

287
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,433
Isn't that Kang-ho?

288
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,491
- What?
- What?

289
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,832
Kang-ho is carrying Sam-sik!

290
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,365
Kang-ho!

291
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,966
- Kang-ho!
- Sam-sik!

292
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,885
Sam-sik!

293
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,955
They're okay.

294
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,665
It's Kang-ho.

295
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,833
Sam-sik.

296
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,169
- Goodness!
- Goodness!

297
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,755
Kang-ho. Oh, dear.

298
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,590
- Oh, dear.
- My Sam-sik.

299
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,966
Wake up, Kang-ho.

300
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,260
Call the ambulance!

301
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,220
Are you okay?

302
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,097
Goodness, my Sam-sik.

303
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,781
Sam-sik!

304
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,763
You should be lying down. You're unwell.

305
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,252
They said his oxygen therapy went well,

306
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,270
and he'll wake up soon, so don't worry.

307
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,926
You've been so busy today because of us.

308
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,761
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

309
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,153
Don't worry about that.

310
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,768
Ms. Jin, you should lie down.

311
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,827
- Sam-sik.
- Sam-sik.

312
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,814
Where am I?

313
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,983
You darn punk. Where do you think you are?

314
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,292
It's the hospital.

315
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,002
The hospital?

316
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:51,032
Why would you jump into the fire?

317
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,013
Are you a moth drawn to a flame or something?

318
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,203
Why would you do such a thing?

319
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,038
You lunatic.

320
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,333
That's enough. He's still recovering.

321
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,211
Why would you call me a moth?

322
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,963
- Hey.
- Yes?

323
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,673
Is this funny to you?

324
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,009
Come on. Don't be so serious.

325
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,970
You almost died back there.

326
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,096
What?

327
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,764
What if something happened to you?

328
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:19,451
What if we lost our precious only son?

329
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,898
I got angry with you first...

330
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,733
so others wouldn't.

331
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,359
She beat you first...

332
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:32,407
because she couldn't stand the thought
of your being beaten up by others.

333
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,967
Do you even know how it feels to be so harsh...

334
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,219
to your own child?

335
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,790
It's okay to cause trouble.

336
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,892
You can even become a jobless thug.

337
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,881
Just stay alive, will you?

338
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,507
Is that so hard?

339
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,442
It's not, right?

340
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,322
Goodness me.

341
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,407
You son of a gun.

342
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,688
How dare you make my man cry?

343
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,524
It's not hard, is it?

344
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,085
Don't cry now.

345
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,338
You're awake. What a relief.

346
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,867
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

347
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,495
Yes, I'm fine.

348
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,496
Right.

349
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,805
How is Kang-ho?

350
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,209
They need to run a few more tests,

351
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,434
so they're transferring him to a general ward.

352
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,106
You're awake.

353
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,471
We're looking into the cause of the fire.

354
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,139
We found traces of gasoline...

355
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,059
near the farm's entrance where the fire started.

356
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,604
We suspect that there were
explosives around the area.

357
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,481
I can explain.

358
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,024
You see,

359
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,653
I went to the farm to look for Kang-ho.

360
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,615
And some suspicious-looking
guy was coming out of the farm.

361
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,173
I did it.

362
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,493
- It was me.
- What?

363
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,911
It was a mistake.

364
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,621
What was?

365
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,039
So...

366
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,333
It was my fault that the fire broke out.

367
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,003
I shouldn't have put the gasoline near the fire.

368
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,170
I was in a hurry.

369
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,548
Ms. Jin, what are you talking about?

370
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,383
I saw him.

371
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,843
This guy...

372
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,762
No. It wasn't just one guy.

373
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,598
Do you see this on the back of my neck?

374
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,976
- They hit me really hard.
- I see.

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,395
That's not the only place you're injured.

376
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,439
- Sorry?
- Goodness, you're a mess.

377
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,315
What happened to your lip?

378
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,916
- Goodness.
- Well, this...

379
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,003
There's no need to further investigate this.

380
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,715
I'm the victim, so why would I lie?

381
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,661
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

382
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,413
- I'm so sorry.
- What...?

383
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,123
But...

384
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,098
What are you doing?

385
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,212
Who's the suspicious guy you saw?

386
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,714
Did you eavesdrop?

387
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,731
Answer me.

388
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,426
He isn't a villager, right?

389
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,736
No one in our neighborhood would do that.

390
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,347
Let me go.

391
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,059
He was really tall and burly.

392
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,977
He was as big as Don Lee.

393
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,228
When I got there,

394
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,397
I saw him running out of the farm.

395
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,566
You saw it too.

396
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,568
The gate to the farm was latched.

397
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,570
It couldn't have been done from the inside.

398
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,614
Then why did Ms. Jin lie?

399
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,424
Beats me. I'm baffled too.

400
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,912
Maybe she caught on to it.

401
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,095
Caught on to what?

402
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,931
What?

403
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,169
Goodness.

404
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,462
That came out wrong.

405
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,215
Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?

406
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,383
I've never known anything in life.

407
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,843
Really?

408
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,361
Then why were you there so late?

409
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,766
That was because...

410
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,560
I went there to see Kang-ho.

411
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,270
Are you serious? At that hour?

412
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,204
Looking like this?

413
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,775
What happened to your face?

414
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,193
Who beat you up?

415
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,487
I wasn't beaten up.

416
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,755
I fell down the stairs earlier.

417
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,578
Do you really want to fall down the stairs?

418
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,205
- Do you?
- What are you doing?

419
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,665
Tell me the truth,

420
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,418
or I can't help but think you set the fire.

421
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,837
What? Darn it.

422
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,838
That makes no sense!

423
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,089
Why not?

424
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,591
You've been jealous of
Kang-ho because I like him.

425
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,634
You like him?

426
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,220
I... No, I don't.

427
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,305
Anyway, so why did you set the fire?

428
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,072
Why?

429
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,909
It wasn't me! It was Oh Tae-soo's guys!

430
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,606
Oh Tae-soo?

431
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,332
- The Oh Tae-soo we all know?
- Yes.

432
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,736
Mi-joo.

433
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,670
I'll be honest.

434
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,215
Kang-ho is in danger.

435
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,249
Mi-joo.

436
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,141
What's going on?

437
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,128
I thought you'd left with Sam-sik.

438
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,186
Report them to the police.

439
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,674
What? Report who to the police?

440
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,650
Those people who want Kang-ho dead.

441
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,073
Ms. Jin.

442
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,149
What did you hear?

443
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,610
Sam-sik told me everything.

444
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,030
He said Kang-ho knew about
Assemblyman Oh's secret.

445
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,656
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's secret?

446
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,825
His illegitimate son.

447
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,302
Apparently Kang-ho had the
original copy of the DNA test.

448
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,997
He did?

449
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,014
You didn't know?

450
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,461
They went after Sam-sik because of it too.

451
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,879
Why him?

452
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,923
The test result was in the bag...

453
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,925
you'd given to Ms. Park.

454
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,566
What?

455
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,140
So tell me. Where is it now?

456
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,725
Sam-sik had it,

457
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,019
but Oh Tae-soo's men took it from him.

458
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,188
Then it's over now. They have the evidence.

459
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,065
So why are they doing this to Kang-ho?

460
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,026
He must feel uneasy about
Kang-ho knowing the truth.

461
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,029
But why? Kang-ho has lost his memory.

462
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,615
Because if Kang-ho ever regained his memory,

463
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,159
he'd find the evidence again.

464
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,078
That's why he's doing this.

465
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,762
So we must report this now.

466
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,916
No, don't.

467
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,875
Ms. Jin.

468
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,919
We don't have any evidence of this.

469
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,172
Provoking them could put
Kang-ho in further danger.

470
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,424
You still don't get it?

471
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,009
Kang-ho is already in danger.

472
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,068
I know.

473
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,112
That's why...

474
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,619
That's why...

475
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,664
we're going to leave.

476
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,667
What?

477
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,380
I don't have much time anyway.

478
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,075
Once he wakes up,

479
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,328
we're going to move and go into hiding,

480
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,637
and prepare for emigration.

481
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,835
So Mi-joo, you don't need
to worry about him anymore.

482
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,129
This is ridiculous.

483
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,922
Why must you guys run away,

484
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,675
when Oh Tae-soo is the guilty one?

485
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,010
Let's just report him.

486
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,013
Then the police will reveal the truth...

487
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,723
and protect Kang-ho.

488
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,741
That's how his dad died.

489
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,602
What?

490
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,537
A fire broke out at our farm in the past.

491
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,733
<i>He lost his life...</i>

492
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,709
<i>trying to expose the truth.</i>

493
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,463
No one protected him.

494
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,577
<i>Neither the court nor our neighbors.</i>

495
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,886
<i>Even I, his wife,</i>

496
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,597
<i>was powerless.</i>

497
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,266
That's why...

498
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,518
I was so strict with Kang-ho.

499
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,938
I wanted him to become a powerful person.

500
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,817
He must've resented me so much...

501
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,362
throughout those lonely and painful years.

502
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,411
I'm going to protect Kang-ho.

503
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,706
I won't let him meet the same fate as his dad.

504
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,713
Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years...

505
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,633
because of you.

506
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,930
During those long years he
was preparing for the bar exam,

507
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,767
he always sang "I'm Happy."

508
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,812
That's your favorite song.

509
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,696
♫ <i>I'm happy</i> ♫

510
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,852
♫ <i>I'm happy</i> ♫

511
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,437
♫ <i>I'm</i> ♫

512
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,191
♫ <i>I'm happy
I'm happy</i> ♫

513
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,919
♫ <i>I'm happy</i> ♫
Keep it down. You're being too loud.

514
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,340
There are so many places
that make pancakes in Seoul.

515
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,786
<i>We visited most of them.</i>

516
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,538
<i>You see,</i>

517
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,790
<i>he was craving mung bean pancakes.</i>

518
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,016
<i>But he wasn't happy with any of them.</i>

519
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,891
How is it? Is it good?

520
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,908
How...?

521
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,440
- <i>Looking back,</i>
- Sorry.

522
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,483
It's okay.

523
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:31,252
He was looking for the taste
of your mung bean pancakes.

524
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,490
Kang-ho...

525
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,300
didn't resent you.

526
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,635
He was worried about you,

527
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,888
and missed you a lot.

528
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,898
Was it you?

529
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,400
Sorry?

530
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,652
Were you the girl...

531
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,281
he wrote about in his journal?

532
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,828
You were the girl he loved to death.

533
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,456
It was you.

534
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,985
That's why...

535
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,862
despite losing his memory,

536
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,088
he still searched for you
and had those feelings.

537
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,967
Mi-joo.

538
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,514
It must've been so hard and painful for you.

539
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,517
Why didn't you tell me?

540
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,898
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,843
I know it's late,

542
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,472
but let me apologize on his behalf.

543
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,907
- I'm truly sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

544
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,411
I should've told you sooner.

545
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,749
It's taken me too long.

546
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,795
That's okay. What could
you possibly be sorry about?

547
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,366
It's all our fault.

548
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,050
- You had no choice...
- I'm...

549
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,261
not married.

550
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,598
Ye-jin and Seo-jin...

551
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,143
are Kang-ho's kids.

552
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,757
But they're my kids now.

553
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,344
I only found out about the
pregnancy after we broke up.

554
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,071
And I decided to have them without him.

555
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,018
I never planned to use them as
an excuse to hold onto Kang-ho.

556
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:30,079
And I don't intend to get back
with him by using them either.

557
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,207
He may not remember right now.

558
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,697
But he abandoned me in the past.

559
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,964
He didn't.

560
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,342
Kang-ho...

561
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,971
wanted to avenge his dad.

562
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,418
So he was going to become
the son of his dad's murderer,

563
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,728
and marry the accomplice's daughter.

564
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,397
What do you mean?

565
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,593
Are you saying his dad was murdered by...?

566
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,220
Song Woo-byeok...

567
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,529
and Oh Tae-soo.

568
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,658
Kang-ho never abandoned us.

569
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,688
If things went haywire,

570
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,040
he knew we'd be in danger...

571
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,625
for being his loved ones.

572
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,503
That's why he chose to leave us.

573
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,757
The only person...

574
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,884
he ever abandoned...

575
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,386
was himself.

576
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,640
Kang-ho.

577
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,017
Kang-ho.

578
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,341
Kang-ho, are you awake?

579
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,024
Mom.

580
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,782
Mi-joo.

581
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,439
Are you Mr. Choi Kang-ho?

582
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,206
Who are you?

583
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,333
Police.

584
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,988
We already explained
everything to the other officers.

585
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,573
What are you referring to?

586
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,466
Aren't you here because of the fire?

587
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,262
Or did you...?

588
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,333
Mr. Choi.

589
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:58,519
You're under arrest on suspicion
of murdering Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun.

590
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,943
An anonymous source sent these photos to us.

591
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,013
Then four hours later,

592
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,157
these photos were taken
on the coast of Taebu Island.

593
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,519
As for Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun,

594
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,704
her body was found near Jemyeon Island,

595
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,109
which is about 3 miles from Taebu Island.

596
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,837
She was wearing the same
clothes and bag from that day.

597
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,907
So...

598
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,634
are you insinuating that my son murdered her?

599
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,803
Mr. Choi.

600
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,223
You know her, right?

601
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,003
No.

602
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,562
What about this baby?

603
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,260
You often visited her at
the postpartum care center!

604
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,763
Everyone there thinks you're the dad!

605
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,640
What are you talking about?

606
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,351
He had a fiancée back then.

607
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:59,121
And we suspect that's the
reason he committed this crime.

608
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,818
He must've had to get rid of
Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby...

609
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,545
to become the son-in-law
of such a powerful family.

610
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,549
Unbelievable.

611
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,053
I'll be honest.

612
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,181
The woman and her baby...

613
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,851
aren't related to him. They're...

614
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,254
Mom, I'm hungry!

615
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,506
What?

616
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,674
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

617
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,218
- Kang-ho.
- What?

618
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,844
- Food.
- Kang-ho!

619
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,137
What are you doing?

620
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,680
No, don't do this!

621
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,739
Don't do this!

622
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,727
What the...?

623
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,896
- That's not a rag.
- Kang-ho.

624
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,606
You aren't hurt?

625
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,067
Mom, I'm hungry. I want to go home.

626
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,236
I'll bring you some food.

627
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,654
No, I want to go home.

628
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,199
Those men keep yelling at me.
I'm so scared. I want to go home.

629
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,409
- Kang-ho!
- Get him.

630
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,828
Don't do that!

631
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,455
- Get him!
- Mom!

632
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,013
Kang-ho!

633
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,599
Come here!

634
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,336
- Stay still.
- Stay still.

635
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,879
What are you doing?

636
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,089
That hurts!

637
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,147
Let him go!

638
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,468
It's okay. It's Mom.

639
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,178
You're all right.

640
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,514
Let's go home.

641
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,739
Let's go home.

642
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,310
Tell me.

643
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,021
Does being in the same
car make him the murderer?

644
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,789
Do you have proof he killed her?

645
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:28,961
How could you use force on
my son who isn't mentally stable?

646
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,198
I want to see your chief.

647
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,657
I'm going to sue you all for violating
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities!

648
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,470
It's okay.

649
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,400
Thank you for lending us your tracksuit.

650
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,138
Should I send it back by courier?

651
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,515
I'm going to gather evidence and come back.

652
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,407
So keep it with you.

653
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,644
Don't even think about running away.

654
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,037
That'll only aggravate his penalty.

655
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,093
Kang-ho.

656
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,808
Gosh, I stink.

657
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,743
I'm going to take a shower.

658
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,708
I've been waiting for a very long time.

659
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,588
Aren't you going to greet me?

660
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,024
You're back.

661
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,569
Welcome back.

662
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,322
It's been a while.

663
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,994
I was so afraid...

664
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,665
I might never see you again.

665
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,903
I knew...

666
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,503
I had to...

667
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,299
ask for your forgiveness
for everything I'd done.

668
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,761
I was afraid I might never be able to do that.

669
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,893
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

670
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,272
It was wrong of me.

671
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,077
I'm back,

672
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,955
Mother.

673
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,040
Mom, I think you should stay at the hospital.

674
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,249
Kang-ho.

675
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,558
I'm okay.

676
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,800
By the way, how did you know?

677
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,234
How couldn't I? I'm your mom.

678
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,029
You could be an actor.

679
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,616
That was some incredible acting.

680
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,271
I had to get out of there at all costs...

681
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,455
to do what I needed to do.

682
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,625
What do you...?

683
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,044
Don't tell me...

684
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,531
No, Kang-ho.

685
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,965
It's too dangerous. I won't allow it.

686
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,746
Father,

687
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,348
Hwang Soo-hyun, and the fire at our farm.

688
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,336
You still don't get it?

689
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,921
They'll keep coming after us.

690
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,064
All the evidence is gone.

691
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,568
I'm sorry.

692
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,197
I didn't know things would pan out this way.

693
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,810
Kang-ho.

694
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,728
Let's just leave.

695
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,314
Why don't we go somewhere far away?

696
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,024
That's what Ms. Hwang tried to do,

697
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,041
and look...

698
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,544
what happened to her.

699
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,783
They'll find us...

700
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,758
one way or another.

701
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,638
So we must find evidence against
them before they do anything to us.

702
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,310
But how will you possibly do that?

703
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,591
You need seven different lies...

704
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,442
to conceal one.

705
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,028
It's the same with crimes.

706
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,364
To conceal one,

707
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,367
you need to commit multiple crimes.

708
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,914
And there's always evidence left behind.

709
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,543
I'll find it at all costs.

710
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:25,033
<i>However, no one can find out
I've regained my memory...</i>

711
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,410
<i>until everything is over.</i>

712
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,387
<i>And you should never be alone.</i>

713
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,540
<i>Do you understand?</i>

714
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,515
I got you.

715
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,270
Wait for me.

716
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,664
That's impressive.

717
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,428
Pasta or pizza?

718
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,969
Babe, how are you guys here together?

719
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,320
We ran into each other.

720
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,932
Let me pack up. One minute.

721
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,366
- Sure.
- Gosh.

722
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,979
Gosh, my babies. Aren't you cold?

723
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,579
It's okay.

724
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,060
Hi, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

725
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,896
It's Mr. Kang-ho.

726
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,570
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

727
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,558
Honestly, I didn't recognize you either.

728
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,102
Did you get a new hat?

729
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,228
You're wrong!

730
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,121
He's worn this hat more than ten times!

731
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,316
It's okay if you don't recognize me.

732
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,875
I'd know you from a mile away.

733
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,253
Come here.

734
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,522
<i>Ye-jin and Seo-jin...</i>

735
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,691
<i>are Kang-ho's kids.</i>

736
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,079
Isn't he the prosecutor from last time?

737
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,485
<i><font color="#ffff00">When Nails Come</font></i>

738
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,628
What...

739
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,199
did you just say?

740
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,133
Petit Nail.

741
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,329
Bar Exam Meal.

742
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,457
Fried-tofu rice balls. Ten square root of two.

743
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,599
I remember everything now.

744
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,310
Does this mean you're all better now?

745
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,228
Yes.

746
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,522
I see.

747
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,566
I'm so relieved.

748
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,864
You're better now?

749
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,159
Then I can give you a beating now, you scumbag.

750
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,979
Hey!

751
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,498
Why didn't you tell me?

752
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,877
I wanted to die multiple times a day.

753
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,657
I cried, cursed,

754
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,535
and resented you every single day.

755
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,222
How could you put a pregnant
woman through such a difficult time?

756
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,918
You know why Ye-jin and
Seo-jin are bad-tempered?

757
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,519
It's all because of you, you scumbag!

758
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,691
If I ever saw you again,

759
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,903
I was going to kill you.

760
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,072
But you were unwell.

761
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,326
So I just waited until you got better.

762
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,771
Then I found out that...

763
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,247
you were in more pain than I was.

764
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:32,072
I'm the one who was abandoned and hurt.

765
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,699
So why can't I resent you for what you did?

766
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,093
Why did you have to suffer more than me?

767
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,169
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,061
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

769
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,733
But Mi-joo,

770
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,971
don't forgive me just yet.

771
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,514
What?

772
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,908
The thing I have to do
without you hasn't ended yet.

773
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,479
So don't...

774
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,731
forgive me just yet.

775
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,402
Keep cursing and resenting me...

776
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,085
for now.

777
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,448
Once I come back safe and sound,

778
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,965
I'll beg and ask for your forgiveness.

779
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,844
And I'll be the one waiting...

780
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,347
for your forgiveness.

781
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,634
Hi, Sung-ae.

782
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,760
It's me.

783
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:41,183
Please come to the village
hall with Mr. Bang by 6 p.m.

784
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,366
And don't eat beforehand.

785
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,954
Okay, see you then.

786
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,210
Who is it?

787
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,994
What brings you here?

788
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,788
I heard there was a fire at your farm.

789
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,665
Is that farm cursed or something?

790
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,960
It's one misfortune after another.

791
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,852
Tell me about it.

792
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,730
I should've just sold that cursed farm...

793
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,511
to a certain despicable guy back then.

794
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,194
What a shame.

795
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,072
"Despicable guy"?

796
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,369
That despicable guy is leaving. I'm moving out.

797
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,789
I have something for you before I leave.

798
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,292
I see.

799
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,044
There's no need for parting gifts,
but I appreciate the thought.

800
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:42,314
No, not that. I came to return your container.

801
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,386
I see.

802
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,721
Goodness.

803
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,125
I feel bad...

804
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,477
for a lot of things I did to you.

805
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,146
Take good care of yourself.

806
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,148
Here.

807
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,613
You have to survive.

808
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,575
Wait.

809
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,620
A goodbye party?

810
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,568
He's moving to Seoul tomorrow.

811
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,819
Is that why...

812
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,447
you made all this food by yourself?

813
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,325
After everything he's done to you?

814
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,203
Maybe she poisoned the food.

815
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,123
- Goodness.
- Are you serious right now?

816
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,333
Goodness, I'm sorry I'm late.

817
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,043
- Come on in.
- Come in.

818
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,169
Hi, kids.

819
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,313
- Come here.
- My babies.

820
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,133
Welcome. My dear Ye-jin.

821
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,676
You like pancakes, don't you?

822
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,846
I also brought <i>mandu</i> soup and
radish-water kimchi, your favorites.

823
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,863
Sit down.

824
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,017
- Sit down.
- Goodness.

825
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,102
You shouldn't have cooked...

826
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,037
when you haven't even fully recovered yet.

827
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,440
- Where is Kang-ho?
- Sorry?

828
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,027
The doctors needed to
run a few more tests on him,

829
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,294
so he's still at the hospital.

830
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,630
Don't worry. He's much better now.

831
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,288
I'm truly grateful for all you've done...

832
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,707
- to save our farm.
- Please.

833
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,127
I'm also sorry...

834
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:19,090
I failed to appreciate you all
because I was so focused on working.

835
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,925
- Stop that.
- What's gotten into her?

836
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,135
From this moment on,

837
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,513
I'm going to put aside my worries,

838
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:28,183
and live happily with you all.

839
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,476
- Sure.
- Do that.

840
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,727
Yes.

841
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,078

such an important task to you.

861

Didn't I tell you that Woobyeok Group...

862

What's so hard about killing that idiot?

Darn it!

869
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,964
Were you the one who sent these...?

870

Mr. Oh!

871
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,556
What happened to Kang-ho?

872
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,101
He was questioned this morning about
Hwang Soo-hyun and released a while ago.

873
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,603
He was released?

874
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,627
A vehicle was recovered at the
scene of the accident on Taebu Island.

875
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:43,229
And the doors and windows
were locked from the inside.

876
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,862
So you're telling me...

877
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:50,006
Hwang Soo-hyun was never
in the car to begin with?

878
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,680
That means Kang-ho duped me.

879
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,519
Then who killed her?

Just one.

I'm in such a great mood today.

00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,103
Tell me about it.

893
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,606
It's unlike you to drink like that,

894

and insist on sleeping at our home tonight.

895
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,236

- Mi-joo...

905
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,550
Let's go outside.

906
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,844
- Let's let her sleep.
- I want to sleep with them.

907
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,555
- Ye-jin and Seo-jin.
- Turn off the light.

908
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,225
- Okay, you can sleep with them.
- My babies.

909
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,936
- Let's sleep together.
- Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

910
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,828
My babies.

911
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,695
- Everyone was so happy today.
- I'm sorry.

912
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,129
They were all dancing and singing.

913
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,908
Really?

914
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,634
Why were they so happy?

915
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,204
I'm not sure.

916
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:46,391
I think they were happy to
hear that Mr. Baek was leaving.

917
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,628
What's this?

918
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,130
I took several videos to show you,

919
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,466
but none of them got saved.

920
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,926
Give it to me.

921
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,302
Let me see.

922
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,512
Look.

923
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,597
Your storage is full.

924
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,849
You should've deleted
unnecessary ones beforehand.

925
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:05,353
None of them are unnecessary!
They're all my work.

926
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,270
Really?

927
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,829
Okay.

928
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,065
What's this?

929
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,483
That?

930
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,502
I filmed Kang-ho's ex-fiancée.

931
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,740
Just delete it. It's the
most useless video ever.

932
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,535
- I hate it.
- Wait, hold on.

933
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,301
Hold on.

934
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,831
<i>Do you see this Banz?</i>

935
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,666
<i>My grandma told me that...</i>

936
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,961
<i>only those who are very rich can drive one.</i>

937
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,937
<i>All right. Let's take a peek inside.</i>

938
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,094
<i>I see the lady Kang-ho brought with him.</i>

939
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,987
<i>She took something out of her bag.</i>

940
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,086
No way.

941
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,756
They both could've died,

942
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,591
so why would she slip him pills?

943
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,218
I heard the driver that day was a woman.

944
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,221
Then it makes absolutely no sense.

945
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,141
Why would she spike her own drink?

946
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,685
I'm sure they were some supplements.

947
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,189
What's important is that
Kang-ho drove when they departed.

948
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,900
That means they switched places midway.

949
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,111
They could've done that if he was tired.

950
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,420
But the reason is just strange.

951
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,407
Apparently Kang-ho fell asleep,

952
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,076
and she was outside the car
when the accident happened.

953
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,704
That's why she was unscathed and met me.

954
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,055
Isn't it so odd?

955
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,126
Well...

956
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,394
It's too convenient to call it a coincidence.

957
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,131
This won't do.

958
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,758
I need to meet her.

959
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,593
What? Hey.

960
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,762
You can't do that!

961
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,154
Can't you see the state I'm in?

962
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,685
I even eat in here in case
those men come back for me.

963
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,479
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

964
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,371
Don't worry.

965
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,706
I won't be going alone.

966
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,741
I can't believe this.

967
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,508
Hey!

968
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,305
Mi-joo.

969
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,919
I'm truly honored and touched that
you chose me to do this with you.

970
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,062
But this isn't right. It's too dangerous.

971
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,092
Then will you live in a closet forever?

972
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,860
A closet is better than a coffin.

973
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,514
You've never met those guys.

974
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,865
If I'm caught again, I really might end up dead!

975
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,185
- Look.
- What?

976
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,369
- Now!
- Hey, Mi-joo!

977
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,372
Are you insane? Goodness.

978
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,444
<i>Who is it?</i>

979
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,906
Hello, is this Ha-young's home?

980
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,242
I'm a close friend of hers.

981
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,786
But I couldn't reach her.

982
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,831
Is she home right now by any chance?

983
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,501
<i>I'm sorry, but she's not home.</i>

984
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,086
Then can I...?

985
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,978
Darn it.

986
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,340
<i><font color="#ffff00">Sillim Fresh Raw Fish</font></i>

987
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,107
He's not here?

988
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,385
Right.

989
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,679
He sold the restaurant a year ago and left.

990
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,222
Where did he go?

991
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,866
I'm not entirely sure where he went.

992
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,536
But we suddenly lost touch.

993
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,715
Hello?

994
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,246
Hello, who is this?

995
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,665
<i>Prosecutor Choi, it's me.</i>

996
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,599
Investigation Officer?

997
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,086
Your car suddenly disappeared,

998
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,590
so I called your mother to check.

999
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:06,010
We were the only ones who
knew where the car key was.

1000
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,803
I'm truly glad.

1001
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,655
I knew you'd come back.

1002
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,851
- Sir.
- Yes?

1003
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,187
I still have some work to do,

1004
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,272
so please keep this a secret until then.

1005
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,997
Of course.

1006
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,235
I'm forever indebted to you.

1007
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,236
<i>You know me.</i>

1008
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,323
Have I ever asked you to lend me money?

1009
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,758
But my mother is getting surgery tomorrow.

1010
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,970
Could you please help me out this once?
I'll pay you back at all costs.

1011
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,723
Hello?

1012
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,850
Hello...

1013
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,774
Woobyeok Paper Company's corporate
transaction records and ledger...

1014
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:45,901
for the third and fourth quarters are missing.

1015
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:49,151
I'm sorry. I'll find them and get it to...

1016
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,265
- Sir?
- Take care of your personal matters...

1017
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,658
so you can focus on work.

1018
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,813
You don't have to come
to work until the weekend.

1019
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,815
Take good care of your mother.

1020
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,986
My mother would've passed away
without having a chance to get surgery,

1021
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,212
if you hadn't helped me back then.

1022
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:13,134
Maybe that's why I couldn't say no
to anything your mother asked of me.

1023
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,912
Don't worry.

1024
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,721
I'll help you no matter what.

1025
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,419
Goodness.

1026
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,713
You've been throwing up all day.

1027
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:27,940
You shouldn't have drunk in your state.

1028
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,511
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

1029
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,820
We already know what I have.

1030
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,328
My body has become too weak to
handle a single glass of <i>makgeolli.</i>

1031
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,877
Oh, no.

1032
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,297
What a small world.

1033
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,325
That was random.

1034
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,620
I've met Oh Ha-young before.

1035
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,971
What? When?

1036
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,849
<i>I won't apologize.</i>

1037
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,794
There.

1038
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,728
What'll you do now?

1039
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,231
In that case, it can't be helped.

1040
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,146
Goodness, you're still here?

1041
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,915
Ha-young's phone is still off.

1042
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,795
Ma'am, I really need to see her.

1043
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,951
I've been studying abroad for five
years, and I flew in temporarily.

1044
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,496
Once I go back,

1045
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,956
I don't know when I'll return.

1046
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,875
I can't believe that woman.

1047
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,376
Could you please...

1048
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,837
help me out this once?

1049
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,355
- Please.
- My goodness.

1050
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,342
You see...

1051
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,512
She's a bit sick, so she's
in a hospital right now.

1052
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,013
Which hospital?

1053
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,572
- I'll visit her.
- No!

1054
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,230
Anyway, it'll be difficult to
see her for the time being.

1055
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,247
So meet her next time.

1056
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,068
Come by again next time.

1057
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,403
Next time when?

1058
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,614
After the presidential election.

1059
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,423
I'm sure you'll be able to meet her then.

1060
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,454
Ma'am, please help me.

1061
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,889
Please...

1062
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,802
That lady...

1063
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,012
looked very anxious.

1064
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,988
Did you notice it too?

1065
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,768
She's in a hospital,

1066
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:46,564
but that lady won't dare
tell you which hospital it is.

1067
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,191
And she said you should
come back after the election.

1068
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,569
But that's in four months.

1069
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:56,031
How sick could she possibly be,
to be hospitalized for that long?

1070
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,492
I don't think the duration matters.

1071
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,802
I think it's the election part that's important.

1072
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,414
Right. I saw this earlier.

1073
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,431
Maybe...

1074
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,169
it has something to do with this.

1075
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,004
<i><font color="#ffa07a">Assemblyman Oh's Daughter
Disappears at Her Wedding...</font></i>

1076
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,630
No way.

1077
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,132
Think about it.

1078
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,219
The election is right around the corner,
and this is what his daughter did.

1079
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,179
Right.

1080
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,807
Plus, she's aware of her
father's illegitimate child.

1081
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:26,270
If I were him, I would've broken her
legs and locked her up somewhere.

1082
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,398
Do you think she's even in a hospital?

1083
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:33,777
Would he really risk the doctors and
nurses spreading rumors about her?

1084
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:38,047
And is there even a hospital
that admits you for four months?

1085
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,767
- Sam-sik!
- My gosh!

1086
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,962
I know where it is.

1087
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,756
What are you talking about?

1088
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,090
The hospital.

1089
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,191
It must be...

1090
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,568
Woosung Medical Center.

1091
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,285
Hey.

1092
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,357
What is this?

1093
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,123
Can't you read?

1094
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,195
It's a medical certificate.

1095
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,947
"14 weeks of recovery"?

1096
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,257
You didn't expect something
like this when you kicked me?

1097
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,059
You messed with the wrong person.

1098
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,463
You know who my dad is, right?

1099
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,982
Fabricating a medical
certificate is a cakewalk for him.

1100
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,177
He could turn someone like you...

1101
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:45,072
into a lunatic and have you
locked up in a hospital forever.

1102
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,561
I did hear that your father...

1103
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,662
is an assemblyman who'll
be running for President.

1104
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,706
"Oh Ha-young"?

1105
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,651
But I only just found out...

1106
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,584
his last name.

1107
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,421
"Woosung Medical Center."

1108
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,448
I see.

1109
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,618
I understand that Assemblyman Oh
is a powerful figure...

1110
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,162
who can fabricate medical certificates,

1111
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,748
and threaten innocent people with them.

1112
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,100
I'll make sure to remember him during elections.

1113
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,341
Do you think she's really here?

1114
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,776
She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.

1115
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,389
You and your dear Kang-ho.

1116
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:29,033
Also for your sake, Sam-sik.

1117
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:37,192
People always mention the
most important person last, right?

1118
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,751
Right?

1119
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,836
Wait up.

1120
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,871
Excuse me.

1121
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,457
Have you seen this man before?

1122
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,083
I don't think so.

1123
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,168
Thank you.

1124
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,170
May I ask you something?

1125
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,687
Have you seen this man before?

1126
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:09,239
Excuse me, sir. May I ask you something?

1127
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,092
<i><font color="#ffff00">Gwangmyeongho</font></i>

1128
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,455
<i>Name, Cho Yeong-jae. Age, 55.</i>

1129
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,874
<i>After he sold his restaurant in Sillim-dong,</i>

1130
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,251
<i>he changed his address to his hometown.</i>

1131
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,462
<i>But no one is living there.</i>

1132
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,800
<i>And I looked into a boat named
Gwangmyeongho as you asked.</i>

1133
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,176
<i>I found out that...</i>

1134
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,487
<i>there are boats by that name
in Dangjin, Pohang, and Haenam.</i>

1135
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,490
Mr. Cho!

1136
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,630
<i><font color="#ffff00">The Good Bad Mother</font></i>

1137
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,921
<i>You've worked tirelessly to support me,</i>

1138
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,989
<i>so I'll make sure you don't regret your effort.</i>

1139
01:02:23,013 --> 01:02:25,050
<i>Did Mr. Choi run away?</i>

1140
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,344
<i>Don't ever come back without a warrant.</i>

1141
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,611
<i>Is everything going well?</i>

1142
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,282
{\an8}<i>- That must be where Oh Ha-young is.
- What?</i>

1143
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,740
{\an8}<i>How could you do something so dangerous?</i>

1144
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:39,064
{\an8}<i>I do know this very secretive place.</i>

1145
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,165
{\an8}<i>Jin Young-soon!</i>

1146
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,484
{\an8}<i>Come out!</i>

1147
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,154
{\an8}<i>I figured the two of them...</i>

1148
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,196
{\an8}<i>needed some time alone.</i>

1149
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,781
{\an8}<i>You weren't with us,</i>

1150
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,717
{\an8}<i>but I was always with you.</i>
