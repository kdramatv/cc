Have you heard of that team?

11
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,868
No, I have never heard of it. We had a team like that?

12
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,169

we will call you right away.

Staying here won't help the case.

31
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,699
So you should go back home.

- could have been... - No.

Don't say that.

37
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,248

it's to study the psychology of criminals.

77
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,759

78
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,059
None.

79
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,898
At least give me some cigarettes.

80

Let me say this again. You will get any benefits.

88
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:02,528
You already know everything. What else do you want to know?

89
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,398
We have your case file.

90
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,299

101
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,648
Cut them off and divide them into two. How many do you have?

102
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,148
There are nine.

103

You can't do math.

104
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,329
Then you cut her neck, pulled out her eyeballs,

105
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,329
cut her nose and ears, split her lips into two,

106
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,559
and cut off two breasts, thumbs, and big toes.

107
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,598

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,429
Did you cut off her tongue?

112
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,299
She talked too much.

113
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,329
You see, I...

114
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,768
She was dead, for sure. But she wouldn't stop talking.

115
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:52,708
That witch kept on talking, so I bit it off. Like this.

116
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,708
Then it was better.

117
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,348
Do you have gum? Can I have a piece?

118
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:05,788
You chewed it off?

119
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:07,759
Her tongue?

120
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,918

Ever since I got this job,

135
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,138
I've been struggling to believe in the all-powerful creator.

Come on. I don't want to eat alone at home.

163

165

No, it's not what you're thinking.

169
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:20,748
Anyway, a school in Singapore offered a scholarship,

170
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,118
so I sent them there.

Anyway, this job is always so unstable, you know.

175

It sounded like a good opportunity, so I sent them.

176
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,929
But living alone is awful.

The freedom was nice for a month, but that was it.

179
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,968
Where should I drop you off?

180
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,439
Just any restaurant on the way.

181

in the alleyway at 94 Changeui-dong.

204
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,029
The news spread quickly because of a reporter who lives in the area,

205
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,929
so it's already stirring up a lot of anger nationwide.

345
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,088

348
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,428

349

Whatever. I'm going directly to the captain.

350

352
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,698
and continue to interview inmates.

353
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:46,269
Then at least share the daily report of the investigation with us.

354
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,108
How can I share that as I like?

355

00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,779
I can always share that.

Good grief.

I'm ordering jjajangmyeon. Do you want some?

360
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,178
No.

361
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,719
The police noted that there were no calls made...

362
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,388
by the culprit to demand money from the family of the victim,

363
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,829
so they speculate that it may have been done...

364
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,428
- by a mentally ill person. - What happened?

365
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,598
They won't even share the investigation reports?

366
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:10,959
I'm going to meet the captain of the Special Crime Squad.

367
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,799
Who's the captain of Team Two again?

368
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,029

369

How may I help you?

380
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,608
My name is Kook Young Soo. I was formerly in Forensics Squad.

386
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,398
I'm studying the psychology of criminals.

387
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,438
I meet with inmates in prison, conduct interviews,

388
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:24,069
and turn them into data.

389
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,569
What do you do with them?

390
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,279
Do you test for their types?

391
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,819
It was a joke. I'm sorry if you were offended.

392
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:37,178
No, it's all right.

397
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,059
I had my first interview with a mutilation murderer.

398
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,829
If we find out the psychology of the criminal,

399
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,598
we can prevent another crime.

400
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,398
We are in a rush to resolve the case instead of preventing it.

401
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:58,938
I understand. It's true, but...

402
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,608
Instead of arresting culprits,

404
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,408
to prevent similar crimes from breaking out, but...

405

406
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,979
it would be wonderful to see a day like that.

We'd like to help with this investigation.

409

The detectives in charge are more than competent.

410
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,128
I doubt it was done by a mentally ill person.

411
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,999
It seems like you're stepping over the line.

412
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,198
Why are you so defensive?

413
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,138
Goodness, why are you two going on with different topics?

414
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,908
Captain Yoon, we came to see you today...

415
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,749
to help out with the investigation.

416

As you can see, we are unbelievably busy...

420
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,688
because we don't even have a suspect...

could you please share the investigation reports?

You're probably asking although you know it's impossible.

What is it this time?

537
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,648
If you know anything, give me some Intel.

538
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,848
Come on. Don't ask me that. Bye.

539
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:56,388
Hey, don't hang up.

540
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:59,789
I really need to find a lead. Can you help me out here?

541
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:06,098
Gosh. Why did he just hang up on me?

542
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:22,378
See?

543
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:25,989
Desperate ones are bound to take initiative.

544
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,418
Do you feel like talking to me now?

545
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:30,888
No. Not yet.

546
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,358
Turn that off.

547
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:38,075
(Keep quiet)

548
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:47,438
- Happy now? - A bit.

549
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:49,209
Don't you feel guilty?

550
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:51,138
You brutally killed a woman.

551
00:31:51,138 --> 00:31:52,779
She was already dead anyway.

552
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,448
I didn't have a choice.

553
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,519
What's the point of holding onto the past and regretting it?

554
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,918
It's not regretting. It's repenting.

555
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:07,059
Do you know something?

556
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,829
Your eyes...

557
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:12,729
seem so familiar.

558
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,438
There's a void...

559
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:20,969
in your eyes.

560
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,938
- Stop making jokes. - I'm serious.

561
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:28,408
Fine. I'm human, after all.

562
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:31,618
I do feel guilty from time to time.

563
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,658
Right.

564
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,898
You too.

565
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:52,168
That just showed that you could turn into a monster too.

566
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,338
I'm just one step away?

567
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:55,678
Yes.

568
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:58,438
You can't consider guilt the same as murder.

569
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:06,118
That's the difference between humans and monsters like you.

570
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:08,688
You think a heinous crime like that is the same as being unethical.

571
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:09,959
That's an indeed horrendous thought.

572
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,358
A horrendous thought.

573
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:20,729
Do you know what's really horrid?

574
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:25,868
Severing the body.

575
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:29,908
Swoosh.

576
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,509
Swoosh!

577
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:39,749
Then why did you do it?

578
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,489
Do you think I did it for fun?

579
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,229
It takes a lot of time and is exhausting.

580
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,959
Think about it.

581
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,569
Where could I go while carrying someone that big?

582
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,029
Where could I hide her?

583
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,838
Cutting her up wasn't easy.

584
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,269
That wench.

585
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,249
So you cut her up to move around easily?

586
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,678
If that was the only reason,

587
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,649
you wouldn't have removed her eyes or tongue.

588
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:16,089
You got half right. The other half is wrong.

589
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,559
You get 50 points.

00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,717
There's a void in your eyes.

592
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,246
You too.

593
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,686
That just showed that you could turn into a monster too.

594
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,496
I'm back.

595
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,806
- Where did you go? - I went to meet Jang Deuk Ho.

596
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:08,806
I see.

597
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,007
How did you get them?

598
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,106
From my connection.

599
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:17,117
Wait. Let's see.

600
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,817
You're missing the time and locations.

601
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,746
Oh, that? I got it.

602
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:34,827
- Did you eat? - I don't have an appetite.

603
00:35:34,996 --> 00:35:36,797
You still have to eat regardless of your appetite.

604
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,949
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

605
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,577
Hey, give me that.

606
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:46,007
- Gosh. I'm so tired. - Goodness.

607
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:47,976
- You're back. - Yes.

608
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,976
Did anyone hold grudges against her parents?

609
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:54,447
We haven't found anyone so far. We still have to look further.

610
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,016
This is the file from Forensics. I checked them by time.

611
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,987
Did you eat?

612
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:03,257
- Do you want to go to a sauna? - It should be open by now.

613
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:04,597
There was no ransom.

614
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,266
So I doubt the culprit was after money.

615
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,367
Given the brutality of the crime,

616
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,797
we can look into people...

617
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,467
who might have held grudges against her parents.

618
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,166
But the Special Crime Squad hasn't gotten that far yet.

619
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,536
That's why they must have narrowed it down...

620
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:15,907
to someone who is mentally unstable.

621
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,146
But the body was cut too neatly for someone who's mentally unstable.

622
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,376
The culprit cut her up by her joints.

623
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,646
It means that the culprit knew the method.

624
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:29,356
And each body part was put in different plastic bags.

625
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,186
Just looking at the evidence,

626
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,797
the culprit must be used to cutting things up.

627
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,556
What kind of job one should have to be skilled at it?

628
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,126
This is going back to square one,

629
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,396
but why were they discarded in the same area?

630
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:44,867
It's easier to find.

631
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:48,306
Maybe he just didn't have the means to move them elsewhere.

632
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,947
But this... They were double-bagged, right?

633
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:58,217
Yes, you're right.

634
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:00,847
Why did he double-bag them?

635
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,726
Maybe he works at a slaughterhouse.

636
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,327
- That's possible. - A slaughterhouse worker.

637
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,097
(Slaughterhouse worker)

638
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,067
It's possible that he used a cutting machine.

639
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,036
And the way the body parts were frozen too.

640
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,467
But would a slaughterhouse worker...

641
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,237
put the body parts so neatly in plastic bags?

642
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:24,976
Then maybe he's someone who works at a butcher shop.

643
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,376
Oh, that's right.

644
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:27,806
When you buy meat,

645
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:29,376
they double-bag it in black plastic bags.

646
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:30,577
Fish too.

647
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,186
Judging by the way they were cut,

648
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:35,186
I'd say he's a butcher, not someone who handles fish.

649
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,617
But doesn't he have to work during the day?

650
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:40,226
Business owners can set their own work schedules.

651
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,257
Or...

652
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:43,927
he's someone who used to have that kind of job.

653
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,297
Who's unemployed now.

654
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,431
(Unemployed)

655
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:54,606
And they said he'd probably be someone with a mental illness.

656
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:56,177
But if he's mentally unstable...

657
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:57,907
I'm not sure.

658
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,706
It's highly unlikely...

659
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:03,476
because people like that can't really plan a crime like this.

660
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:04,677
And the way they were cut...

661
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:07,016
tells me that it has to be someone who is skilled at cutting things.

662
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:10,317
Exactly. That's how we should approach this. We should...

00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:39,907
You sure have a knack...

716
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,137
for overstepping your boundaries.

717
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,507
Let me make this clear to you.

718
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:49,177
I am the lead investigator in this case.

719
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,847
Do not underestimate or doubt what the Special Crime Squad can do.

720
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,086
If you truly want to help us,

721
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:58,987
do what you have to do in your own position.

00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:38,967
- Oh, dear. It's so hot, isn't it? - Yes.

728
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,496
We can't use the AC before July.

730
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,737
Can you please brief us on the progress?

731
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,266
Do you have a suspect yet?

732
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:50,237
I'll certainly let you know if there is any progress.

733
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:54,106
What? All eyes are on this case now.

734
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:56,447
Are you saying there still has been no progress?

735
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:01,086
Come on. You know that we're all busting our butts now.

Well, everything is classified except for the info...

737

that has been reported on the media,

738
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:08,556
so we can't tell you anything at the moment. Please understand.

739
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,027
Please use that exact wording when reporting my statement.

740
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:12,056
I have to go.

741
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,896
- Come on! - Tell us what's going on!

742
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,496

749
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,956
Hey, I transferred to the Intelligence Unit here...

752
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,657
You must be very busy these days.

753
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,556
Yes, as always.

754
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:48,126
How can we chat and share information...

755
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:49,867
with someone who doesn't smoke?

756
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,896
She's no fun.

757
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:53,436
She's difficult to work with.

758
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:54,637
Goodness.

759
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,806
They say women are chatty,

760
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:58,706
but men are worse in my opinion.

761
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:02,876
How's the investigation going? Any progress?

762
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,146
Well, it's not easy.

763
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:06,286
Because you're in charge...

00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:08,416

Everyone in the police force knows that you're a star player.

768
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,927
I can't believe people are still complaining...

769
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,126
about a woman leading the Special Crime Squad.

770
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:23,297
Losers. They're so pathetic.

771
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,606
I'm so happy that you're here.

772

775
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,217
The victim went missing at a park during the day,

776

and the body parts were found in a residential area nearby.

780
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:48,856
And it has to be someone who doesn't have a set schedule.

781
00:43:50,456 --> 00:43:52,396
What kind of trait does the culprit have?

782
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,666
Why did he kidnap her?

783
00:43:57,536 --> 00:43:59,336
Why did he dismember her body?

784
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:03,777
The body parts were found in black plastic bags.

785
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:05,947
They were double-bagged.

786
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,577

787
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:14,487

791
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:32,197
Hey, wait up!

792
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:33,536

Captain, come to the autopsy room. Now.

(Autopsy Room)

797
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:48,987

798
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:51,356
They were frozen when they were found.

799
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:54,157
The marks on the back seem to be from the freezer shelves.

800
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,367
Captain Kook Young Soo found it.

801
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:15,717
What is it about, sir? Why can't you just say it?

802
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:20,387
I know what everyone thinks about the Analysis Team.

803
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,117
I know what's going on,

804
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:27,257
but we can give them a chance, you know?

805
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:30,356
I heard Kook Young Soo was the one who found the clue.

806
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:35,737
Captain Yoon, I'm sure you know this,

807
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,836
but it's lonely taking a path no one has ever taken before.

808
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,606
They must be feeling lonely right now.

809
00:45:40,606 --> 00:45:45,777
So I'd like you to help them.

810
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:51,047
Don't get me wrong. It's not an order.

811
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:53,947
Of course not. I'm sure she knows.

812
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,717
Yes, sir. I should get back to work.

813

00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:56,559
- What is it? - Excuse me.

894
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:57,818
- Excuse me. - Okay.

895
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,428
Is that him? The stubborn one?

896
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:02,928
Yes. Let's talk later.

897
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:06,528
Hey! When can we go in? Young Soo!

898
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:12,669
You found the model of the fridge?

899
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,909
Yes, we did.

900
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,039
It's a Daesung fridge, manufactured in 1988.

901
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,039
This is the model name.

902
00:51:18,238 --> 00:51:21,309
Hey, I still have a business to run.

903
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,778
How much longer will this take, young lady?

904
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:25,948
She's not, "young lady." She's a detective.

905
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:27,889
She's the captain in charge of this case.

906
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,858
Whatever the case, please wrap it up quickly.

907
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:32,059
Gosh, I'll have to call a shaman for cleansing or something.

908
00:51:36,298 --> 00:51:39,329
Can't we go in now?

909
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,798
Don't come in here to step on and touch things.

910
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,968
The best way for the two of you to help is to stay right there.

911
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,539
Thank you for the hard work.

912
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,648
Someone with experience needs to help out with this.

913
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:54,678
Young Soo.

914
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,178
This is strange, right?

915
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:09,999
This guy didn't come here to sleep.

916
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,389
What is this?

917
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:41,959
On Monday, May 29,

918
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:47,028
a five-year-old, Lee Soo Hyun, was dismembered...

919
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:49,838
and found in a residential area in Changeui-dong.

920
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,838
Yesterday on June 26,

921
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:54,738
an additional part of her body...

922
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,139
was found at a motel in Gyeongseong-dong.

923
00:52:57,678 --> 00:53:00,979
Mrs. Kim, the owner of the motel...

924
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,878
reported to the police...

925
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,019
when she found a part of a young child's remains...

926
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,318
in the toilet of room 302 on the third floor around 3pm.

927
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:11,389
According to Kim,

928
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:17,128
a man who looked to be in his 40s, dressed in manual labour clothes...

929
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:19,798
stayed in this room around 7am on the 25th.

930
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:24,539
We will share the details of this ongoing investigation...

931
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:25,738
with the citizens.

932
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:27,838
We will do our very best in this investigation...

933
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,209
and make sure to catch the culprit.

934
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:33,749
I will end the brief here.

935
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:42,469
(Tuesday, June 27)

936
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:44,990
("Our Pledge")

937
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,659
We got our first-ever witness...

938
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,829
but it didn't lead to the culprit's capture.

939
00:53:54,307 --> 00:53:57,646
(Wonil-dong)

940
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:00,508
If anything, the identity of the culprit...

941
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,409
has become hazier.

942
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:14,789
- There you are. - Hi.

943
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:18,019
We need more support staff for the Investigation Team, Chief.

944
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:21,389
We've already maxed out the number. You know that too.

945
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:24,528
It's already been a week since the additional body part was found.

946
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,169
We can't delay any further.

947
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,999
We don't even have enough to send out for questioning.

948
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:33,139
Try using the Behavioural Analysis Team.

949
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:36,039
- Chief... - You said it's urgent.

950
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,678
Try asking for the Analysis Team's help.

951
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:42,209
Even though their method may seem foreign...

952
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:45,448
the team was still made to work for the organization too.

953
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,349
They're affiliated with the Detective Division too.

954
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:52,019
Also, this is off the record...

955
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:56,659
but the Behavioural Analysis Team may go away after this year.

956
00:54:56,928 --> 00:54:58,028
What do you mean, "Go away?"

957
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,599
They will have to show results, in order to show their worth.

958
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,599
Those guys are in as knee-deep as we are in this case too.

959
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,209
So try utilizing them well.

960
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:10,039
I'm certain it'll be helpful for both sides.

961
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:19,318
The act of the culprit leaving the mutilated corpse...

962
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:22,019
in a residential area was likely because he wanted to show off.

963
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:24,459
The method of the murder was so violent and highly advanced.

964
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:27,128
It's been over a month since Soo Hyun disappeared.

965
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:29,059
Yet, the whereabouts of the culprit is still...

966
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:34,528
To a profiler, policing doesn't come before examining the minds.

967
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,499
Examining the minds come first.

968
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,769
(Body parts found: both arms, both hands, both legs...)

969
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:42,338
A profiler must detect what happened at the crime scene.

970
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:47,378
There's no meaning in keeping the meeting materials in the team.

971
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:49,619
Why don't we write up a report...

972
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:51,519
and share it with the Investigation Team?

973
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,889
So you want to put together the reasons for our reasoning...

974
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:56,858
and suggest it to them as a possibility?

975
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:58,758
Yes.

976
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,928
There's no meaning in doing this by ourselves.

977
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:03,229
I'm not sure if she'll be convinced.

978
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:05,599
We'll have to try.

979
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:07,428
Shall we?

980
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:13,139
Profiling Report, Changeui-dong Case.

981
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:15,769
The body was mutilated after it was frozen.

982
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:18,039
A mid to large-sized fridge for home was used.

983
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:19,849
The cross-section of the body parts.

984
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,849
The shape and the cross-section show...

985
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,249
the culprit is someone who cuts frozen food.

986
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:27,218
All seven black plastic bags containing the parts were clean.

987
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,919
Two plastic bags were used to pack the body parts.

988
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:30,588
Goodness.

989
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,128
When people sell frozen products,

990
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:36,358
they have a habit of wrapping them in two plastic bags.

991
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:39,159
The culprit likely has a history of selling frozen food...

992
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:41,269
or is currently working...

993
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,898
at a butcher's shop or at a fish shop.

994
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,999
The time elapsed while mutilating the body.

995
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,508
It means he took time to cut her body.

996
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:52,309
If he cut her after freezing her body,

997
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,749
it means he spent a lot of time mutilating her.

998
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:58,448
The culprit either lives alone...

999
00:56:58,979 --> 00:57:00,619
or works alone.

1000
00:57:01,648 --> 00:57:03,488
It would've been too dangerous...

1001
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:05,088
to travel far with a little child.

1002
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,389
In conclusion, the culprit is a man who lives alone,

1003
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,499
but someone who likes to keep things clean.

1004
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,698
If you search his house, it will be neatly organized.

1005
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:16,698
The weapon he used will also be put away neatly.

1006
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:18,499
The crime site and his residence...

1007
00:57:18,499 --> 00:57:20,769
may be within the walking distance...

1008
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:22,769
between the point she went missing to the victim's home.

1009
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:25,479
Abduction, sexual molestation, mutilation,

1010
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:26,948
and abandonment show...

1011
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,378
the culprit's age is between the late 30s to early 40s.

1012
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:32,718
His final education is presumed...

1013
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,789
as a middle school drop out or a middle school graduate.

1014
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:36,858
It may be a person...

1015
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:39,019
who has experience in selling frozen foods such as a butcher,

1016
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:40,858
or a person who does cutting-related work,

1017
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,758
someone who does not work in one place for a long time...

1018
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:44,198
and changes jobs frequently.

1019
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,599
He may currently run a butcher shop, a raw fish restaurant,

1020
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,369
or another restaurant alone.

1021
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:52,398
"If someone abducted a minor for sexual purposes,"

1022
00:57:52,738 --> 00:57:54,608
"he may show characteristics..."

1023
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,709
"that are common to culprits of child rape and murder."

1024
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,909
"He may be an introvert, reserved,"

1025
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:02,709
"and have a sexual complex."

1026
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,249
"Premature ejaculation or impotence?"

1027
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:07,019
How are we going to confirm that?

1028
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,858
So in summary,

1029
00:58:09,858 --> 00:58:13,528
a man with a sexual complex who lives alone...

1030
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:16,128
and likes things neat is probably the culprit. Yes?

1031
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,128
- Yes, sir. - What is this nonsense?

1032
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,798
The victim was abducted at a place...

1033
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,499
difficult to find for those who aren't familiar with the area.

1034
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:26,099
Also, it probably wasn't easy to take the victim far away...

1035
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,039
as she cried and fought back.

1036
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:30,508
These two things tell us that...

1037
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:32,909
the crime site and his residence...

1038
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,108
may be within the walking distance from where she went missing.

1039
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,519
He's the most likely to reside somewhere in that area.

1040
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:43,088
We already searched through the entire neighbourhood.

1041
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:45,318
We did not find anything suspicious.

1042
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,988
The same goes for the butcher shop. We already investigated.

1043
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:52,829
Yes, we did not just sit around.

1044
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,229
Then he must have worked at a butcher shop in the past.

1045
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:56,939
He'll be someone who does not work in one place for a long time...

1046
00:58:56,939 --> 00:58:58,798
and changes jobs frequently.

1047
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:00,209
If that's your theory,

1048
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:03,508
is it possible that the culprit can be someone...

1049
00:59:03,508 --> 00:59:05,778
who takes night shifts at a raw fish restaurant?

1050
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:07,249
It's very likely.

1051
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:10,349
This sounds too vague.

1052
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,619
Look at this in the middle.

1053
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,218
"Abduction, sexual molestation,"

1054
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:15,519
"mutilation, and abandonment show..."

1055
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,588
"the culprit's age is between the late 30s to early 40s."

1056
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,488
"His final education is presumed..."

1057
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:22,128
"as a middle school drop out or a middle school graduate."

1058
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:23,628
If he has a criminal record,

1059
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,459
he may have a record for a crime such as theft...

1060
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:27,099
rather than violence or injury against a person,

1061
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:28,928
then became punished...

1062
00:59:28,928 --> 00:59:30,939
when he was in middle and high school.

1063
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,068
I mean, what's your ground?

1064
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,139
Our ground is the FBI's crime analysis...

1065
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,778
Good grief, you're bringing up those Americans again.

1066
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,249
Hey, you're in Korea,

1067
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,448
where the World Cup will happen in just two years.

1068
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:50,919
Also, he threw out the body parts he cut up...

1069
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:53,428
around the neighbourhood as if he put them on display,

1070
00:59:53,428 --> 00:59:55,289
yet you're saying he's not a smart criminal?

1071
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:56,499
It may look like he put them on display,

1072
00:59:56,499 --> 00:59:58,298
but the biggest reason why he cut her body was...

1073
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,468
that he did not want her to be noticed.

1074
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:03,939
Also, the culprit threw those out in many different areas.

1075
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:06,468
It's almost like that personality type test.

1076
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:09,338
"Blood type B has a feisty and selfish personality."

1077
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:11,108
Isn't it something like that?

1078
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:14,849
I think I trust the blood type personality theory even more.

1079
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,079
What are you...

1080
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,648
Here's one I find the most convincing.

1081
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:21,148
"He may have a sexual complex."

1082
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:23,919
"He either worked around the crime scene..."

1083
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,389
"or resided there."

1084
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:28,459
"He's someone who does not have many close friends."

1085
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:32,398
Most sex offenders are introverted...

1086
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:34,128
and have a sexual complex.

1087
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:36,269
If he targeted a minor instead of a grown woman,

1088
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:38,139
it means he wanted to find...

1089
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,869
an easy target who wouldn't fight him.

1090
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:43,439
We must start investigating sex offenders...

1091
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:45,209
who committed a crime against minors.

1092
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:47,249
My gosh.

1093
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:49,809
Chief Heo.

1094
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,048
It can't happen, can it?

1095
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:55,189
No, we can't do this.

1096
01:00:56,088 --> 01:00:57,318
We have pride here at the Special Crime Squad.

1097
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:00,028
How can I give them an order to investigate by using this report?

1098
01:01:00,528 --> 01:01:01,559
Gil Pyo.

1099
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,959
Chief Heo. You have nothing to lose.

1100
01:01:04,959 --> 01:01:06,568
The least you can do is investigate.

1101
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:08,599
No, we can't do that.

1102
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,298
If we must investigate every single ex-con,

1103
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:14,539
we'll need a lot of manpower too.

1104
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:15,709
Don't you think so?

1105
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,148
Here's what I'm trying to say.

1106
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:26,818
I think it'll be impossible if we try to do this officially.

1107
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:33,019
(Unofficial)

1108
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,128
Just do it unofficially.

1109
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:44,838
Let's end the meeting.

1111
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,838

1113
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,309
Let's give a chance to Behavioural Analysis Team.

1114
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:55,148
If they help our investigation,

1115
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:57,419
we won't lose anything either.

1116
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:00,919
It's an unofficial duty, so you have to move quietly.

1117
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:02,548
I don't think this is the place.

1118
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,289
Oh, Behavioural Analysis Team.

That's right.

1124
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:26,108

1129
01:02:40,988 --> 01:02:42,889
And I don't mess with kids.

Where were you between 12pm to 4pm on May 20?

1131
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:56,068
Ever since I was released, I've kept a low profile.

1132
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:57,108
I'm innocent.

1133

Did something go wrong?

1150
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,439
There's nothing we can do...

1151
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,008
other than cross out the list.

1152
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,678
Don't beat yourself up so much.

1153
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,088
- Excuse me. - Yes, what is it?

1154
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:19,758
Instead of searching the area...

1155
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:21,459
with the list of sex offenders,

1156
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:23,599
why don't we try to find...

1157
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,659
a sex offender who lives alone in the area?

1158
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:28,028
That'll take too long.

1159
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:29,628
He has a point.

1160
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,439
If he recently moved to the area,

1161
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:34,238
we may not find him on our list.

1162
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,568
Yes, I don't think it's a bad idea.

1163
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:39,309
Then let's find a list of men in their 30s and 40s...

1164
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,008
who live alone in the area.

1165

Please give me a list...

1171
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:55,959
of men in their 30s and 40s who live alone in Changeui-dong.

1172

You need to see this.

1178
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,619
These four weren't found on the criminal records database...

1179
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:19,349
at the police agency.

1180
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,148
They registered their move later,

1181
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:22,419
so they weren't caught on the system.

1182
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:25,419
So there were those who got left out.

1183
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:28,229
Yes, we might end up catching the culprit easily.

It's odd that there are only three fingerprints, right?

1208
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,009
He either has a weird grip...
