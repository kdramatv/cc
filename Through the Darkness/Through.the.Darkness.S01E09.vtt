7
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,810
I always had to do this alone.

8
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,009
But the three of you joined me today. Thank you for coming.

9
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:11,620
Gosh. There's no need to thank us.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,720
I'm sure all the victims were loved when they were born.

11
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,420
But seeing how we couldn't even put a name to these victims...

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,890
makes me think life is futile.

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,259
So people don't come here.

14
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:25,602
Thank you for coming today.

15
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:30,883
These victims faced a bitter end after a life of hard work.

16
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:34,753
Please help them, so they could be happy over there.

17
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:37,482
And please give Gu Young Chun a taste of his own medicine.

18
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:42,423
To someone like Gu Young Chun, that's too generous of a punishment.

19
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:47,393
I heard that...

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,333
Captain Yoon has been working...

21
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,462
day and night to find families of those unidentified victims.

22
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,432
But I didn't think she'd come here.

23
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:57,143
Captain Yoon...

24
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,242
isn't cutting her hair for the victims.

25
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,542
Why her hair?

26
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,182
She thinks inconveniencing herself...

27
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:06,143
with long hair is her way of mourning for the victims.

28
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,313
I guess having this sense of guilt...

29
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,022
comes with our job.

(Through the Darkness, Part 2)

31
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:20,022
(Episode 9)

32
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,933
Learning from the unprecedented case...

33
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,163
which resulted in countless victims,

34
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,332
we see the need to set up...

35
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:29,332
a comprehensive, government-wide solution...

36
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,702
for the public good and safety.

37
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,672
To prevent from making the same mistake in the future,

38
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,443
we will put together a manual based on Gu Young Chun's case...

39
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:39,813
for our investigations.

40
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:43,723
We are setting up the structure, so everyone can be informed.

41
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,082
Moreover,

42
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:49,322
police officers who committed grave mistakes...

43
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,362
while investigating the serial killer, Gu Young Chun,

44
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:55,362
were reprimanded to a great extent.

45
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:57,533
With this momentum,

46
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,262
we will strive to close unsolved cases of violent crimes...

47
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,332
by the end of this year.

48
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,202
And we will do our best...

49
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,272
to keep our people safe.

50
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,413
Good luck.

51
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,123
As you all know, we'll be studying...

52
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,292
Gu Young Chun's case.

53
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,322
The serial killer we recently apprehended.

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,862
The public and the higher-ups are criticizing us...

55
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,463
that we didn't catch the killer soon enough.

56
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,633
It's not like we purposely took our time to catch him.

57
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,802
That's right.

58
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:34,973
He went into hiding and didn't leave any evidence.

59
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,102
What were we supposed to do with him?

60
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,142
I know that it's a hassle.

61
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:41,042
But we've never had someone like Gu Young Chun.

62
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,443
If we caught Gu Young Chun sooner,

63
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:46,743
we wouldn't have this many victims.

64
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,482
Was there a problem with the initial investigation?

65
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:50,653
There was.

66
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,922
All the incidents took place in different districts.

67
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:54,922
All the initial investigations were done by different stations.

68
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,452
And putting together the information we had,

69
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:57,522
took a long time.

70
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,693
If we were to reorganize the protocol,

71
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,633
so the Special Crime Squad could investigate initially,

72
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,332
we might be able to lessen the confusion.

73
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,602
Great. What else?

74
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,832
After Gu Young Chun killed...

75
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,272
the wealthy elderly,

76
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,272
he changed his MO.

77
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:15,172
Despite receiving multiple missing persons reports on our victims,

78
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,412
they were categorized as simple runaway cases.

79
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:20,082
It's not possible to file adults missing in our system.

80
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:23,253
There were 11 missing women.

81
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:26,383
The fact that they were excluded from our investigation...

82
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,592
is a problem.

83
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:31,423
And we should recognize that...

84
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,633
our existing investigation method didn't work.

85
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,133
Looking for people who might have held a grudge...

86
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,532
and ex-convicts with similar records...

87
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:40,303
is the first step of our investigation.

88
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,702
How could we ignore that?

89
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:44,543
I'm not saying we should ignore the system.

90
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,972
With Gu Young Chun's case,

91
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,873
it was confirmed that he didn't have any motive.

92
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,642
And we haven't come across this kind of crime before.

93
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:55,183
Therefore, we need to accept new investigation methods.

94
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:58,253
She has a point. I agree with her.

95
00:04:58,553 --> 00:04:59,952
The report from the Behavioral Analysis Team...

96
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:01,452
was spot on once again.

97
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,863
However, it would be prudent for us...

98
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:07,092
to also discuss the risk of only relying...

99
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,793
on the behavioral analysis reports when we investigate.

100
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,633
Here's the most ironic factor of this case.

101
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,103
It was figuring out the murder weapon.

102
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:17,043
Goodness. A hexagon-shaped steel hammer.

103
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,402
Why hadn't we thought of that?

104
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,443
No one uses a steel hammer to kill people.

105
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:23,743
That's why.

106
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,782
Gu Young Chun chose the steel hammer...

107
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,683
so it'd be easy for him to take down his victims.

108
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:30,423
In other words, killing was his sole goal.

109
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:34,123
By controlling his victims, he showed off his power.

110
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,293
And he prepared thoroughly for his killings.

111
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:37,493
"Prepared?"

112
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,423
As I mentioned earlier, he renovated a hammer...

113
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,662
so the job would be easier.

114
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:41,733
(Analysis of Gu Young Chun)

115
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,433
And he took a full-body X-ray...

116
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,032
to study where the body should be severed.

117
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,332
Once he started killing,

118
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,842
the degree of desecration gradually escalated.

119
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,342
So the preparations and the act of desecration...

120
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,813
gave him the thrill.

121
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,443
Correct.

122
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:59,543
So he's not the delusional type who sees hallucinations,

123
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,282
but I'm not sure if he did this with a sense of mission.

124
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,082
I'd say he does exhibit the traits.

125
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:07,392
He did say he committed the murders to root out social evils.

126
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,123
Using such preposterous logic,

127
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,493
he tried to justify what he did.

128
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,733
Power, influence, and money.

129
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,133
This world where the wealthy get rich illegally,

130
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,662
women live promiscuously,

131
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,133
and civil servants live like bugs.

132
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,303
They all have to be punished!

133
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,902
Gu Young Chun.

134
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,582
He could go on about his "sense of mission."

135
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,712
But essentially, he purposely chose weak targets...

136
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,452
whom he could take down easily.

137
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,322
He's just...

138
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,923
a cowardly loser who's all talk.

139

Don't people like me all have the same story?

151
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,092
An abusive father.

152
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:53,363
And no one to lean on. I had a miserable childhood.

153
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,793
So do you blame your father?

154
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:59,303
I bet you have no idea what it's like to live with a dad...

155
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,603
who threatens you with a hammer every time he gets drunk.

156
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,842
I never lived with my father.

157
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,003
He passed away the day I was born.

158
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,142
You're lucky.

159
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,412
Not having one is better than growing up with a father like that.

160
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,082
It's only natural to become all twisted.

161
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:14,883
You think that's the reason?

162
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:17,082
Didn't you say you were a criminal behavioral analyst?

163
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,952
Didn't you hear such a childhood...

164
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,193
could cause you to become a serial killer?

165
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,272
He's just trying to justify himself, like a wimp.

166
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,253
I'm home.

167
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,353
It's getting late.

168
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,323
You're still up?

- Here, have some. - Thanks.

00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,012
I guess I'm getting old. I tossed and turned a little,

174
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,672
and I can't fall asleep anymore.

175
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,042
I made it today. It turned out nicely. Try it.

176
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,312
Okay, thank you. Try to get some sleep.

177
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,833
What's with the booze?

178
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,503
He can't even drink.

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

180
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:50,983
You see, we never agree to interview requests,

181
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,782
but he kept pestering us about it.

182

I didn't know Woo Ju had such a cool friend.

183
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,953
My, what a pretty name. Reporter Choi Yoon Ji.

184
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:01,993
Here, have some coffee.

185
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,762
- Thank you. - How nice is this?

186
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,162
Thanks to Reporter Choi,

187
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,603
we can sit down and enjoy coffee in the office.

188
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,662
Cheers.

189
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,233
- Cheers. - Cheers.

190
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:23,542
- It's good. - It is.

191
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,853
As I mentioned last time... No pictures, please.

192
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:29,883
Oh, this.

193
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:32,522
It's like a soldier's weapon on the battlefield.

194
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,853
I always have it with me wherever I go.

195
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:37,192
I won't be taking any pictures today.

196
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,623
It'll just be a story that introduces the team.

197
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,192
My gosh, why am I nervous?

198
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,032
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

199
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:48,733
- Relax. It'll be like a chat. - Okay, sounds good.

200
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,772
Here's what I was most curious about.

201
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:56,442
Common motives for murder...

202
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,883
include money, lust, hatred,

203
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,012
and revenge, right?

204
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,453
That's right.

205
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,253
However, Gu Young Chun is a serial murderer...

206
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:07,652
who completely deviates from that.

207
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:10,762
What do you think is the reason behind...

208
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,993
such motiveless murders?

209
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,463
Here's what I think.

210
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:17,532
Feelings of social isolation...

211
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:21,973
have been on the rise, and these brutal crimes...

212
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:25,103
are manifestations of blind hatred resulting from that.

213
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,442
- Blind hatred? - Yes.

214
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,412
Profilers aren't psychics.

215
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,512
We analyze the psychological and behavioral patterns...

216
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:33,442
of culprits and assist in investigations...

217
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,152
so they can be caught as soon as possible.

218
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,782
We use accumulated data to analyze such patterns.

219
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:41,292
Interviewing other convicts is a part of that.

220
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:44,062
There are always traces left at crime scenes.

221
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,892
And every murderer leaves a trail.

222
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:47,292
Their behaviors...

223
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,432
show us what their motives are and what they're trying to achieve.

224
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:55,272
That's right. The Forensics Squad...

225
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,343
finds evidence at the scenes.

226
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,843
And we, profilers, analyze the clues and circumstantial evidence...

227
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,243
based on our observations of the scenes.

229

We're analyzing the incidents in southwestern Seoul at the moment.

230
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:10,182
I want to say this to the culprit who will probably read this.

231
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,323
"We'll catch you soon."

232
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,052
I do hope you catch the culprit soon.

233
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,323
I can tell you this one thing for sure.

234
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:21,892
There's no such thing as a perfect crime.

235
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,542
Way to go, Yoon Ji.

236
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,113

237
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:44,152

238
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,692
This article will be a hit.

239
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:50,353
I need to focus.

240
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:52,792
Oh, right. Sorry.

241
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,432
You know how important this article is.

242
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,402
Fix this typo, Yoon Ji.

243
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:01,432

244
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,243

246
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,812
He's not here. You called the Special Crime Squad.

247
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,282
Hello?

248
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,883
May I speak to Inspector Song?

249
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,853
- Who? - Inspector Song Ha Young.

250
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,213

I didn't know it'd go viral like this.

258

I didn't know so many people would read Yoon Ji's article.

259
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,486
The media has such a wide reach.

260
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,126
Maybe it's all thanks to us, the Behavioral Analysis Team.

261
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,827
He has stepped out of the office.

262
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:57,736
I'm afraid I can't give you his number.

263
00:13:58,866 --> 00:13:59,866
Okay.

264

expanding the Forensics Squad into Scientific Investigations Division.

I've been trying to convince those people up above,

295
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:47,077
so don't just say no, and give it a thought first.

296

301
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,917
how do you call that an expansion? It's a reduction.

303
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,157
Yes, you can do it instead.

324
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:56,006
The weapon was a kitchen knife.

325
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,647
The victim was murdered around 2:30am in front of the door,

326
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,716
also with the key in the keyhole.

327

Aren't you coming in?

328
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,786
We start from the outside.

329
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,927
We have to check the environment...

330
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,056
and the structure of the building before we go in.

331
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:14,026
That way, we can infer the reason why the perp chose this place.

332
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,427
We think like the culprit...

333
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:17,667
and try to guess their movement and follow that.

334
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,867
Once we go through this process,

335
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,907
we'll reach the murder scene in the end.

00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,966
So that you can imagine...

337
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:26,907
where the culprit went and ended up running into the victim?

338
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,076
- That's right. - I see.

339
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:30,806
Anyway, how did you receive a report on Guro-gu's case?

340
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,147
They asked for cooperation,

341
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:35,187
so police stations nearby are out here checking similar cases.

342
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,347
We concluded that...

343
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,316
the Imyeong-dong Case wasn't done by Gu Young Chun.

344
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,056
Also, everyone has their eyes on this case...

345
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,756
since the Pureumae Park Case, so they're cooperative.

349

- the air is a bit different. - It is.

350

How is it different?

351

- Let's go inside. - Shall we?

354
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:05,076
The key was in the keyhole.

355
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:08,986
And her bag and wallet were spread out in front of her.

356
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,486
- And the money was still in there? - Yes.

357
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,056
Did he wait for the victim to go into the house?

358
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:15,986
What if she had family at home?

359
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,486
Then his crime would've been exposed.

360
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,357
Would he risk such danger?

361
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:23,466
He's the type who shows his face, so that could be possible,

362
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:24,766
although I don't understand it.

363
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,736
I think there might be another reason.

364
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:28,867
Let's go back, then.

365
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:32,877
First off, he probably chased up the stairs after her.

366
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:37,147
The victim puts the key in. She's about to go inside...

367
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,716
You startled me.

368
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:49,457
I think he hesitated until the moment she went in.

369
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:53,897
The culprit seems aggressive, but he doesn't seem to be bold.

370
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,697
He's rather timid.

371
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,407
Sounds great. Just as you said,

372
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,937
he could have hesitated until the very last minute,

373
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:06,907
then found enough courage in that last moment.

374
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,276
Then what about showing himself...

375
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,016
under the bright light and stuff?

376
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,647
He wasn't showing them his face.

377
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,486
It's the other way around.

378
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,516
He wanted to see the victim.

379
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:22,887
He wanted to check the victim's face before he kills a stranger?

380
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,597
The moment he attacked them,

381
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:27,897
he was looking...

382
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,427
at the victim's facial expression.

383
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,687
- Hey, Woo Ju. - You're here.

384
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:53,687
This is it?

385
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:55,087
- Please print these. - Yes, sir.

386
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,756
- Did you eat dinner? - Yes, I did.

387
00:19:56,986 --> 00:20:00,556
All right, then. Let's start with...

388
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,296
Let's hurry.

389
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:09,736
- Let's see... - Hello.

390
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:10,937
Oh, hello.

391
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,806
Take a look at this record. It says right here...

392
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,617
In that case, this is...

393
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,117
(Prosecutor's Oath)

394
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,607
I'll have to stay here until late at night.

395
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:45,476
Report back to me every now and then if anything comes up.

396
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,837
Sinheung 2-dong and Gocheong-dong.

397
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,647
Two victims both died in front of the door,

398
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,246
with their key in the keyhole.

399
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,076
I believe this shows the culprit hesitated...

400
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:55,786
until the moment the victim went into the house.

401
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,887
If he's a timid guy,

402
00:20:58,187 --> 00:20:59,687
that explains why these victims were...

403
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,357
attacked in front of their house.

404
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,387
Right.

405
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,556
Gocheong-dong Case broke out in April,

406
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,897
so it must be before Pureumae Park Case.

407
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,796
Yes, there were too many cases reported to Dongjak Station,

408
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,097
so they recognized...

409
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,937
the Pureumae Park Case first in the same jurisdiction.

410
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,806
That means the culprit began to use a kitchen knife...

411
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,407
starting with Gocheong-dong.

412
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,407
In that case, the culprit changed the weapon...

413
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:23,246
to make sure he kills the victims, just as we predicted, right?

414
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,677
That's the highest possibility.

415
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,647
Other than the Imyeong-dong case,

416
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:28,117
everything else only lasted in severe injuries.

417
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:31,117
These results probably made the culprit more anxious.

418
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:32,857
And he has evolved.

419
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:36,957
He might have studied the ways just as Gu Young Chun did.

420
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,826
He studied?

421
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:40,796
These people study a lot to kill.

422
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,397
That's why he made the steel hammer himself.

423
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:52,177
These psychos are beyond my imagination.

424
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:54,607
Gocheong-dong is in Guro-gu too.

425
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,776
The cases mostly broke out in the southwestern area.

426
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:59,476
Do you really think he's behind the Imyeong-dong case?

427
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:02,617
We thought about it for a long time.

428
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,187
But look at the subway line. Line One.

429
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:07,957
Like this.

430
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:12,127
Most of these areas are near Subway Line One.

431
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,597
Sometimes Line Two.

432
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,326
We thought the area was within the culprit's usual reach.

433
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,766
He might be someone who lives around Subway Line One.

434
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,266
Gu Young Chun went back and forth...

435
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,806
between the south and the north of the river to confuse us.

436
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,407
He also claimed that he took the subway,

437
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,006
but this man doesn't look that meticulous.

438
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,617
(Hanyung, Line One)

439
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,216
The locations for cases in the southwestern area are...

440
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,486
all in different jurisdictions,

441
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:38,457
but they are all within walking distance.

442
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:39,857
Precisely.

443
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,526
Also, he does not look for his victims before he acts.

444
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,496
He went out at dawn or late at night,

445
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,927
when there aren't many people to spot women who travel alone,

446
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:50,927
then followed them and attacked them ruthlessly.

447
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,407
Man.

448
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:59,207
So we're looking for a psycho who's in the southwestern area,

449
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:00,806
walking around with a knife.

450
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,746
You're right. That's him.

451
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:06,476
What if he fails to find a victim?

452
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:08,687
I'm sure there are many more days when he fails.

453
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,546
If such days continue...

454
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:13,187
As you can see, he changed his weapon.

455
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:17,157
Then he'll change his MO, just as Gu Young Chun did.

456
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:09,476
He changed his weapon...

457
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,677
from a camping knife to a kitchen knife.

458
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:13,417
What will it be next?

(Profiling Report)

460
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,016
Will it be a steel hammer, just like Gu Young Chun?

(Gocheong-dong Murder Case)

462

(Date and Time, Location)

463
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:28,266
He studied his crimes,

464
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,927
and his MO evolved.

465
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,837
He's timid.

466
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:38,207
He hides in an alley and looks for a victim.

467
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,546
But he's aggressive enough to watch his victim in pain...

468
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,877
as he attacks them.

469
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,226
What will it be next?

470
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:58,996
Where will he be?

471
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,026
How far will he go?

472
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:03,226
Inspector Song?

473
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,736
You're here.

474
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:11,466
I thought you were staying at the prosecution all night.

475
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,437
We got done much faster than I expected, so I stopped by.

476
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:19,046
I read the case file on the Gocheong-dong Case.

477
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,587
And this is the profile report.

478
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:25,556
I'll share this with the Special Crime Squad tomorrow.

479
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,457
"The culprit is introverted because he lacks the ability..."

480
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:32,397
"to make social connections."

481
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,197
I remember that you made a similar analysis...

482
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:37,996
with Cho Hyun Gil a few years ago.

483
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,197
Is that correct?

484
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:40,536
Yes.

485
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:42,867
Back then, you said that he chose young kids because...

486
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:46,337
they wouldn't be repelled by him and then sexually assaulted them.

487
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:48,947
That was the reason you gave us to support your claim.

488
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,006
Then what about this guy?

489
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,417
It's similar.

490
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:55,117
I concluded that he didn't have the social skills...

491
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,046
or the guts to lure his victims.

492
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:00,357
That sounds plausible.

493
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,387
After all, he mostly followed his victims at the scene.

494
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:04,687
Right.

495
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:07,427
But what worries me is that...

496
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:10,127
his MO is progressing.

497
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:11,867
It's progressing.

498
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:15,066
We need to increase the range of similar cases we investigate.

499
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,466
Right. But...

500
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:20,407
there seem to be a lot of hypotheticals again.

501
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:23,447
It will be difficult to make them understand why...

502
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,447
and how many more cases...

503
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:27,417
we should include in our investigation.

504
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:29,887
If we hesitate and delay implementing these changes,

505
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,516
there will be more victims.

506
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:34,716
The Special Crime Squad wants to catch the culprit...

507
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,226
as soon as possible too.

510
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:43,867
That's not what I was doing.

511
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,036
It's likely that he will move on...

512
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,566
to breaking and entering or arson.

513
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,736
- Arson? - Serial killers enjoy...

514
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,006
setting things on fire.

515
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,806
It's an easy way to satisfy their urges.

516
00:26:58,006 --> 00:26:59,417
And one more thing.

517
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,147
Being timid during the act...

518
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,246
is his unique factor.

in a low-rise apartment in Gocheong-dong.

in front of the door with the key in the keyhole.

He speculated the culprit might break in and commit arson.

I'm not so sure if it's the right call...

539
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:09,647
to put serial killers and arsonists in the same group.

540
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,887
He said serial killers are used to committing arson.

541
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,587
But still. This is too big of a range for us to investigate.

542
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:16,687
Right.

543
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:19,296
Then we have to investigate all the violent crimes we have.

This is Yoon Tae Gu of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

547
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:36,806
Please share any break-in and arson cases with us.

548
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:40,377
But only when the culprit doesn't take any valuables or money.

549
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:42,587
Hold on.

550
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:48,087
Please include cases as long as the amount isn't big.

551
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,427
What are these?

552
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,066
He keeps changing his weapon.

553
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,796
He used a kitchen knife after a camping knife.

554
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:00,637
I'm sure he'll change his weapon again.

555
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,367
Put them away after you study them.

556
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,137
They are just tools.

557
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,306
But they look creepy in this office.

558
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,516

559
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,016
What are you doing?

560
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:20,857
- To become him. - To become him?

561
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:22,657
I will become the culprit.

563
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:41,976

in order to proactively handle criminal cases...

565
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:45,216
that target random people...

566
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,117
just like the recent serial murder case.

567
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:49,947
The police agency set up an investigation support center...

568
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:51,746
to prepare for the violent crimes...

569
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,887
and decided to reform the Special Crime Squads...

570
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,957
into Wide-Area Investigation Squads.

572
00:29:58,427 --> 00:30:01,796
you ought to drink beer and soju together, Gil Pyo.

573
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:04,127
- Gosh. - Here you go.

574
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:06,597
- That's enough. - What are you talking about? Here.

Superintendent Heo Gil Pyo of Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

580
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,617
Too bad that you won't get to see me now.

581
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,187
What are you talking about?

582
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:31,726
I'm finally going to have good bowel movements. I feel great.

583
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:33,957
When you go to Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, shave your chin.

584
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,226
Try to look clean.

585
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,197
You can get here in 50 minutes from Gyeonggi Province.

586
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:39,296
Doesn't it mean you can visit us when you want to?

587
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,437
No, it takes longer with the traffic jam.

588
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:43,707

- Of course, not. - Right.

594
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:55,216
Exactly. Gil Pyo won't forget us.

595
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,746
Good work.

596
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:02,786
By the way, you lost a lot of weight, Inspector Song.

597
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:04,056
- Me? - Yes.

598
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:06,897
I don't know. I just don't have an appetite these days.

599
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:09,526
- Here. Eat a lot. - That's not good.

600

You and Young Soo will be so busy that you wished you had two bodies.

601
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:16,236
I don't think you're in any position to worry about others.

602

You know what? I'm sure Superintendent Heo...

603
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:21,177
and Captain Kook will do a fine job.

Gosh. I don't like changes.

606

608
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:31,786
Goodness. It sounds like Chief Cook. Cook as in chef.

610
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:34,657
I'll get going first.

611
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:37,127
- Are you going to the scene? - Yes.

612
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,526
Yes. If you have work to do, don't feel bad. You can go.

613
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,427
- Let me go with you. - No. I'll go alone. Stay here.

614
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:45,496
- I'm sorry. Please excuse me. - Sure.

615

I'm sorry. I'm from the police.

We talked about a strange man...

619
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,556
walking around our building at night during the resident meeting.

620

Can't you be considerate of people who actually live here?

621

- I'm sorry. - Don't just stand there.

622

If you're done, get out of here.

623

Okay.

624
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,496
If you're sorry, you wouldn't be doing this.

625
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,496

626
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:54,496

- Goodbye. - See you.

Hey.

640
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,582
You're just getting home.

641
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,491
Your mother should go to sleep soon.

642
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:01,062
So I'll leave after I nag you for a bit.

643
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:06,931
- Please sit. - Okay.

644
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:12,201
Goodness.

645
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,411
It is good to be focused on work,

646
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,641
but it is important to separate work from home.

647
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:23,551
I know, I should.

648
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:25,622
But it's not easy.

649
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:27,522
I live alone, so it's a different story.

650
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:29,591
But you live with your mother.

651
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:32,062
If you leave these case files wide open on your desk...

652
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:34,261
She'll be worried.

653
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:37,332
She has a good understanding of what I do.

654
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:38,761
That is different...

655
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,632
from how concerned she must be as a mother.

656
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,772
You need to learn to pay attention to how the people around you...

657
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,272
must be feeling.

658
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,772
Thank you for the advice...

659
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:53,542
and also for your nagging.

660
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,451
But must you do this at this time of night?

661
00:34:58,852 --> 00:34:59,922
Good point.

662
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:03,491
I should get going before you kick me out.

663
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:06,321
- Captain Kook. - Tidy up a little.

664
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:07,891
I'm off.

665
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:16,931
I'll try.

666
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:19,701
Of course, you should.

667
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,042
We're in this for the long haul.

668
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:24,241
Right.

669
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:25,841
- Bye. - Bye.

670
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:27,312
- Get home safely. - Will do.

671
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:34,352
Thirteen murders that took place in the metropolitan area...

672
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:37,491
in the past two years still remain unsolved.

673
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:39,522
At this rate, they'll most likely...

674
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:42,591
become cold cases where the killers remain uncaught.

675
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,361
The murders of the three women in southwestern Seoul,

676
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:48,872
which began in April, still remain unsolved.

677
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:49,931
The police have announced...

678
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,641
that they would investigate missing person cases,

679
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,602
but the decline of public trust in the police is evident.

680
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:58,042
Since there is no evidence of sexual assault,

681
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,781
the police are investigating the incidents...

682
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:02,982
as simple mugging cases or attacks caused by resentment.

683
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:19,462
It seems that the culprit usually uses Subway Line One.

684
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:23,632
Most of the Southwestern Cases...

685
00:36:23,632 --> 00:36:26,172
took place late at night or after midnight.

686
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,111
If he fails to find a target...

687
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,882
He attacks right before his victims enter their homes knowing the risk,

688
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:16,091
because he's obsessed with murder.

689
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,161
- Why are you getting home so late? - You're still up?

690
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,261
I was so worried. Come on in.

691
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:29,002
So he won't give up...

692
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,402
until his day is over.

00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:19,252
Would you like a bottle of juice?

695
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:46,641
Ma'am.

696
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,911
Anybody around? There's a woman collapsed on the ground.

697
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,082
Anybody around?

698
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,721
Hello, you've reached...

699
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:58,962
the Behavioral Analysis Team at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

700
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:00,922
Inspector Song Ha Young?

701
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:03,062
What is it about?

702
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,292
Gunpo Police Station?

703
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:08,462
I see. Fax us the details. I'll pass it along.

704
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:11,772
Gunpo? Is it about a new case?

705
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:13,102
Yes, they think...

706
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:16,042
it could be a serial case. They want us to take a look.

707
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:27,522
(Facial Composite)

708
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,801
The victims in both cases...

709
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,942
were stabbed in the stomach with the same weapon.

710
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:48,971
Near Geumyang Station and Gunpo Station,

711
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,042
both on Subway Line One.

712
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:51,511
What kind of weapon?

713
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:53,312
The pathologist believes that it was a fruit knife.

714
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:55,951
Those blades are less than 10cm long.

715
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:58,082
Just like camping knives.

716
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:00,721
And no money or valuables were stolen?

717
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,152

Looks a lot like the culprit in the Southwestern Cases.

(Facial Composite)

721
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:28,542
The cases in Gunpo...

722
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,451
took place at around 6am and 5:40am.

723
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:34,022
There was a huge risk of being seen,

724
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:35,252
but he took the risk regardless.

725
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:38,692
A while ago, you mentioned something about timid aggression.

726
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:40,161
Could that have something to do with this?

727
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:42,761
Yes. He's timid, so he prefers to do it...

728
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:45,462
when people aren't out and around, but he did this in the morning.

729
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,031
It shows us that he's aggressive and is willing to take a risk...

730
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,332
just to kill.

731
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,071
He was probably on his way home...

732
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:53,442
after failing to find a suitable victim...

733
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:55,741
when he ran into the juice lady near his residence.

734
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:59,582
In other words, he was determined to kill.

735
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:02,082
Yes, at all costs.

736
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,382
Why don't you call Gil Pyo and ask him...

737
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:06,852
to share the reports on the cases that occurred in Gyeonggi Province?

738
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:09,391
Then we'd be able to find more similar cases.

739
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:11,221
That's no problem at all,

740
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,922
but there will be a ton of reports.

741
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:16,161
We'll start with the ones that took place within the year.

742
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:17,861
We'll give it a shot.

For the first time,

780
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:04,292
I'm starting to wonder if what I did was right.

781
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:07,221
I was merely trying...

782
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:11,792
to put myself into the culprit's shoes.

783
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,462
It's better not to know if you have to wield a weapon just like them.

784
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,002
I was not trying to harm anyone.

785
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:18,272
But you were a threat.

786
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:22,511
I know it is important to think in their shoes.

787
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:24,611
But this method is too dangerous.

788
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:27,011
Look at you.

789
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:29,252
Just take a look at yourself right now.

790
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:32,451
Looking into those punks' minds? It's all good.

791
00:45:34,422 --> 00:45:35,482
But before that...

792
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:39,261
Take care of yourself first. Please.

793
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:41,062
Whenever I think about those punks strutting down the streets...

794
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:43,132
and killing innocent people...

795
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:52,031
At night these days,

796
00:45:53,672 --> 00:45:55,672
I'm reminded of the victims' faces.

797
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:57,841
So out of all the methods, this is the one you chose?

798
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:03,281
Do you have to kill someone too to catch those punks?

799
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:11,221
You seem very unstable right now.

800
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:13,922
I just want to catch them as quickly as possible. That's it.

801
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:15,861
I feel like that responsibility...

802
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,692
is weighing you down too much.

803
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:21,732
I also feel like you have gotten more impatient...

804
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,772

at a house in Mogu-dong, Gwanak-gu at dawn today.

00:50:23,012 --> 00:50:25,472
The mother and father who slept in the master bedroom evacuated.

829
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:28,612
But the daughter who was sleeping in the other room was found dead.

830
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:31,851
The police are taking note of the fact that there are traces...

831
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,382
of the victim being bludgeoned in the head multiple times.

832
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:36,322
They've started investigating with the possibility...

833
00:50:36,322 --> 00:50:39,222
that the culprit started the fire to cover up the murder.

834
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:43,262

(Crime scene stepping plates)

836
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:46,786
He wasn't after their valuables.

837
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,156
Right, since cash or expensive jewelry...

838
00:50:49,156 --> 00:50:50,826
are usually kept in the master bedroom.

839
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,897
- You're here. - Hello.

840
00:50:58,567 --> 00:50:59,936
I think it started from here.

841
00:51:01,697 --> 00:51:03,366
He stood here and hesitated.

842
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:06,377
What was he hesitating about?

843
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:14,647
If it were me...

844
00:51:19,386 --> 00:51:22,257
Hey, what do you mean, "If it were me?"

845
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:29,056
If I was the culprit,

846
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,127
I would have headed towards the small room first.

847
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:34,436
Timid aggression.

848
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:37,306
It's the signature of the culprit from the Southwestern Case.

849
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,706
Do you think it's the same guy with the Southwestern Case?

850
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:41,237
Yes.

(Crime scene stepping plates)

852
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:56,627
Usually, there are children...

853
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:59,726
in the smaller rooms.

854
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:03,826
Yes, that's true.

Chief Kook.

859
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:47,277
I received a call from Gwanak Police Station asking for your team.

860
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,677
- They called you first? - Yes, they did.

861
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:51,706
Those guys are at a loss,

862
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:53,246
so I think they are curious.

863
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:56,346
Go with Inspector Song...

864
00:52:56,346 --> 00:52:59,116
and brief them on the profiling analysis you made.

865
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,956
Gosh, I wonder if they'll even listen to us.

866
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:02,257
I'm not sure.

867
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:04,826
They may not be too welcoming of it since it's their first time.

868
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:06,056
But I'm sure the two of you will do fine.

869
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:08,427
- Okay, we'll do our best. - All right.

870
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:10,467
(Seoul Gwanak Police Station)

871
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,967
We speculate that the culprit for Mogu-dong and Southwestern Case...

872
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,467
is the same guy.

873
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:17,107
And he used many different weapons and used them repeatedly.

874
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:19,677
On top of that, he's used to walking and running.

875
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:22,476
He walked to the murder scenes, so he's probably in sneakers.

876
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:25,406
He probably hid his weapon somewhere.

877
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:26,576
How do you know?

878
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:29,016
It depends on how you attack someone,

879
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:31,116
but weapons that can kill are usually big and sharp,

880
00:53:31,116 --> 00:53:32,386
so they're noticeable.

881
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:34,786
It would've been tough for him to carry it around.

882
00:53:34,786 --> 00:53:37,257
However, there is a high possibility that he carries around...

883
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:39,496
small weapons like a camping knife.

884
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:42,797
Also, his murder attempts weren't successful every time,

885
00:53:42,797 --> 00:53:44,897
so do look into insignificant cases of violence...

886
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:46,197
that break out at night.

887
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:48,697
Who does he think he is to give us a sermon? Isn't that right?

888
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:49,906
Right.

889
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:53,036
He was in the newspaper too, so let's hear him out first.

890
00:53:53,636 --> 00:53:57,246
The culprit is probably around 35 years old.

891
00:53:57,246 --> 00:53:59,346
Man, is he a shaman or what?

892
00:54:00,346 --> 00:54:02,277
- Exactly. - Wild guesses?

893
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:04,317
Why is he in mid-30s?

894

Behavioral Analysis Team...

895
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:10,527
turned over 1,000 violent crimes...

896
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:12,027
and cases of violence into data.

897
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:13,056
Hey, wait.

898
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:14,797
Over 1,000 cases?

899
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:17,467
And we've interviewed over 200 criminals.

900
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,297
- What? - Over 200?

901
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,167
We used this data and put together the cases of random killings,

902
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,507
and most of the culprits were...

903
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:26,607
between 33 to 37 years old.

904
00:54:27,536 --> 00:54:28,936
So he isn't just a shaman, after all.

905
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:32,246
In order for his anger to blow up,

906
00:54:32,246 --> 00:54:33,947
he should at least be in his early 30s...

907
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:35,677
to have enough social provocation.

908
00:54:35,677 --> 00:54:38,987
Don't people in their 20s blow up in anger more often?

909
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:40,956
- Young people's vigor is scarier. - Right.

910
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:42,386
- You're right. - Younger people.

911
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:45,587
People in their 20s tend to be more impulsive with their emotions.

912
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:49,197
However, no, perhaps that's why their crimes are...

913
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:52,567
mostly random, without a plan or bringing changes into their MO.

914
00:54:52,967 --> 00:54:54,996
- What? - He has a point.

915
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:58,467
The said culprit lacks social skills.

916
00:54:58,467 --> 00:54:59,777
So if you talk to him,

917
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:03,906
there is a high possibility that he'll avoid your eyes.

918
00:55:04,406 --> 00:55:07,417
- Get it out there. - Yes, go out in a hurry.

919
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,147
- Do we look into those cases? - Yes.

920
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:11,547

(Childhood, Crime Preparation)

986
01:01:49,987 --> 01:01:51,386
I have a question.

987
01:01:51,786 --> 01:01:53,147
The analysis results on his childhood...

988
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:56,627
and the serial killer's emotional and cognitive thinking are...

989
01:01:56,726 --> 01:01:59,456
all shared by criminals,

990
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:01,857
as we can see on our interview reports.

991
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:04,996
Then if we put these characteristics together,

992
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:07,496
can we find the possibility someone might become a monster later on?

993
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,706
That's the most troubling area.

994
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:14,076
For example, arson and animal abuse...

995
01:02:14,076 --> 01:02:17,047
that are spotted after a certain age are...

996
01:02:17,246 --> 01:02:19,007
also considered as signs of a potential serial killer.

997
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,817
Gu Young Chun's childhood does match with the theory,

998
01:02:21,817 --> 01:02:24,317
but I'm not sure if we should include this.

999
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:25,516
You're right.

1000
01:02:25,516 --> 01:02:28,217
He experienced a lack of support as a child,

1001
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:30,156
but not everyone like him turns into a criminal.

1002
01:02:30,726 --> 01:02:32,527
Some people end up becoming stronger.

1003
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,697
I went through a lot because we were dirt-poor.

1004
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:37,866
But I grew up into a detective, not a criminal.

1005
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,697
And I grew up with a single mother.

1006
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,507
Do you think monsters are born...

1007
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:45,806
or made?

1008
01:02:46,536 --> 01:02:47,636
I'm not sure.

1009
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:50,547
If such lives are already decided from the moment they're born,

1010
01:02:51,447 --> 01:02:53,346
it just seems too unfair and cruel.

1011
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:56,647
Life has always been unfair.

1012
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:00,956
At times, when I am sitting there with criminals,

1013
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:04,357
I begin to want to believe that people are born evil.

1014
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:09,357
"He must have always been that evil. There's no way he was once good."

1015
01:03:11,127 --> 01:03:13,067
And if such people are made,

1016
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:15,866
our world will seem hopeless.

1017
01:03:20,136 --> 01:03:22,007
But if the world is responsible for creating monsters,

1018
01:03:22,877 --> 01:03:24,507
it should share the responsibility too.

1019
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:26,306
Right.

1020
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,846
I wonder what kind of environment they grew up in...

1021
01:03:29,547 --> 01:03:30,947
to become such monsters.

1022
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,417
I'm leaning toward believing that people are born evil,

1023
01:03:34,556 --> 01:03:36,056
but a bigger part of me wants to believe...

1024
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:37,556
that people are inherently good.

1025
01:03:38,927 --> 01:03:41,627
"One's perception of others determines..."

1026
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:43,726
"whether people are inherently good or evil."

1027
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:45,667
That's what I heard.

1028
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:48,737
Then it means I haven't given up hopes...

1029
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:49,797
on people, right?

1030
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:53,306
What about you?

1031
01:03:55,576 --> 01:03:57,806
I don't think what we are born with matters.

1032
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:01,576
It's important to remember...

1033
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:05,217
that these decisions were made by us, not by other people.

1034
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:08,886
Right. Whether or not our world has monsters,

1035
01:04:10,886 --> 01:04:14,456
it's important to remember that anyone can become one.

1036
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:20,297
Gosh. It's been four years since our team was formed.

1037
01:04:23,136 --> 01:04:24,737
A part of me is concerned too.

1038

Don't go in too deep.

1039
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,147
If you go in too deep,

1040
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:35,076
you might fall into that hole.

1042
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:45,786

01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:47,096
We didn't find any luminol reaction.

1044
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:49,096

1045
01:04:49,096 --> 01:04:51,467
We won't be forced to release him, right?

1046
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:53,496
This jerk. He's no joke.

1047

Do you want to hear my story?

1049
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:59,406
I couldn't talk to anyone about this. I was so frustrated.

1050
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:02,737
People who are fighting monsters must be careful, so they don't...

1051
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:03,806
turn into monsters.

1052
01:05:03,806 --> 01:05:05,607
You don't have to shoulder all the burden on your own.

1053
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:08,016
If I was going to run away, I wouldn't have started.
