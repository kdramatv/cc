6
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,671
That's too blurry.

7
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,042
That won't be enough...

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,372
for us to confirm if the woman next to him is...

9
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,237
the missing woman or not.

10
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:42,737
Come on. You guys have good eyes. Take a closer look at him.

11
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,038
We just installed those cameras,

12
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:45,978
so they're better than what we're used to.

13
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:47,877
Young Soo kept pushing for them too.

14
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:49,307
It's blurry,

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,978
but the vehicle was spotted...

16
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:54,447
around the locations where the women went missing.

17
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,788
Detective Nam, did you run the license plate?

18
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,118
I put in a request for tech support.

19
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:01,858
We used the security cameras to track him on the same night.

20
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:04,957
But we couldn't track him after the 5km mark.

21
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:10,767
We can suspect that he probably went to someplace secluded.

22
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,998
If he's our guy,

23
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:15,567
he probably abandoned the body right away.

24
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:23,977
Yes.

25
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:26,418
Woo Ho Sung?

26
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:28,688
Okay.

27
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:31,457
A 38-year-old man, Woo Ho Sung.

28
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:32,817
They faxed us the information...

29
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,257
- of the vehicle owner. - Okay.

30
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:43,198
The vehicle owner is Woo Ho Sung, a 38-year-old man.

31
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,097
He works at an acupressure massage parlor.

32
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:49,037
Why does he look so normal? This is so creepy.

33
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:52,537
People who seem so normal are good at scamming people.

34
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,608
Shouldn't we check his alibi first?

35
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,548
I'll take Detective Nam with me.

36
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,418
- Okay. - All right. Then...

37
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,317
can you pay attention to his reaction...

38
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,117
when you meet him for the first time?

39
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,388
- Sure. - I already know.

40
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,158
I bet he'll say he didn't do it.

41
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:09,088
He'll probably deny everything even if he did it.

42
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:10,898
Right. He'll deny it.

43
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,097
Captain Yoon. That's why...

44
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:16,428
I need you to check if he's angry or calm when you question him.

45
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,037
Pay attention to the subtle changes in his attitude or the way he talks.

46
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,808
Having these answers will help us with our interrogation strategy.

47
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,577
You got it.

48
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,977
To women, he's still a stranger.

49
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,218
No matter how approachable he seems,

50
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:32,748
women would still be a bit hesitant to get into his car, right?

51
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:33,847
Right.

52
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,588
And women tend to be more cautious especially at night...

53
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:38,817
no matter how kind they seem.

54
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:40,287
If he didn't force them to get in,

55
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,257
it's likely that he made...

56
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:46,498
these women feel guilty about turning down his kindness.

57
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,627
He made them feel guilty by pretending to be kind?

58
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,167
This jerk is unbelievable.

59
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,507
This guy could skip town for all we know.

60
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,167
- So be careful. - Okay.

61
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:56,808
We'll be back.

62
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,438
Call us if there's anything.

63
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,877
- Okay. - We'll call you.

64
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:01,178
- Thank you. - Sure.

65
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:18,398
I think this is the place.

66
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,528
- I'll check if there's an exit. - Okay.

68
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:29,408
None, right?

69
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,838
Even if he runs, he has to come out here.

70
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:32,208
Okay. Let's go inside.

72
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,507
- Hello. - Welcome.

73
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:40,018
Do you have an appointment?

74
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,347
We're from the Wide-Area Investigation Squad...

75
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,887
at Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

76
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,887
Our business isn't illegal.

77
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,458
We're here to see Mr. Woo Ho Sung.

78
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:49,827
He's here, right?

79
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:52,827
Why do the police want to see him?

80
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,697
Could you bring him out?

81
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,338
He's with a customer now.

82
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,537
Then we'll wait here.

83
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:03,637
But your customers will come and go. You're okay with that, right?

84
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,877
Please wait.

85
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:07,977
Sure.

86
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:16,857
There.

87
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,357
Is that a wig? I can't see his face clearly.

88
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,028
How do his hands look to you?

89
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,237
You wanted to see me?

90
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,268
Mr. Woo Ho Sung?

91
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,408
Yes. That's me.

92
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,648
Could we step out for a moment? We have some questions.

93
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:45,677
We can talk here.

94
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,047
Let's do this outside.

95
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,888
No. I'm sorry. My customer is waiting for me inside.

96
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:54,328
It's fine. Let's talk here.

97
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,597
Where were you on February 23 from 7pm to 10pm?

98
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,268
And what were you doing that day?

99
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,138
Why do you ask?

100
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:12,607
We need to verify your alibi for a case we're working on.

101
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:18,318
Did I do something wrong,

102
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:20,318
Detective Yoon?

103
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,787
On the night of February 23,

104
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,057
a woman in her 20s went missing in Gunpo.

105
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,458
That's the case we're investigating now.

106
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:35,568
And your vehicle was caught on the security camera...

107
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,867
in the area where the victim was.

108
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:40,737
My goodness. I didn't know about that.

109
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,378
February 23... Was that Thursday?

110
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,537
It was last Friday.

111
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,847
I see. Friday. Then, on February 23,

112
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:52,617
my shift must have ended before 5pm.

113
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:53,917
Right?

114
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:58,117
Yes. That's correct. Take a look.

115
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:03,028
(Woo Ho Sung: Kang Dong Su, Kim Ju Hyun, Choi Hye Rim...)

116
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,128
- I see. - I had dinner around here...

117
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:09,497
with my girlfriend. And then I went home.

118
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:15,768
And my girlfriend also happens to live in Gunpo.

119
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:19,307
There are dangerous people in the world.

120
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,708
So I can never let her go alone. I always drop her off.

121
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,617
And I drove her home that night as always.

122
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,388
I don't remember the exact time,

123
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,787
but I was home around 10pm.

124
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:38,828
Could we get your girlfriend's phone number?

125
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,068
I can't.

126
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,367
Am I obligated by law to give you her number?

127
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:51,278
I don't want my girlfriend to worry.

128
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,047
Then how about this?

129
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:58,448
You can check my alibi at the restaurant we went that day.

130
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,287
I made a reservation before going.

131
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,518
Check it yourself.

132
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,528
What if we go there and ask them, but...

133
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,927
Go check first.

134
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,458
If you still can't confirm my alibi,

135
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,097
I'll give you her number then.

136
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,198
Is that all?

137
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,737
I have to get back to work.

138
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,977
Thank you for your cooperation.

139
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:24,977
You're welcome.

140
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,677
- Thank you. Take care. - You too.

141
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:35,617
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

142
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:40,787
I'll give you ten extra minutes to make up for it.

143
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:59,307
(Through the Darkness, Part 2)

144
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:03,047
(Episode 12)

145
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:05,518
If we combed through the entire area...

146
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,487
but didn't find additional bodies,

147
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,888
it means he buried them elsewhere.

148
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,057
Like the sixth case,

149
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,617
it must be a place that can't easily be found.

150
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,927
We have to ask him about it when we interview him.

151
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,727
The sixth victim, Yoon Jin Sil,

152
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,828
was abducted in Anyang.

153
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:21,167
Then Woo Ho Sung buried her...

154
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,797
on his way home to Ansan.

155
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,838
And his place isn't far from the bank where money...

156
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,607
was withdrawn from the account of An Yu Yeon, the seventh victim.

157
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,278
He doesn't live far from where the other victims went missing,

158
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,937
assuming that he was driving.

159
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,008
On top of that, his vehicle was caught on camera,

160
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,317
heading in the same direction that the culprit must've gone.

161
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,217
Woo Ho Sung is our prime suspect.

162
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,087
Woo Ho Sung, that scumbag.

163
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,988
It's possible that he's also committed insurance scams.

164
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,768
I'm Detective Nam from the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency.

165
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,037
Did someone named Woo Ho Sung have a reservation here?

166
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,067
Woo Ho Sung? What's his phone number?

167
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,378
That is him.

168
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,878
(Woo Ho Sung)

169
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:11,648
Yes, Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency...

170
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,287
It's Detective Yoon.

171
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,687
Hang on. Let me put you on speakerphone.

172
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,388
Go ahead.

173
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:22,258
Does he have an alibi?

174
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:26,258
He said he had dinner with his girlfriend that evening.

175
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:29,327
After that, he drove her home.

176
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:31,967
Detective Nam went to the restaurant to check.

177
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:35,108
- What's his attitude like? - He seemed self-assured.

178
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,207
And he's confident.

179
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:41,348
He also seemed relaxed.

180
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,118
He sounds polite and has good manners,

181
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,417
so I can see the victims letting their guard down easily...

182
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:51,817
after a few awkward moments upon encountering a stranger.

183
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,128
You haven't checked his car, have you?

184
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,787
We can't search his car without a warrant.

185
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,457
If we aren't careful,

186
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,398
he may try to destroy evidence,

187
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,827
so we'll wait until he gets off work...

188
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:04,537
and check naturally when he's getting into his vehicle.

189
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,408
How did it go?

190
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:14,207
He was actually at the restaurant that evening.

191
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:16,447
He did have a reservation under his name that evening,

192
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,417
and I checked the CCTV footage too.

193
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,687
The woman he was with wasn't the one who was missing.

194
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,717
I think it really was his girlfriend.

195
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:28,528
- Goodbye. - Bye.

196
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,368
Wait, Ho Sung.

197
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,498
What did the detectives want?

198
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,868
I think there was a misunderstanding about something.

199
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:40,967
How could they suspect you, of all people?

200
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:44,077
- It's all cleared up now. - Good.

201
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:50,478
Darn...

202
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,717
He's clearly different from those who don't have the ability...

203
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,988
to lure their victims or those who launch...

204
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,457
random motiveless attacks.

205
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,217
On top of his expensive car...

206
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:03,287
and likable face, he has a way with words.

207
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,158
He used all those things...

208
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:07,998
to find and lure his victims.

209
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:09,967
He knows that it works.

210
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,537
That's where Woo Ho Sung's confidence comes from.

211
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:14,567
That's right.

212
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,408
Yes, Wide-Area Investigation Squad...

213
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,148
It's... Hey, hold on.

214
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,278
Go ahead.

215
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,348
We have confirmed his alibi that he had dinner...

216
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,817
with his girlfriend that evening.

217
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,618
Do we know what else he did that night?

218
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,917
Detective Moon at Anyang Station looked into it,

219
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:36,187
but there's nothing on his call log after 7pm that evening.

220
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,358
We checked all the cameras near his home,

221
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,498
and he got home at around 1am.

222
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,868
He told us that he got home at around 10pm.

223
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:52,408
We need to go and check.

224
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:53,978
I wish we could search his house now.

225
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,748
Our priority is to secure concrete evidence.

226
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,478
If we put in a request for a search and seizure warrant now,

227
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:00,988
the prosecutors will laugh at us.

228
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,287
- It won't be issued. - Chief Park.

229
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,518
We'll wait here until Woo Ho Sung gets off work...

230
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,228
and ask him to voluntarily come into the station.

231
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:09,957
I'll call you back.

232
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:15,467
Goodness. Even if we request a warrant now,

233
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,037
we won't get it tonight.

234
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,878
Okay, fine.

235
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,748
I'll speak with Superintendent Heo.

236
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,648
I'm getting a bad feeling.

237
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:31,947
(Name, Woo Ho Sung)

238
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:33,848
We need a search and seizure warrant...

239
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,518
for Woo Ho Sung's vehicle and residence.

240
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:37,988
We must secure evidence as soon as possible.

241
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:41,988
It's also possible that he committed insurance scams in the past.

242
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:44,297
Insurance scams? What did he do?

243
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,457
In 2005,

244
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,797
his wife and mother-in-law died in a fire.

245
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,037
The life insurance payouts he got...

246
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,467
were almost 400,000 dollars in total.

247
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:53,837
What? 400,000 dollars?

248
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:58,008
He had signed up for various life insurance policies.

249
00:12:58,008 --> 00:13:00,608
But the insurance companies must've deemed it legitimate...

250
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:01,978
for him to have received the money.

251
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,917
On what grounds are we suspecting him?

252
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,417
Even with Gu Young Chun and Nam Ki Tae,

253
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,417
we found evidence in their homes.

254
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,087
We cannot let this scumbag buy time.

255
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,518
Not even another moment.

256
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,228
He'll destroy all evidence.

257

We'll continue to keep a close watch on you.

283
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,937

00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,248
so may I visit the station sometime tomorrow morning?

288
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:41,868
Sure.

- Yes. - Okay.

and he also has a luring mechanism in his car.

313
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,788

357
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,777
Do you understand?

358
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,048
He's confident, just as I expected.

359
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,788
He knew we'd get suspicious of him for setting his car on fire.

360
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,917
But he still chose to do that to get rid of the evidence.

361
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,588
We pressured him to go talk at the police station,

362
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,757
so he got anxious and made the wrong choice.

363
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,427
I think he wanted to play the victim.

364
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:16,767
But he was in a hurry,

365
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:19,068
so he must have resorted to something he was used to.

366
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:22,638
He forgot that he was under suspicion for arson...

367
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:23,868
and insurance fraud.

368
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,477
Does he think the police are a joke?

369
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,808
As if we wouldn't have looked over that.

370
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,177
Anyway, I guess he was the type who thinks he's smarter than others.

371
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,717
He tripped over his own feet.

372
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,588
Let's go inside.

373
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:41,658
You haven't figured out anything.

374
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:45,158
Why don't you let me go before we start talking?

375
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:07,148
The fingers that punched in the PIN at the ATM to withdraw money.

376
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:09,288
It's similar...

377
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,088
to Woo Ho Sung's hand.

378
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,217
Did you see it?

379
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:15,527
When I went to the massage parlor, and when I cuffed him.

380
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:17,058
I saw his hands.

381
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:19,227
Woo Ho Sung is also conscious of that.

382
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,027
It looks like it.

383
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:27,667
Are other detectives watching me from behind that wall?

384
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:29,467
You know why you're here, right?

385
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,068
How many of you are there?

386
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,777
Didn't you hear me? I asked you a question.

387
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:37,848
I'm not sure.

388
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,447
She told you when she cuffed you. Abduction.

389
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:44,348
Who? Who did I abduct?

390
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,358
You would know better than us.

391
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,788
Do you have evidence?

392
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:53,358
That's why we arrested you.

393
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,197
Even if you search through my house,

394
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,098
you won't find a thing.

395
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,677
(Scientific Investigations Team)

396
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:10,148
Did you find anything?

397
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,217
I don't see anything in particular.

398
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:23,288
He formatted everything.

399
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:26,358
This is you, isn't it?

400
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:27,358
(CCTV footage evidence)

401
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,068
What is this?

402
00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:32,467
You used the debit card of a woman who went missing...

403
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,068
and withdrew cash.

404
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,338
Show me...

405
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,908
the evidence that this is me.

406
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:43,247
Where is that woman?

407
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,878
Who?

408
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,578
This is you.

409
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,048
Where is she?

410
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,417
I really have no idea what you're talking about.

411
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,318
At 2pm on February 24,

412
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,257
tell me where you were.

413
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,128
I slept at home.

414
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:05,497
Not that. Give me something else.

415
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,967
Something more feasible.

416
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:14,108
I said I slept at home.

417
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,578
Do you expect me to believe...

418
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:17,007
that you were asleep in the broad daylight?

419
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:18,477
In this situation?

420
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:21,648
What will I do on weekends? I should sleep.

421
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:23,548
You said you had a girlfriend.

422
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:26,618
If anything, you would've gone out on a date.

423
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,757
We went out the day before.

424
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,257
I need a day to rest.

425
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,398
It was my day off too.

426
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:37,828
You don't know who I am, do you?

427
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:42,108
This is you. I know it is.

428
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:44,638
Do you have evidence?

429
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:48,677
If you don't, you have to trust me.

430
00:25:57,247 --> 00:26:01,358
The dead karaoke employee found in that hill was...

431
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:02,757
probably killed by him too, right?

432
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:04,128
I believe so.

433
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,457
The dead body had traces of rape too.

434
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:10,027
We must get him to confess to the sexual assault too.

435
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:13,237
How did he seem? Is he a little different now?

436
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:16,667
He did not show any emotional distress.

437
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:20,108
He seemed rather calm in a startling situation.

438
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:22,777
It looks like he has an antisocial personality disorder.

439
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:23,908
Like psychopathy?

440
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:27,777
- Yes. - Someone extremely self-centered,

441
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:30,747
lacks a sense of sympathy,

442
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,257
and lacks a guilty conscience.

443
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:36,757
It looked like he kept two dogs.

444
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,457
It's probably a cover-up.

445
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:41,828
I'm sure he only used them to lure the victims.

446
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,898
Let's conduct the PCL-R on him later.

447
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,737
He looks like the type who shows aggression selectively.

448
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,007
What do you mean?

449
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,437
People like him have a high level of self-control.

450
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:56,348
They keep their composure until the moment of their crime.

451
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:57,578
They won't show their emotions.

452
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,417
But once he begins to attack,

453
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,987
he becomes more brutal and violent than others.

454
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:06,017
Are you saying he picks and chooses his victims?

455
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,058
You're right.

456
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,757
Gu Young Chun and Nam Ki Tae...

457
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:12,497
expressed their aggression on many and unspecified persons.

458
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:14,457
But that man...

459
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,997
only expresses his aggression on the victims he chose.

460
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,338
I think we should be more strategic about our interrogation tactics.

461
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,608
Even if we show him evidence,

462
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,078
he won't confess that easily.

463
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:28,947
Chief Kook and I will interrogate him.

464
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,318
Two gentlemen are joining me this time.

465
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:41,957
Are you here to have a conversation with me?

466
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,358
That's right.

467
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:49,667
What about the other detectives from earlier?

468
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,497
You'll be talking to us for a while.

469
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,908
I told you to get evidence.

470
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,338
I guess it's not going well.

471
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,677
Gosh.

472
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:07,247
If you wanted to talk to me,

473
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,048
you should have at least brought me some water.

474
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,187
Is that all you need?

475
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,658
We're here to talk to you.

476
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,767
But we're not here to bring you water.

477
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,527
Let us know once you get really thirsty...

478
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:25,737
during our conversation.

479
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:27,598
I'll get you some water then.

480
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,578
What are they doing?

481
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:37,177
Just let them do their thing. They have their own system.

482
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:41,517
His attitude seems a bit different from before.

483
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:42,848
Whose attitude?

484
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,618
- Song Ha Young's? - Yes.

485
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,257
Of course, it should be different.

486
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:50,358
After all, he went through a lot.

487
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,427
This guy is different.

488
00:28:57,628 --> 00:28:59,737
He probably subdued the victims in a matter of seconds...

489
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,007
and clouded their judgment emotionally.

490
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,138
And then, he probably continued his act...

491
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,038
just like he was trying to have...

492
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,608
a power struggle by making me bring water.

493
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,247
I've been sitting here...

494
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:17,088
and talking to the detectives since I got here.

495
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,858
What else do you want to talk about?

496
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,017
We have our own set of questions.

497
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,328
If you have time for this,

498
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,457
wouldn't it be better spent by looking for evidence outside?

499
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,898
All you're doing is sitting here...

500
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,197
and running your mouth.

501
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,207
We're looking for the evidence.

502
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,677
- So don't worry about it. - All right. If you say so.

503
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:40,507
It won't take long to find evidence.

504
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:45,447
Why is that jerk so brazen?

505
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,818
You know that denying their charges shamelessly is their specialty.

506
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,818
According to Chief Kook,

507
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:52,558
his self-control is very high.

508
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,927
And it looks like he's trying to control his emotions even now.

509
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,727
He asked for water as soon as he saw them...

510
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:03,098
to test out if he could control them or not.

511
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,167
Does he think he can intimidate them?

512
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,068
How dare he?

513
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,308
Let me ask you a few questions.

514
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,477
Your wife and mother-in-law died...

515
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:14,777
in a fire a few years ago.

516
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:19,417
And you only took your son when you escaped from the fire.

517
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:23,917
When you think about it again, how do you feel?

518
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:33,697
Why must I think about that now?

519
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,798
I'm just asking how you feel...

520
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,527
or what you're thinking right now.

521
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,068
I don't know...

522
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:43,967
how the fire has anything to do with this incident.

523
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,078
Why are you bringing up my son?

524
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:50,308
Your son?

525
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:56,148
I wonder how your son would feel once he finds out that his dad is...

526
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,257
a serial murderer and rapist.

527
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,788
You see,

528
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,957
he's too young to know anything.

529
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:06,598
Not yet.

530
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:09,927
No. Listen.

531
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,167
Nothing has been proven yet.

532
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,368
I really don't follow you.

533
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,007
That's right.

534
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:21,308
"Not yet."

535
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:25,777
You received a hefty sum of money...

536
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,247
from the insurance claim.

537
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:30,987
Are you...

538
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,658
suspecting me right now?

539
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:36,828
You see, the fire...

540
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,398
started because of the mosquito incense stick.

541
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,237
And the detectives who investigated the case...

542
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,207
couldn't prove anything.

543
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,947
They "couldn't" prove anything?

544
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:00,477
Right.

545
00:32:01,277 --> 00:32:02,588
They couldn't prove anything...

546
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,658
because there was nothing to prove. Isn't that obvious?

547
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:10,487
You see, I was trying to survive the fire with my son.

548
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,328
All I did was escape. That's all.

549
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:16,828
Well,

550
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,538
we didn't say otherwise, did we?

551
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:25,308
Why did you send your son to your cousin's house?

552
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:32,578
Once I go to work,

553
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,487
no one's there to look after him.

554
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,058
How old is your son? Is he 11 years old?

555
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,088
Why are you curious about that?

556
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,427
I was just wondering if you knew how old your son was.

557
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,298
Don't be so absurd. Darn...

558
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,197
Don't be rude.

559
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,108
Do you want your son to find out...

560
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,507
that his father is a serial murderer and rapist?

561
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:02,447
You...

562
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,318
That jerk.

563
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:18,128
- Why are you doing this to me? - I'm sure you know why.

564
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,527
Let's stop talking about my son.

565
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:22,398
Why? You don't like it? Is it uncomfortable?

566
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,967
It has nothing to do with this case.

567
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,737
You said you didn't do it.

568
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:30,237
But you're still ashamed when you think about your son?

569
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:34,878
Even I'm curious too.

570
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,408
Why is he bringing up the son?

571
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,118
Woo Ho Sung's narcissism.

572
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,017
(Having attachment to oneself)

573
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:44,618
Serial murderers and rapists...

574
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,187
who commit crimes for pleasure like Woo Ho Sung...

575
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,828
will highly likely show a quality of narcissism.

576
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,727
He did seem to be full of himself.

577
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:52,798
People tend to develop excessive self-attachment...

578
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,427
as a defense mechanism against pain and despair.

579
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:58,497
And when they experience an attachment injury,

580
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,167
they feel a sense of humiliation and hopelessness.

581
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:03,608
So the attachment toward the others gets directed to themselves.

582
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,608
A sense of humiliation and hopelessness?

583
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,378
That can cause narcissism?

584
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,208
They must deny their reality that they can't be loved.

585
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:13,918
How can we get Woo Ho Sung to talk?

586
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:18,018
We need to find out the target of his unconditional attachment...

587
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:19,658
right away.

588
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,927
Unconditional attachment?

589
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,688
It has to be his family. Right?

590
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,897
- His parents or kids. - It can't be his parents.

591
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:28,627
Having a big trauma like an attachment injury...

592
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:31,228
must mean that he didn't feel loved by his parents.

593
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,868
Then it has to be his kids. Does he have kids?

594
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,708
He has a son in elementary school.

595
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:39,708
His cousin is looking after him.

596
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:45,277
Fine. If not your son, how about your parents?

597
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:46,918
Why do you keep...

598
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,717
trying to talk about...

599
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,158
my personal life?

600
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,018
That's why we're here.

601
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:58,927
We analyze criminal behaviors.

602
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:02,368
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Kook Young Soo)

603
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,967
You haven't proven...

604
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:08,098
anything yet.

605
00:35:11,368 --> 00:35:13,177
I really don't understand...

606
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:16,578
what you're talking about.

607
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,317
How was your relationship with your dad?

608
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,377
My dad?

609
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,717
- He was strict. - Did he hit you too?

610
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:26,587
No. He never hit me.

611
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,388
Was your family well-off?

612
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:29,857
Why do you ask?

613
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,098
Do you think...

614
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:34,027
I had a tough upbringing and grew up in poverty?

615
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:35,498
This is a standard question.

616
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,328
Gosh. You guys are unbelievable.

617
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,837
You guys are biased against people.

618
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:45,337
Enough with these ridiculous questions.

619
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:46,438
Go out there...

620
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,208
and find more evidence.

621
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,748
You just wait. It won't be long.

622
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,087
Gosh. That jerk.

623
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,248
How's the search going?

624
00:35:58,248 --> 00:35:59,688
He has a lot of stuff.

625
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,328
And he especially has a lot of clothes.

626
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,828
That's not an excuse.

627
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,958
We have to bring everything in.

628
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:12,868
Whenever we tried to provoke him,

629
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:15,467
he kept asking us if we found any evidence.

630
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,737
He thinks he got rid of all the evidence.

631
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,237
What about his call history?

632
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,277
We used his call history since February...

633
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:23,978
and tracked his whereabouts with his cell phone...

634
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:26,047
to check the security footage as we speak.

635
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,018
Gosh. It will take forever.

636
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:29,547
No news from the NFS, right?

637
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:31,047
There's too much stuff from his house.

638
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,058
So it will take a long time just to run DNA tests on them.

639
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,857
He set his car on fire for a reason.

640
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:36,788
He formatted his computer too.

641
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:39,857
Gosh. We just need some hard evidence to make the arrest.

642
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,668
He seemed experienced in starting a fire.

643
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:45,467
Serial killers often commit arson too.

644
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:47,498
Every single one of them started a fire.

645
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:50,708
We'll have to check a few more things,

646
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,677
but I'm sure he's the culprit.

647
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,007
He said the police "couldn't" prove anything.

648
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,348
Wait. His response is wrong.

649
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,748
He shouldn't say the police couldn't prove it.

650
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:01,918
He should be arguing that he was innocent.

651
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,418
He killed his wife and mother-in-law?

652
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,018
No humans can do this.

653
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:08,388
Listen. Are you telling me the only thing we could do right now is...

654
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:11,788
sit around this table and wait for a call from the NFS?

655
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,467
We have 32 hours left.

656
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:20,237
You can eat now.

657
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,638
What is this?

658
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:27,408
You should've asked me first.

659
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,507
I don't eat jjajangmyeon.

660
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:32,518
It's bad for you.

661
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,447
- What? - I want a proper meal.

662
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:38,788
With soybean paste soup. Or with cheonggukjang stew.

663
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,897
What? It's bad for you? Unbelievable.

664
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,368
Why are these scumbags...

665
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,868
all so health-conscious?

666
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:58,237
Who else was like that other than Nam Ki Tae?

667
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,408
Gu Young Chun.

668
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:03,478
Those scumbags can live long lives in prison.

669
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:05,147
I'll go feed Woo Ho Sung.

670
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:06,317
- Okay. - See you in a bit.

671
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,377
- See you. - See you.

672
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,958
Let's resume the interview with him after he's done eating.

673
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,228
- Okay. - Sounds good.

674
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:25,868
While we're eating, let's think about his MO from his perspective.

675
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:28,808
- From Woo Ho Sung's perspective? - Yes.

676
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,938
He used his expensive car to lure his victims.

677
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:34,737
The victims got into his car without suspecting anything.

678
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:36,578
For that to happen,

679
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:39,177
there are various conditions that had to be met.

680
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:41,217
He must've cared a great deal about what he wore.

681
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:43,618
Yes, they found a ton of clothes at Woo Ho Sung's house.

682
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,757
Clothes that look expensive.

683
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:48,058
Winter clothes that he must've worn often.

684
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:49,888
We should check those first. It'll be faster.

685
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:52,058
He lured his victims inside his vehicle,

686
00:38:52,058 --> 00:38:53,857
so maybe not thick winter jackets.

687
00:38:53,857 --> 00:38:55,697
He most likely wore expensive-looking clothes.

688
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:59,268
Let's check neutral-colored shirts and jackets first.

689
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:00,467
Why does the color matter?

690
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:03,138
Strangers wearing neutral colors tend to seem more trustworthy...

691
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:04,308
than the ones wearing loud colors.

692
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:08,038
That's right. This way, we can save time.

693
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,877
Start with clothes that he probably wore often.

694
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,618
Neutral-colored winter shirts and jackets that look expensive.

695
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:18,147
We ordered you what you wanted to eat,

696
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,257
so it's now your turn to give us the answer we want.

697
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:25,498
You little punk, you're really something.

698
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,868
I'm getting sleepy now that I've eaten.

699
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:31,397
All right, let's get this done fast.

700
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:34,438
That's exactly what we're trying to do now.

701
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,607
You punk.

702
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,538
Are you here to play?

703
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:41,638
Look, Detective. You arrested me without a warrant...

704
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,578
based on mere suspicion. Am I wrong?

705
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:47,518
- What? - And you're treating me like dirt.

706
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,288
What will you do if I'm not the culprit?

707
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,118
What if...

708
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,228
I sue you?

709
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:00,797
What will you do then?

710
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:04,967
You little punk, you have a knack for getting people riled up.

711
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,067
Chief Park.

712
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,668
- Let go. You piece of... - Chief Park, please.

713
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:13,478
You'd better confess when you still have the chance to,

714
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,547
or you'll regret it later. You little...

715
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:17,578
I'm scared.

716
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:21,217
Darn it.

717
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:24,587
That scumbag is so confident.

718
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,618
What did the NFS say?

719
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,987
I asked them to check his winter clothes first.

720
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,458
Darn it.

721
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:34,598
If we find the victims' DNA, it's a done deal.

722
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,427
Let's wait and see.

723
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:38,627
People like him open up easily to those...

724
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:41,638
who are either younger than them or have low-level positions.

725
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,237
It's one of the common traits of a narcissist.

726
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:45,308
Correct.

727
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,777
They want to feel supported and acknowledged.

728
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:52,748
We shouldn't make him feel inferior.

729
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:56,348
Then should Detective Nam deal with him without Chief Park?

730
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:58,918
Let's wait and see.

731
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,098
You killed them.

732
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,927
Take your time and have a look.

733
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,978
Can I get a cup of coffee?

734
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:29,248
Go ahead.

735
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:46,301
Looks like he'll confess, right?

736
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:49,341
He might, or he just felt a sudden pang of guilt.

737
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,071
He did show a reaction at that moment,

738
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,942
but we'll have to wait and see what he does.

739
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:56,341
He's been denying everything this whole time.

740
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:59,212
He won't be swayed that easily just because of the victims' photos.

741
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:03,752
But he's human after all.

742
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:07,221
Based on his attitude so far, I know he won't confess easily.

743
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,662
And he managed to be cleared of the insurance scam charges.

744
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:47,892
These women aren't even recognizable.

745
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,962
What do you want me to do with these photos?

746
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:54,272
That scumbag is clearly a psychopath.

747
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,201
Why did he put down the cup on top of the photo?

748
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:01,111
Of course, he wasn't going to confess.

749
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:05,812
"These women aren't even recognizable."

750
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:10,281
- What is it? - They're photos of one victim.

751
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,991
It's not the owner of the debit card he tried to use to withdraw money.

752
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:17,491
It's the karaoke bar employee who was found dead in the woods.

753
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:27,872
He should be under the impression that it's the victim...

754
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,372
we're accusing him of killing,

755
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:34,272
but he assumed that it'd be more than one person.

756
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,482
What? Then...

757
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,712
It means there is more than one victim.

758
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:41,712
He's the culprit.

759
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:48,421
He killed several women.

760
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:51,462
Hence the reaction.

761
00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:52,991
If he didn't do it,

762
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:57,502
he'd know nothing about the victim or the location.

763
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:02,442
So the fact that he said he couldn't recognize them...

764
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:04,741
is certainly odd.

765
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,392
I found something.

766
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:29,531
What did you eat?

767
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:31,261
Pizza.

768
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,511

00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,281
- Look. - What?

The NFS?

774
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,721
Goodness, they pulled an all-nighter too.

775
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,522
Hey.

776
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:00,892
Yes, okay.

777
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:02,832
What is it?

778
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:06,372
They found a bloodstain on Woo Ho Sung's jacket.

779
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:10,801
The DNA matches that of the body found in the woods.

780
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:16,741
Finally, thank goodness. You're dead meat now, you punk.

781
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:20,082
Also, they found a half-burned lipstick...

782
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:21,982
in the burned vehicle.

783
00:45:21,982 --> 00:45:22,982
Did they manage to lift DNA?

784
00:45:22,982 --> 00:45:25,551
Not yet. I just wanted to keep you informed.

785
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:28,221
I'll go in and let them know.

786
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,091
They've faxed the report over already.

787
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:33,031
- Okay. - Good work, everyone.

788
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:35,801
What would we have done without you guys?

What is it, Ha Young?

790
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,372
The lipstick.

791
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,801
Maybe it belongs to a victim we don't know about yet.

792
00:45:45,712 --> 00:45:47,372
We need to get a confession out of him.

793
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:14,171
Goodness.

794
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,102

Just confess, you scumbag.

811
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:15,732
I will confess.

In return,

00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,602
I want Captain Yoon here.

- It'll be quick. - Sure, go ahead.

820

- Will you be all right? - Yes.

821
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:45,221

- Be smart about it. - About what?

831
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:28,201
Whether or not you want your son to remember...

832
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:30,201
you as an unremorseful murderer until the very end.

833
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:33,111
And this will be the last time we talk.

834
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:36,781
I'm not scared.

835
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,542
I'm not saying this to scare you.

836
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:43,551
I mean to tell you that nobody will listen to your story anymore.

837
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,551
I already know that you have multiple victims.

838
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:49,491
We've acquired all the evidence too.

839
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:54,091
I thought you weren't here to talk about the case?

840
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:56,761
- I'm not. - Then let's change the subject.

841
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,631
No. I already have you figured out.

842
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,071
Which is why I'm no longer curious.

843
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:39,071
Would it be possible...

844
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,881
for me to talk privately with Captain Yoon?

845
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:48,912
I'll be fine.

846
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:52,692
Give me your hands.

847
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:06,932
What is it that you want to say?

848
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:10,341
I'm sure getting a confession out of someone...

849
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:13,471
is harder than you detectives think.

850
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:18,642
Am I right?

851
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:22,212
It's the same for the confessor too.

852
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:24,821
Which is why...

853
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,022
I'm torn.

854
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:33,292
Whether the culprit confesses or not...

855
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,531
is his decision to make.

856
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,002
Then how...

857
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:40,332
can I get him to decide?

858
00:50:40,732 --> 00:50:43,542
Just give the nuance that you understand him to an extent.

859
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,142
Woo Ho Sung has strong narcissistic tendencies.

860
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:48,111
If you form a rapport with him,

861
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:50,781
it'll bring about a change in his emotions.

862
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,252
Don't you think the burden will be lifted...

863
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,522
if you confess?

864
00:51:00,692 --> 00:51:03,192
- Who's burden? - Yours...

865
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:05,562
and mine too.

866
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:08,091
Do you really think so?

867
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,932
I'm sure you had a reason...

868
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,102
why you asked for me specifically.

869
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,412
I'm ready...

870
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,372
to listen to whatever it is...

871
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,142
that you have to tell me.

872
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:37,892
Why did you do it?

873
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:46,071
Must there always...

874
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,002
be a reason...

875
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,212
why you kill someone?

876
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,111
So...

877
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,182
you didn't have a reason?

878
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:02,821
Well, if I had to come up with one,

879
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,692
it's because I wanted to kill them.

880
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,591
How many...

881
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:12,832
did you murder?

882
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:17,801
We found components...

883
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:21,631
of another victim's lipstick...

884
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:24,071
from your car.

885
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:27,542
It will all be revealed in the end.

886
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:35,511
That hand.

887
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,951
You tried your best to hide her face.

888
00:52:39,182 --> 00:52:40,392
But unfortunately,

889
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:43,721
you weren't able to hide your hand.

890
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:52,801
You've been self-conscious about it all along, right?

891
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,442
I'll come back...

892
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:03,212
once you are ready to talk to me.

893
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:09,281
I'll do it.

894
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,792
I will talk.

895
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:34,841
The suspect confessed that he murdered...

896
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:37,182
all the women who started going missing from 2006...

897
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:39,651
around Gyeonggi's southwestern area.

898
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,111
Early this morning in Suwon,

899
00:53:42,111 --> 00:53:43,682
the police found the body of the missing housewife.

900
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:46,051
They are continuing their search...

901
00:53:46,051 --> 00:53:47,522
- for the other women's bodies... - Is this hair?

902
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,591
Oh, I found it!

903
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:52,591
- What? - I found something.

904
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,761
Look.

905
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:55,962
On the day I planned to murder,

906
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:59,471
I made sure that I executed it.

907
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,642
No matter what.

908
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:07,312
You're saying you planned for all seven murders?

909
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:08,312
Of course.

910
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,482
I'm determined...

911
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,182
from the moment I leave the house.

912
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:16,451
Did you ever fail?

913
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:18,421
Fail?

914
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:21,591
I have never failed.

915
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:24,192
You see,

916
00:54:25,122 --> 00:54:27,861
it's like a promise I make to myself.

917
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,832
I executed it.

918
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:35,971
One way or another.

919
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:39,201
The police intensely investigated the suspect...

920
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:40,971
to find out if he committed additional crimes...

921
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:43,942
until early this morning.

922
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:46,982
They will also carry out a crime scene reenactment...

923
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:48,011
- this morning. - Look over here.

924
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:49,551
He reenacted...

925
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:52,991
three out of his seven crimes yesterday.

926
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:55,421
The bereaved families and residents were enraged once again,

927
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:57,361
as they watched him...

928
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:58,921
reenact the crime nonchalantly.

929
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:01,962
I have always known...

930
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:04,832
that I was a psychopath.

931
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:07,502
Why did you think that?

932
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,841
I was watching TV one day.

933
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:15,611
When I heard the characteristics of a psychopath...

934
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:19,341
I realized.

935
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:23,752
That's me in a nutshell.

936
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:28,551
- Look over here. - Take his hat off. Let me see him!

937
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:30,421
- My gosh. - That scumbag...

938
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:31,721
His 2nd crime was by highway 39,

939
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:34,232
which was his secret burial site.

940
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:36,701
When the police told him to reenact how he dug the ground,

941
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,031
he was comfortable enough to revise the order.

942
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,471
Saying that he dug the ground after he took the body out of the car.

943
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:45,002
His calm demeanor as he reenacted the horrible crime...

944
00:55:45,002 --> 00:55:47,272
made the onlookers even more furious.

945
00:55:47,272 --> 00:55:48,542
The bereaved families...

946
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,712
who came later to watch the reenactment...

947
00:55:50,712 --> 00:55:53,412
were crying out, demanding to show his face.

948
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,182
When do you feel the urge to kill?

949
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,392
That is...

950
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,801
a little difficult...

951
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,201
to describe in words.

952
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,442
Hitting on women is a piece of cake.

953
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:19,872
You see, those girls...

954
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:22,611
They all liked me.

955
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:25,582
I'm not sure.

956
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,212
I think it's just you.

957
00:56:28,212 --> 00:56:30,881
Why won't you trust me? It's true.

958
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:34,522
They all really liked me.

959
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:35,821
I also think...

960
00:56:37,662 --> 00:56:40,361
you only look like a petty loser.

961
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,761
Sorry for the bad news.

962
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,932
We...

963
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,471
do not...

964
00:56:48,232 --> 00:56:50,002
believe your words.

965
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:53,571
If they don't listen to me,

966
00:56:54,272 --> 00:56:55,412
then...

967
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,542
I take off...

968
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,951
my necktie and bind their hands and feet.

969
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,491
The investigation headquarter of Gyeonggi Agency stated...

970
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:10,122
they received the confession from Woo, the suspect who killed...

971
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,261
the female university student who went missing in February,

972
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:15,192
that he killed seven and buried them until early this year.

973
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:20,631
Last month, he conducted two psychopathy tests...

974
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,301
and was confirmed as a typical psychopath...

975
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:25,901
with the score of 27 and 28 respectively.

976
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:30,082
I will be...

977
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:32,812
sentenced to death, right?

978
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:34,881
You should be.

979
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:45,721
Even after I go up there, I won't find...

980
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:48,131
my peace.

981
00:57:49,861 --> 00:57:51,631
Did you dream of ending up in paradise?

982
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:09,312
Goodness, Ji Sook.

983
00:58:09,312 --> 00:58:13,022
Ji Sook, you've returned in such vain.

984
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,142
Let's go.

985
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,482
(Gyeonggi Investigation Headquarter of Serial Missing Women Cases)

986
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,059
Superintendent Heo, a souvenir.

987
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:56,728
Park Dae Woong! Big bear! You did it!

988
00:58:56,728 --> 00:58:57,769
Thank you.

989
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:01,168
Good work, everyone.

990
00:59:01,168 --> 00:59:02,769
- Great job. - Great work.

991
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:05,938
It's sad to see you go.

992
00:59:06,438 --> 00:59:08,079
You don't look too sad.

993
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,239
Tell me about it.

994
00:59:09,608 --> 00:59:13,579
Well, I may not look sad, but I'm glad and sad to see you go.

995
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,019
We'll come back and visit.

996
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,789
It only takes us 50 minutes to get here from Seoul Agency...

997
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,648
I don't expect you to come.

998
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:20,889
You're the one to talk. I don't expect you to come either.

999
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,628
If we have to meet again, it'll have to be another case...

1000
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:25,958
Goodness, no.

1001
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:27,699
In that case, I'd rather not meet at all.

1002
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,969
Let's just keep our memories deep inside, right here.

1003
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,869
Captain Yoon, you should also share something.

1004
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:43,079
Let's go now.

1005
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:45,648
- Great work. - Great job.

1006
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:48,849
- Chief Park, let's have some soju. - Let's do that.

1007
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:50,019
Stay healthy, okay?

1008
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,889
Yes, be mindful of your health too.

1009
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,258
- Bye. - Goodbye.

1010
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:56,559
- Let's go. - Great job.

1011
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:10,108
Why are you moving on a day when I'm free?

1012
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:12,139
Because I moved to a neighborhood you told me to.

1013
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:15,008
I can't move here because there are lots of robberies.

1014
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:17,909
Another place is too dangerous because of burglars.

1015
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,378
When I see you, I realize knowing too much can hurt.

1016
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:22,418
Thanks to me, you came to a safe neighborhood.

1017
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,418
According to statistics,

1018
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:27,059
this area has 50 percent less crimes compared to other neighborhoods.

1019
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,059
And downstairs,

1020
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,128
a detective of Wide-Area Investigation Squad lives.

1021
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,858
So when will Detective Nam get here?

1022
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:33,329
- Detective Nam? - Yes.

1023
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:36,568
I have your order of gopchang.

1024
01:00:36,568 --> 01:00:38,969
- These are all my order? - Yes.

1025
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:44,769
My gosh, this is a lot. All right.

1026
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:46,708
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

1027
01:00:48,008 --> 01:00:49,338
Goodbye.

1028
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:01,358
When did you get all these?

1029
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:03,458
- I had to run. - That looks good.

1030
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,858
Detective Nam got these?

1031
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:06,699
You can get gopchang to go?

1032
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,559
Yes, you can get just about anything to go now.

1033
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,728
It's much easier since it's already fully cooked.

1034
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:12,798
It's really good.

1035
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:13,969
- Is it? - Yes, try some.

1036
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:15,898
Let's make a toast first.

1037
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:18,269
Congratulations.

1038
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:23,978
This is how I recharge the energy I lost from moving.

1039
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:36,789
The mood here is perfect.

1040
01:01:37,088 --> 01:01:41,228
Let's get together from time to time and have meetings here.

1041
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:43,099
- It'd be nice. - Sounds great.

1042
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:45,099
I got it.

1043
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,798
Isn't this the first time we got together outside of work?

1044
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:50,508
- You're right. - Is that so?

1045
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:54,608
- Oh my. - The moon is so pretty.

1046
01:01:56,108 --> 01:01:59,048
- Yes, it's huge. - That's very pretty.

1047
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,619
- Yes. - Right.

1048
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,318
Then let's all make a wish together.

1049
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:07,219
Woo Ju, your drunk habit is making a wish to the moon, right?

1050
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:09,389
- You're right on. - My gosh.

1051
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:12,329
If Woo Ju wants to do that, then let's make a wish.

1052
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,728
You make wishes like that?

1053
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:19,938
Then how?

1054
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,469
I'm all done.

1055
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,778
(March 2007)

1056
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:33,378
Who are you trying to look good for?

1057
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:36,119
Who do you think? The future members of Analysis Team.

1058
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:39,389
- Aren't you excited? - Why should I be?

1059
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:44,429
You should start looking at people other than me.

1060
01:02:44,588 --> 01:02:45,688
Good grief.

1061
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:48,458
You should stop digging my nagging.

1062
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,429
You need to share your love with these future members.

1063
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,438
Let me off right over there.

1064
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:56,869
Forget it. It's a special day, so let's get our hair done.

1065
01:02:56,869 --> 01:02:58,769
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

1066
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:02,008
Recently, the vitamin care is received greatly by our customers.

1067
01:03:02,008 --> 01:03:03,139
Really?

1068
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:05,409
This is perfect for us.

1069
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:07,179
Then let's do this one.

1070
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:08,449
- Okay. - All right.

1071
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:10,619
- We'll do this. - Sure.

1072
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,389
Do you drink a lot?

1073
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:19,628
How did you know?

1074
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:22,829
This is a care routine we recommend to those who drink often...

1075
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:26,369
and have bad blood circulation. For those who are stressed...

1076
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:27,599
and need to be refreshed.

1077
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,739
That already feels nice.

1078
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:31,508
- Chief Kook. - Yes?

1079
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,838
- Does it feel good? - It feels very refreshing.

1080
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:36,409
Ha Young, you should do it too.

1081
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:40,878
Someone said a person's heart is the most difficult thing to fathom.

1082
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:44,418
But there are those who must do such difficult work.

1083
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:47,918
On top of that, they must fathom the hearts of criminals,

1084
01:03:47,918 --> 01:03:49,719
not just any old people.

1085
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:52,458
At times, among countless numbers of criminals,

1086
01:03:52,688 --> 01:03:56,568
they must put up a fight to read the minds of serial killers,

1087
01:03:56,568 --> 01:03:57,869
the worst evil of them all.

1088
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:01,269
And these people are none other than you.

1089
01:04:02,168 --> 01:04:05,139
Some once said an angel is only a hair different from a devil.

1090
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,508
Most minds that live an ordinary life,

1091
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:12,108
and the most atrocious minds that commit heinous murders.

1092
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,418
Where did they cross their paths?

1093
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:20,059
What made these people so wicked?

1094
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:23,088
Our duty begins with that basic question.

1095
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:27,728
In this chaotic world and dramatic reality,

1096
01:04:28,528 --> 01:04:30,728
the only thing that keeps us from becoming evil...

1097
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:35,838
might be in our ability to touch people's hearts.

1098
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,639
I hope your duty...

1099
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,208
becomes another chance to revisit the preciousness...

1100
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,179
and the importance of that ability.

1101
01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:46,449
I hope you will...

1102
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:50,019
learn to embrace your own hearts.

1103
01:04:51,648 --> 01:04:52,789
Through this duty,

1104
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:55,418
I also had the chance...

1105
01:04:56,389 --> 01:04:57,929
to have priceless experiences...

1106
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,228
and to realize these important values in life.

Today, we interviewed the first profiler in Korea,

1111
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:24,608
Captain Song Ha Young of the Behavioral Analysis Team.

1112
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,478
Is there anything you would like to say...

1113
01:06:27,478 --> 01:06:30,148
before we wrap up the interview?

1114
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:31,789
Well,

1115
01:06:32,818 --> 01:06:34,619
we haven't been able to catch the culprit...

1116
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:36,388
of the Daesung Serial Murder Case, a cold case from a long time ago.

1117
01:06:36,928 --> 01:06:38,858
And if he's watching the show now,

1118
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,228
I would like to say this to him.

1119
01:06:42,428 --> 01:06:44,199
Science is making progress day by day.

1120
01:06:45,098 --> 01:06:46,898
And there's no perfect crime in this world.

1121
