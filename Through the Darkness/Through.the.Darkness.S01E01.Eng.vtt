- Just sleep here tonight. - I have to go to work tomorrow.

185
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:27,733
Then take a taxi. I'll give you money for the fare.

186
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,802
Why waste money on a taxi ride when I can take the bus?

187

- Forget it. - Wait!

188

Bye.

199
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,633
Bye. Don't forget to lock the door.

200
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,004
I won't.

201

208
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,474
You forgot to take an umbrella, right?

209
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:54,813
How did you know?

210
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,354
The floor was wet, so I wiped it.

211
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,954
I should've picked you up.

- What? - My mom was here.

222
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,652
It's just a tent bar. Can't you play hooky...

223
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,254
and hang out with me today?

Look at you belittling me again.

Again?

229
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:05,113
You get all sensitive whenever I talk about the tent bar.

230
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,424
I'll be honest. It makes you look so insecure!

a woman in her 20s was found dead...

and launched an investigation.

243
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:32,072
The police decided to investigate whether this incident was related...

244
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:35,173
to the so-called Red Cap Incident, the sexual assault cases...

245
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:37,843
that broke out one after another in Seoul.

246

On April 10,

247
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,342
a report was made by a woman in her 30s,

248
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:44,953
a victim of sexual assault from Hwayang-dong, Gwangjin-Gu.

249
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,413
- May I help you? - This case was regarded...

250
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,022
as a crime...

251
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,122
- Do you have a pinky? - done by the same culprit...

252
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:52,393
- I want to eat it. - as the so-called Red Cap Incident,

253
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:55,023

confirmed her returning home.

287

She couldn't reach her, so she came to visit,

288
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:45,033
then made a report.

She was in awful condition,

294

so I just injected her with a sedative and sleeping agent.

Whenever he's at the crime scene,

296

00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:09,262
My dear Chief Kook Young Soo of Forensics,

360
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,532
stop talking to me.

361
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:13,174
You can talk directly to Superintendent Baek Jun Sik.

362
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:15,173
Talk to me about what?

363
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,644
- My goodness. - Good grief.

364
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:32,593
Do you know how important profilers are?

365
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,663
Yes, I do. Pro fliers, like pilots?

366
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:39,032
If we want to conduct scientific investigations,

367
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,904
do we have to get on a plane too?

368
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:43,763
The higher the building goes,

369
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,004
the longer its shadow will be.

370
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:47,643
Goodness, that quote is...

371
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:49,843
from that ancient show, "Chief Inspector."

372
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:53,342
I guess Young Soo is getting older too.

373
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,312
With the IMF crisis and all, the buildings have crashed down.

374
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,052
What shadow?

375
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,283
You must be free.

376
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,323
Listen up.

377
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:06,352
Very soon, we will see...

378
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:09,023
brutal and heinous criminals like the ones in the US.

379
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:11,332
These criminals have no motives.

380
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,593
Then what do we do?

381
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,362
We have to get ready to deal with criminals like them!

382
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:16,434
Hey!

383
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,803
I can't take this anymore.

384
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:21,474
Are you praying that something big will break out?

385
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:24,542
Why don't you go somewhere and pray that a huge case will break out,

386
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,812
then another, then another one even bigger than the rest?

387
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,244
That's not what I meant.

388
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,954
You know what I mean. Don't say that.

389
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:35,783
How long did Park work overtime?

390
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:40,724
Young Soo.

391
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:42,924
Let's grab one later.

392
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,063
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:52,904
She was pregnant.

394
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:56,974
- Pregnant? - Yes, about 14 weeks.

395
00:26:57,343 --> 00:27:00,012
Man, this jerk.

396
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:02,812
She died from suffocation caused by pressure on the neck.

397
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,654
Her nose and mouth were shut.

398
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,413
The estimated time of death is...

399
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:09,122
between 10pm to midnight on the night of 15.

400
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:11,253
The temperature of her rectum shows...

401
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,092
that it was around 10:30pm.

402
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,993
The contents of her stomach show...

403
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,293
she ate something within an hour before her death,

404
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,233
so around 11pm.

405
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,263
Other than the victim's mother,

406
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:24,332
the time of her death...

407
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,572
coincides with the time of Bang Ki Hoon's visit.

408
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,174
But there's no sign of rape.

409
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,404
Wait, what about her clothes?

410
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:33,373
There's no sign of rape, but he only undressed her?

411
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:35,244
It's 100 percent Bang Ki Hoon.

412
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:39,113
So Bang Ki Hoon is your friend?

413
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,754
We only went to the same high school.

414
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:51,593
(Temporarily closed due to personal matters)

415
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:56,363
Mr. Bang Ki Hoon?

416
00:27:57,934 --> 00:27:59,773
We're from Dongbu Police Station. Come with us.

417
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,602
Why should I?

418
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,204
Are you acquainted with Choi Hwa Yeon?

419
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:06,843
- She's my girlfriend. - Exactly.

420
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:09,483
Bang Ki Hoon, you are arrested...

421
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:11,353
for the suspicion of Choi Hwa Yeon's murder.

422
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:14,113
Murder?

423
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:16,654
Murder? What do you mean?

424
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:19,454
Murder?

425
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:21,194
Is Hwa Yeon dead?

426
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,434
We can talk about the details at the station.

427
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,934
You were going to run away?

428
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:29,333
Too bad.

429
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,772
You missed your window by a close call.

430
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,134
I'm not running away.

431
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,144
Do you have an arrest warrant?

432
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,312
Bang Ki Hoon. You have the right to remain silent.

433
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:41,782
Anything you say can and will be used...

434
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,012
against you in a court of law.

435
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,654
You have the right to an attorney.

436
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:49,454
Hwa Yeon is dead?

437
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:56,464
I didn't do it.

438
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:58,734
Yes. Right on cue.

439
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,963
That's what everyone says.

440
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:04,872
I really didn't do it. Why would I...

441
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:08,043
All the circumstantial evidence is pointing to you.

442
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:12,943
You were at her house at the estimated time of death.

443
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:15,484
And we also found your fingerprints at her house.

444
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:18,512
Why would I kill my girlfriend?

445
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:21,623
Exactly. That's what I would like to know too.

446
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:24,153
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

447
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:25,623
I didn't kill her.

448
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:27,724
Then...

449
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,823
where did you go after leaving her house?

450
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:32,234
You didn't work that night.

451
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:39,234
You don't have anyone to support your alibi, right?

452
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:41,504
I went to the Han River.

453
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,873
Come on.

454
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,914
At least make it sound believable. Is that the best you can do?

455
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,083
I'm telling the truth.

456
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:52,954
We had a fight that night. I wasn't in the mood to work.

457
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:55,523
That's it.

458
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:58,423
Your motive for killing Choi Hwa Yeon.

459
00:29:58,424 --> 00:29:59,494
It was...

460
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,694
a small fight.

461
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:06,862
Do you kill your girlfriend over some argument you had?

462
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:10,863
That's the difference between us. So you sit there, and I sit here.

463
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:14,744
We're only 1m apart. But there's a huge gap between our humanity.

464
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:17,704
Detective.

465
00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:20,474
I really didn't do it.

466
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:22,984
Are you...

467
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,083
the culprit of the Red Cap Incident too?

468
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:28,622
What?

469
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:32,823
We got a report that someone saw a man in a red cap around that time.

470
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:41,464
(Turtle Supermarket)

471
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:47,273
A man without an umbrella was walking, not running.

472
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,244
I just thought that it was because he was wearing a cap.

473
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,873
Was it red?

474
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,914
I think it was.

475
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,983
- A red hat? - Yes.

476
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,884
Do you remember any other physical traits about him?

477
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,883
As for his height...

478
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,623
(Turtle Supermarket)

479
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:09,664
I'm not sure. Anyway, he was short enough to be a girl.

480
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:11,833
Detective.

481
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:15,633
What can I do to make you believe me?

482
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:18,633
Show me evidence you didn't do it. Then I'll believe you.

483
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:20,532
We only believe in evidence.

484
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,343
But you don't have evidence. Do you?

485
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:24,714
The door.

486
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:28,484
The door wasn't locked.

487
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,914
Think carefully before you speak.

488
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:34,523
This statement could work against you.

489
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,224
No.

490
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,263
You have a record for assault.

491
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,734
Gosh. You're running a business, pretending to have left the gang.

492
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:53,404
I'm not pretending. I'm done with that life.

493
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:56,174
I don't care if this is an act or not.

494
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,113
But people like you get hot-tempered just like now.

495
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:03,112
And when you do, unintentionally,

496
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:05,154
you end up hurting people. Right?

497
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:06,783
Just be honest.

498
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:09,283
I don't kill people.

499
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,293
Are you a gang member who has a heart?

500
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,762
Did your dead girlfriend know...

501
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,533
that you used to be in a gang?

502
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:27,533
Then did you know?

503
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:31,644
That Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant?

504
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:37,343
What do you mean?

505
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:39,683
Given that you were dating,

506
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:42,553
you two kept a lot of secrets from each other.

507
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:44,353
Exactly.

508
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:49,092
I'm telling you. You just can't rely only on the physical evidence.

509
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:53,134
Well, without the evidence, we'd be shooting blind. Right.

510
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:55,134
Then...

511
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,363
what should we rely on?

512
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,803
How they prepared to commit crimes.

513
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:06,113
And how and why they committed crimes.

514
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:08,542
And how the corpses were handled.

515
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:12,683
We should be studying the entire process.

516
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:16,082
- Right. And scientifically too. - Yes.

517
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,223
Science.

518
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,553
Come on. Stop talking about science.

519
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,393
Hold on.

520
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:25,293
Do you have to get the license to be a pilot or whatever that's called?

521
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,603
What? Why are you laughing?

522
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,072
Are you Choi Bool Am? "Pilot?"

523
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:35,944
- Gosh. You're so frustrating. - You're frustrating.

524
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:38,913
It's not a pilot. It's a profiler.

525
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:41,244
- Right. A profiler... - Hey.

526
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,512
A profiler.

527
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,483
All right. I'm sorry about the noise.

528
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:49,283
By the way, who's going to do that?

529
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:50,553
I know just the guy.

530
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:53,454
He's more stubborn than me.

531
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,164
Gosh. He sounds like trouble.

532
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,389
(Temporarily closed due to personal matters)

533
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,368
Bang Ki Hoon. Did you really do it?

534
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:42,445
Gosh. I can't believe this.

535
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,685
There were a lot of petty thieves in that neighbourhood.

536
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:50,824
The landlord on the second floor was robbed of their valuables too.

537
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:53,525
When?

538
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,395
About a month ago.

539
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,763
Their house had a smart door lock.

540
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,303
When did you check that?

541
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,534
Wait. Are you going there?

542
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:09,903
Gosh. You really shouldn't.

543
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:12,573
You killed a woman. You jerk.

544
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:15,184
You jerk.

545
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:18,014
I told you to confess, you jerk.

546
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,023
What?

547
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,083
What are you doing?

548
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,753
I'm getting a confession out of him. Close the door.

549
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,624
You piece of trash.

550
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,193
You jerk.

551
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:37,732
What? What's the problem? What is it?

552
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,132
Do you think this confession will be admissible in court?

553
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:43,803
Respect me as your superior. Don't you try to lecture me.

554
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:45,443
Get back to work.

555
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,244
This is my work too.

556
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,023
Gosh. Come on.

557
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,164
Get out.

558
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:11,573
He can't even give me his alibi right now.

559
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:14,373
Why? Because he killed her.

560
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,604
You know he was there at the estimated time of death.

561
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:20,772
Your little friend from school...

562
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:23,113
had a fight with Choi Hwa Yeon that day.

563
00:36:23,644 --> 00:36:26,982
He didn't call her for a few days, so he had no idea she was dead.

564
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,552
You think that makes any sense?

565
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,253
She was pregnant.

566
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:32,192
Bang Ki Hoon might not have been the culprit.

567
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:35,224
You think murderers have mercy?

568
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,823
No.

569
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,264
But it was too bad for him...

570
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,463
because he didn't even know she was pregnant.

571
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:43,733
Hey.

572
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:47,803
She must have hidden the fact that she was pregnant for a reason.

573
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,513
Well, even if I wanted to be lenient with him, I can't.

574
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:53,314
Even his motive is crystal clear.

575
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:57,983
Anyway, these gangsters will never learn.

576
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:00,152
They get hot-tempered and cause trouble.

577
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:02,022
They are too dumb to stage a perfect crime,

578
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,723
but they don't want to serve time.

579
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,894
But you still want to believe that guy?

580
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:07,793
This isn't about if we believe him or not.

581
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:10,022
I just want to find definitive evidence.

582
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:12,193
You said you weren't really friends with him.

583
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:14,963
Then listen up.

584
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:19,934
Those jerks don't deserve to be called human.

585
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,103
And beating those scumbags...

586
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:24,144
is the fastest and the easiest way to teach them a lesson.

587
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,874
I understand, but this is wrong.

588
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:29,383
(Interview Room)

589
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:35,084
I know why you got kicked out of Jungbu Police Station,

590
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,322
but don't try to police your supervisors...

591
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,423
by nitpicking us.

592
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:43,363
Just get out there and catch criminals.

593
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,132
Just go out there.

594
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,394
You have a lot of work to do.

595
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:52,233
(Let's create a free, mature democratic society.)

596
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:09,553
Hey.

597
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:13,322
Investigate him in connection with the Red Cap case.

598
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:14,354
Yes, sir.

599
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,223
But he didn't rape her. And the method is different.

600
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:20,034
Such perverted acts are no different from rape.

601
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,803
Wait, where are you going?

602
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,644
I'm heading out to find evidence.

603
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:36,144
My goodness.

604
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:01,544
This might prove that it wasn't Bang Ki Hoon.

605
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:05,514
There are signs of forced entry.

606
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:07,843
Here's another thing.

607
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,713
Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant.

608
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,113
Then did you know?

609
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:14,653
That Choi Hwa Yeon was pregnant?

610
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:17,854
But he didn't know, and he denied all charges.

611
00:39:23,224 --> 00:39:24,794
There is evidence against him. Number one.

612
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,733
His prints and blood were found at the scene.

613
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:29,903
Number two.

614
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,773
The estimated time of death also matches.

615
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,374
That punk...

616
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,204
Your little friend from school...

617
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,544
had a fight with Choi Hwa Yeon that day.

618
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:41,843
Clear motive.

619
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,283
Number three.

620
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:44,953
Show me evidence you didn't do it.

621
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:46,483
Then I'll believe you.

622
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:48,323
He has no alibi.

623
00:39:56,963 --> 00:39:58,022
Number four.

624
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,963
Entered through the door instead of the windows.

625
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,474
I should really move.

626
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,244
Petty thieves are one thing, but someone died.

627
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:10,374
Gosh, I'm so terrified that I can't live here anymore.

628
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:11,873
Even I'm this scared.

629
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,644
What if the house doesn't sell? I'm worried.

630
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:15,943
Who else had break-ins in this area?

631
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,184
There were 3 to 4 other cases, just counting the ones I heard of.

632
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,013
You see, that's the problem.

633
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:22,623
The stolen goods aren't that valuable,

634
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:24,022
so the police don't care.

635
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:25,294
It's been so long.

636
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,293
If it was a rich family, the thief would be in jail already.

637
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:29,763
Was there another break-in downstairs...

638
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,092
before this incident?

639
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:33,863
No, not that I know of.

640
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,933
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

641
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,133
Detective.

642
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:39,502
Can you also catch the thief who stole my jewellery...

643
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,442
while tracking down the jerk who killed the lady downstairs?

644
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:44,244
Okay. Just a moment, please.

645
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:53,914
Ma'am, these numbers here. Did you write them?

646
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:56,853
What is that?

647
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:00,624
My goodness. Why would I doodle on the wall? I'm not a kid.

648
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:03,363
Maybe my granddaughters wrote them when they were visiting?

649
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:08,934
Anyway, thank you.

650
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:12,834
Detective, please catch that thief!

(Case Report)

652
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:17,303
(Case File)

653
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,443
Five cases were reported in total.

654
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,943
There was a break-in every 2 weeks up until 3 months ago.

655
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,112
The last one was the 2-story house at 214 Daebong-dong?

656
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:28,522
Yes, this jerk is clever.

657
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:30,153
He never breaks into houses where men live.

658
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:32,653
And the value of the stolen items is low.

659
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:36,363
It's so petty that there are no leads on him whatsoever.

660
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,664
So Dongbu Police Station has given up.

661
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:41,633
We've enhanced patrols in the area.

662
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:43,604
And thankfully, it's been quiet since then.

663
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,534
Okay, thank you.

Daebong-dong, 183-10.

666
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,053
The number, 233.

667
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,293
Hey! Who are you?

668
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,893
- What are you doing? - Hold on!

669
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:13,592
- Ma'am! - Why are you lurking around?

670
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:15,934
- I'm a police officer! - Why? What?

671
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,463
I'm a police officer, ma'am.

672
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,374
Then why didn't you ring the doorbell?

673
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,243
Why did you lurk around my house? It looked so suspicious.

674
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,974
- My gosh. - I'm sorry. It's getting late.

675
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:28,814
What can I do for you?

676
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:30,784
I have a few questions.

677
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:32,253
What is it?

678
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:35,523
Do you happen to know what these numbers are for?

679
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,684
That's not my address.

680
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:39,494
What is it?

681
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,693
- Mom. - Yes?

682
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,923
Why did you come out?

683
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:48,033
Who's in your family?

684
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:50,334
Me and my kids. Just the three of us.

685
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,534
I don't mean to pry, but what about your husband?

686
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,834
Why do you ask?

687
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,874
I'm interviewing every household in the area.

688
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,073
We don't live together.

689
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,044
I see, I'm sorry.

690
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:04,913
You don't think your kids wrote the numbers, right?

691
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:07,212
They're not tall enough to reach that high.

692
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:08,253
I see.

693
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,153

00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:14,252
Sure. Come on. Let's go back inside.

- Hurry, go inside. - Bye, kiddo.

00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:19,093
- What's wrong with this area? - I'm sorry again.

00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:30,672

700
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,672
Who do you live with?

701
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:34,842
Just me and my sibling. Why do you ask?

702
00:43:34,843 --> 00:43:37,244
Your sibling? Sister or brother?

703
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:38,883
Sister.

704

705
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:42,023
I live alone.

My mom. It's just the two of us.

708
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,604
Every third house, I see a number written on the wall.

Who do you live with?

710
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:05,573
I live with my wife. What's this about?

711
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:08,583
- Who is it? - Hello.

712
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,613

(Daegyeong Waterproofing)

714
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,022
Choi Hwa Yeon's landlord's house had 233 written on the wall.

715
00:44:22,023 --> 00:44:24,494
The house with 2 kids also had 233 written on the wall.

716
00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:26,592
These numbers seem random.

717
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:27,963
What could they mean?

718
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,903
Gosh, that punk...

719
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:45,153
Maybe my granddaughters wrote them when they were visiting?

720
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,314
Me and my kids. Just the three of us.

721
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,052
(Do your duty.)

722
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,763
How many eateries in the area deliver?

723
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:58,633
Like Chinese restaurants and fried chicken joints.

724
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:01,394
- Which places deliver? - See these numbers?

725
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:03,703
What is this?

726
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,232
It shows you who lives in each household.

727
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,572
Two means an adult female. Three means a kid.

728
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:07,704
And the number one...

729
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:10,343
means an adult male.

730
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:13,013
That was the number he avoided, the houses where men live.

731
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:15,243
He deliberately broke into houses where only women or kids live.

732
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:17,882
But what does that have to do with restaurants that deliver?

733
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,553
It has to be someone with a job that allows him...

734
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:22,454
to have an idea of who lives in each household.

735

(Breaking News)

736
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:28,993
This just in.

737
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:32,163
The serial rapist known as "Red Cap"...

738
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:35,663
whom women living in Seoul have been terrified of...

739
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:38,232
was arrested last night.

740
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:39,434
You're heading out already?

741
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:40,973
- Yes. - Dongbu Police Station...

742
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:43,603
- Gosh, isn't that your district... - The police managed...

743
00:45:43,604 --> 00:45:46,613
to arrest the suspect at the scene.

744
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:49,583
The suspect was caught red-handed,

745
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,382
wearing his red cap.

746
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:53,882
He has admitted to all charges and confessed that he is...

747
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:55,683
the real culprit in the Red Cap serial murder case.

748
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:56,982
Do you admit to everything?

749
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:58,252
- Move back. - Just a comment, please.

750
00:45:58,253 --> 00:46:00,152
Is there anything you'd like to say to the bereaved?

751
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:01,293
- Just a comment! - Move back!

752
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:03,462
- Look here! - Say something!

753
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:05,692
- Why did you do it? - How do you feel now?

754
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:06,764
- Just a comment! - Wait!

755
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,563
Do you admit to all charges?

756
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:11,064
- Wait! - Just a comment!

757
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:13,732
Unlike the previous cases...

758
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:16,343
that took place in the victims' homes,

759
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,243
- this incident... - How dare you smirk?

760
00:46:18,244 --> 00:46:19,874
- took place... - Is this fun for you?

761
00:46:20,874 --> 00:46:21,982
Request an arrest warrant.

762
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:23,044
Yes, sir.

763
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,482
Detective, it really wasn't me.

764
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:26,913
Why would I kill Hwa Yeon?

765
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:29,224
- Sit down. - That jerk.

766
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:31,653
Song Ha Young, right?

767
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:35,822
The culprit picked the lock to break in.

768
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:37,192
Look, these numbers...

769
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:38,863
Your friend has already confessed to everything.

770
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:46,203
Goodness. Should I go to a temple somewhere and pray?

771
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,434
Talk about bad timing.

772
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:52,842
How could you kill your own girlfriend?

773
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,843
It really wasn't me. Please believe me.

774
00:46:56,244 --> 00:47:01,152
Hey, I've seen plenty of scumbags who killed their wives, daughters,

775
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:03,623
and even their own parents on the spur of the moment.

776
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:05,253
A girlfriend? That's nothing.

777
00:47:05,624 --> 00:47:07,954
Goodness, me and my bad luck.

778
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:10,893
I caught a murderer,

779
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,593
but that punk is getting all the spotlight now.

780
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:18,403
They only care because she was pregnant.

781
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:20,773
Why did he take her clothes off?

782
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:22,604
I guess he's a perverted punk.

783
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:25,743
You expect me to know his sexual preferences too?

784
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:29,144
If you're that curious, just ask his friend over there.

785
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,814
That guy isn't the culprit.

786
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,084
Get up and follow me.

787
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:41,394
Are you taking him to the Special Crime Squad?

788
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:44,023
Why would he go there? We're the ones who caught this punk.

789
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:45,564
All right.

Please hurry over to the Internal Medicine Department.

He's not the culprit.

802
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,994
Is Bang Ki Hoon the real culprit?

803
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:49,894
His eyes weren't that of a criminal's eyes though.

804
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:57,104

807

who killed my Hwa Yeon.

808
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:12,584
Bang Ki Hoon, the man who was Choi Hwa Yeon's boyfriend...

809
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:16,253
he's the culprit.

810
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,854
Did you say, "boyfriend?"

811
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:23,724
Hwa Yeon had a boyfriend?

812
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:28,764
She hid her pregnancy and even the fact that she had a boyfriend.

813
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:31,164
Is Bang Ki Hoon really the culprit then?

814
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:35,173
Oh, goodness.

815
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:38,813
Of all the things to take after me,

816
00:49:38,814 --> 00:49:42,343
it had to be my bad luck with men.

817
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:55,894
I'm so sorry, Hwa Yeon.

818
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:59,693
I'm sorry, Hwa Yeon.

819
00:50:05,573 --> 00:50:08,874
I should have stayed with her that day.

820
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,874
She asked me to sleep over.

821
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:17,713
She offered but I declined.

822

It's not your fault.

823

Hello?

Chief, this is Ha Young.

Yes?

836
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:51,303
I need to ask you a favour.

837
00:52:01,153 --> 00:52:03,224
- You're here. - Yes.

838
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,284
Here, take this.

Gosh.

00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:13,633
Where is it?

841
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:23,244
They may have missed something in the first investigation.

842
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:24,843
Only this cup is left.

843
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:28,713
If Bang Ki Hoon cleaned it all up, why would he have left just this?

844
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:30,442
Everything matches.

845
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:33,184
From his fingerprints, bloodstain, and time of death.

846
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:35,584
He even confessed.

847
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,123
That's true, but...

848
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:39,994
You just got to Dongbu Station, will you be all right?

849
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,323
I came because you asked as a favour,

850
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,293
but just as a case is important, relationships are important too...

851
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,704
You're right. But right now, it's more important to catch the culprit.

852
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,604
You never give in to anything.

853
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:56,673
I heard you were friends with the suspect?

854
00:52:58,544 --> 00:52:59,773
Did you run a background check on me?

855
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,943
"Background check," you say? I call it, "having interest."

856
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,382
We're basically strangers.

857
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,013
Even if he were my friend, nothing would change.

858
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:10,023
- As I told you earlier... - All right, I got it.

859
00:53:11,184 --> 00:53:13,454
You're enough human interaction that I need.

860
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:16,764
That's why I couldn't refuse, you know that, right?

861
00:53:17,624 --> 00:53:18,724
Thank you.

862
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,193
Express it a little for me then.

863
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:23,934
- Here? - No, forget it.

864
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:29,942
The fact he was calm enough to erase his footprints and fingerprints...

865
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:31,874
makes it highly likely that this was a planned crime.

866
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:35,943
A woman living alone in a one-bedroom like this...

867
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,784
He may have been hiding and waiting for her.

868
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,253
Either from underneath this bed...

869
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:49,963
or behind here.

870
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:21,854
Hey! Are you crazy?

871
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:25,494
Gosh, darn it.

872
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:30,934
Why did you ask for fingerprints on a case that's done? Why?

873
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,773
You said that Bang Ki Hoon isn't your friend.

874
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:35,703
It's not because he's my friend.

875
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:39,643
Friend or not. This case is over.

876
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,173
Bang Ki Hoon admitted to it!

877
00:54:44,883 --> 00:54:46,712
That's because you forced a confession out of him...

878
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,053
You're a complete lunatic, aren't you?

879
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:52,652
Is Bang Ki Hoon stupid? Why would he say he killed her when he didn't?

880
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:54,652
He took back what he said though.

881
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:57,794
Darn it, you crazy lunatic!

882
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,863
Is it your hobby to screw your superiors over?

883
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,003
What's the problem?

884
00:55:06,104 --> 00:55:08,533
I'm just saying, Bang Ki Hoon may not be the culprit.

885
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:09,604
If he's not...

886
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:12,974
if Bang Ki Hoon isn't the culprit.

887
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:15,414
What are you going to do about it?

888
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:18,814
If that becomes the case, we'll have a bigger problem.

889
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:21,552
You know it well yourself.

890
00:55:21,553 --> 00:55:23,353
- Know what, you punk? - Captain!

891
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:24,723
- Is there something you know? - Calm down.

892
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:26,293
- You know nothing, you punk! - Please!

893
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:27,893
Step outside for a moment, please!

894
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:29,422
Calm down, Captain.

895
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:30,494
Hey!

896
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:34,132
You better fix your attitude if you want to keep this career.

897
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:35,164
You got it?

898
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:37,604
(Detective Division)

899
00:55:41,173 --> 00:55:43,474
- Yes? - Inspector, Song Ha Young?

900
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,773
I'm calling to notify that the fingerprint results are in.

901
00:55:47,573 --> 00:55:49,843
But we were unable to confirm the identity.

902
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:58,383
I understand the frustration...

903
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,354
but you have to accept the outcome.

904
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:02,956
- Hi. - Yes, hi.

905
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:07,994
My instincts are telling me otherwise.

906
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:10,863
I know we can't take a detective's instincts lightly.

907
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:14,533
But we have definite evidence and his confession too.

908
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:15,673
That's true, but...

909
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:19,003
The fact that Choi Hwa Yeon's wallet disappeared...

910
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:21,544
how she was left undressed,

911
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:23,144
and the trace of breaking in.

912
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,613
On top of that, the number that seemed marked by the culprit.

913
00:56:25,854 --> 00:56:27,713
All those things are bothering me.

914
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:30,724
If it were a premeditated crime...

915
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:33,423
why did he leave her undressed?

916
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:36,794
He would've been busy trying to cover up his traces.

917
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:40,834
Have you heard about profilers?

918
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:44,863
We call them criminal behavioural analysts.

919
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:47,303
All the qualifications that a profiler needs,

920
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:49,604
you have them all.

921
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:53,572
First, refusing to give up just like you are now.

922
00:56:53,573 --> 00:56:55,713
- All detectives are... - Next is having an open mind.

923
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:59,213
Intuition, general knowledge, and the skill to analyze logically.

924
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:01,712
You also need to be able to detach personal feelings and other things.

925
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,084
But more important than all that...

926
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,153
The thing I find most important is sensitivity.

927
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:08,494
"Sensitivity?"

928
00:57:08,653 --> 00:57:11,794
Would you understand better if I say it's sensitivity towards others?

929
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:13,834
Why would you need that?

930
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,633
Because it's a job that analyzes people's hearts.

931
00:57:19,164 --> 00:57:21,773
Goodness. You only say the most confusing stuff.

932
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:24,503
Hey, take this.

933
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,044
Give it a read when you have time.

934
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:30,343
And these.

935
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:32,414
Have some when you have time.

936
00:57:34,014 --> 00:57:37,284
Thank you. What is this?

937
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,553
I'm making an attempt to create a new team.

938
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:42,454
I think I found the right guy...

939
00:57:43,363 --> 00:57:45,093
as a criminal behavioural analyst.

940
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:48,764
It's a perfect job for someone like you.

941
00:57:48,963 --> 00:57:50,303
I'm fine with what I do now.

942
00:57:52,104 --> 00:57:54,433
Hey, if you turn me down before you even consider it,

943
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:55,573
you'll hurt my feelings.

944
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:00,044
Anyway, the thing is,

945
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:03,113
it's tough to tell what you're thinking,

946
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,343
but that's a strength for a profiler.

947
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:07,482
Are you teasing me?

948
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,684
No, I'm very serious.

949
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:12,693
You don't have to decide right away.

950
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:14,954
It'll take some time anyway.

951
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:19,733
But for now, just remember that there is...

952
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:21,894
something like this.

953
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:31,698
Where are you going after making her faint?

954
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,468
What did you do after you made her faint?

955
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:34,537
(Suspect)

956
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:36,608
Yes, you got on top of her.

957
00:58:37,258 --> 00:58:38,586
You got on top of her and strangled her, right?

958
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:39,857
How did you strangle her?

959
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:41,928
Her neck.

960
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:44,368
It was her neck, right?

961
00:58:45,997 --> 00:58:48,568
Man, this guy is driving me insane.

962
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:51,667
Hey, your hands weren't like that.

963
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:56,707
You pushed your hands up to her chin and strangled her.

964
00:58:56,948 --> 00:58:59,078
Start pressing.

965
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,948
You did this, so why don't you remember?

966
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:03,948
Continue.

967
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:07,488
We're running out of time. Hurry up.

968
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:09,287
Keep taking the video.

969
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:13,797
After you strangled her, what's next?

970
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:15,658
And then what? You unbuttoned her shirt.

971
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:18,397
Take her clothes off.

972
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:21,567
Why did you kill your girlfriend?

973
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:24,206
Tell us the motive of your murder!

974
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:27,007
- Move aside. - Say something!

975
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:29,606
- Please move. - Why did you kill her?

976
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,348
- What's your motive? - Murderer!

977
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:33,547
- Why did you kill her? - What's the reason?

978
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,047
- Say something! - Why did you do it?

979
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:37,147
- You murderer! - Why did you kill her?

980
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:41,787
Please move aside!

981
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:44,126
- No! - Please move!

982
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:45,857
No!

983
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:48,457
Bring my daughter back!

984
00:59:50,028 --> 00:59:53,267
The victim lost her irreplaceable and precious life...

985
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:55,397
at such a young age,

986
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:59,638
and it is clear the victim's family will live in pain...

987
00:59:59,937 --> 01:00:03,348
for the rest of her life, along with a psychological shock.

988
01:00:06,017 --> 01:00:08,078
The crime of taking another person's life is...

989
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:10,488
serious and unacceptable...

990
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:13,686
and the accused did not reflect on his crime...

991
01:00:13,687 --> 01:00:15,087
despite his history of assault.

992
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:18,427
The judiciary concluded that his crime was heinous.

993
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:19,496
(Daebong-dong Murder Case, Judgement)

994
01:00:19,497 --> 01:00:22,357
Hence, the court sentences Bang Ki Hoon, the accused,

995
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:25,727
to 12 years in prison.

(We do not take bribes to alter the investigation in any way.)

999
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,496
Pak Se Ri did not give up in the midst of her crisis...

1000
01:00:59,497 --> 01:01:01,166
and showed her concentration until the end.

1001
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:04,666
North Korea test-fired a new ballistic missile today.

1002
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,976
Today at 5:40pm, with the sound of a foghorn,

1003
01:01:06,977 --> 01:01:09,137
a historic departure was made for Mount Geumgang...

1004
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:11,706
The European Union's unified currency was launched...

1005
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,717
to unite the 300 million Europeans into one economic bloc,

1006
01:01:13,718 --> 01:01:15,277
named the Euro.

1007
01:01:15,278 --> 01:01:16,947
Park Chan Ho, a pitcher in the MLB...

1008
01:01:16,948 --> 01:01:19,617
hit a two-base hit worth two points and more,

1009
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:21,487
playing as a pitcher and a batter,

1010
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:23,356
scoring his second victory of the season.

1011
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:25,927
Shin Chang Won was finally caught.

1012
01:01:25,928 --> 01:01:28,626
Shin Chang Won, the man behind the escape of the century,

1013
01:01:28,627 --> 01:01:31,967
came to an end this afternoon thanks to a civilian's report.

1014
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:33,967
Let's hear the report on Shin Chang Won's arrest...

1015
01:01:33,968 --> 01:01:35,738
from Reporter Choi Yong Beom.

1016
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:41,107
Believe in Christ, go to heaven. Disbelief will send you to hell.

1017
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:44,678
Believe in Christ, and you shall go to heaven.

1018
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:47,048
If you do not, you'll be sent to hell.

1019
01:01:47,218 --> 01:01:48,246
Believe in Christ, go to heaven.

1020
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,347
- Disbelief will send you to hell. - The police...

1021
01:01:50,348 --> 01:01:51,618
I'm back.

1022
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:53,117
You brought it back?

1023
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:54,757
Goodness, you didn't have to.

1024
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:56,057
It was right around the corner.

1025
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:58,827
Good work, Kang Moo. You should go home.

1026
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:00,158
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:02,056
- Good work today. - Good work.

1028
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:03,396
Take good care of your grandma.

1029
01:02:03,397 --> 01:02:05,328
- Okay. Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1030
01:02:06,738 --> 01:02:09,198
He's very diligent, unlike other kids these days.

1031
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:13,008
I hope my son can be half a man like Kang Moo.

1032
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:16,206
Teens these days are all like your kid.

1033
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:17,807
He's the odd one out.

1034
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:22,278
Whenever he gets paid, he takes it to his grandmother.

1035
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:24,118
There's no kid like him these days.

1036
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:27,258
Does he think he's my dad or what?

1037
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:31,888
(Sungwon Restaurant)

1038
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:40,857
Dal Sik.

1039
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,167
Why didn't you tell me about Dae Hyub?

1040
01:04:48,727 --> 01:04:51,298
(Stay tuned for the epilogue.)

1041
01:04:51,598 --> 01:04:56,267
(Through the Darkness)

1042
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:31,807
Ha Young, what did you do with your friends today?

1043
01:05:34,337 --> 01:05:37,278
This lady looks sad.

1044
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:42,778
- Yes. - Why is she sad?

1045
01:05:48,957 --> 01:05:52,686
Do you know how scary it is when you're deep underwater?

1046
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:54,126
(Youngshin Supermarket)

1047
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:57,627
She must've been scared and sad.

1048
01:05:59,468 --> 01:06:02,198
Her mom isn't there in the water.

1049
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:07,607
Ha Young, come here.

1050
01:06:11,477 --> 01:06:14,647
It's not that Ha Young is unable to feel anything.

1051
01:06:14,977 --> 01:06:17,217
He can feel them way too deeply.

1052
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:19,448
I'm not sure if you'll understand him.

1053
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:23,158
But he can look deeply into people's inner side.

1054
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:24,727
Their inner side?

1055
01:06:25,788 --> 01:06:28,227
Ha Young. What about your umbrella?

1056
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,887
I gave you an umbrella this morning.

1057
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:32,797
Where is it?

1058
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:36,791
Ha Young is only nine years old.

1059
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,594
It's because he's a child.

1060
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,284
He sees a gap between his feelings and other people's reactions.

1061
01:06:45,681 --> 01:06:49,751
He must have realized that he is different from the others.

1062
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:51,840
Seeing the dead body that day...

1063
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:54,758
triggered this thought in his head.

1064
01:06:55,697 --> 01:07:00,537
So he's trying to hide his emotions.

1065
01:07:00,857 --> 01:07:02,198
Don't worry, Ha Young.

1066
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:04,407
I will bury it in a nice place.

1067
01:07:07,307 --> 01:07:08,376
Come here.

1068
01:07:24,594 --> 01:07:26,904
I want to know why you thought he didn't do it.

1069
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:28,503
If you fail to catch him again, things will get worse.

1070
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:30,673

1072
01:07:32,704 --> 01:07:35,303
and received help from the inmate. And this news shocked the public.

1073
01:07:35,304 --> 01:07:38,343
A detective kept visiting him...

1074
01:07:38,344 --> 01:07:39,984
and asking him for advice.

1075
01:07:39,985 --> 01:07:41,784
Criminals understand each other better.

1076
01:07:41,785 --> 01:07:43,083
It's about the Behavioural Analysis Team.

1077
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:44,383
I think we can finally set it up.

1078
01:07:44,384 --> 01:07:47,053
Other people might not understand why we need this, but you know...

1079
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:48,184
that we need this.

1080
01:07:48,185 --> 01:07:50,954
And I am certain that you are the perfect man for the job.

1081
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:57,305
(Tomorrow at 10pm)
