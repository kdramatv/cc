(This drama may contain disturbing and brutal scenes.)

6
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,796
Are you investigating this case as a serial murder?

7
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,465
It's too early to confirm that.

8
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:28,066
As you know,

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,035
these murders took place in different districts.

10
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,674
It's been over a month after the Suseong-dong incident.

11
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,397
You still haven't made any progress?

12
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,268
The detectives in those districts and the Special Crime Squad...

13
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,638
are doing their best.

14
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,037
Are you sure this isn't a serial murder?

15
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,748
Everyone, please.

16
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:49,617
Don't jump to conclusions. You'll only scare the public.

17
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,147
I heard the MO for all three cases was the same.

18
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:53,857
And your answer is still a no?

19
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:55,488
Just look at these murders.

20
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,888
Are you sure there wasn't any accomplice?

21
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,827
Is there a reason behind not treating this a serial murder?

22
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,327
Since these incidents took place in different districts,

23
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:04,997
they couldn't have been a one-man job.

24
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,367
Take this. You dropped this. Look.

25
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,218
- I'm sorry. - That was so not cool.

26
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:07,728
What's going on?

27
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,298
Gosh.

28
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:16,738
Hello?

29
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,138
It's an alarm.

30
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:26,978
Just last September,

31
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,478
there had been three break-ins that led to murders.

32
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:31,488
But the police still haven't found a suspect...

33
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,988
- Kitty, slow down. Okay? - which is alarming the public.

34
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,488
The police announced that they are taking various approaches...

35
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,587
to investigate these three murder cases.

36
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,728
Some people are suggesting that the culprit targeted...

37
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,298
wealthy senior citizens.

38
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,198
But the police announced...

39
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:48,437
that grouping individual cases...

40
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,067
into one serial case was a risky move.

41
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,074
- Without any definitive proof, - Hey. Take this.

42
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,743
- the police dispatched... - What's that?

43
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,114
more resources to question more people.

44
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:57,014
So they are focused more on legwork.

45
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:59,313
- But they haven't found a lead yet. - Okay.

46
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,114
- The police are open... - Bye.

47
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,984
to other possibilities such as...

48
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:05,083
robberies or crimes of passion by the victims' acquaintances.

49
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,424
And the police are following up on other possibilities.

50
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:26,074
Listen. Detectives like us...

51
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,974
who do all the legwork catch the culprits.

52
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:32,514
When we were canvassing these neighborhoods...

53
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,854
to the point that we got blisters,

54
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:35,813
what did those district cops do?

55
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,183
Yes. I'm glad you brought that up.

56
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,984
Where were you in all of this?

57
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:40,924
Right. You were at a sauna.

58
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,694
I went there once!

59
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,023
Yes. I know that.

60
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,264
You went to the sauna once, the go club once,

61
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:46,493
and the Internet cafe once.

62
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,394
Are you having fun playing a computer game with high schoolers?

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,364
You're 40 years old, for goodness' sake.

64
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,974
Do you think she's the type to tell on me about that?

65
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:57,003
You punk. I have ears too.

66
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,343
I believe it is necessary to set the boundaries...

67
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,873
between our squad and the Behavioral Analysis Team.

68
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,984
Right. That's my point.

69
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:07,083
They just wear suits and act all cool.

70
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,313
They just have meetings like some scholars.

71
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:10,683
What do you think they can do?

72
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,523
As long as they can pinpoint a suspect,

73
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,153
it doesn't matter if they have meetings...

74
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,154
like scholars or standing on their heads.

75
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,364
What do you care?

76
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,393
Entering the crime scene as they please...

77
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,993
is obstructing the investigation.

78
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,534
Captain Kook isn't the chief of the Forensics Squad anymore.

79
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,303
And Song Ha Young was always into playing the hero.

80
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:30,243
He keeps crossing the line. You know how he is.

81
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,344
I won't participate in making personal attacks.

82
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:33,914
What?

83
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:38,883
Other teams aren't happy with the Behavioral Analysis Team.

84
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,513
If there are no boundaries between us and them,

85
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:44,984
whenever we get cases, there's bound to be a conflict.

86
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,084
Listen.

87
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,323
They are taking the lead on their own.

88
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,964
- How can I stop them? - Gosh.

89
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,393
Besides, they aren't really getting in your way.

90
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,534
They can actually help you out.

91
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,433
Goodness. Did you all have coffee this morning?

92
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,133
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

93
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,003
Come on! What's the matter with you?

94
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:07,013
What's going on in there?

95
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,013
It's too early to be yelling at this hour.

96
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,313
Well, the thing is...

97
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:13,753
Yesterday, when Chief Kim Bong Sik...

98
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,414
went to check out the area in Jinjung-dong,

99
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:16,984
he ran into Inspector Song.

100
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,953
Darn it, that little...

101
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,393
Gosh.

102
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:24,823
- It's... - Captain Yoon and I...

103
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,633
also run into him whenever we go...

104
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,234
to Suseong-dong or Gungok-dong.

105
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,104
It seems like Inspector Song...

106
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,964
is visiting all the scenes on a daily basis,

107
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:35,303
so people are talking.

108
00:05:36,174 --> 00:05:38,373
- Captain Yoon. - Yes, sir.

109
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,914
As police officers, it is our job to catch criminals.

110
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:43,243
Whether he's trying to play a hero or not,

111
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,013
let's not doubt his genuine intentions.

112
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:48,683
I don't doubt his intentions.

113
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,823
- Hello, sir. - What's going on?

114
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,623
The Behavioral Analysis Team reports directly to me.

115
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,534
What's your problem?

116
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,464
If you have a problem, talk to me.

117
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,174
It's not a big deal, sir. There was a small misunderstanding.

118
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,633
Ban the Behavioral Analysis Team from entering the scenes.

119
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,943
Oh, that's what you want?

120
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:13,274
That's it?

121
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:16,813
Sure, fine.

122
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:20,784
If you have a problem with that, I'll be sure to let them know.

123
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,914
- Thank you, sir. - But the thing is,

124
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,753
I can't stop them if they want to conduct their own investigations.

125
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,594
They're cutting down on sleep to do that...

126
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,364
on top of conscientiously completing their own tasks,

127
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,834
so I can't tell them not to do that.

128
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,604
I can't dictate how much sleep they get.

129
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,534
Right, they're not kids.

130
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:42,404
We're not asking you to just go ahead and stop them.

131
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:45,703
I think the Behavioral Analysis Team needs to understand that...

132
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,813
they're not one of our investigation teams.

133
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,544

00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,903
- You can't touch that. - You can't come in here now.

181
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,503
- No, stop! - My goodness.

182
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,834
- Don't touch anything. - Darn it.

183
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,204
Get out of my way. Get rid of this stench first, idiot!

184
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,503
You're contaminating the scene.

185
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,013
Darn it. Let go!

186
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,383
Gosh.

187
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,283
- There he is. - Hey.

188
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,984
Hey, how did the fire break out?

189
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,153
The culprit tried to set the house on fire.

190
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,293
Thankfully, the fire died out after partially burning the body...

191
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:22,554
and the ceiling.

192
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,163
Then maybe it was someone else.

193
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:27,094
We'd have to look into it further, but a blunt weapon was used.

194
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,003
The triangle again?

195
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,204
(Forensics)

196
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,304
Gosh, this is insane.

197
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,974
What is happening?

198
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,604
Then why did the culprit start the fire?

199
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,273
Maybe there was something that the culprit wanted to hide.

200
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,383
We're looking into that too.

201
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,714
Then I'll return to the office...

202
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,084
and collect statements from the bereaved.

203
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:48,253
Okay, sure.

204
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,423
How long do you think this will take?

205
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,954
There was a fire, so I'd say about ten hours.

206
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,753
By the way, what's Kim Bong Sik doing inside?

207
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,824
I have no idea. Why is he...

208
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,434
I'll lift all his prints...

209
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,964
and submit them as evidence.

210
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,633
- Darn it. - All right, I'm sorry.

211
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,064
- Take it easy. - Get back to work.

212
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,234
- Take it easy. - Thank you.

213
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,903
- What happened? - No idea.

214
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,734
- What is going on? - Hey.

215
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:10,804
- Gil Pyo. - Yes.

216
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,074
I told you not to smoke and contaminate the scenes.

217
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,074
I'm just frustrated. They said it'd take ten hours.

218
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,214
Frustrated, my foot.

219
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,444
How many of these did we find last time?

220
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,783
Do you want to end up on the list of suspects again?

221
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,554
Why are you here? Did you come here to nag me?

222
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,114
Whatever. Anyway, what happened?

223
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,184
The Forensics Squad is investigating the scene now.

224
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,954
We're waiting too.

225
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,153
You guys in the Analysis Team should return to the office.

226
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,824
How could we go back to the office now?

227
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,224
Gosh, seriously.

228
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,293
Captain Kook.

229
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,263
Chief Kim Bong Sik is inside.

230
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,403
He's inside?

231
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,064
- Kim Bong Sik, this little... - Hey.

232
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,033
- Hey, stop. - This is wrong.

233
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,444
You're no longer in the Forensics Squad.

234
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,344
And you know that Kim Bong Sik likes to talk.

235
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,643
Look, many eyes are watching.

236
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:49,373
If people start to complain about your team...

237
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,614
frequenting the scenes, things will get complicated for all of us.

238
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,684
Both you and Superintendent Baek are here.

239
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,153
Why should I walk on eggshells around him?

240
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,623
We can't have your back forever.

241
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:00,084
The two teams must respect each other's boundaries.

242
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:02,054
You were the one who came up with this system.

243
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,724
Exactly. Just go back to the office and wait.

244
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,493
We'll share all the updates with you.

245
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,094
Why must we argue about this now?

246
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,163
- Just go back to the office. - I'm so angry right now.

247
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:15,234
Why is he standing there alone, looking all serious?

248
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,413
Let's go for a smoke.

249
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,344
Sure, let's go.

250
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,614
- Go somewhere far. - I can smoke over there, right?

251
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,444
- Not within a 50m-radius. - Fine, I heard you!

252
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,354
The culprit must've tried to burn the house down.

253
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:30,883
Yes, there's the burning smell.

254
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:33,383
Who's the victim?

255
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,023
A female in her 60s.

256
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,393
A quiet alley in an affluent residential area.

257
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,734
Of course, I don't see a single security camera.

258
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,033
But an arson attempt. That's a first.

259
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:48,704
It was probably premeditated, right?

260
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,944
But it's a little odd.

261
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,714
What's odd?

262
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,344
The 1st incident took place on September 12.

263
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:57,444
The 2nd one, on the 24th. The 3rd one, on the 30th.

264
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,054
The interval between the cases had gone down from 12 to 6 days.

265
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:03,383
But now, it has increased to a month.

266
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,484
If this really is a premeditated serial murder case,

267
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,893
such decreased intervals and sporadic patterns...

268
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,594
mean that the killer is becoming bolder.

269
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:18,503
However, it took the killer a month to commit this murder.

270
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,903
There must've been a reason.

271
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,844
What could it be?

272
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,214
Was it suicide?

273
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,354
What caused the fire? Was it attempted arson?

274
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,283
- Move back. - Did the fire kill the victim?

275
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,653
- Or was it murder? - Move back!

276
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:39,184
Have you identified a suspect yet?

277
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,393
Is that Yoon Tae Gu from the Seoul HQ?

278
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,493
There have been many murders lately. How do you plan to prevent crime?

279
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,434
- Was the victim murdered? - Just a comment, please!

280
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,934
- What exactly happened? - Tell us!

281
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,903
- Is this a homicide case? - Tell us!

282
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:55,934
Was the victim murdered...

283
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,773
Earlier today, at around 11:10am on Thursday, October 30,

284
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,743
Yoon Jung Yoon, a 65-year-old female,

285
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:03,913
was found dead in her home in Hwanghwa-dong, Seoul.

286
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:06,743
She was attacked with a blunt weapon.

287
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,013
Her husband, Han Jong Yong,

288
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,923
saw that their house was filled with smoke...

289
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,324
upon returning home from work...

290
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:15,023
and called it in.

291
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:16,753
What was used to start the fire?

292
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,224
We believe that the culprit used newspaper and paper...

293
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:21,263
to start the fire.

294
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:22,633
Any lead on the culprit?

295
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,604
We can't tell you anything at the moment.

296
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,373
We're restricting access to the scene as we wait...

297
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:30,643
for the Forensics Squad's preliminary results,

298
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:33,143
so we can't share any details with you at the moment.

299
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,773
I hope you all understand.

300
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,243
Was anything stolen from the scene? Cash or any valuables?

301
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,283
How did she get in here?

302
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,753
At the moment, it doesn't seem like anything was stolen.

303
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,883
Do you still think it was done by someone who knew the victim?

304
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,393
We are considering every possibility.

305
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:49,753
As I mentioned earlier,

306
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:51,923
we're still waiting for the preliminary results...

307
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,694
Do you admit that this may be connected to the cases...

308
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,033
that occurred in Suseong-dong, Gungok-dong, and Jinjung-dong?

309
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,304
Serial murders targeting affluent senior citizens.

310
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,903
Do you admit it?

311
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,773
Well...

312
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:06,074
We plan to expand the investigation keeping in mind...

313
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,043
the possibility that the culprit could be the same person.

314
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,283
Do you think there was an accomplice as in the Jijon Family case?

315
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,584
There wasn't any accomplice?

316
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,253
Are they related?

317
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,753
- Do you have any speculations? - Are the cases related?

318
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,123
Excuse me, reporters. I apologize.

319
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:21,054
I'm sure you have more questions,

320
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,194
but that's all for today's briefing.

321
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:26,293
We will do our best to arrest the culprit,

322
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,763
so please give us some time.

323
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:28,793
Thank you.

324
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,464
- Where are you going? - That's it?

325
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,903
- Are those done by the same guy? - Is everything related?

326
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,204
Breaking news.

327
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,304
This morning in a residential area in Hwanghwa-dong,

328
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,944
a woman in her 60s was murdered.

329
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,814
The police launched an investigation.

330
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,273
The police believe these cases of wealthy elderly murders are...

331
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:46,084
possibly planned as serial murder.

332
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:48,554
The police identified the culprit of the Hwanghwa-dong incident...

333
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:50,554
as the same one who committed...

334
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:52,623
the three previous murders of the elderly.

335
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,724
They repeatedly stated they would expand the investigation...

336
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:56,954
to a serial murder case.

337
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,434

(Scientific Investigations Team)

341
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:24,923
(Forensics)

342
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,234
Why did he suddenly start a fire?

343
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,633
He tried doing something he had never done before.

344
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,173
Did you find any inflammable?

345
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:44,804
- Check out this area first. - Okay, sure.

346
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,454
He didn't prepare anything in particular.

347
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,484
I think he started it with newspaper.

348
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,484
If he didn't carry any inflammable here,

349
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,023
I don't think he sought after psychological exhilaration...

350
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:01,893
as most arsonists do.

351
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,864
If he was after psychological exhilaration,

352
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,623
he would've stayed and watched the fire grow bigger.

353
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:07,893
He probably would have.

354
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,004
I'm sure he came across an expected situation.

355
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,334
He either wanted to destroy traces he didn't want anyone to see.

356
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:16,673
Or it could've been his trace.

357
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,713
He failed to open the safe.

358
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:24,044
Maybe this was a copycat crime.

359
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,584
He wasn't keen on taking the valuables until now.

360
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:28,383
But he used the same weapon.

361
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:32,653
Triangular?

362
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:38,264
Then let's check the body first.

363
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,433
(Joy, prayer, thanks)

364
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:49,104
He destroyed the cross. An unnecessary act.

365
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:56,473
Mallet. Hammer. Brick.

366
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,614
We took everything we can find...

367
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,913
to see if any of those could leave a triangular mark,

368
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,114
but none of those.

369
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,123
Do you think he made the weapon himself?

370
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,423
The murder weapon?

371
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:07,923
I mean, we can't seem to find it.

372
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,864
His choice of a blunt weapon rather than a sharp one shows...

373
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,324
the anger built within this culprit.

374
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,764
On what has he become this furious...

375
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,133
to brutally kill complete strangers?

376
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,574
Let's check.

377
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:24,844
May I borrow a notebook?

378
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,614
- Thank you. - First off, the front.

379
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:31,413
One, two, three, four.

380
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,314
On the head, one...

381
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:46,994
He isn't after money.

382
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:49,364
It wasn't done by an acquaintance who holds a grudge.

383
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,633
In that case,

384
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:56,534
where did his anger that ultimately made him...

385
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:00,004
attack these helpless wealthy victims stem from?

386
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,314
Are you sure?

387
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:06,483
Yesterday night, he wanted to put that jacket on,

388
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,014
but he changed into something else,

389
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,284
then left it on the sofa before he left.

390
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,064
But come the morning,

391
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,994
the jacket was gone.

392
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:22,764
Maybe the victim moved it somewhere.

393
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:25,034
So I asked the chief of Forensics to find his jacket first.

394
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,963
He looked for it twice, but he never found it.

395
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,903
He left the money and valuables,

396
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:34,473
and all he took was a black jacket?

397
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,913
It suddenly got chilly this morning.

398
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,784
This is such a shame.

399
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:44,683
If we had cameras in the alleys, we would've found him by now.

400
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:48,193
We put up many more at the beginning of this year.

401
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,123
When we never had these, I never even thought about it,

402
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,324
but I guess I began to feel this way ever since we began to put them up.

403
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,334
They're making the control center or something next year,

404
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:57,403
so that's something to look forward to.

405
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,463
Over there.

406
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:03,233
(Mini Mart)

407
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,574
They're all wearing black.

408
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,044
But it's just a day's worth.

409
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,814
- Find someone in hiking boots. - Okay.

410
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,854
He carried a big weapon around,

411
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,723
so I'll find someone with a backpack too.

412
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:18,854
Once you screen them,

413
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,854
ask the husband if it's the jacket he lost.

414
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,893
Yes.

415
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,893
Goodness, Reporter Im Moo Sik.

416
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,594
I always gave you the information.

417
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,804
If we find anything, I'll let you know first.

418
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,433
Hey, wait.

419
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,643
Why? Did you find something?

420
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,514
(Gungok-dong, Hwanghwa-dong)

421
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,844
Man, look at this guy.

422
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:47,913
(Suseong-dong, Jinjung-dong)

423
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:50,953
- I'll call you back. - One second.

424
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:54,794
Gil Pyo!

425
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:59,524
- This jerk. - What? Did you find anything?

426
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,564
Listen up.

427
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:02,794
Suseong.

428
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:04,864
Gungok.

429
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,433
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

430
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:09,173
What about them?

431
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,244
They have the same consonants.

432
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,373
Darn it. Explain it so that I can understand.

433
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,143
Suseong. S and S.

434
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,774
Gungok. G and G.

435
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,814
- Jinjung. - J and J.

436
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,213
- Hwanghwa. - H and H!

437
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:27,723
Look, they are all located in places with good access.

438
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:30,354
Not only are there luxurious residential districts,

439
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:33,064
it's accessible by public transit, and all these towns have...

440
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,094
a concentrated area of adult entertainment businesses.

441
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,094
So what?

442
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,403
The investigation team says he must've gone around in a car...

443
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,064
because he was never seen...

444
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,733
even though he committed the crimes in a large area.

445
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,334
But it might be quite the opposite.

446
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,574
Oh, he uses public transit?

447
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:48,244
In Tak said there's a jacket missing, right?

448
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,244
Yes, if that's true,

449
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,244
it's another proof for our second theory.

450
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,754
The temperature dropped even lower this morning,

451
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,314
so if he didn't have a car,

452
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,983
he would've needed a jacket or something.

453
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,524
- We can make another assumption. - What is it?

454
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:04,494
He could've needed to hide his bloodstained clothes.

455
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:06,794
If that's the case,

456
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,393
then shouldn't we have many more witnesses?

457
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,933
I mean, he used public transit.

458
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,534
Even if he went around with bloodstained clothes,

459
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,703
most people wouldn't have noticed...

460
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:18,574
unless they saw him near the crime scene.

461
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:20,604
Right, you're right.

462
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:23,044
He wouldn't go around telling people he's a murderer.

463
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,483
Also, surprisingly,

464
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,213
people aren't too interested in others.

465
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:30,213
Due to their inattentiveness,

466
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,824
they wouldn't get suspicious...

467
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:35,223
nor perceive it as strange even if they saw his bloody clothes,

468
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:36,554
just as Hwang Dae Sun said.

469
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,524
Yes.

470
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,804
(Gungok-dong, Hwanghwa-dong, Suseong-dong, Jinjung-dong)

471
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,903
(Restricted Area, Authorized personnel only)

472
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,943
That man. Is that the jacket?

473
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,254
Hello?

474
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,094
Yes, Chief.

475
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:19,633
(Chief of Forensics, Oh In Tak)

476
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,534
To sum up,

477
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,034
the culprit probably doesn't have a car,

478
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,804
and he's a guy with a foot size between 260mm to 265mm?

479
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:29,074
One second.

480
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,744
Hello, Captain Kook Young Soo of Behavioral Analysis Team...

481
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:34,913
Hey, In Tak.

482
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,483
All right.

483
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,784
Fax it over right away. Thanks.

484
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,294
We can stop looking for the shoes.

485
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:45,824
They found it?

486
00:23:46,364 --> 00:23:48,594
- Which brand is it? - He'll fax it to me.

487
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,733
Wait, how does this make any sense?

488
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,544
Why doesn't it? It fits perfectly.

489
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:02,244
Have you found any evidence more trustworthy than this?

490
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,483
You should dispatch some men in Bangbae-dong.

491
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:07,413
You need to stop the fifth murder!

492
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,443
You're all here. Take a look at this.

493
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:38,544
- You found it? - You found something?

494
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,983
The hiking shoes...

495
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:43,213
Why do you have this?

496
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,123
If you want to get cranky, you should do your job first.

497
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,024
I don't want any inconvenience either.

498
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,294
What is it?

499
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:53,294
Darn it, the chief of Forensics is doing his job weirdly.

500
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,733
Not as weirdly as the chief of the Special Crime Squad.

501
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,604
- What? - You're with the superintendent.

502
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:00,104
- Okay. - Over here. This one.

503
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:01,233
We found him.

504
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,604
Yes, but you're a step too late.

505
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:05,004
I mean the CCTV footage.

506
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,304
We got a shot of the back of the culprit.

507
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:19,883
What are we supposed to do with that?

508
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:23,423
We're still in a tight spot with or without leads.

509
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:26,163
We won't be able to find anything with that.

510
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,264
Come to the conference room now.

511
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,494
We caught the back of the culprit on the security camera.

512
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,133
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

513
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,844
Did you forget something?

514
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:40,304
- Should I go and fetch it now? - No. Wait.

515
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:45,443
It's not his face. It's his back.

516
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:47,683
Right. Yes.

517
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,923
Let's dispatch some people in Bangbae-dong.

518
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,653
And why don't we interrogate people...

519
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,153
with the same hiking shoes in the area?

520
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,024
There will be countless people who own the same hiking shoes...

521
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,393
of the same size just in Seoul.

522
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:02,094
We won't be able to track people who bought the shoes with cash.

523
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,364
We should start with the neighborhoods...

524
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,963
like we're taking a census.

525
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,403
I think doing the legwork will give us accurate information.

526
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:08,774
It's not just one neighborhood.

527
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:11,844
As you know, these murders took place all over Seoul.

528
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,473
Sir, why are we going to Bangbae-dong?

529
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,314
What? Oh, that?

530
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:24,114
All right. Listen up.

531
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:26,054
Suseong. Gungok.

532
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,693
Jinjung. Hwanghwa.

533
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,594
Anything?

534
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:33,393
You idiots.

535
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,494
S and S. G and G.

536
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,834
The syllables start with the same consonants.

537
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,233
Let's put out an APB.

538
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:46,373
What nonsense is that?

539
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,713
We must put out an APB.

540
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:50,213
How could we put out an APB with just that?

541
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:53,044
Come on in. You're here. So join us.

542
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,814
Come on in. And take us step by step.

543
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:01,453
We must broadcast it on the nine o'clock national news.

544
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,024
He's driving me crazy. Come on.

545
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,094
But we know nothing about the guy or even have a composite sketch.

546
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:10,094
You want us to do that with just the footage that shows his back?

547
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,604
Having the footage of his back won't make any difference.

548
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,433
About 99 percent of the tips we receive won't be useful.

549
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,943
Then it will only complicate our investigation.

550
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,443
But when he keeps a low profile,

551
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,014
we can buy time.

552
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,574
I think it's a good idea.

553
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:26,483
The cooling-off period was long between the 3rd and 4th cases...

554
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:28,814
Wait. What's a cooling-off period?

555
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,223
It's a hiatus for serial killers.

556
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:33,153
Hey, he didn't ask you.

557
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,423
Come on.

558
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,494
It took a month for him to commit the fourth murder...

559
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,193
because of the press.

560
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:41,633
What about the press?

561
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:45,163
Up to the third case, his cooling-off period was short...

562
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,534
because he was confident.

563
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:47,973
- What's going on? - But the press...

564
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:49,673
raised suspicions of serial murder.

565
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:52,173
And they started to pay attention to each case individually.

566
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,413
The moment he became confident,

567
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,183
he hesitated for a bit in case he might get caught.

568
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,883
Who on earth did that?

569
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:02,953
But he killed again.

570
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:09,354
It means that the pleasure from killing and his confidence...

571
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,393
overweighed his fear of getting caught.

572
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,893
You're saying that there could be another victim?

573
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,693
Yes. He only hesitated. He didn't stop there.

574
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:23,133
Even if he kills again, it won't be easy to catch him.

575
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:25,544
That arrogant jerk.

576
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:27,304
Subsection Chief Kim Bong Sik.

577
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:30,373
Do I have to teach you how to respect your colleagues?

578
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:35,584
He's aware of his crimes and our investigation progress.

579
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,114
He's smart.

580
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:45,693
Don't tell me that you're buying this nonsense.

581
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,633
The culprit will watch the broadcast somewhere...

582
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,163
because he pays attention to the press.

583
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,163
So...

584
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,534
are you suggesting that we give him a warning...

585
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,504
that he could get caught?

586
00:28:58,574 --> 00:28:59,643
That's correct.

587
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:03,173
He already committed four murders.

588
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:04,883
He won't stop here.

589
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,784
The only way to stop him from striking again...

590
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,383
is this.

591
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:15,193
Stop him from striking again...

592
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:20,024
He'll continue?

593
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:25,733
But we should consider this as making progress, right?

594
00:29:26,504 --> 00:29:27,973
We found the hiking shoes.

595
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,133
And we got his back on camera. I'm sure we'll find him soon.

596
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:32,903
Everyone is working together. He can't get away from this.

597
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:33,973
You're right.

598
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:36,074
Chu Chu, we'll give you a ride.

599
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,183
No. It's okay. The bus is still running.

600
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:39,983
- We have room. Let me drop you. - Yes.

601
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:41,784
No. It's in the different direction.

602
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,514
Taking the bus is more comfortable.

603
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:47,453
Okay. I get it. You want to get away from us as soon as possible.

604
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:48,754
See you tomorrow.

605
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:49,994
- Okay. Goodnight. - Okay.

606
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:51,393
- Get home safely. - Goodnight.

607
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:52,824
- Bye. - Bye.

Why not?

613
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:08,913
With just that?

614
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:10,873
You really should...

615
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,844
take another class on how to listen to your colleagues.

616
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,114
What?

617
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,614
He wants to use this as a warning...

618
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:20,983
to stop the next murder.

619
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:24,994
I thought everyone understood that. But I guess you didn't.

620
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:26,693
A warning? As if.

621
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:29,233
Do you think our duty is to scare people?

622
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,403
If you can't understand this,

623
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:35,004
following the majority is also a way.

624
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,433
Hey.

625
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:42,473
I've been too nice to you. How dare you talk to me like that?

626
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,284
I really hope you will stop being nice to me.

627
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,983
Your personality hasn't changed one bit.

628
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:50,683
I bet you'll live a long life. Right?

629
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:54,923
- What did you say? - I'm your fellow detective.

630
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:59,163
But you still treat me like a woman. Narrow-minded, shallow,

631
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:02,834
biased, and even immature. That's how your perception is.

632
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,403
Gosh. You are also trying to ruffle up my feathers today.

633
00:31:07,403 --> 00:31:10,703
And are you cool with ruffling up other people's feathers?

634
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,304
You little...

635
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,744
Did you see that?

636
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:20,514
If you weren't a woman, I would have slapped you right away.

637
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:22,483
I'm not slapping you because you are...

638
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:30,054
This is my answer...

639
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,824
to what you did to me before.

640
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,364
I thought I was over it.

641
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:39,963
I guess I wasn't.

642
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:48,244
Hey, Yoon Tae Gu!

643
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,744
If you don't want me to treat you like a woman,

644
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:51,983
cut your hair!

645
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,983
Don't give me that excuse you're growing out for the victim!

646
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:55,713
Come on!

647
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:18,962
So I pushed for it.

648
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,262
Do you think putting out an APB will work?

649
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:24,603
If he hides, it will be harder to find him.

650
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:27,272
Right.

651
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:30,542
But stopping the next murder is our top priority right now.

652
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:33,343
Right. That's true.

653
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:34,812
Yes.

654
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:37,113
Drop me off there.

655
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,113
- There? - Yes.

656
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,583
- Good work. - Thanks. Bye.

657
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,022
- See you tomorrow. - Okay.

658
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:44,052
All right.

659
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,292
Gosh.

660
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,792
- Captain Kook. - Yes?

661
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:50,992
- Hold on. - What?

662
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,492
Wait. I have something.

663
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,163
My mother gave it to me this morning.

664
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,032
But I forgot about it all day. I'm sorry.

665
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,532
What is this? Why are you apologizing?

666
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:02,272
It's a present from me.

667
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,443
Happy birthday.

668
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:05,812
For me? Today is...

669
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:09,642
Goodness.

670
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:12,412
Hey, I'm an old man. I don't need presents.

671
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:15,653
People in our line of work only memorize the crime dates.

672
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:17,022
We always forget birthdays.

673
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:19,093
Anyway, thank you.

674
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:22,363
And please thank your mother for me too.

675
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,162
- Sure. - You're making me blush.

676
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:26,792
- Gosh. Thanks. I mean it. - Sure.

677
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:27,792
Okay.

678
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:34,203
Song Ha Young is a nice gifter.

679
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:41,642
Happy birthday to me.

680
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:47,312
Gosh. What is it?

681
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:51,752
Gosh. Right.

682
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:53,993
Sorry, honey.

683
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,763
- I... - Happy birthday, honey.

684
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:57,863
- Happy birthday, Dad. - Happy birthday, Dad.

685
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:03,363
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

686
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,633
- Happy birthday to you, dear honey - Happy birthday to you, dear Dad

687

688

689
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,142
Dad, you need to make a wish.

690
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:16,142
Okay, hold on.

691
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:30,763
- Did you do it? - What did you wish for?

692
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:31,763
It's a secret.

693
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:32,993
- Come on. - Come on.

694
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:35,662
I'm so glad we got to wish you a happy birthday before midnight.

695
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:37,232
I know. Thank you.

696
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:39,272
- I love you. - I love you, Dad.

697
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:42,843
- I love you! And I miss you. - Me too. I love you too.

the calls from our tippers over the ones from the reporters.

00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:47,122
Now, back to your calls. I don't need your answer.

728
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:48,993
Hello?

729
00:37:49,423 --> 00:37:50,962
- Yes. - That's right.

730
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:53,863
- Yes, from now on... - Is that right?

731
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:56,332
- As for the Hwanghwa-dong case... - I'll take care of that.

732
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:01,602
The footage shows a man walking. He's wearing a black jacket.

733
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:04,542
He takes a look around, looking relaxed.

734
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,113
The police have identified this man in the footage...

735
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,513
as the prime suspect in the case.

736
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:14,182
The jacket he is wearing matches the one...

737
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,423
that is missing from the scene.

738
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:16,423
And he was caught on this camera...

739
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:18,823
immediately after the incident took place.

740
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:22,022
According to the police, the size of this man's shoe print...

741
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:23,923
matches that of the shoe print...

742
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:27,193
found at the scene of the senior citizen's murder.

743
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:29,403
The MO seems similar as well,

744
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:31,673
so the possibility that the killer is the same person...

745
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:39,173
How are you feeling? Better?

746
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:42,212
Gosh, the commissioner was so mean to me.

747
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:43,682
- Gosh. - Last night,

748
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,982
when I went to his office to get his approval on the search,

749
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,622
he kept hitting me in the back of the head,

750
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:50,883
asking how we'd manage to catch the killer with this alone.

751
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,392
But you see, I'm almost 50 now.

752
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,622
Goodness. He just can't quit that habit of his, can he?

753
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:58,693
I stayed up all night and managed to persuade the commissioner,

754
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:01,962
but what will happen to us if this doesn't work?

755
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:04,363
Well, it can't be undone now.

756
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,932
Don't be scared.

757
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,042

758

to see if we'd manage to catch him...

761
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:17,843

762
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:21,312
Come on, Chief Heo. Why are you being like this?

763
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:22,953
Are you suddenly regretting your decision?

764
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:25,593
No, it's not that. I'm just frustrated. That's all.

765
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:29,193
It'd be amazing if we could catch that scumbag with this,

766
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:30,723
but it's also true that it's more important...

767
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:32,332
to prevent additional cases.

768
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:33,932
You're right.

769
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,703

00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,082
"he has an intellectual disability or schizophrenia."

885
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:15,283
"Therefore, there is a need to focus the investigation..."

886
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,653
"on people who have an aggressive character disorder."

887
00:48:17,823 --> 00:48:20,193
I'm having trouble understanding this part.

888
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,962
What's the reason we have to differentiate schizophrenia,

889
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:26,162
intellectual disabilities, and character disorders?

890
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:28,493
Character disorder is an illness...

891
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:30,303
when one shows extreme or deformed forms of obsessive...

892
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:33,102
dependent, avoidant, or antisocial characteristics.

893
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,943
But the truth is, everyone makes little of this illness...

894
00:48:35,943 --> 00:48:37,872
so they don't take active measures to treat it.

895
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:40,173
You're saying there may not be medical records of it then.

896
00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:41,912
Yes, that's right.

897
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:45,752
Even if he did get treatment, it probably didn't last long.

898
00:48:45,752 --> 00:48:47,712
The possibility of being admitted to a closed ward...

899
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:50,053
is extremely low too.

900
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:54,053
Meaning character disorders don't leave many clues.

901
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:58,493
Are you sure the culprit isn't someone...

902
00:48:58,493 --> 00:49:00,062
with an intellectual disorder or schizophrenia?

903
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:03,662
All right, let me explain this to you easily.

904
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:06,772
Patients with either schizophrenia, intellectual disorder, delusion...

905
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:10,673
It's hard for them to commit premeditated crimes.

906
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:13,312
I'm sure you know from looking at the crime scene from this case.

907
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:15,272
It's clean and there's no witness.

908
00:49:15,272 --> 00:49:16,283
You're right.

909
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:18,182
Cho Hyun Gil wasn't mentally ill either.

910
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:20,553
What we're trying to tell you is...

911
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:23,223
We shouldn't look for mentally ill patients...

912
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,553
who have been receiving continued treatment.

913
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:27,993
Instead, we should look for a suspect who has a record.

914
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:31,363
Although the chances are low. That's what we mean.

915
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:34,832
That means it will be harder to narrow down a suspect.

916
00:49:34,832 --> 00:49:37,602
I thought you said you'd make it easier. I'm more confused now.

917
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:39,272
That's too broad.

918
00:49:39,272 --> 00:49:40,932
We don't have enough people as is.

919
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:42,303
Based on what you're saying...

920
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:44,943
every single citizen is a suspect then.

921
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:47,372
To be blunt, who doesn't have a temper?

922
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:50,812
Besides our benevolent Superintendent Baek.

923
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:53,513
In conclusion, these are more or less just guesswork.

924
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:55,453
Right?

925
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:58,923
It's not like you gave us a specific lead that we can investigate on.

926
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:02,962
We can't mobilize the entire squad just based on this.

927
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:10,332
It's been over three months...

928
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:13,133
and the police still don't have a single lead on the culprit.

929
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:15,943
He's a murderer who killed seven people.

930
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:19,113
You're talking as if the police are incompetent.

931
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:21,613
But they are doing their very best.

932
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:24,642
That goes for the Hwanghwa-dong case from last time too.

933
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:27,312
They found an image of the culprit from the CCTV footage.

934
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:31,682
Also, they are actively receiving tip-offs...

935
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:34,323
so they will find a lead on the culprit soon.

936
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:38,363
It's already been over two months since they released an APB.

937
00:50:38,723 --> 00:50:40,232
If they were relying on the APB for a lead...

938
00:50:40,232 --> 00:50:42,292
they should've gotten one a long time ago.

939
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:44,962
Time is passing, including this moment here.

940
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:47,002
The people are growing more anxious by the day.

941
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,372
What do they plan on doing about this?

942
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:51,443
In order to strengthen public security...

943
00:50:51,443 --> 00:50:54,642
on top of increasing the number of patrolling officers,

944
00:50:54,642 --> 00:50:57,013
they have offered many solutions like installing security cameras...

945
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,682
in crime-ridden districts.

946
00:50:59,153 --> 00:51:00,613
They are currently executing those solutions.

00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:01,513
He's a murderer.

956
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:02,843
They only got a picture of his back.

957
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:04,582
How do they plan to catch him with only a picture of his back?

958
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:06,252
- Seriously. - That's what I'm saying!

959
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:08,582
- How can they catch him? - Seriously.

Gosh, he's an evil one, isn't he?

Gosh, what's the police doing?

of the suspect's back. This serial murder case...

If the culprit does not stop...

986
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:34,273
and continues to commit the crimes in hiding,

987
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:38,103

When will they catch the culprit? I'm too scared.

994
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:52,023
The culprit will definitely kill someone again.

995
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:53,693
It was too rash to start an open search.

996
00:53:53,853 --> 00:53:55,722
The culprit would only hide more. Why would he come out?

997
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:58,063
I'd trust my dog before I trust the police.

998
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:02,233
You wanted to make the Behavioral Analysis Team,

999
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:05,063
so I let you have your way, but what have you done right?

1000
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:08,132
You began an open search just by using a photo of his back,

1001
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,143
but you have no evidence?

1002
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:12,242
This only made the police look ridiculous!

1003
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:15,043
How will you patch this up?

you taught us a few ways, and we tried everything.

1014
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:39,532
We asked around the crime scene,

1015
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,833
we talked to every delivery man who goes around the area.

1016
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,143
We searched around the internet cafes in the vicinity,

1017
00:54:44,143 --> 00:54:45,972
then got a warrant to search the base station,

1018
00:54:45,972 --> 00:54:48,773
so we even searched every person who used their phones in the area.

1019
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:52,183
But we still haven't found a strand of the culprit's hair.

1020
00:54:53,152 --> 00:54:56,922
The Behavioral Analysis Team or whoever, we need to ask...

1021
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:01,293
and find a new method of investigating this case.

1022
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:05,023
Yes, so just as the Analysis Team reported on the profiling report,

1023
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:07,233
we plan on searching for people with mental illnesses...

that the Behavioral Analysis Team is out on the field now, did you?

1028
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:22,143
- Sorry? - They keep asking me...

1029
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:24,443
who those guys are and complaining about them.

1030
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:27,353
I can only turn a blind eye to those complaints for so long.

1031
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:30,882
We can't force them to stop when they want to take part...

1032
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:32,753
in the investigation.

1033
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:34,293

00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:38,992

1035
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:43,003
Make sure you take a firm measure.

1036
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:48,003
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1037
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:55,782

Hey.

1039

Let's put an end to our obsession.

1040
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,023
The Special Crime Squad has too many cases to resolve...

1041
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:06,853
other than looking for some guy who can't even be detected.

1042
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:10,592
You talk as if we're a huge burden to the Special Crime Squad.

1043
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,322

00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:20,072
The commissioner taught me a big lesson when I went in...

1047
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:21,603
to have some documents approved.

1048
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:23,242
Oh, so you called us to nitpick over that?

1049
00:56:23,242 --> 00:56:26,672
Nitpick? I'm your superior. Why would I do that with you two?

1050
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:28,043
If anything, I'd give you an order.

1051
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:31,543
All I'm saying is that we've all done enough.

1052
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:33,583
What do you mean by enough?

1053
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:34,753
Are you telling us to give up?

1054
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:37,222
Hey, there is no giving up when it comes to our cases.

1055
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:41,722
I'm saying there are many cases we could resolve with that time.

1056
00:56:41,753 --> 00:56:42,963
Come on.

1057
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:45,663
We never just sat on our hands.

1058
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:48,933
The Behavioral Analysis Team has done our duties by ourselves.

1059
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:52,773
What is it? Stop beating around the bush and tell me.

1060
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:53,833
Goodness.

1061
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,072
I'll be frank.

1062
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:59,413
Those up above aren't happy...

1063
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:02,313
with the Behavioral Analysis Team.

1064
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:04,713
They were never happy with us. Good grief.

1065
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:07,282
We're a workplace. An organization. What can we do?

1066
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,322
Those men out there...

1067
00:57:09,322 --> 00:57:11,452
also are complaining about how your team is...

1068
00:57:11,452 --> 00:57:12,793
coming in and out of the crime scenes.

1069
00:57:12,793 --> 00:57:15,523
The only thing we can do is investigate the crime scene.

1070
00:57:16,023 --> 00:57:17,023
If you stop us from doing that...

1071
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,393
I mean, I just want to stop by the crime scene...

1072
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:21,693
after the forensics are done, so why do they complain about that?

1073
00:57:21,693 --> 00:57:24,032
There are many other things you can work on.

1074
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:27,572
You know, those documents you took from the cabinets.

1075
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:30,702
You all study that and create data too.

1076
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:34,373
That's our job, so we'll manage, okay?

1077
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:36,313
Please don't stop us from going to the crime scenes.

1078
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:37,742
There's nothing he can do to stop us.

1079
00:57:38,382 --> 00:57:39,483
We can go whenever we want to.

1080
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:42,782
Forget it. I'm done with this.

1081
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:43,782
Goodbye.

1082
00:57:43,822 --> 00:57:46,253
We need to put an end to this. Inspector Song.

1083
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:49,762
I know you visit the crime scene every day.

1084
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:52,322
I'm not trying to stop you.

1085
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:55,862
Please use your effort in something else too.

1086
00:57:57,802 --> 00:57:58,833
Let's go.

1087
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,032
I'm talking to him right now.

1088
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:03,972
It's my first time having a serious talk with him.

1089
00:58:03,972 --> 00:58:06,413
You don't have to listen. There's nothing serious about it.

1090
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:07,773
Come on out.

1091
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:09,282
That little...

1092
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:13,183
Please excuse me.

1093
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,152
You understand what I mean, right?

1094
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:26,132
- What now? - What do you mean?

1095
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:28,393
I would've never started if I was going to stop.

1096
00:58:29,663 --> 00:58:31,963
Do you know something we have in common?

1097
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:34,373
- Nothing. - Exactly.

1098
00:58:34,773 --> 00:58:36,443
Who do you think we are?

1099
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:38,503
Let's not lose your spirits. We have lots to do.

1100
00:58:42,342 --> 00:58:44,413
Mr. Gu Young Chun, please come on in.

1101
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:51,922
(X-ray Room)

1102
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:58,063
Sir, we're about to take an X-ray of your entire body.

1103
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,282
(64 days after the open search began)

1104
00:59:19,282 --> 00:59:22,213
(January 3, 2004)

1105
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:28,992
Did he give up on committing another crime to hide?

1106
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:30,663
Or...

1107
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:34,762
is he still planning another crime?

1108
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:42,742
You never miss a day.

1109
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:49,483
We never know when the crimes will start again.

1110
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:50,943
Do not believe...

1111
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:55,183
that you decided to begin the open search all by yourself.

1112
00:59:57,152 --> 01:00:00,222
The Special Crime Squad isn't incompetent...

1113
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:04,163
to a point we'll blindly follow a rash decision.

1114
01:00:06,663 --> 01:00:07,793
From the outside,

1115
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:11,503
it may seem like the investigation is standing still.

1116
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:15,273
Until the moment we catch the culprit,

1117
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:17,643
even we sometimes feel that way.

1118
01:00:19,172 --> 01:00:20,273
However,

1119
01:00:21,842 --> 01:00:24,112
we came to this choice altogether.

1120
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:29,052
What doesn't change is how we came to the same decision,

1121
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:32,052
that all we want is to catch the culprit.

1122
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:36,322
What's more important than wanting to catch the culprit is...

1123
01:00:37,893 --> 01:00:40,262
actually catching the culprit.

1124
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,972
We will catch him. Certainly.

1125
01:00:49,402 --> 01:00:50,972
He will not stop.

1126
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,913
We'll catch him before he goes on.

1127
01:00:57,342 --> 01:00:59,183
I thought it would work once we stopped him.

1128
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:04,152
No matter how many times I look through the daily reports,

1129
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:06,492
I do not see a report of a crime in that same pattern.

1130
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:12,592
What if...

1131
01:01:14,163 --> 01:01:16,063
What if the culprit changed the MO?

1132
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:20,503
What do we do then?

1133
01:02:19,963 --> 01:02:21,393
(Daily Case Report)

1134
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:38,882
(January 30, 2004, Victim: Kim Yang Hee)

1135
01:02:38,882 --> 01:02:42,112
(The victim was stabbed with a knife used for leisure activities.)

1136
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:22,893
- Go home. - See you later.

1137
01:03:22,893 --> 01:03:23,992
- Call me. - Bye.

1138
01:03:23,992 --> 01:03:25,963
- Text me. - Hurry. It's getting cold.

1139
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:28,563
- Call me. - Okay. Bye.

1140
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:30,202
(February 12, 2004)

1141
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:31,402
(Sinheung 2-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu)

1142
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,103
(Are you home?)

1143
01:03:33,103 --> 01:03:34,373
Are you home?

1144
01:03:34,902 --> 01:03:36,342
I'm almost home.

1145
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:38,143
(To Su Min)

1146
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:58,063
(Sinheung 2-dong)

1147
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:43,802
(Through the Darkness)

1148
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,503
The devil went off the grid again.

1149
01:05:16,503 --> 01:05:17,672
Time is ticking.

1150
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:19,302
If this becomes a cold case...

1151
01:05:19,302 --> 01:05:20,543
Murderers like this usually...

1152
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,443
kill for their own pleasure and enjoyment.

1153
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:24,342
It means they are happy when they kill.

1154
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:25,413
An outdoor knife?

1155
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:26,782
Do you think it was done by the same guy?

1156
01:05:26,782 --> 01:05:28,282
It's similar to the guy we're looking for.

1157
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:30,552
The murder weapon, MO, and the time periods are different.

1158
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:31,952
But what if it's what we speculated?

1159
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:33,623
Because he failed to get what he wants out of this?

1160
01:05:33,623 --> 01:05:37,193
Then Korea has two serial killers now.

1161
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:45,362
(Part 2 of Through the Darkness will be back on February 25 at 10pm.)
