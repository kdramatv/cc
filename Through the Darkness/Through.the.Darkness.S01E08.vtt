Give them to me. Let me.

00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:23,417
Call 911.

7
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:24,887
- What happened? What? - Call 911 now.

Gosh. What's taking them so long?

13
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,357
It's about the serial killer who murdered wealthy elderly, right?

14
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:08,756
Come on. Can't you just tell me?

15
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:13,637
You're here as a journalist, not my friend.

16
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:15,267
I can't tell you anything.

17
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,767
Gosh. Okay. I got it.

18
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,036
Anyway, I'm staying here for the night.

- Why are you here? - Hold on.

21
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:53,036
Come on.

22
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:55,336

00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:15,697
Any update on Captain Yoon?

27
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:20,597
Luckily, he missed all the vital organs.

28
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:24,107
- Darn it. - Hey.

29
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,847
That scumbag, Gu Young Chun.

30
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,107
- Hey. - Hey.

31
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,177
How dare he stab a detective?

32
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,617
Hey. Control yourself.

33
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,246
Don't ruin this.

34
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,686
Sir!

35
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:41,516
- Captain Yoon could have... - Hey. What about us?

36
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:43,886
What about me?

37
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:45,787
Do you think we're not mad because we have different titles?

38
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,657
His rage is understandable!

39
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,956
My detective got stabbed!

40
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,237
Did you even help her, Song Ha Young?

41
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,306
How's Captain Yoon?

42
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,136
They treated the wound urgently.

43
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,777
But the stab wound was pretty deep,

44
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:04,777
so she has to stay in the hospital for a few days.

45
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,576
I came back after I checked...

46
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,376
that they transferred her to a room and she fell asleep.

47
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:12,016
Okay.

48
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:16,316
Captain Yoon is strong.

49
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,487
She'll be back before you know it.

50
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:21,097
All right. I know that we are all worried about her.

51
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:23,196
So let's calm down.

52
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,896
Oh, right. What about our guys in Nojin-dong?

53
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:29,196
They are working hard to find the bodies, but no news yet.

54
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,837
What if that jerk lied about burying them in the hill?

55
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:35,436
Once we find the bodies, his statement will be credible.

56
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:36,907
So we must hurry.

57
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,347
Okay. Captain Kook is at the scene. So let's give them some time.

(Scientific Investigations Team)

59
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,996
And one more thing. I'll interrogate him.

60
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:57,727
You stay here, Chief Kim.

61
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:00,196
Are you leaving me out because he got away from me?

62
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,936
No. It's not that.

63
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,667
You cannot interrogate him first.

64
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,667
Why not?

65
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,167
I observed him during the interrogation.

66
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,177
And he likes to show off.

67
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:12,177
He thinks that he can control what's happening to him.

68
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,477
See? I told you, didn't I?

69
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,217
He kept changing his statements at Mapo Police Station.

70
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,617
It was like he was toying with them!

71
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:18,717
If you go in now,

72
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,756
anyone below you won't be able to interrogate him.

73
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,987
If we're not careful,

74
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,487
he will never talk.

75
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,667
Did you check if he had any mental illnesses?

76
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,667
I did.

77
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,696
He had a mental illness caused by an epileptic seizure.

78
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:36,636
According to the records, he was treated from 1992 to 1994.

79
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:40,806
Captain Yoon and I looked into the records of mental illnesses...

80
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,837
of violent offenders, dating back to five years ago.

81
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:44,907
Five years weren't enough, I guess.

82
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,816
Your profiling report was correct, though.

83
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,246
Then let me interrogate him first.

84
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:55,117
Then you should interrogate him for now.

85
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,326
Hey.

86
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,626
What happened to the woman I stabbed?

87
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,436
Why?

88
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:10,766
I feel bad.

89
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,607
I don't need to hear your lies.

90
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:22,316
I've got your statement here. So don't try anything funny.

91
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:30,657
It was all a lie.

92
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:32,756
I didn't kill them.

93
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:37,727
That scumbag is driving me nuts.

94
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,196
Then what is this?

95
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,266
I wrote it based on what I saw on the news.

96
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:48,237
It was all over the news, you know. The locations and the method.

97
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:49,506
Is that so?

98
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,547
Then why did you lie?

99
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,316
Because you guys forced me to.

100
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,117
Right?

101
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:06,227
I don't think you have the guts to kill anyone.

102
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:10,027
You killed 18 people and secretly buried 11 of them?

103
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,696
It's all a lie.

104
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,436
Is this fun for you?

105
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,376
Do you want to know the truth?

106
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:30,016
Darn, that arrogant scumbag.

107
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,046
Can I please just go in now?

108
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,656
Can I not go in?

109
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,557
I can't let you.

110
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:40,626
You're all riled up. If you go in now,

111
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,026
things will get even more complicated.

112
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:44,697
Darn it. This is nuts!

113
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,967
Who's the boss here?

114
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:52,666
If you guys want me to talk, go bring your boss.

115
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,906
You scum!

116
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,676
Do you want a promotion?

117
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,117
Don't you get a special promotion for catching a killer like me?

118
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,046
You piece of...

119
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:12,987
This is why I can't talk to you little fish.

120
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,327
Go get your boss.

121
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,636
I am the suspect in the case where 18 people were killed...

122
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,837
and 11 were secretly buried.

123
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,136
That punk is asking for me.

124
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:32,447
Fine, I shall go in if he wants to talk to me.

125
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,646
No, leave it. I'll go in.

126
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,676
- What? - Goodness.

127
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,447
At this rate,

128
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,587
he'll ask to speak...

129
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:42,557
to all the police executives one by one,

130
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,457
- don't you think? - Hold on.

131
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,426
One moment.

132
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,026
- Hi. - Why are you here?

133
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,926
I didn't want to interrupt.

134
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,896
- You got what I asked for? - Yes, I have everything.

135
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:59,536
- Hey. - You're still here?

136
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,607
Where else would I be...

137
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,237
- These four piles here? - Yes, sir.

138
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,646
Oh, wait.

139
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:10,146
Take this too just in case,

140
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:11,947
Inspector Song.

141
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:16,386
You should leave.

142
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,766
Hey, what is all this?

143
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,367
Take these inside and just put them on the table.

144
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:30,967
Glance at them,

145
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,266
but don't go through them.

146
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:35,176
To intimidate him, right?

147
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,077
Yes, just give him the impression that we already know a lot.

148
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,577
Okay, got it.

149
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:40,977
- One more thing. - What?

150
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:43,646
He gets offended if we use an interrogating tone.

151
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,587
- It ticks him off. - I see.

152
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,916
Just coddle him at first.

153
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,857
Once the real interrogation begins,

154
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,357
he'll lean back in his chair.

155
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,996
- Is he a king or what? - All right, I got it.

156
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,057
Here, thanks.

157
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,796
- No, let me. - Thanks.

158
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,266
Just a moment.

159
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,067
- Take this too. - Okay, got it.

160
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,597
(Robbery Suspect Wanted)

161
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,636
(Robbery Suspect Wanted)

162
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,276
All right.

163
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,756
You can talk to me now.

164
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,396
Finally, someone on my level.

165
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,626
What's your title?

166
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,256
Are you the captain?

167
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,626
I'm higher than a captain.

168
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,837
I'm a senior superintendent. Four hibiscus flowers.

169
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,107
I'm the head of Criminal Investigations.

170
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:40,807
The head?

171
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,906
Listen, Gu Young Chun.

172
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,447
Dragging this out will only make things more difficult for you.

173
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:50,687
You know, the cops aren't idiots.

174
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,457
Let's see.

175
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:58,727
My gosh.

176
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,097
You can draw pretty well.

177
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:05,026
I was pretty good at drawing when I was young.

178
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,896
Is that right?

179
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,697
I see.

180
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:10,766
But you know,

181
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,307
you drew even the details that we never disclosed to the media.

182
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,676
How did you know these details?

183
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,307
Where the safe was...

184
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,876
and whether it was standing upright or knocked over.

185
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,746
You even drew these things,

186
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:28,557
which means you were there. Am I wrong?

187
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:31,926
Then...

188
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:33,926
Look at this.

189
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,496
Anyone would say this is a picture of you taken from behind.

190
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,327
And your face is on this thing.

191
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,437
Which means,

192
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,707
you'll get caught in no time even if you run away.

193
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:46,766
Do you understand?

194
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,926
Give me...

195
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,426
some time.

196
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,026
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

197
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,597
We got it. The hill behind Nojin-dong.

198
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:21,337
What's going on?

199
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,176
- What happened? - I'll tell you later.

200
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:24,347
Hey!

201
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:40,786
(Body recovery site, Nojin-dong, Seodaemun-gu)

202
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:08,546
Captain Kook, we just found one body so far?

203
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,617
And...

204
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,987
there are ten more?

205
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:18,386
Where did you bury them? You scum!

206
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,406
- Sir. - What?

207
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,447
Here! Found one!

208
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,646
- Over here! We found one too. - Here too!

209
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,987
- We found something here too. - Hey, dig it up.

210
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,467
This, right here. Hurry.

211
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,766
- Here's one too! - Over here too.

212
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,337
Here too!

213
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,707
- Here too. - We have something here too.

214
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,567
Over here! We found something too!

215
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,707
Darn...

216
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:19,416
Darn it!

217
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:15,777
This just in.

218
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:18,807
The police have arrested a man...

219
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,807
who murdered 18 innocent civilians in the past year...

220
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,476
in a grotesque manner.

221
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,449
On the 10th,

222
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,580
while investigating the case of the missing sex workers,

223
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,379
the police discovered that the suspect is the same man...

224
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:33,290
who murdered four rich elderly couples...

225
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,419
around Gangnam and Jongno area.

226
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,359
According to the statement of the suspect,

227
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,030
the police searched through the hill behind Nojin-dong...

228
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,129
and found the dead bodies buried underground.

229
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,060
They are currently searching through the suspect's home...

230
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,530
to obtain further evidence of his crimes.

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,040
Here's the report of the case...

232
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,099
given by the superintendent of the Seoul Police Agency.

233
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:56,580
Hello, Superintendent Baek Jun Sik of Detective Division, Seoul Agency.

234
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:03,849
Let me brief you on the arrest of Gu Young Chun, the serial killer.

235
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,720
The police received a report...

236
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
on a serial abduction case of sex workers.

237
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,560
On the 5th, around 5:30am,

238
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,129
we arrested the perpetrator, Gu Young Chun.

239
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,000
However, Gu Young Chun confessed to having killed...

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,570
a total of 18 people.

241
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,540
We took the perpetrator, Gu Young Chun,

242
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,740
to the place he claimed to have buried the bodies,

243
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,409
the hill behind Nojin-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul.

244
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,780
We found unidentified bodies of women in their 20s and 30s,

245
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,849
a total of 11 bodies buried in secret.

246
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,720
Any additional crimes?

247
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,490
And accomplices. Does he have any accomplices?

248
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:40,820
Thus far in our investigation,

249
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,589
we confirmed that he did this alone without an accomplice.

250
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,230
We are also pressing him to find out if he committed additional crimes.

251
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,000
(Police found 11 buried bodies)

252
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,310
This is a hill near Nojin-dong, Seoul.

253
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,980
Once they started digging, you can see the body...

254
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,210
of a woman in her 20s.

255
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,409
A total of 11 bodies were found in this area.

256
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:06,449
All of the bodies were...

257
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,449
- severely damaged. - One interview with Gu first.

258
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,119
There were many trees around where the bodies were buried,

259
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,449
and it's also situated deep inside of the hill,

260
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:15,619
somewhere tough to be spotted from the road.

261
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,429
The police are making an attempt to identify...

262
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,859
- the bodies found underground. - Is your piece worth some clicks?

263
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,899
The colleagues of these dead women came to the crime scene...

264
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,399
and watched with wretched hearts.

265
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,939
("The Worst Killer in History Arrested, Helped by Fate")

266
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,020
("Serial Killer Arrested, What If the Police Acted Faster?")

267
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,750
I think I'm done packing.

268
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,599
You can just blame him...

269
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,460
for the Southwestern Case too.

270
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,429
It looks like he did everything.

271
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,000
He says he didn't do that, so we have to continue to check.

272
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,939
How can you believe what he says?

273
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,470
Start digging up everything with the premise he's the culprit,

274
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,010
so that he won't be able to make another excuse.

275
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,710
I can't quite put a finger on how far his crimes stretch.

276
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,119
We're looking through every other cold case we have,

277
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,550
not just the Southwestern Case.

278
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,290
Put all of these cases together, then do your best...

279
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,359
to get him to confess.

280
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,530
Commissioner, you already know we'll get into bigger trouble...

281
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,629
if the prosecution doesn't find any evidence after he's transferred.

282
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,530
What we need to do is resolve this pressing incident!

283
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,040
Try to find a way to avoid responsibility...

284
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,740
by turning Gu Young Chun into the perpetrator.

285
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,280
With every minute, the media are pumping out stories...

286
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,879
on Gu Young Chun and all kinds of other cold cases.

287
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,280
We have to throw them something...

288
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,750
to turn away these criticisms that are pointed at us.

289
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,649
Yes, I understand.

290
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,349
Are you still trying to see if he committed other crimes?

291
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,790
Yes.

292
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,030
Captain Yoon is interrogating him.

293
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,429
We've been going days without getting any sleep.

294
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,429
Chief Kim and Captain Yoon are taking turns with the cold cases.

295
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,040
Man, they are about to blow up trying to humor that man,

296
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,369
who's not even human.

297
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:12,669
He claims to have committed every single case we bring him.

298
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,379
He says he would've killed 100 people if he wasn't caught.

299
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,810
That psycho. Does he think he's some kind of a hero?

300
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,580
Then when we cross him, he'd change his argument right away.

301
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,619
He's the first man who didn't budge...

302
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,790
despite my awful temper.

303
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,419
Ha Young does not bite crazy dogs.

304
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,560
- You little... - What?

305
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
Hey.

306
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,629
How can you still have enough energy to bicker?

307
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:35,859
(The weapon is a size of a camping knife.)

308
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,659
Another camping knife.

309
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,530
Yes, we've been trying to see if Gu Young Chun is the perp...

310
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,270
for the cases in Dongjak and Geumcheon Station.

311
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,300
But he denied those.

312
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,139
- I also doubt this is his doing. - What?

313
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,839
Why not? Gu Young Chun said he did this.

314
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,939
I remember reading it on a Daily Case Report.

315
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,010
This case was already reported. Dongdaemun Station missed it.

316
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,520
This is why we need to improve cooperation between jurisdictions.

317
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,220
I finally get what you mean after going through this.

318
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,589
The Analysis Team can be very nosy.

319
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,960
You're always trying to get way too much information.

320
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,330
- Hey. - Those above tell us to blame him.

321
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,859
But these men I dread the most suggest that it can't be him.

322
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,599
But the jerk who actually killed all these people is just...

323
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,300
Darn it. Man.

324
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,210
Man, unbelievable.

325
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,780
Captain Yoon is getting his confession...

326
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,139
on the Imyeong-dong case right now.

327
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,080
You said his MO or whatever changed.

328
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,179
(MO: Modus Operandi, the crime method)

329
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,349
So wouldn't that work?

330
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
No.

331
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,919
This is a whole different case.

332
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,659
Were you after cash?

333
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,129
They were dressed nicely.

334
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,230
It looked like they had some money.

335
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,810
I showed my police ID and approached her,

336
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,339
but she got scared and began to step back.

337
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,510
I'm the police!

338
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:01,010
Why would she run away?

339
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Was it because I looked shabby? I suddenly lost it.

340
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
(Personal information)

341
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,889
So?

342
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,020
You followed her and stabbed her?

343
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,030
Detective, thanks to me, you'll get a promotion.

344
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,669
It's my way of paying back for stabbing you.

345
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,270
Gu Young Chun.

346
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,310
No matter how much you think, he didn't do the Imyeong-dong case.

347
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,780
No.

348
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,419
He's not the type who would switch from a hammer to a camping knife.

349
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,189
I wouldn't say his MO changes.

350
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,589
It simply seems like he was after stronger stimulants.

351
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,369
(Detective Division Conference Room)

352
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,510
Are you feeling better?

353
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,849
Yes, I'm all right.

354
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,280
I'm glad.

355
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,389
Goodbye.

356
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,490
By the way...

357
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,830
The Imyeong-dong case...

358
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,830
probably wasn't Gu Young Chun, right?

359
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,409
Goodbye.

360
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,409
The police are conducting further investigation...

361
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,480
to find other crimes committed by the serial killer, Gu Young Chun.

362
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,720
Gu claimed to have killed another woman in her 20s...

363
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,119
at the end of January in Imyeong-dong, Dongdaemun-gu.

364
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,560
The police shared their plans to conduct further investigation.

365
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,030
If he's found to be guilty of the Imyeong-dong Case,

366
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,629
- the total number of victims... - What?

367
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:55,899
he created will reach...

368
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,030
- a total of 19 people. - I did that.

369
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,570
The Imyeong-dong Murder Case broke out last January...

370
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,970
- in Imyeong-dong, Dongdaemun-gu. - That jerk.

371
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,899
The victim, Kim, was found lying dead on the street...

372
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,210
- after getting stabbed many times. - I'll kill you.

373
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,010
The case remained unresolved to this day.

374
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,679
On the other hand, the police will wrap up the investigation...

375
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,449
and hand him over with the investigation record...

376
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,050
to the prosecution tomorrow.

377
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,149
He's to be transferred tomorrow, but until today,

378
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,889
the police believed he has committed more crimes,

379
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,629
so they have been putting in all manpower into interrogating him.

380
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,000
Why did you choose them as your victims?

381
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,369
Mr. Gu! Is there a last word you want to leave to the world?

382
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,369
I hope this becomes...

383
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,879
the motivation for women to be more careful...

384
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,409
with themselves.

385
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,780
I also hope the riches...

386
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,119
will wake up too.

387
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,290
Anything else?

388
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,089
- Mr. Gu! - Excuse me.

389
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,859
- Do you regret this? - Anything else you want to say?

390
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,399
- Just one more word! - Why did you change the MO?

391
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,970
- Do you feel bad for the victims? - Mr. Gu!

392
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,800
Just say one more word!

393
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,250
(The Safest City, Seoul, Respected Seoul Police)

394
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,689
You can't transfer him immediately without a chance for us to see him!

395
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,790
He felt too offended to meet anybody.

396
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,099
What can I do?

397
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,899
Man, all of our staff are trying our best to humor him...

398
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,070
just to get a word out of his mouth.

399
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,099
He drained us through the interrogation and field search.

400
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,510
Gu Young Chun isn't an ordinary perp.

401
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,310
No, he's not ordinary. That's why we must see him.

402
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,280
I'll be there soon.

403
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,250
He refuses to meet anybody. What can I do?

404
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,720
He murdered over 20 victims if you include...

405
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,619
other crimes he claimed to have committed.

406
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,820
If you rub him the wrong way, he might change his statement again.

407
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,490
It'll make our lives miserable.

408
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,830
I'm going home.

409
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,159
Is it that hard to do? Gil Pyo.

410
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,210
A profiler's question is...

411
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,349
a sort of enticement.

412
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,480
To get what we want,

413
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,349
we must fully understand our suspects.

414
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,689
And to understand Gu Young Chun, I must become him now...

415
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,929
and suppress my anger for a moment.

416
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,139
I am...

417
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,210
you now.

418
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,879
(Seoul Detention Center)

419
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,040
- It's good. - Okay.

420
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,460
(Keep quiet)

421
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,349
It's cloudy today.

422
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,889
The investigation was over.

423
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,490
What else is there left?

424
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,960
We're not investigators.

425
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,159
Aren't you detectives?

426
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,129
You were there when I was arrested.

427
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,500
I used to be. But not now.

428
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,970
Then what do you do?

429
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,000
Our job is to find out the causes behind these incidents...

430
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,099
and analyze the causes.

431
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,339
So...

432
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,439
are you like criminal behavioral analysts?

433
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,010
Like psychologists?

434
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,710
Something like that. So you know what we do.

435
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,050
Most people don't.

436
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,990
I was curious about my psychology too.

437
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,859
I wondered about that.

438
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:49,889
All right.

439
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,760
Then before we discuss that,

440
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,330
why don't we go over some questions we have about each case?

441
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,770
Sure.

442
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:01,599
The man next to me is the captain.

443
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,199
He'll ask you those questions.

444
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,369
First of all, why did you make your own murder weapon?

445
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,339
At first, I used a knife and tried it out on a dog.

446
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,510
But the dog kept bleeding...

447
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,379
and ran away instead of dying.

448
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,419
So I switched to a steel hammer.

449
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,790
A long handle was cumbersome when I grabbed it.

450
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,520
And it didn't fit my bag either.

451
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,320
So I shortened it.

452
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,030
Why did you stop killing after an APB was issued?

453
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,699
You say you are a criminal behavioral analyst.

454
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,629
Isn't that obvious?

455
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,970
The entire country saw a photo of my back. I had to be careful.

456
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Right.

457
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,240
So we could suspect that you were a careful guy.

458
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,109
And you didn't leave any evidence when you were new to this...

459
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,010
because you were careful.

460
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,050
You bet.

461
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,790
Perfect crimes require thorough planning.

462
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,990
There are no perfect crimes.

463
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,460
You failed to catch me.

464
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,960
We got you. So you're here.

465
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,129
No, I'm here because of my confession.

466
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,099
Well,

467
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,439
you said in your statement that you started a fire...

468
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,869
in Hwanghwa-dong to remove any possible bloodstains from you.

469
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:12,369
I wanted to break the safe.

470
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,510
I even used a golf club and a crowbar.

471
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,010
But I couldn't open it. I only ended up hurting my hand.

472
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,449
I guess safes in Korea are pretty sturdy.

473
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:34,030
The fire was put out quickly.

474
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,060
I know. I watched it nearby.

475
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,000
Were you watching it to make sure it was burning?

476
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,510
I was anxious. So I watched the house from afar.

477
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,169
By the way, starting a fire wasn't easy either.

478
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,879
Gosh. I had no idea it would go out that fast.

479
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:52,349
The fire went out pretty fast.

480
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:54,409
Weren't you worried that we might have found your blood?

481
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,780
I didn't think much of it.

482
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,449
Well, why did you steal the jacket when you left?

483
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,689
I ran into an unexpected situation.

484
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,530
So I was nervous. And it got a bit cold.

485
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,129
I had a lot of blood on my clothes.

486
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:12,899
And I happened to see it. So I grabbed it and put it on.

487
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,439
And you threw it out afterward?

488
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,570
I gave it to a homeless man on my way home.

489
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,439
Did you throw out the hiking boots?

490
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,879
I threw them out because that was on the posters.

491
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,379
You were very careful indeed.

492
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:25,879
What did you do with the clothes that had blood on?

493
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,649
Based on your statement, you didn't change your clothes.

494
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,589
People don't care if you have blood on your clothes.

495
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,490
When I got nervous about it,

496
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,689
I went into a restroom at a building or a subway station to wipe it.

497
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,730
Everyone is busy with their own lives.

498
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,899
People aren't that interested in other people.

499
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:46,869
They would only be interested in someone like me.

500
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,109
I see.

501
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,909
You've never seen a killer like me, right?

502
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,250
Do you think you're special?

503
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,389
Isn't that why you guys came here to see me?

504
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,990
You're asking a lot of questions too.

505
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,099
We want to know the type of people who commit crimes like you.

506
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,159
But we're not interested in you, per se.

507
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,439
I'll continue with the questions.

508
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,109
Let's look at the murder cases with the elderly.

509
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,080
Houses without any security systems in that rich neighborhood...

510
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,119
Gu Young Chun is a different type of criminal we've met so far.

511
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,419
Observing his attitude from the interrogation,

512
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,359
he was confident that he didn't leave any evidence behind...

513
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,730
and had a sense of superiority about his crimes.

514
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,060
I noticed that too when he admitted his crimes.

515
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,629
Our approach needs to be a bit more thorough.

516
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,270
Like how?

517
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,609
For example, we don't have to...

518
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:01,109
directly let him know that he chose easy locations.

519
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,980
So you don't want to provoke him?

520
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:07,849
Right.

521
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,650
Other than the security systems,

522
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,989
was there a factor you considered when choosing locations?

523
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,690
Security systems? I don't know about them.

524
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,429
I just chose a house close to a church.

525
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,770
A church? Why?

526
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,770
The deity is right next-door, but He won't help.

527
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,400
And I wanted to prove that.

528
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,110
I was the one who decided that they would die or live.

529
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,009
Have you ever thought that the deity didn't help you?

530
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,449
A lot of times.

531
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,920
I always thought so.

532
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,049
I got caught stealing at the age of 20 and had to stand trial.

533
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,819
My lawyer said I would get off with probation.

534
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,659
And...

535
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,159
I desperately begged that I would live a good life...

536
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,860
if He would keep me away from prison.

537
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:01,670
But He didn't do that.

538
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,440
So...

539
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,810
is that why you think He abandoned you?

540
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,040
Who abandoned whom?

541
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,310
People who believe in Him are pathetic.

542
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,980
They pretend to be holy, but they chase money...

543
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,279
and look down on other people.

544
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,889
Have you been to my house?

545
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:24,290
Yes.

546
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,830
You know the bathroom threshold?

547
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,860
The threshold is...

548
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,699
the line that separates the living realm and underworld.

549
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,139
The line between life and death which is decided and ruled by me.

550
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,610
Anyone who crossed that threshold didn't make it out alive.

551
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,790
Why did you cut up the bodies before abandoning them?

552
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,500
It must not have been easy.

553
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,199
Have you killed anyone?

554
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,000
If I had,

555
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,770
we wouldn't be here.

556
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,469
Right.

557
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,880
You would be in there with me.

558
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,310
If you haven't done it,

559
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,080
how do you know it's hard?

560
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,179
Have you met with other murderers?

561
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,719
That's our job.

562
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,119
Of course, it wasn't easy.

563
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,460
To liven up the mood,

564
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,230
I played grand music when I worked on the bodies.

565
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,849
Why? Were you scared?

566
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,630
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.

567
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,099
I can't. But why?

568
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,799
Do you think I'm going to kill you with a pen?

569
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,799
Are you scared of me when all my limbs are bound?

570
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:22,440
You seemed curious to know how I cut the bodies.

571
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,639
I was going to draw it for you.

572
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,880
The X-ray on the wall.

573
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,020
Was it for this?

574
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,349
That's right.

575
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,920
I studied a lot.

576
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,690
I also read a lot of books on forensic pathology.

577
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,989
They tell you...

578
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,429
exactly when and where to cut to make the job easier.

579
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:55,230
All that effort for what?

580
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,440
You see, people don't die easily.

581
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,040
They're not small, and to survive...

582
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,009
You already said that was why you chose the steel hammer.

583
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,989
Right. I did, didn't I?

584
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,690
Then did you know this?

585
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:19,489
Before you chop up a body,

586
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,259
you should drain the blood out and wait until the body stiffens.

587
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,529
Then it's much easier.

588
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,199
Whatever you do, you should do it in the most efficient way.

589
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:29,599
"Efficient?"

590
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,840
And to be efficient, you need to study.

591
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,340
I bet no one here knows more about human anatomy than I do.

592
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,909
I'm sure I know way more than the two of you do.

593
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,750
You sure had to be "efficient"...

594
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,690
to take care of 11 bodies.

595
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,860
Then why did you mark the spots where you buried the bodies?

596
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,429
Why did he leave a mark only he would recognize?

597
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:01,469
Was it a type of sentimental act, to remember what he did?

598
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:06,670
To bury other bodies there, time after time,

599
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:09,380
I had to remember the spots so I wouldn't dig them up again.

600
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,759
And they'd be uncomfortable too, even though they're dead.

601
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,000
I chose the spot so they could hear the stream nearby.

602
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,000
I was being considerate so they wouldn't be bored.

603
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,040
Anyway, I did that a few times and got used to it.

604
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,489
I was wrong to expect that the devil would have feelings.

605
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,860
He has no emotions.

606
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,190
All he cares about is comforting himself...

607
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,060
and justifying his actions.

608
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,500
Is that why you desecrated the bodies?

609
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,199
You see, I'm a very curious person.

610
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:08,270
After killing someone,

611
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,139
what's next?

612
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,409
I chopped up the body.

613
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,409
Then what's next?

614
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,889
Have you heard of Richard Chase?

615
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,054
No, never.

616
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:38,464
He's an American serial killer who drank his victims' blood.

617
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,263
He suffered from schizophrenia,

618
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:42,804
so he desecrated the victims and ate their remains.

619
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:44,763
But he just did it in a crazy state...

620
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,574
without any knowledge of anatomy.

621
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:49,804
But that's not what I did.

622
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,743
I'm different.

623
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:58,413
I see that you studied a lot about murder.

624
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,984
I enjoy studying because I'm a curious person.

625
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:09,263
Let's take a break for lunch. We can resume after lunch.

626
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:16,933
Can you eat after hearing all this?

627
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,840
(Snack Shop)

628
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,911
I wanted to curse at him so badly. I had to bite my tongue.

629
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,180
I'll get a bottle of water.

630
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,121
I want another bottle too.

631
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,291
- I bet you have no appetite now. - No, I don't want to eat.

632
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,421
It's a dollar.

633
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:48,990
Thank you.

634
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:03,271
After the break, you should go in alone.

635
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:08,481
I'm just so angry. I'm afraid I'd ruin it.

636
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,081
I think it's better that you go in alone...

637
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,820
to make sure we don't fall for his tricks.

638
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:20,220
We might be overestimating someone who's just a crazy loser.

639
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,101
From now on, I'm going to deal with him my own way.

640
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,921
Where did the other one go?

641
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:52,421
I guess you're pretty brave.

642
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:59,061
We heard enough about the case, so I came in alone.

643
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,300
Then what do you want to talk about now?

644
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,970
Why did you confess to the Imyeong-dong case?

645
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,441
You didn't do it.

646
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:23,150
Well, have you ever wondered how you ended up like this?

647
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,161
Don't people like me all have the same story?

648
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,691
An abusive father.

649
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:34,001
And no one to lean on. I had a miserable childhood.

650
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,800
So do you blame your father?

651
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,970
I bet you have no idea what it's like to live with a dad...

652
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,271
who threatens you with a hammer every time he gets drunk.

653
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,840
I never lived with my father.

654
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,180
He passed away the day I was born.

655
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:48,740
You're lucky.

656
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:51,981
Not having one is better than growing up with a father like that.

657
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,680
It's only natural to become all twisted.

658
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:58,851
You think that's the reason?

659
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,030
Didn't you say you're a criminal behavioral analyst?

660
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:05,030
Didn't you hear such a childhood...

661
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,231
could cause you to become a serial killer?

662
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,371
You see, the prison is full of them.

663
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:16,041
People like me who have no one to lean on.

664
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:19,211
People who are all alone in this world.

665
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,010
Why did you start...

666
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,581
luring your victims to your home...

667
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:27,581
instead of breaking into their homes?

668
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:31,621
Like I said, it was because my home...

669
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,360
was the place where I decided whether or not they could live.

670
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:37,260
Not because you were afraid...

671
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,461
you'd be caught after you saw the security footage?

672
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,800
I killed almost 20 people.

673
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:43,601
I didn't leave any evidence,

674
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:45,731
and I figured out an easy way to take care of the bodies,

675
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:47,441
so why take a risk?

676
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:51,711
So it wasn't because you were afraid?

677
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:52,711
No.

678
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,380
It was not out of fear.

679
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,811
It was because I could kill them unhindered at my place.

680
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:01,880
Why did you stop receiving treatment for your epilepsy?

681
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,661
I was there too.

682
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,961
Darn it.

683
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,561
So you saw everything.

684
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,501
Even being hospitalized didn't help.

685
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,800
Nothing was going my way.

686
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:18,430
The only thing I could do was kill.

687
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:20,871
I guess you had many aspirations.

688
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,871
When I was young,

689
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,880
I wanted to be an artist.

690
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,211
But you need money to do that.

691
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,380
So I thought about becoming a cop...

692
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,421
A cop?

693
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:37,621
Power, influence, and money.

694
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,691
They are the most important things in life.

695
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:41,021
Without it, you get looked down on.

696
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,630
But...

697
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,200
aren't cops just a corrupt group of people too?

698
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,171
Why do you think that?

699
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:52,030
When I forged the police ID card...

700
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,800
and used it to get money, people gave it up so naturally.

701
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,070
This world where the wealthy get rich illegally...

702
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,641
women live promiscuously...

703
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:03,150
and civil servants live like bugs.

704
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,421
They all have to be punished!

705
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,150
If I don't do it...

706
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:13,521
who will punish them?

707
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,161
You talk as if you are implementing social justice.

708
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,630
Do you have the right to do that?

709
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:28,141
Well, I wouldn't say I have the right...

710
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,271
but killing is sort of like a job of mine.

711
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:37,650
Your job?

712
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,720
I'm doing the job that needs to be done.

713
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,260
So...

714
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:50,130
is that why you only chose those who were weaker than you?

715
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,831
You know very well yourself...

716
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,630
just how pathetic that is, right Gu Young Chun?

717
00:47:58,271 --> 00:47:59,271
What?

718
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:01,200
You have no right to punish them.

719
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,470
That goes for everyone else too.

720
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,941
Even if they committed a crime, they should be punished...

721
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,481
within the limits of the law, not by you.

722
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,780
So don't try to justify your horrible actions...

723
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:18,220
with that ridiculous reasoning.

724
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,621
- You're wrong! - Gu Young Chun.

725
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,891
You are...

726
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,331
just a pathetic murderer.

727
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,061
Gu Young Chun is just a nasty scumbag...

728
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,090
who gave divine meaning to his actions...

729
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:02,030
then substituted his helplessness with anger and attacked people.

731
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:23,251

00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,661

733
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:37,530
Yes, let's do that.

734
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,941
What are you doing? Song Ha Young.

735
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,180
Are you okay?

736
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,050
Yes, I'm okay.

737
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:55,680
Pace yourself.

738
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,001
He said killing was his job.

739
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:13,371
Who did?

740
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:15,671
Gu Young Chun?

741
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:18,641
What a crazy scumbag.

742
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,820
Before this, I never heard from anyone...

743
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,851
what they studied in order to cut up the bodies...

744
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,590
and what they felt while mutilating them.

745
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:38,831
On top of that...

746
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:42,300
Never in my life...

747
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,970
did I see a face so full of the sense of superiority and joy.

748
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,740
You did good work.

749
00:50:58,351 --> 00:50:59,450

What is it?

751
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:03,550
Why was it me of all people?

752
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,291
Why did it have to be me...

753
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,791
for a job like this?

754
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:16,800
Ha Young, that...

755
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,601
You said you carried a lighter with you for emergencies, right?

756
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:20,641
Would I feel a little better...

757
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,211
if I get drunk?

758
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,351
I'm sorry.

759
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,760

764

What did the prosecution say about Gu Young Chun?

765
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:40,266
Gu Young Chun, that punk.

766
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:42,936

What are you saying all of a sudden?

786
00:55:18,975 --> 00:55:20,975
You know how fast I can pick things up.

787
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,345
I'm just saying this because I've been watching the two of you...

788
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:26,214
since I joined the team, and things seemed awkward.

789
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:29,654
Song Ha Young, that guy. He only pretends to be righteous.

790
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:33,154
I already know how good he is at betraying people.

791
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:37,825
Hey.

792
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:42,294
Even after what your perp, Jung Soo Chang, said that day,

793
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:44,964
I never told anybody else.

794
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:48,604

796

told you what?

Come on, you can't forget that.

800
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:03,915
He was blabbing on and on about it during my interrogation.

801
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:06,015
I can tell you now that I beat him up so badly...

802
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:08,455
that he wouldn't speak up again. You didn't know, did you?

00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:00,504
I was on my way home,

811
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:02,544
but I saw the lights on,

812
00:57:03,415 --> 00:57:04,515
so I decided to stop by.

813
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:07,584
You're still here.

814
00:57:08,714 --> 00:57:11,615
I had to check something.

815
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:16,555
For the Southwestern Case?

816
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:18,395
Oh, yes.

817
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:22,564
We first thought Gu Young Chun did that,

818
00:57:23,895 --> 00:57:27,464
but our team is also turning the case...

819

in a different direction now.

It'll take some time for you to heal.

828
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:56,464
I have had...

829
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:02,435
a misunderstanding about you, Inspector Song.

830
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:04,904
A misunderstanding?

831
00:58:04,935 --> 00:58:06,174
Right before my promotion,

832
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,345
I said I wanted to right the wrong...

833
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:13,745
because I did not catch Jung Soo Chang.

834
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:18,814
Do you remember what you said?

835
00:58:19,214 --> 00:58:20,555
Why do you suddenly ask?

836
00:58:24,854 --> 00:58:27,865
I said you caught Jung Soo Chang.

837
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:29,294
Yes.

838
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:32,234
You said...

839
00:58:34,134 --> 00:58:36,035
the same thing back then.

840
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:39,334
I know you've had a tough time because of that stalker.

841
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:43,044
I also know how people around you just laughed it off...

842
00:58:43,745 --> 00:58:45,915
and said it's because you're popular.

843
00:58:46,015 --> 00:58:47,944
But it's also true that I was afraid...

844
00:58:48,814 --> 00:58:51,654
even though I was a detective who should be arresting the perp.

845
00:58:52,955 --> 00:58:53,955
Also,

846
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:57,254
someone became a witness to that moment, which made me...

847
00:58:58,354 --> 00:58:59,654
embarrassed...

848
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,464

as well as Gil Pyo.

898
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,634
Don't keep everything to yourself.

899
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:36,305
If you get mad, scream out.

900
01:03:37,634 --> 01:03:39,305
And start swearing too.

901
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:41,444
Do whatever you want. I can deal with it.

902
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:43,915
I'll do that.

903
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,285
I'll broaden my search and look for other cases...

904
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:50,154
similar to the Southwestern Case.

905
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:53,455
I do feel bad...

906
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:56,754
for choosing you for this work.

907
01:03:58,294 --> 01:04:00,225
But even if I went back in time, I'd still choose you.

908
01:04:00,725 --> 01:04:01,964
Me too.

909
01:04:06,464 --> 01:04:08,134
You know how cheesy this is, right?

910
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:10,004
Yes, I do. I know.

911
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:12,734
I'm just saying it over a drink.

912
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:14,604
Woo Ju, do you want one more drink too?

913
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:23,044
Goodness. Woo Ju.

914
01:04:23,314 --> 01:04:26,084
We're looking for a psycho who's lurking around...

915
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:27,524
the Southwestern area with a knife in his hand.

916
01:04:27,524 --> 01:04:29,154
The weapon continues to change.

917
01:04:29,154 --> 01:04:31,754
It's good for you to focus on work, but we're in for a long haul.

918
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:33,395
The more we delay this and hesitate,

919
01:04:33,395 --> 01:04:34,865
the more the victims will increase.

920
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:37,165
Special Crime Squad also wants to catch the culprit.

921
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,995
His MO evolved by studying his crimes.

922
01:04:39,995 --> 01:04:41,104
What's next?

923
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,904
- What are you doing? - Copying him.

924
01:04:42,904 --> 01:04:44,234
I'm trying to become the culprit.

925
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:45,975
For the first time,

926
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:48,075
I'm starting to wonder if what I did was right.

927
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:55,515
(Next Friday at 10pm)
