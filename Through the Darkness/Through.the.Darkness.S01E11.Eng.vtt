Luckily, he's out of the woods for now.

Thank you.

10
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,469
Thank you. Thank you for saving him.

11
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,708
I should have kept a closer eye on him.

12
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,948
It's all right.

13
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,978

Right.

00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,989
Was I six years old then?

16
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,928
I went to an amusement park with my mother on Children's Day.

17
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,499
I saw a dead body for the first time that day.

18
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:51,269
You were pretty young.

19
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,139
The body was in the water.

20
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,868
When I saw her face underwater, she didn't scare me.

21
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:00,808
She just looked so lonely.

22
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:03,879
"She must have been terrified."

23
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,719
"She must've been in pain and lonely."

24
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,149
That crossed my mind.

25
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:12,518
So I wanted to reach out to hold her hand.

26
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,089

36

- They deserve nothing but death. - has caused controversy.

37
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,292
Why do people want to keep him alive?

38
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:58,933
I really don't get it.

39
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,833
What he did was inhumane. He doesn't deserve human rights.

40
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,403
Sir, I'm sorry. But could you turn that off?

41

I told you everything I know over the phone.

64

70

She was having fun with her customer here.

often go AWOL and move to another karaoke.

94
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,663
I guess that must've been why.

95
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:53,663

When I was investigating this case,

97
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,502
an acquaintance who worked at a karaoke in Suwon said...

98
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,842
another worker from that karaoke...

99
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:02,603

And I don't when there's none.

104
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,623
You're a detective. Tell me about your hunches.

105
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:21,563
Show me that you're at least trying to open this case.

106
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:24,262
Gosh. There was a time...

107
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:27,363
when I had to pay a hefty price because of my hunches.

108
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,873
So I'm careful with everything.

109

Then...

114
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:50,022
is it possible that there was no motive behind these cases?

115
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:51,952
Is that your hunch as a detective?

116
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:54,863
Well, every detective has a hunch.

117
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:57,663

Why would you come here twice if this wasn't serious?

127
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,102
Did she pay you monthly rent? Or did she put down a huge deposit?

128
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:37,702
She paid me rent.

If you couldn't reach her in February,

130
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,513
she must be behind rent at least for three months.

131
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:51,783
Yes. But I can just deduct her rent from the initial deposit she made.

181
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,163
I guess he hasn't heard about Inspector Song yet.

182
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:21,633
He's at Gyeonggi Agency now,

183
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,972
so he wouldn't know unless he intentionally looked into it.

184
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,442
This is a missing person's case.

185
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:29,803
Let's check the area and her movements leading up...

186
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,673
- to the time of the incident. - Yes, sir.

187
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:43,893
You're doing great.

188
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:46,893
Let's try that one more time.

189
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,903
Nerve paralysis?

190
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:59,572
When the fractures occurred at the time of the accident,

191
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:02,602
some of the nerves around the bones were damaged.

192
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:05,413
Thankfully, he can move his toes,

193
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:08,513
and there isn't a complete loss of sensation,

194
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:11,053
so I'd say it's partial paralysis.

195
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:13,082
In cases like this,

196
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:15,982
you could recover through rehabilitative therapy.

197
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:18,553
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency...

198
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:21,192
transferred gang members who had been...

199
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,362
embezzling a large amount of cash through an illegal casino...

200
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:24,933
to the prosecution.

201
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:27,663
We wrapped up another case.

202
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,462
Good work, everyone.

203
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:30,972
How about a team dinner?

204
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,442
You want to drink, don't you? Sit down already.

205
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:36,602
The case isn't closed until the trial is over.

206
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:39,242
I told them to contact us if they need additional evidence.

207
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,383
Okay.

208
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:44,013
The gift certificates they received were used...

209
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,553
Oh, shouldn't we visit Inspector Song in the hospital?

210
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:51,192
We haven't seen him since he moved to the general ward, right?

211
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:52,322
That's right.

212
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:57,533
(Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency)

213
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:05,972
Look at you.

214
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,503
Salute, Superintendent Heo Gil Pyo.

215
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,513
Did you really come alone?

216
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:15,242
Why? Am I not good enough?

217
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:17,813
I trained Korea's first criminal profiler.

218
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:18,883
I'm in high demand.

219
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:22,722
- Goodness. Don't be so difficult. - This is so cool.

220
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,153
Oh, there he is.

221
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,023
This is Chief Park Dae Woong of the Serious Crime Unit.

222
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:29,663
He is from Gyeonggi Agency. You know him, right?

223
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:31,663
- Yes, we've met. - It's been a while.

224
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,862
Take a seat.

225
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,872
Are you in charge of this case?

226
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:40,442
No, Anyang Police Station is in charge of the investigation,

227
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,503
but it's a little strange.

228
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:45,842
As for the unreported case in Suwon, she has no family?

229
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,482
That's right. That was probably why no one called it in.

230
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:52,283
What's going on?

231
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:56,222
Don't tell me... No, right?

232
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:58,492
Hey, I'm still new here.

233
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,222
Isn't that why you got in touch with me?

234
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,192
I'll go check the scene first.

235
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,592
I'll go with you.

236
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:11,273
(Rehabilitation Room)

237
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:12,472
(Gukil Hospital)

238
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,403
Be careful.

239
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,183
Inspector Song.

240
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,482
My gosh, you came again.

241
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,053
Yes. Here, it's just something small.

242
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,253
My gosh, you always bring something.

243
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:35,122
- Where can I put this? - You can put it over there.

244
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,633
I'll leave you to talk. Since you're here,

245
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,232
I should step out for lunch.

246
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,202
You didn't have to come all the way here.

247
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,572
I heard you were undergoing rehabilitation.

248
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:48,872
How are you feeling?

249
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,572
Not bad.

250
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:54,342
Make yourselves at home. I'll leave you to talk.

251
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,913
Please stay. We'll leave soon.

252
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,653
You'll feel more comfortable without me.

253
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:02,183
No, ma'am. That's not why we're here.

254
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:06,852
- Yes, just stay. - I want to step out for lunch.

255
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:10,663
- All right, then. - Enjoy your lunch.

256
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,393
Thank you.

257
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,633
Oh, let me.

258
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,972
I can do it by myself. Thank you.

259
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,683
You're doing much better now.

260
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:30,753
Oh, we came to see you when you were in the ICU.

261
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,352
That was when Captain Yoon and I met your mother for the first time.

262
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:38,492
Get better soon so we can work together again.

263
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:42,862
Yes, you're in high demand at the moment.

264
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,602
The Behavioural Analysis Team was very busy to begin with,

265
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,033
but Chief Kook has to take care of most things by himself now,

266
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,972
so he's always swamped these days.

267
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:55,702
But you're almost fully recovered now.

268
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,712
You should be able to return to work very soon.

269
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,742
I don't want to go back.

270
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:18,163
As you can see, it's a quiet area.

271
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,133
It is a karaoke bar, but most customers...

272
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:23,872
are people who live in the area.

273
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,602
I don't see any CCTV cameras.

274
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:28,102
That's right. They already interviewed...

275
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,942
every single customer who visited that day...

276
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,342
but found nothing.

277
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,043
But her phone...

278
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,283
On the map, you'll see Daejong Lake.

279
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:39,153
(Tojung-dong, Daejong Lake)

280
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,622
Daejong Lake? It's like a recreation area.

281
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:44,293
It's estimated that she went missing at around 1am,

282
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,122
so she didn't go there for a day of fun.

283
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,023
And nothing was caught on the CCTV footage.

284
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,592
Any possibility of suicide?

285
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,133
The divers already searched the entire lake...

286
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,462
but found nothing. She didn't commit suicide.

287
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:59,202
And the thing is, the person she last spoke to...

288
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,403
was her daughter.

289
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:04,142
She told her she'd pick up some fried chicken and head home.

290
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:08,513
It's impossible to hail a taxi here.

291
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:12,553
Then she probably took a bus at that stop.

292
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,453
Oh, right.

293
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,483
We already looked into it and even interviewed...

294
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:20,322
the driver who drove the last bus that night,

295
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:22,463
and she wasn't on the bus.

296
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:25,733
And the location where her phone last pinged...

297
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:28,033
is far from the bus route.

298
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:33,203
Then how did she get there?

299
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,973
She must've walked or...

300
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,513
She was kidnapped?

301
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:48,053
- Hello. - I guess it's your day off.

302
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:51,053
Yes. Oh, your soybean paste soup was so good.

303
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,763
- Really? I'll make it again. - Thank you. Have a good day.

304
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:55,122
You too, take it easy.

305
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,142
Oh, boy.

306
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,102
Her family must be so worried.

307
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,832
(Have you seen this woman? Help me find my mother.)

308
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:41,443
Song Ha Young is doing well, right?

309
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,713
I've been meaning to get in touch, but I've been too busy.

310
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:50,082
I thought he'd come with you.

311
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:51,513
Ha Young is...

312
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,382
Did he not want to come because of me?

313
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,453
- You know how he is, right? - I sure do.

314
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,253
He doesn't hold grudges.

315
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,723
He probably doesn't care to know what I'm up to.

316
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:03,963
If you're curious,

317
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,733
you could reach out to him first, you know.

318
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:09,533
Right, I'm sure I'll see him soon anyway.

319
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,172
You know, time will fly by.

320
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,102
And you may never get a chance.

321
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:16,773
Sorry?

322
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,773
Let's head over to Daejong Lake.

323
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:26,983
He never loses his heart.

324
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:27,983
Beta-carotene!

325
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,622
- Hi. - Hello.

326
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,152
Nam Ki Tae, the suspect...

327
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,352
of Southwestern Serial Murder Case in Seoul,

328
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,162
showed no remorse for his actions...

329
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,793
during his first trial last month.

330
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,963
His attitude brought upon rage from the bereaved families and...

331
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,533
Why would I feel remorse?

332
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,902
I'm not sorry at all. I don't even feel guilty.

333
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,313
I'm so sorry, Hwa Yeon.

334
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:02,882
I'm sorry, Hwa Yeon.

335
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:20,172
In that intersection up ahead, the road splits up...

336
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:23,443
into the victim's home and Daejong Lake.

337
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,973
You can turn left and find Daejong Lake.

338
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:36,783
(Daejong Lake)

339
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:40,493
If she wanted to go home, she should've taken a right.

340
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,162
The location of the phone the missing person had was...

341
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:47,332
right there on the left, turned off as she went for the lake.

342
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,503
Let's say she was abducted.

343
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:51,003
If she was forced to get in his car,

344
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:53,102
he would've taken her phone first.

345
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,473
But the phone of an abducted woman was...

346
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,872
turned on until she got here.

347
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,612
The last person she talked to was her daughter.

348
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:01,983
After she left the karaoke room,

349
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,082
she didn't make any calls.

350
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:05,713
Could she have hopped in herself?

351
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,622
Not unless she knew him.

352
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:09,352
She wouldn't get into a stranger's car.

353
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,493
Did you say you questioned all of her associates?

354
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,193
Yes.

355
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:19,362
(Daejong Lake)

356
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:04,773
(Gukil Hospital)

357
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,983
They came and visited you twice...

358
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,713
even when you were in the ICU.

359
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:15,253
You didn't know?

360
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,793
A few more visited you other than them.

361
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,352
You didn't know that either?

362
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:20,922
Not just Chief Young Soo?

363
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,362
Chief Young Soo stops by very often.

364
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,233
Some younger people came too.

365
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:28,533
A woman and a man.

366
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:30,132
I see.

367
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,632
And there were other people from the Seoul Agency,

368
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:34,973
someone on the older side.

369
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,243
Then other people who said they're your colleagues...

370
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:39,072
lined up to visit you,

371
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:41,043
even after you were moved here and bed bound.

372
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,743
Even as you were on the bed,

373
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:46,753
all of your colleagues flooded in and visited you,

374
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,422
so I was really glad.

375
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,892
You didn't know if your son was going to wake up,

376
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,092
but you were glad about that?

377
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:55,223
Why wouldn't I know that?

378
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:57,632
I knew you would wake up.

379
00:22:58,063 --> 00:22:59,963
How did you know? Even the doctor didn't.

380
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,733
I'm your mom.

381
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,973
(Gukil Hospital)

382
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,342
Ha Young is asleep, right?

383
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:16,912
Yes, he fell asleep half an hour ago.

384
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,652
I see. How was he today?

385
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:21,152
His rehab is going well,

386
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:23,753
and he's recovering quickly too.

387
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,352
Right, Captain Yoon and Detective Nam stopped by...

388
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:28,422
this afternoon.

389
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:30,293
Goodness, he must've felt awkward.

390
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:32,963
Only on the outside. He's not like that on the inside.

391
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,432
It's not like I've known him only for a couple of days.

392
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,672
I can tell by his face.

393
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:44,243
So, Chief Young Soo, you should meet Ha Young before you leave.

394
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:47,172
I still can't muster up the courage.

395
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:50,313
Goodness.

396
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,592
(Manyeon-dong, Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province)

397
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,503
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

398
00:33:58,472 --> 00:24:23,917
Oh, I'm not dangerous.

399
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:27,147
I wanted to ask you for directions.

400
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:28,457
Sure.

401
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:32,127
I'm trying to go to Taepyeong Park. Which way do I need to go?

402
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,326
It's probably closed right now.

403
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:37,497
Oh, I'm not trying to go there.

404
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:39,197
I'm going in that direction.

405
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:40,697
I see.

406
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:46,866
You can go down this way for about 900m.

407
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:49,836
When you see a big barbecue place on the right, take a right.

408
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,546
Turn right at the barbecue place.

409
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:55,076
- Yes. And then... - One second.

410
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:58,116
I have a bad memory, so let me write it down.

411
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,487
Hold on.

412
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,957
I don't have paper or pens.

413
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:08,997
It's not that confusing.

414
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:11,796
Turn right at the barbecue place,

415
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:13,397
- then the second intersection... - Where are you headed?

416
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:15,637
Me?

417
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:18,306
If you don't mind, I can give you a ride.

418
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,177
The bus will be here soon. It's all right.

419
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:24,006
I'm driving down anyway.

420
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:26,207
If you're going in the same direction, I'll give you a ride.

421
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:27,816
No, I'm fine.

422
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,217
I'm not dangerous, you know.

423
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:33,147
Oh, that's not why.

424
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:37,526
My house is near the bus stop, so I'm really fine.

425
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:40,856
Well, the world is now a dangerous place,

426
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:42,657
so it's uncomfortable to just hop in, right?

427
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:44,826
No.

428
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:46,727
When will the bus get here?

429
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,667
- Is it the last bus? - It's about time it came.

430
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,237
Did you miss the last one?

431
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,306
Then I can wait with you.

432
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,947
If you missed the last bus, I can give you a ride.

433
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:01,217
No, I'm really fine.

434
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:04,147
No, I'll leave after I see you get on the bus.

435
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,116
Sure.

436
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:21,566
The last bus left, right?

437
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:23,937
Gosh.

438
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:27,877
It's pretty late, so I have to get going too.

439
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,977
You really won't get in?

440
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:31,076
Will you be all right?

441
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:32,947
I'll go, then.

442
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:39,717
Then can you just tell me the directions once again?

443
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:45,157
Go down this way, then at the barbecue...

444
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:46,487
Why don't you just get in?

445
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,856
Why are you so anxious?

446
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,596
Goodness, it must be cold.

447
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:53,427
Hop in.

448
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,207
In that case, thank you.

449
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:04,907
The bus is here. I'll take that.

450
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:07,576
Take a left on the second intersection.

451
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:10,776
(Sinjeong District 5)

452
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,727
Darn it.

453
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,266
Darn it!

454
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:35,576
Man, that bus.

455
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,776
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

456
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,177
Can you check if there are...

457
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:45,887
any similar cases in Gyeonggi area?

458
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:48,516
Yes.

459
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,756
The first one wasn't even reported.

460
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,397
We can only speculate instead of investigating it.

461
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:00,766
It's tough to be the judge just with that case.

462
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:04,096
Anyway, continue to check and see if there are any similar cases.

463
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:08,606
Okay.

464
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:11,947
- Captain Yoon. - Thank you.

465
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:13,677
You're here.

466
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:15,046
- Thank you. - Chief.

467
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:16,177
- Is that for me? - Yes.

468
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:17,276
- Thank you. - Sure.

469
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,687
It feels like...

470
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,217
I'm on a break for a moment,

471
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:25,286
drinking coffee away from the Wide-Area Investigation office.

472
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,897
Coffee is about the only thing that can comfort...

473
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,197
people like us.

474
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:30,526
So...

475
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:33,627
is the Analysis Team working on a case?

476
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,266
Oh, it's Gil Pyo.

477
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:36,667
Superintendent Heo?

478
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,806
Well, it's a missing case of employees at karaokes.

479
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:43,437
He said there were one each in February and April.

480
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:44,846
He asked me to look into it,

481
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,346
so yesterday, I went to the Gyeonggi Agency.

482
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:47,977
Did you go alone?

483
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,076
Yes, it's not even that far.

484
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:54,086
But what do you mean the first case...

485
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,217
was not reported?

486
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,856
I overheard you on the phone.

487
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,657
While they investigated the missing case from April,

488
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,727
they found out that there was an unreported missing case,

489
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,227
because she lived alone without any family.

490
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,427
I see.

491
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:10,637
Right, so what brings you here?

492
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,806
Detective Nam and I...

493
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,076
went to visit Inspector Song at the hospital yesterday.

494
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:20,747
I heard.

495
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,016
He seemed very exhausted.

496
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:26,947
I think...

497
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:30,217
he needs some time to himself.

498
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:32,856
(Resignation Letter)

499
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,997
I don't want to go back to work.

500
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,296
I see. Well,

501
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:42,137
don't think about anything else,

502
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:45,937
and just focus on your health while you stay in the hospital.

503
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,977
I'm spending...

504
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:52,477
a lot more time with my mother after I was hospitalized.

505
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:54,677
We're having meals together.

506
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:58,586
And we're talking a lot more.

507
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:05,957
I can't even remember the last time I had a normal day like this.

508
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:12,296
I realized that having a normal life like this was the joy of life.

509
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:19,066
I had been dealing with only evil, intelligent criminals.

510
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,477
So I guess I was tired.

511
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,407
- Captain Kook. - Yes.

512
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:30,677
Do you think I was only trying to put myself...

513
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,687
in their shoes?

514
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:37,187
To be honest, what scared me the most...

515
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,586
was the anxiety...

516
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:44,096
that there might be a different side of me I was not aware of.

517
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,366
I was scared...

518
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,266
that I might even turn into them.

519
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,806
For now,

520
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,907
don't let these thoughts get to you. Okay?

521
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,076
Just look after yourself, and get some rest. I'll get going.

522
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:09,056
And I will hold onto this for now.

523
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:10,316
Captain Kook.

524
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,997
I don't want to go back.

525
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,526
- Chief Kook. - Yes.

526
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:24,667
I'm here because that's what I wanted to talk about.

527
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:30,276
It's fine. Woo Ju knows everything.

528
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:32,046
Okay.

529
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:36,747
You watched the interview. So you know...

530
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,987
that they're beyond our imagination.

531
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:42,887
Those monsters...

532
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:45,887
dump out a different kind of trash we didn't see during interrogation.

533
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:48,157
And handling this trash...

534
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:50,657
isn't easy.

535
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:51,667
Right.

536
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,566
And that probably exploded.

537
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,667
He needs time to empty it out too.

538
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:03,237
Time to empty it out...

539
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:06,377
You need to take it easy too, Captain Yoon.

When people keep running without a break,

541
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:11,487
they always trip over and explode.

542
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:13,947
So...

543
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:19,187
what do you plan to do about Inspector Song?

544
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,687
I need to wait.

545
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:26,967
After everything he's been through, I couldn't push him again...

546
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,237
because I felt responsible...

547
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:33,566

No. Let's just talk.

552
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:57,296
It's a waste of energy. Why don't you sing a song?

553
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:02,137
I would rather talk to you than sing a song.

554
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:05,467
Sure. I'll turn off the music.

555
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,076
Do you want to go out for another round?

556
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,526

- Stop it. - Come on.

558

What is this? Get your hands off me.

559
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,066
- Stop it! - It's fine.

560
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:40,006

Yes. It is. But why do you ask?

571
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:49,074
Could you give this to Detective Song?

572
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,735

643

and realized...

644
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,664
that I had been able to hold out...

645
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,965

I want to congratulate you on your recovery.

It's just a small token of my appreciation.

661

- Thank you very much. - No problem.

00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:43,454
Some of the bereaved manage to pluck up the courage to live on,

663
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:47,824

665
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:56,465

- You woke him up. - I'm sorry.

670
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:30,925
It's okay. I had to get up anyway.

671
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,465
- When did you get here? - Just now.

672
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:34,624
Here, this is for you.

673
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:37,034
I picked out the best ones.

674
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,095

676
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,034

677
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,175
He'll be here later.

678
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:47,545
- Have some. - Thank you.

679
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,675
- You too, Reporter Choi. - Thank you.

680
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:52,514
You can go home soon, right?

681
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,085
- Yes, in 2 days. - After almost 6 months.

682
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:58,485
- How do you feel? - Is this an interview?

683
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,085

684
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,525
Of course, he's excited.

685
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:04,494
Then what will you do as soon as you get home?

686
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:06,264
I'm not sure.

687
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:08,894
I haven't really thought about it.

688

Wait, hold on!

689
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:35,054
- Let's go eat something. - You want to eat again?

690
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:36,695
You didn't have dinner?

691
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:39,695
I did, but I'm hungry again. It's winter, you know.

692

693
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,635
- It's good to eat a lot. - Oh, Chief Kook.

694
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:46,764
- You made it. - We waited for you until now.

695
00:44:46,764 --> 00:44:48,905
- I see. You're leaving now? - Yes, we are.

696
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:50,675
You're here.

697

Get in, guys.

699
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:57,414
I guess these guys kept you up.

700
00:44:57,414 --> 00:44:58,615
You should be in bed now.

701
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,845
You just got here. Are you leaving right away?

702
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,085
Yes. I mean, no.

703
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:09,454
Actually, I should get going. You need to go to bed.

704
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,565
I'm glad to see you looking healthy. I'll be off, then.

705
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:13,595
Bye.

706
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:16,295
- See you in the office. - Okay, good night.

I can give you a ride.

714

Can you explain the case to me in detail?

807
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:27,965
All right. As it was reported here,

808
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,874
a woman went missing from a karaoke bar in April.

809
00:51:30,874 --> 00:51:32,744
But back in February,

810
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:36,574
another employee from a karaoke bar went missing but it wasn't reported.

811
00:51:36,574 --> 00:51:38,315
Then 2 days ago, on the 23rd,

812
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:41,715
a female university student went missing from the same bus stop.

813
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:44,284
I think it's the same perp for all three cases.

814
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:48,085
We think this because when we visited the crime scene...

815
00:51:48,224 --> 00:51:49,954
for the case in April, there was a bus stop there too.

816
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:51,454
Then what about the undeclared case from February?

817
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:53,365
There was a bus stop there too.

818
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:57,195
All three cases share the similarity that it's in a desolate area.

819
00:51:59,434 --> 00:52:00,934
He's looking at the location.

820
00:52:01,865 --> 00:52:03,735
You figured that out about him already?

821
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,945
- I'm sure there are no witnesses? - That's right.

822
00:52:10,945 --> 00:52:12,545
So if we take Chief Kook's guess...

823
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:15,585
and assume that all three were abducted from a bus stop...

824
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:17,585
It means all three of them were waiting for the bus.

825
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:18,655
What time did they go missing?

826
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:20,885
All of their phones went radio silent...

827
00:52:20,885 --> 00:52:22,425
around 1am in the morning.

828
00:52:23,394 --> 00:52:24,954
They must've been waiting for the last bus.

829
00:52:26,124 --> 00:52:28,264
He might have forced the adult women into the car.

830
00:52:28,264 --> 00:52:32,034
Don't you need at least two people to force an adult into your car?

831
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:33,965
They were offered a free ride.

832
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:36,635
- What? - A free ride, you say.

833
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:37,775
If there are two culprits,

834
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:40,505
there's no good reason to abduct women from a bus stop.

835
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:42,644
They can just target a woman walking alone in a desolate area...

836
00:52:42,644 --> 00:52:44,414
and abduct her by forcing her into the car.

837
00:52:47,345 --> 00:52:50,784
I think there's a high chance that it's the same serial culprit.

891
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:27,675
Anyone in that situation would have done the same thing.

892
00:55:29,104 --> 00:55:30,744
It's all in the past now.

893
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:33,184
I'm just glad that we got to meet again.

894
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:36,854
Let's do our best.

895
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:53,104
Did you hear the rumours about you whipping me into shape?

896
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:56,574
What kind of absolute nonsense is that?

897
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,804
Who whipped who into what?

898
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:00,644
People just love to gossip.

899
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:02,345

901
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,014
It's true though.

902
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:15,724
The buses run in 40 to 50 minute intervals. That's quite a wait.

903
00:56:16,324 --> 00:56:17,354
Right.

904
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:19,224
There aren't many taxis either.

905
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:21,525
I'm sure there are fewer at night.

906
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:22,865
He probably had that in mind.

907
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,335
The decision to install more CCTVs has been finalized, right?

908
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,905
Yes. They said they'll install more in the areas of disappearance...

909
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:30,804
and all nearby locations.

The CCTVs should help, right?

913
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:53,394
I'm sure he'll be more cautious with the lack of blind spots.

914
00:56:54,224 --> 00:56:56,195
It's been over nine months now.

915
00:56:56,764 --> 00:56:58,295
I hope they are alive.

916
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:02,164
At least none of the missing women were found dead yet.

917
00:57:03,474 --> 00:57:04,675
Yes, you're right.

918
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:06,905
We should be hopeful.

919

(Gyeonggi Investigation Headquarters of Serial Missing Women Cases)

933
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:58,438
All three cases broke out when the wind chill factor was low.

934
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,438
It was a secluded area, so buses didn't come often.

935
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:03,648
I stood alone at the bus stop,

936
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:05,577
but a truck came by and offered me a ride...

937
00:58:05,577 --> 00:58:07,017
out into the main street.

938
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,418
You won't find a bus here even if you waited.

939
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,488
He takes advantage of the situation and the psychology of the victims.

940
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:13,887
The buses don't run often,

941
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,227
so there was a friendly culture in that neighbourhood...

942
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:18,088
of giving people rides.

943
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:21,258
On a cold day, it must've been easier.

944
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:24,997
So he used his kind face as a mask to lure them?

945
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:26,637
Yes.

946
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:30,537
Even so, how can they gladly hop into a stranger's car?

947
00:58:30,537 --> 00:58:31,738
They didn't hop in gladly.

948
00:58:32,738 --> 00:58:34,807
He must've convinced anybody to hop in.

949
00:58:34,807 --> 00:58:38,577
Then he must drive a luxurious sedan that doesn't look like a threat.

950
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:40,247
Or he might have...

951
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:42,418
something in his car that drives away people's suspicion.

952
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,088
A family photo? Or stuffed animals?

953
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:48,957
- A baby? - If a baby is in the car,

954
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:52,258
people rarely ask anybody else to join them.

955
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:54,997
The first thing the victim looks at is the driver.

956
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,068
So I think the suspect may look amicable,

957
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:00,267
someone who doesn't draw people's suspicion.

958
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:02,367
I'm sure he doesn't look intimidating.

959
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:03,608
Someone who looks likeable.

960
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:05,838

969

The victim is Heo Geum Young, 51 years old,

970
00:59:31,398 --> 00:59:33,537
- went missing in Gunpo. - And is it similar?

971
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:34,968
She went missing...

972
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:37,338
at a bus stop in a secluded area.

973
00:59:37,338 --> 00:59:40,637

974
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:42,207

976
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:46,548
No, I got it. I have to use the restroom too.

977

986
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:22,378
The missing person worked in Haeyong Industrial Park.

987
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:24,747
She usually commuted by bus...

988
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,517
at the bus stop in front of the industrial park.

989
01:00:26,517 --> 01:00:29,287
That area only has industrial parks around,

990
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:31,528
so everything is pitch dark at night.

991
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:34,528

He probably didn't make a move by day.

1021
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:45,054

01:05:57,713 --> 01:05:59,543
has been missing for 18 days,

1067
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,883
so the police began an open search.

1068
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:05,414
The police obtained the footage of a man in his 20s to 30s...

1069
01:06:05,414 --> 01:06:08,753
withdrawing 700 dollars with this woman's debit card...

1070
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:10,124
at a bank.

1071
01:06:10,124 --> 01:06:13,224
He's now openly wanted as the key suspect.

1072
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:15,424
Yes, all right.

1073
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,964
I checked with the taxi company,

1074
01:06:18,964 --> 01:06:21,103
and they haven't found the driver and the vehicle yet.

1075
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:22,733
If he grabbed a taxi,

1076
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,634
he probably lives not too far away from the bank.

1077
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:26,773
The bank is close to where the victim went missing.

1078
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:28,603
It won't be easy,

1079
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:32,674
but let's check every CCTV footage on streets from the missing point...

1080
01:06:32,674 --> 01:06:34,114
to the bank.

1081
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:39,053
We'll check every footage within six kilometres...

1082
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:41,424
- of the bank. - Everything?

1083
01:06:41,853 --> 01:06:44,294
There are at least over 300 CCTVs out there.

1084
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:47,294
- Yes, we'll check everything. - Please cooperate.

1085
01:06:47,624 --> 01:06:48,763
- Okay. - Okay.

1086
01:06:53,534 --> 01:06:54,603
Right here.

1087
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,403
What were you doing then?

1088
01:07:02,744 --> 01:07:04,813
I was at home.

1089
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,614
Darn it.

1090
01:07:15,924 --> 01:07:17,223
Let's keep trying.

1091
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:21,424
(Munsan)

1092
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:25,794
Gyeonggi 89.

1093
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:29,773
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1094
01:07:31,773 --> 01:07:34,443
(Responsible Gyeonggi Police for safety and order)

1095
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:43,483
Hold on.

1096
01:07:44,153 --> 01:07:46,653
Could you rewind the footage just now?

1097
01:07:48,384 --> 01:07:50,893
Yes. That one. Please zoom in.

1098
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:59,164
- Chief Kook. Come over here. - Yes?

1099
01:07:59,164 --> 01:08:02,103
(Responsible Gyeonggi Police for safety and order)

1100
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:40,954
(The epilogue will air shortly.)

1101
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:45,921
(Through the Darkness, Part 2)

1102
01:09:18,643 --> 01:09:19,773
Gosh.

1103
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:23,884
I've been working in the force for about 30 years.

1104
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:25,553
And in my opinion,

1105
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:30,723
you are the best cop Korea has.

1106
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:34,164
That was random. What are you talking about?

1107
01:09:34,393 --> 01:09:37,093
I've never seen you second guess yourself.

1108
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:40,504
You only focus on your job. You don't let the job get to you.

1109
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:43,303
So for the past 20 years, I have been watching you...

1110
01:09:43,303 --> 01:09:45,803
killing it at work without much trouble.

1111
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:48,343
And I realized that people like you...

1112
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:50,914
were born to be police officers.

1113
01:09:52,143 --> 01:09:55,013
And I was proud to have a competent junior like you.

1114
01:09:56,553 --> 01:09:59,454
But the guy you scouted, Song Ha Young,

1115
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:03,853
is just like you. He reminds me of you in every sense.

1116
01:10:03,853 --> 01:10:06,393
What? How does he remind you of me?

1117
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:12,034
Ha Young is young, handsome,

1118
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:14,233
and looks great with a perm.

1119
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:18,903
You two can't see it.

1120
01:10:19,433 --> 01:10:21,374
But in my opinion,

1121
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:24,374
you and Ha Young...

1122
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:26,784
are the same kind.

1123
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:31,313
So that got me worried all of a sudden.

1124
01:10:31,784 --> 01:10:35,183
- Worried about whom? - Isn't it obvious? It's you.

1125
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:37,693
Why? I'm a grown man.

1126
01:10:41,624 --> 01:10:45,364
It's easy to come back after running away once.

1127
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:47,464
But...

1128
01:10:48,664 --> 01:10:51,603
people who never thought about resigning...

1129
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,903
had been working together.

1130
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:57,643
So I was worried that...

1131
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:03,084
both of you might give up if one of you crumbled down.

1132
01:11:07,424 --> 01:11:08,853
You do have a point.

1133
01:11:12,193 --> 01:11:13,864
That's how I feel right now.

1134
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:19,494
Just like you said, I've been wrong for the last 20 years.

1135
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:24,773
It doesn't feel like I've been focusing on my job.

1136
01:11:26,773 --> 01:11:28,874
Because I was too busy with my job,

1137
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,674
maybe, I failed to take care of my team.

1138
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:37,714
And I wonder if I've been doing it wrong the whole time.

1139
01:11:39,813 --> 01:11:40,983
Young Soo.

1140
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:46,994
Cops are human too.

1141
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:53,803
Get in. I had fun today.

1142
01:11:53,803 --> 01:11:56,063
- Let's grab one more drink. - We had enough.

1143
01:11:57,204 --> 01:11:59,773
- Sir, please drive him home safely. - Sure.

1144
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,343
Apartment Complex Seven in Mok-dong.

1145
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,044
- You can go. - One more drink.

1146
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:05,473
- Bye. - Wait.

1147
01:12:05,714 --> 01:12:06,714
Let's get one more drink!

1148
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:10,584
Thanks, Gil Pyo!

1149
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:24,563
Woo Ho Sung?

1150
01:12:24,634 --> 01:12:26,233
Did you want to see me?

1151
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:28,864
Can we continue this talk at the Police Agency?

1152
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:31,174
Are you suspecting me? Do you have proof?

1153
01:12:31,174 --> 01:12:32,834
We can't give him more time.

1154
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,303
He'll get rid of all the evidence.

1155
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,744
This guy is evil.

1156
01:12:35,744 --> 01:12:37,513
What if I'm not the culprit?

1157
01:12:37,513 --> 01:12:39,544
He must have been under pressure.

1158
01:12:42,114 --> 01:12:44,313
- Who is this? - This is Woo Ho Sung.

1159
01:12:46,524 --> 01:12:51,134
(The final episode will air tomorrow at 10pm.)
