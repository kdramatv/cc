00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,466
at the Police University. I saw it just now.

37
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:18,236
It's a robbery case. They said it seemed suspicious,

38
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,135
so Captain Yoon and I took a look.

39
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,936

Didn't you break into the apartment in Sinheung-dong to steal money?

53

Yes.

54
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,116

I could tell right away.

66
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,086
You're right. I met him.

67
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:43,526
He indeed is a bluffer and a loser.

68
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,255

70

I know these things.

78
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,285
But I have to say,

79
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,286
I've never seen a robber with a pipe wrench.

80
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:19,786
Why did you pick such a heavy tool?

81
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,596
Because I may have to kill them.

82
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,025
Why do you have to kill them?

83
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,926
Goodness. They saw me. That's why.

84
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:28,096
Are you really a detective?

85
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,806

90

I know a thing or two when it comes to this stuff.

91
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,726
But there are more affluent neighborhoods.

92
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:52,385
Why Sinheung-dong, if you needed money?

93
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,525
Many rich people from Gangnam have moved there.

94
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,726
I was going to walk around the area and pick my targets,

95
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,096
but I couldn't even do anything because security was so tight.

96

So you changed your plan and targeted low-income buildings.

97

98
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,536
so they had no choice.

99
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,775
Don't you feel bad for them?

100
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,416
Why should I?

101
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,846
It's their fault for being poor.

102
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,455
- Then why did you start the fire? - What?

103
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,565
I...

104
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,695
That wasn't me.

105
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,195
I didn't do it.

106
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,306
I didn't start the fire.

107
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,436
I didn't do it, the fire.

108
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,046
All right, we can talk about that again later.

00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,085
How do you know?

112
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,025
I'm an introvert too, just like you.

113
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:03,496

114
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:05,496

115
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:11,606
Totally.

123
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,996
Everywhere I went, I had to suffer and get beaten up.

124
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,866
I even had to put up with that awful thing.

125
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:46,705
When?

126
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,835
- When I was little. - How old were you?

127
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,275
When I was in elementary school.

128
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,116
Who did that to you?

129
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,145
My neighbor, an old man.

130
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,755
That must've been a lot to handle for a kid.

131
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,825
Do you want to keep talking to me?

132
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,726
Yes.

133
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:16,835
Then answer every question the detectives here ask you.

134
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,806
Do that, and we'll talk again.

135
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,936
I don't want to go back to jail.

136
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,346
Whenever I think about that time, I feel crazy.

137
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,876
I get so upset and angry, to the point that I'd rather die!

138
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,015
If you struggled that much,

139
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,916
why didn't you speak with the correctional officers?

140
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,486
I complained numerous times,

141
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:37,585
but no one listened.

142
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,695
I...

143
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,166
The people here will listen to everything you say,

144
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,106
so don't worry and just tell them.

145
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,315

What will happen after I tell them everything?

147
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,486
What will happen if you don't tell them everything?

148
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:15,395

151
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,335
Get me a single cell.

152
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,835
A single cell. That's all I ask for.

as well as the Mogu-dong arson case.

156

Okay.

158
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,066
Let me know if you need anything.

159
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,665
I'll help you.

164
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,525
But the thing is,

165
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,856
I don't remember every single thing I did.

166
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,925
I just walked around and did it whenever I felt like it,

167
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,066
so I don't think I can recall where each one took place.

168

00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,165
- He's here. - Hello, sir.

184
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,505
How did it go?

185
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,035
- Can we go in now? - No, wait.

186
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:44,805
The Southwestern Case. It was Nam Ki Tae.

187
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,275
- See? - I told you.

188
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,545
The Imyeong-dong case too.

189
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,045
- That was also him. - What?

190
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,285
- Goodness. - Unbelievable.

191
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,685
Did he confess?

192
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:55,155
Yes.

193
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,785
Gosh, we went through so much because of that case.

194
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,285
We should be strategic about interrogating him.

195
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,326
Okay.

196
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,866
He's emotionally unstable.

197
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,696
And he seems socially inept.

198
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,996
He struggles to communicate with others.

199
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:09,336
I knew it. I thought he looked like a dimwit.

200
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,966
He's never formed a relationship...

201
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,765
with anyone who supports his words and actions.

202
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,576
Then how should we go about interrogating him?

203
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,106
If we get angry or yell,

204
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:18,905
he won't want to talk.

205
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:20,376
We have to humor him too?

206
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,576
I'm not asking you to praise him for his crimes.

207
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:25,885
These suspects already know what the detectives are after.

208
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:28,586
Even if you treat them nicely, they won't trust you.

209
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:29,655
She's right.

210
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:31,755
If you seem to overly approve of what they did,

211
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,696
it can actually backfire.

212
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,696
Then what should we do?

213
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,555
First off, try to avoid showing him any kind of judgment,

214
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,196
be it positive or negative.

215
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:40,736
Try as hard as you can to let him do the talking.

216
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:42,935
Nam Ki Tae has a high tendency to be socially withdrawn.

217
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,066
He'll become anxious if there are too many detectives around him.

218
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,706
So we'll have only a minimal number of people in there.

219
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:52,206
Why are there so many rules over a simple interrogation?

220
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,476
There has to be.

221
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,216
As everyone here knows,

222
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:59,045
Nam Ki Tae is unlike any other violent criminal.

223
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:02,255
The victims of the Southwestern Case that we are aware of...

224
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,456
come to a total of 14.

225
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,385
Among them, six died.

226
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:08,956
And there is a high possibility of many more victims.

227
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:12,196
This means we cannot miss even one innocent victim.

228
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,836
That is how we can be responsible in this current situation.

229
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,366
Also, you should not throw random questions at him.

230
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,366
He has poor communication skills, so if he gets confused,

231
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,935
he might blurt out just anything.

232
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:25,246
From now on, we should write down our questions beforehand.

233
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,275
That is a good idea.

234
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,775
If you don't, he might agree with even the wrong parts,

235
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:32,316
then give up on making a statement.

236
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,755
(We'll be quick, kind, and fair as advanced first-class police.)

237
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:34,956
And one more thing.

238
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,025
Until the interrogation is over,

239
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,456
pick out one detective...

240
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,226
who converse with the suspect the most efficiently.

241
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:44,765
It'll be the most effective in getting the answer you want.

245
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:57,706
Nam Ki Tae was...

246
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:00,305
raped in his childhood.

247
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,846
By whom?

248
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,415
He just said it was an elderly person in his town.

249
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,816
Around when in his childhood?

250
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,015
In elementary school.

251
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,555
He didn't want to elaborate,

252
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,185
so I didn't press him.

253
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:14,356
Nam Ki Tae was charged for rape a few times, right?

254
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:16,996
From child rape to adults, at every age.

255
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,966
There is no crime he stayed away from.

256
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,035
So how did you get him to confess the Imyeong-dong case?

257
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,696
He was conscious of Gu Young Chun.

258
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,836
He said Gu Young Chun was showing off with something he did.

259
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,476
So I provoked him and asked.

260
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,435
How amazing.

261
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,946
Were they competitive or something?

262
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,045
Let's go inside.

263
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,986
You walked around?

264
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:41,086
Once I got off the subway, I always walked from there.

265
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:44,986
It's a pretty long journey to the apartment in Sinheung 6-dong.

266
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,785
I'm really fit.

267
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,226
I ran ten laps a day.

268
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,425
Ten laps a day?

269
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,096
I had to run fast to avoid getting caught.

270
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,265
How did you choose your crime sites?

271
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,435
I didn't choose anything in particular.

272
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,435
I just walked into desolate places.

273
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,775

277
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,785
of the southwestern area of Seoul in 2004 was caught.

278
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:16,515
Last night, he broke into Im's house in Sinheung 6-dong,

279
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,856
in an attempt to steal money.

280
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,785
But after a fight with Im's father, he was caught...

281
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,255
and handed over to the police.

282
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,366
The suspect is Nam, a man in his 30s.

283
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:26,996
Currently, the police stated Nam has admitted...

284
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,596
to all charges of serial assault and murder...

285
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:31,035
in the southwestern area,

286
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,106
and they are now interrogating him for additional crimes.

Yes, they're the real deal.

Of course, I've worked with the Analysis Team.

294
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:50,986
What they mostly do is...

295
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,785
talk to people like Nam Ki Tae.

296
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,196
They're unbelievably good at creating the atmosphere...

297
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,696
to fish out a confession from these suspects.

298
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:01,496
Do you think they yell at him and press him in the investigation?

299
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,966
How is the investigation going?

300
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,675
He confessed to most of his crimes.

301
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,275
In order to increase the credibility of his confession,

302
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,876
we are doing our best to inspect the scene...

303
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,645
and secure the evidence.

304
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,045
What was his motive?

305
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,346
We are yet to put our finger on something certain.

306
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,616
We can only assume.

307
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,555
So far, we presume it's the anxiety from violence and beatings...

308
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,785
and the intensification of social withdrawal,

309
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,755
so a combination of such factors can be the reason for his behavior.

310
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,096
Was the Southwestern Serial Murder all done by one person?

311
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,736

00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,455
conducted the reenactment for Pureumae Park Murder Case.

363
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,026
The police announced today that they will also conduct...

364
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:52,796
a reenactment of the Gocheong-dong Murder Case...

365
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,596
and the Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case.

366
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,665
Shocking, isn't it?

367
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,405
I knew it seemed odd.

368
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:03,905
He recognized me at first sight.

369
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:05,106
Nam Ki Tae did?

370
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,675
Yes.

371
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:08,745
We should refrain from exposing the identity of our officers.

372
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,715
This isn't some kind of a film.

373
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,415
It wasn't because I wanted to.

374
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:14,155
There is this guy named Im Moo Sik.

375
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,586
A reporter that I don't like.

376
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,586
He put his photo in the article without asking.

377
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:19,155
Is he insane?

378
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:22,495
Well, I guess he didn't think things would be like this.

379
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,596
No one could have imagined.

380
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,296
Hey, take a look at this.

381
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:30,195
All of these are articles on the Southwestern Case.

382
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:31,905
("Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case")

383
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,705
It looks like he scrapped the articles for his crimes.

384
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:39,006
I'm sure there are many more...

385
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,245
other than these.

386
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,566
Why did you set the place on fire?

387
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,635
Me? Fire? What fire?

388
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:09,576
Why are you suddenly asking him that?

389
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,006
Why did you set the place on fire?

390
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,975
Why are you asking us?

391
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,516
Is this...

392
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,116
about Nam Ki Tae's arson?

393
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,286
You're right.

394
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,816
If he didn't set the place on fire,

395
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,885
he should react like you two, as if he doesn't know...

396
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,225
what I'm talking about.

397
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,425
And? Did he say something else?

398
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:29,495
Yes.

399
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,266
First, he was flustered at the question.

400
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:34,126
Then he answered me like this.

401
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,695
I didn't start the fire.

402
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:39,066
I didn't do it, the fire.

403
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,276
What kind of nonsense is this?

404
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,806
Nam Ki Tae is the perpetrator...

405
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,645
of the Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case.

406
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,645
- What? - What now?

407
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,215
Keep your focus on that case and start pressing him.

408
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,225
- Young Soo! - Yes?

409
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:07,566
I need you here.

410
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:09,235
Why? What is it?

411
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:12,965
What is this?

412
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,806
This guy isn't just an ordinary criminal.

413
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:20,076
This explains why we never got his footprints.

414
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:22,016
Nam Ki Tae also did everything he could to commit murder.

415
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:26,185
Young Soo.

416
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,215
Take a look at this.

417
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:30,415
What's this?

418
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,626
(Food good for eye health)

419
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,856
"Food..."

420
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:38,566
(Food good for the heart)

421
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,536
This is ridiculous. Darn it.

422
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,097
He was fine with harming people,

423
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:46,253
but he wanted to live a long life?

424
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,276
(Tomatoes are high in lycopene...)

425
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,606
("The Best Benefit of Hiking Is the Way We Walk")

426
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:52,145
An eyewitness said he ran away very quickly.

427
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,576
The statement was correct.

428
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:57,685
He even studied how to run away quickly.

429
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,185
I bet he's hiding the murder weapon somewhere in the house.

430
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:04,326
Do you really think he kept it in the house?

431
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:05,955
You watched his reenactment on the news, right?

432
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,586
I did.

433
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:10,195
Gosh. How can anyone make that facial expression?

434
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,026
It really creeped me out.

435
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,066
He gets off just by thinking about the act.

436
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,195
- He solely kills for pleasure. - Right.

437
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,935
So he must keep the murder weapon somewhere in the house.

438
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:21,405
I doubt he threw it out.

439
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:24,905
Then let's look for anything that could be used as murder weapons.

440
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,945
Yes, sir.

441
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,046
Find everything that might be a murder weapon from now on.

442
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,046
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

443
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,086
You came through the balcony.

444
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,816
(Reenactment for the Mogu-dong Arson and Murder Case)

445
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,415
Being timid during the act is his unique factor.

446
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:37,655
(Suspect)

447
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:39,985
You headed to the smaller bedroom.

448
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,425
(Victim)

449
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:58,346
Wrap it up.

450
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,445
- Hey. - Hey.

451
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,846
Hey! Take it.

452
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:04,116
- Step back! - You murderer!

453
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,215
- Please step back. - You murderer!

454
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:10,316
- You need to move back! - Step back!

455
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,425
- Murderer! - Hey!

456
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,326
- Just one comment! - You murderer!

457
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,695
- Step back. - Die!

458
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:18,066
- Hey, stop him! - Stop him!

459
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,526
- Die, you murderer! - Get him to stop!

460
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:21,766
Move back!

461
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:23,895

462
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,205
- Stop them! - Die!

- Stop them! - Just one comment!

- Put him in the car! - You murderer!

465
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:35,116
- Stop, and step back! - Get him to the car.

466
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,475
- Just one question. - Step back.

467
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,245
- Okay. Go! - Hold on!

468
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,516
- Step back! - Stop!

469

00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,455

477
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,145
of the suspect trembled in rage once again.

478
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,705
The lack of remorse from the serial killer during the reenactment...

479
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,846
brought pain and shock...

480
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:12,215

487

You said you didn't want people to look down on you.

How did you know that he had a social phobia?

505
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:18,215
Well, we didn't get it diagnosed by a doctor or anything.

506
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:20,816
We were only commenting on the suspect's characteristics...

507
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:24,086
like how he rarely talks and is introverted. That's all.

508
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,385
How much did he steal so far?

509

We're investigating the robbery cases separately.

510
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,925
When we arrested him, the amount of confirmed robberies...

511
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:32,826
was ten dollars in cash.

512
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:35,495
- He did that for 10 dollars? - Just for 10 dollars?

513
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,796
Then could we interpret that he didn't commit these crimes...

514
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:40,106
to steal money or valuables just like Gu Young Chun?

515
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,376
Yes. That's right.

516
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,606
For now, we believe this was his way of expressing...

517
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,175
disapproval of our society.

00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,965

00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:15,106
Right.

00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,645

541
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:04,455
("Southwestern Serial Murder Case: Who Is This Man?")

542
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:07,026
(Deco Plaza)

543
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:20,135
What are you staring at?

544
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:25,046
I was just frustrated.

545
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,776
I was just wondering about...

546
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:32,715
what people on the street were thinking about.

547
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:38,286
"What should I eat today?"

548
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:40,856
"What should I bring home?"

549
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,056
"I'm late for my appointment."

550
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,266
"My boss is so annoying."

551
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:50,096
They are probably thinking about their day-to-day life. Right?

552
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:53,705
I can't even remember the last time I thought about...

553
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:55,776
my day-to-day life.

554
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,506
It does feel like we're running...

555
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,175
in a race that's never going to end...

556
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:04,376
when I see these criminals,

557
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:07,316
crawling out here no matter how many of them we put away.

558
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:11,016
Some people in our country are being brutally murdered.

559
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,155
But some people from the same country have peaceful days.

560
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,425
Nothing has changed in this world.

561
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:19,925
In life...

562
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:24,766
and especially in our line of work, we see more evil than good.

563
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:28,675
But it's quite sad at times that we can't have hope...

564
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,836
in people.

565
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:34,205
Whenever I try harder to have hope,

566
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:38,145
I end up facing criminals that are smarter and more evil.

567
00:28:39,816 --> 00:28:43,056
You have more interviews left with Nam Ki Tae, right?

568
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,425
I should interview him before the prosecution takes him.

569
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:48,626
"He who fights with monsters..."

570
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,695
"should look to it..."

571
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,495
"that he himself does not become a monster."

572
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:58,066
"If you gaze long into an abyss,"

573
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:01,336
"the abyss also gazes into you."

574
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:03,975
Nietzsche, right?

575
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,356

576
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,296
"Unchanging Society,"

577
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:28,866
"and Shameless Media Bring Tears to the Bereaved Family."

578
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:32,006
The victim was an average college student.

579
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,336
Afraid of going out alone,

580
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,576
the student still cannot return to school.

581
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:40,705
And another victim had to be buried in the cold underground...

582
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:43,076
instead of enjoying the days of youth.

583
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,086
Only blackened marks of the fire...

584
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:48,185
remain with this happy family.

585
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:50,556
A playful daughter...

586
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:53,655
faced a wrongful death even without having a chance to say goodbye.

587
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:58,026
Some people lost their loved ones overnight.

588
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,695
And these people aren't strangers to us.

589
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,836
They are our neighbors and family.

590
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:09,205
We found this knife.

591
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:10,806
But there was no luminol reaction.

592
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:12,945
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

593
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,445
Seeing how he cut the soles of his shoes,

594
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,745
I'm sure he's the culprit.

595
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:20,145
We need to find the victim's DNA.

596
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,556
No way.

597
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,385
He already confessed to everything.

598
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,885
We're not going to be forced to cut him loose, right?

599
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:29,126
If we don't have any supporting evidence,

600
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,296
he will only be indicted...

601
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,225
for the break-in and aggravated robbery.

602
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:35,536
On top of that, if he recants his confession, we'll have nothing.

603
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:36,665
We must find more evidence.

604
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,836
Actually, Chief Kook and Inspector Song...

605
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:42,006
went back to his house to look for more evidence.

606
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:46,506
But I get the feeling that he might have tossed the murder weapon.

607
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:07,566
This place has a similar vibe to the crime scene.

608
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,066
- Right? - The districts were different,

609
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:13,106
but he must have chosen a familiar environment subconsciously.

610
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,235
We should link cases to see if there are incidents that...

611
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:16,675
took place in a similar environment.

612
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,046
- I'll tell Woo Ju. - Okay.

613
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:23,016
The detectives can't just sit back and wait until Nam Ki Tae talks.

614
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,046
Right.

615
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:26,685
- Let's go in. - Okay.

616
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,713
Do you really think it's here?

617
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:35,082
He's obsessed with murder.

618
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,583
Let's look for it.

619
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,943
I've already checked that room.

620
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:17,082
Help me pull out this closet.

621
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:20,693
One, two, three.

622
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:23,792
Here?

623
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,882
He didn't even bother to wipe the blood off.

624
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,724
Professor An, hang on.

625
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,384
Did you see this?

626
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,803
Hello?

627
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,133
I see. Thank you.

628
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:20,931
Captain Yoon.

629
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,961
They found Nam Ki Tae's kitchen knife.

630
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:25,101
So it really was there.

631
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:28,271
Yes, under the closet. He didn't even wipe the blood off.

632
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:29,670
He's a total lunatic.

633
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,200
I just got a call from the NFS too.

634
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,981
While examining the pipe wrench, they found hair...

635
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,441
and an old bloodstain.

636
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,211
So he can't even deny it now.

637
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,950
When are we sending him to the prosecution?

638
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,450
It's scheduled for next Friday.

639
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,681
The Analysis Team will interview him before that, right?

640
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,351
That's right.

641
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,691
Inspector Song must be under a lot of stress.

642
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,431
He has to speak with that psycho again.

Are you going to be okay alone?

00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,220
Knowing how Nam Ki Tae is, I have to talk to him one on one...

662
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,920
to get more out of him.

663
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,070
We meet again.

664
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,110

666
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,420
Did the detectives listen to what you had to say?

Yes, they're good listeners.

I'm older than you, so I'll drop the honorifics.

670
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,860
Sure thing, all the other detectives talked to me casually anyway.

671
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,871
Do you remember telling me that you had a hard time in jail?

672
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,070
Of course, I do.

673
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,610
My cellmate who was a thug beat me up to a pulp.

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,411
- Why? - For no reason.

675
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,711
He just beat me up because I couldn't say anything.

676
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,880
I mean, because I wouldn't say anything.

677
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,720
He must've been so surprised when he saw me on the news.

678
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,961
That scumbag.

679
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,490
Is that gratifying for you?

00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,760
"Gratifying?"

681
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:11,431
That I'm not sure.

682
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,030
But I bet he had no idea I'd walk around with a knife...

683
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,371
to kill people.

684
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,641
He must be in shock now, right?

685
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,411
You said you were sexually assaulted as a child.

686
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,110
Do you remember?

687
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,681
You said it was a neighbor, an old man.

688
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,291
Right.

689
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,090
How old were you at the time?

690
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,820
I was ten.

691
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,461
He dragged me into the woods...

692
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,130
and tied my fingers with my shoelaces...

693
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,541
Hold on.

694
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,711
He tied your fingers?

695
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,871
Yes.

696
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,021
He dragged you into the woods...

697
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:10,961
and tied your fingers...

698
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:13,391
with your shoelaces?

699
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:16,961
By any chance,

700
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,900
is there a sexual assault case Nam Ki Tae confessed to?

701
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,001
No.

702
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,300
Then see if you can find a similar case,

703
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,470
where the victim was found in the woods with fingers tied...

704
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,771
with shoelaces.

705
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:28,811
I'll see what I can find.

706
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,661
Victim found in woods, shoelaces.

707
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,461
Sexual assault or murder.

708
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:47,791
See if you can find a case that matches.

709
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:53,431
A man did that to a little boy. It was awful.

710
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,601
It must've been traumatizing.

711
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,271
I was very young, so I didn't know what to think of it.

712
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,110
But I was scared whenever I saw him after that incident.

713
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,711
That was only the beginning though.

714
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:07,481
What do you mean?

715
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,450
My next-door neighbor did it to me twice when I was in high school.

716
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,621
And it happened again when I was in the military.

717
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,420
I was like everyone's punching bag.

718
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,360
Why didn't you call the police?

719
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,961
I didn't want to.

720
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:22,030
I was too shy and couldn't even get angry at anyone.

721
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:23,530
You must've had friends though.

722
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,170
At school or in the military. You must've had someone.

723
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,271
No, I never did.

724
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,501
They all either tried to use me or bully me.

725
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,181
No one wanted to be my friend.

726
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,981
What about your teacher? Your teacher at school.

727
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,411
My teacher?

728
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,380
The teachers weren't any better.

729
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,820
What's that thing...

730
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,621
where teachers record their observations of students?

731
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:48,691
- Student record? - That's right.

732
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,121
All through school,

733
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:55,561
mine said, "too reliant, passive, lacks independence."

734
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:58,001
Those three things were always on my student record.

735
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,170
That's why I still remember those difficult words.

736
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:07,641
"Reliant, passive, lacks independence."

737
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:10,481
Didn't it make you angry?

738
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,211
It made me very angry.

739
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,650
But I rarely show it.

740
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:23,490
Do you want to hear my story?

741
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,630
You have something else to tell me?

742
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,161
You haven't heard my story yet.

743
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,130
I wanted to commit a perfect crime.

744
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,170
Once I found out that I was good at something,

745
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,110
I wanted to be better at it.

746
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,681
- That's why you studied? - Yes, I studied so hard.

747
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,411
I read books.

748
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:45,911
And whenever they said important stuff on TV,

749
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,411
I jotted it down.

750
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,521
I saw your notes.

751
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,851
I wrote down everything that could be helpful.

752
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,691
Some of your notes were about health.

753
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,760
Why were you so health-conscious?

754
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,291
Because I need to live a long life.

755
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,501
And why is that?

756
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,670
That way, I can kill more people.

757
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,181
Gosh.

758
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,081
(Secure Interview Room Instructions)

759
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:24,251
- Goodness. - Oh, you're here.

760
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:29,891
My gosh.

761
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,191
Do you remember what your first offense was?

762
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,001
It was back in elementary school.

763
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,931
I broke into an empty home then stole their money and valuables.

764
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:44,041
- What about rape? - I can't really remember that.

765
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,670
I mostly went for kids when I was younger.

766
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:49,840
They do as you say.

767
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,521
- How young were the kids? - Elementary school students.

768
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
What is the psychology behind that?

769
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,021
That's why what children experience is so important.

770
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,851
They accumulate things without even knowing.

771
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,661
Of course, not everyone will become a criminal...

772
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,360
from a bad experience.

773
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,630
But kids can't manage situations themselves.

774
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:14,501
In the case of Nam Ki Tae,

775
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:17,141
he accumulated all of his repeated traumas.

776
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:20,041
I think that influenced his character-building greatly.

777
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,641
What if, in order to break away from the negativity,

778
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,550
he voluntarily assumed the role of a killer?

779
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,581
That might be it.

780
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,780
About three years ago,

781
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,990
I started to think about killing people too.

782
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,320
Three years ago?

783
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
That's after you were released from prison.

784
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:40,691
- Yes. - Did you not think...

785
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:42,630
to live straight after being released?

786
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,700
Not really.

787
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,271
There's no changing me, so why bother trying?

788
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:50,170
Instead, I felt a bigger thrill once I got released.

789
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,010
I wanted to try stabbing people...

790
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,010
and strangling them too.

791
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,711
Because you felt wronged for the beatings you got in jail?

792
00:41:56,711 --> 00:41:58,141
Of course I felt wronged.

793
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,351
You have no idea how much I wanted to kill the punk who beat me.

794
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,050
Then you should've talked to the guy directly.

795
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,851
Why did you let your anger out on strangers?

796
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,391
I wasn't letting my anger out.

797
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,420
That's not the reason.

798
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,061
I just did it because I liked it.

799
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,161
- You did it because you liked it? - Want to know something?

800
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,101
When I see the person dying in front of my eyes...

801
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,840
flapping their arms and legs.

802
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,840
My heart starts to race.

803
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:43,320
That's when I finally feel a little alive.

804
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,931
You felt alive...

805
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,001
while watching someone dying?

806
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,570
It's truly euphoric.

807
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,610
That's why I can't quit.

808
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,411
Can't quit what?

809
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:05,751
Killing, of course.

810
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,050
I could quit smoking, but I couldn't quit killing.

811
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,820
Didn't you ever think to stop?

812
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,891
No.

813
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,831
I mean...

814
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,661
even not killing for a few days drove me crazy.

815
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:26,831
So I didn't even try.

816
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,470
That lunatic.

817
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:35,311
That was the reason why...

818
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:36,811
he turned his victims around in a bright place to see their faces.

819
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,121
There's a case from January 2004 in Bongu-dong, Bucheon.

820
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:48,550
A ten-year-old boy was kidnapped, raped, and murdered.

821
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,920
I'll print the materials for you.

822
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:51,691
(Bongu-dong)

823
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:55,661
(Bongu-dong, kidnapping and murder)

824
00:43:57,731 --> 00:43:59,231
("Bongu-dong Elementary Student Murder Case Left Unsolved")

825
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:00,731
("Reported missing 21 days ago, 11 days since the body was found.")

826
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,240
Does anyone happen to know about...

827
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,041
a case from two years ago in Bongu-dong?

828
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:08,170
Where a ten-year-old boy was kidnapped, raped, and murdered?

829
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,911
I saw it when I was picking out cases for us to work on.

830
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:12,251
Bongu-dong?

831
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,950
Isn't that the cold case from two years ago...

832
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,251
that was extensively reported about?

833
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,691
Give me the fax number here, please.

834
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,661
(Receiving scan)

835
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:31,130
I guess the more I watch them...

836
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,800
the more I want to try something more violent.

837
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,141
That's why you kept changing your murder weapon.

838
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,311
At first, I liked the feeling of strangling someone.

839
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,840
That feeling when they flap about as they run out of breath.

840
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,650
It was more euphoric than I had imagined...

841
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,550
when I tried it myself.

842
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
You keep using the expression, "euphoric."

843
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,661
I feel like it expresses the best feeling.

844
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,331
Anyway...

845
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:07,470
After I came home that day, I slept like a baby.

846
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,570
- Because you felt euphoric? - Yes.

847
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:13,211
Oh, right. Then I tried using a knife.

848
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:16,880
I tried it and once I saw the blood spurting out, it drove me crazy.

849
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:19,450
I was so happy. It was so thrilling.

850
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,920
I sometimes went back to the neighborhood I killed...

851
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,621
and reminisced about it too.

852
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,691
- Reminisce? - Yes.

853
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:31,061
You liked the knife so much.

854
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,490
So why did you switch to a pipe wrench?

855
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:38,030
I wanted to feel a different sensation from a knife.

856
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,570
Was that after Pureumae Park?

857
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,641
Maybe.

858
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,371
I get a little confused because there are so many.

859
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:51,181
When I used a small knife, they wouldn't die very easily.

860
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:53,280
So I got frustrated and switched to a kitchen knife.

861
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:55,311
But even the kitchen knife didn't really do the job.

862
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,981
It got me annoyed and angry for some reason.

863
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:00,820
It made me uncomfortable and annoyed if they didn't die.

864
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,990
Why would you get annoyed?

865
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:05,461
That should not happen in a perfect crime.

866
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,630
I was trying to commit the perfect crime.

867
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,760
So I didn't even rape the girls I killed.

868
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,400
- In case you might leave evidence? - Yes.

869
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,371
No matter how hot it was, I didn't take my gloves off.

870
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:22,811
Even though the gloves dulled the sensation a little.

871
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,251
The steel pipe had its perks too, so it was all right.

872
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,550
It was a necessary inconvenience...

873
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,751
as I wanted to kill many for a long time.

874
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,150
What is the sensation that you're talking about?

875
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:38,161
The head is the weakest part of a human.

876
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:42,331
The moment you strike down like this...

877
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:46,771
Gosh. Words can't explain this. You have to try it for yourself.

878
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,271
A ton of blood starts spouting out.

879
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:51,141
At that moment when I look at their faces as they're flapping about.

880
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,211
The moment drives me insane. It excites me so much.

881
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,811
I feel like I'm about to die. Really.

882
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:58,581
Looking at it makes me so happy. It feels amazing.

883
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:02,050
You've never tried it, so you have no idea.

884
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,820
Gosh, I can't listen to him anymore.

885
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,720
How does he stand listening to him?

886
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,530
This isn't a job for the weak minded.

887
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,331
I have a weak mind.

888
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,161
I'm going to step out for a moment.

889
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:23,541
I need to pee.

890
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,771
- You want to use the bathroom? - Yes.

891
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:34,851
Hold on. The detectives will be here.

892
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,981
- You'll wait for me, right? - Yes.

893
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,590
I will be right back.

894
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,161
Sure. Take your time.

895
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,030
You're back.

896
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,731
You gave me a signal just now, right?

897
00:47:51,061 --> 00:47:52,101
Yes.

898
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:55,400
You think this was Nam Ki Tae's doing too, right?

899
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:57,340
I do.

900
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,541
The way the ten-year-old boy's fingers were tied up...

901
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,670
by a shoelace.

902
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,240
It's the same thing that happened to Nam Ki Tae in his childhood.

903
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:05,880
We'll have to interrogate him then.

904
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,950
How far does his area of crime stretch out too?

905
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,720
I'm going to go back in.

906
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,851
Ha Young.

907
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:17,161
(Criminal Investigation Division)

908
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,760
You can leave it to the detectives in charge here.

909
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,191
There's no need for you to do everything.

910
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,601
Nam Ki Tae and I already formed a rapport.

911
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,501
I'll get his confession the fastest.

912
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:29,840
Yes, that's true.

913
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,871
But all those horrible things that he's pouring out...

914
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,780
There's no need for you to bear it all yourself.

915
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,041
I wouldn't have even started...

916
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,351
if I was going to avoid it.

917
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,251
You're right.

918
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,791
I worried for nothing.

919
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,191
I'll be back.

920
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,530
(Criminal Investigation Division)

921
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,130
(Interview Room)

922
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:04,170
You get scared easily, don't you?

923
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:07,510
- Me? - You seem that way.

924
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,740
Seeing how large Korea is, you chose to commit crimes...

925
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,010
only around Seoul and Gyeonggi, in neighborhoods close to you.

926
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,211
What if I get caught by going to a foreign place?

927
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,411
It was for your perfect crime?

928
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,681
That's why you ran around with all your might?

929
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:19,291
How did you know I run every day?

930
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,791
- You ran every day? - You didn't know then.

931
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,760
I was shocked for a moment because I thought you knew that too.

932
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,061
I did see that you wrote down running methods in your notes.

933
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,461
I ran around the school's field ten times.

934
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,360
I didn't miss a single day.

935
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,871
Which is why running is the one thing I'm super confident about.

936
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:35,470
Wait, no.

937
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,271
I'm good at killing people too.

938
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,411
Once I went to a couple of different neighborhoods,

939
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,510
it made me want to visit Busan too.

940
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:44,840
I wasn't able to go because I got caught though.

941
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,351
Didn't you get scared, once the news started to...

942
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,650
- focus their attention on you? - Why would I be scared?

943
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,181
You might get caught.

944
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,490
Gu Young Chun.

945
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:56,860
That punk said he was scared, right?

946
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:58,561
Why are you suddenly bringing Gu Young Chun up?

947
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,161
That punk is a loser.

948
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,431
I liked trying to avoid the police.

949
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:04,700
I liked the thrill it gave me.

950
00:50:05,061 --> 00:50:06,670
- Thrill? - Yes.

951
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,441
Do you still feel no remorse towards those people?

952
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:14,670
Why would I feel remorse?

953
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,441
I'm not sorry at all. I don't even feel guilty.

954
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,820
All I wanted to do was kill more people.

955
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,351
When I saw what I did here and there on TV,

956
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,650
I felt like I became a hero.

957
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,391
I became proud, thinking that I killed that person.

958
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,961
Then I felt like the TV...

959
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,760
What was that?

960
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,800
You said you felt like a hero and became proud, right?

961
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,911
You took a ten-year-old kid to the woods in Bongu-dong,

962
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:50,711
tied up his fingers with shoelaces,

963
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,081
then committed the atrocity...

964
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:54,880
you experienced to that little kid.

965
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:58,081
Isn't that so?

966
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,021
Why are you suddenly getting mad at me?

967
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,090
Will anything change even if I said anything?

968
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,490
If you don't confess what you did,

969
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:07,860
people like Gu Young Chun will bluff and claim that they did it.

970
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,061
Darn it.

971
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,061
I did that.

972
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,911
(On January 5, 2004, Jung was playing soccer with his friends...)

973
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:21,811
What was he doing at that time?

974
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,681
- He was playing with a ball. - Doing what?

975
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,711
Soccer.

976
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,610
Happy now?

977
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,050
And I'll share the details with the detectives here, right?

978
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,161
Then can I go back to what I was saying?

979
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,760
Do you enjoy discussing something like this, Nam Ki Tae?

980
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,831
It's fun.

981
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,461
It's the first time anyone listened to what I said.

982
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:47,700
Why do you think people don't want to talk to you?

983
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,900
They're all normal, but I seem like a psycho.

984
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,200
A psycho?

985
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:54,441
You know, confused and anxious.

986
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,311
This confusion often drives me insane too.

987
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,150
I'm sure I'd seem weird to others too.

988
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,650
And you were freed from such emotions when you killed?

989
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,150
I told you already.

990
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,450
That's why I can't stop.

991
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,561
When you stab someone,

992
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,061
I avoid places that will spurt out blood,

993
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,831
so I go with the stomach or the side.

994
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:17,931
Then the moment the knife goes into them,

995
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:20,400
they can feel it with all of their five senses.

996
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,800
You should've seen their faces.

997
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,010
I want to do it again.

998
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,911
I think you're less than a beast.

999
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:34,102
What do you think?

1000
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:39,141
You're not a hero.

1001
00:52:41,172 --> 00:52:44,411
You seem like an angry lunatic who just throws his knife around.

1002
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,482
You're right.

1003
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:48,652
I never denied that.

1004
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:55,192
- Let me continue. - You're going to continue?

1005
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:58,862
I couldn't share this with anyone, so I was really frustrated.

1006
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:02,531
It's now or never, right? So stay and listen.

1007
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:06,132
Among many ways of killing,

1008
00:53:06,132 --> 00:53:08,571
my favorite is hitting someone on the head.

1009
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:11,301
As I mentioned before, it's the flapping.

1010
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:14,071
It feels awesome to watch them flap about.

1011
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:15,712
Once I kill someone like that,

1012
00:53:15,712 --> 00:53:18,442
the ecstasy stays with me for a week to half a month.

1013
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:20,382
But after a while,

1014
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:22,922
the impulse comes back and it's even worse.

1015
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,281
Then as my impulse gets stronger,

1016
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:26,621
there is no other way...

1017
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,951
than going out and killing someone.

1018
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:33,332
I promise. Just once more. I want to go out and kill someone.

1019
00:53:33,431 --> 00:53:34,931
I need to feel that ecstasy.

1020
00:53:36,102 --> 00:53:37,161
Detective.

1021
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,571
- Detective? - Yes?

1022
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:42,871
Are you listening?

1023
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,712
- Nam Ki Tae. - Yes?

1024
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,212
Do you think it's unfair that you were caught?

1025
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:55,582
It is unfair.

1026
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,321
If I didn't get caught,

1027
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:03,161
I would've lived my life traveling around the country,

1028
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:05,692
becoming the best serial killer in history.

1029
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,701
It's a lot of shame when I think about that.

1030
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:13,431
I can never do this again.

1031
00:54:16,272 --> 00:54:17,301
You're right.

1032
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:23,482
You won't be able to do this anymore.

1033
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,409
- I think it's a relief. - It's a huge relief.

1034
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:46,650
I was really worried.

1035
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,849
- He's here. - Ha Young is back.

1036
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,050
- Oh, he's here. - He came back.

1037
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,880
(We'll be quick, kind, and fair as advanced first-class police.)

1038
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,650
He made a confession regarding the Bongu-dong case too.

1039
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,389
- Nam Ki Tae is unbelievable. - My gosh.

1040
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,090
Words got around about you for a reason.

1041
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,230
I didn't think he would continue to confess until today.

1042
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:03,559
Good work.

1043
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:06,070
Thanks for the tough work.

1044
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,000
Yes, let's go.

1045
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,440
- Good work. - Good work, everyone.

1046
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,369
- Good work. - Good job.

1047
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,710
- Good work. - Great work.

1048
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,239
Wait, Inspector Song.

1049
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:20,949
I heard this was yours. I was told to keep it well.

1050
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,079
I almost forgot.

1051
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,619
Thank you.

1052
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:30,460
(Happy and secure residents with sincere Yeongdeungpo Police)

1053
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:31,820
Why are you throwing this out?

1054
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,329
Nam Ki Tae used that.

1055
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,520
(The police will always be with our citizens.)

1056
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,820
Over here!

1057
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,590
- Nam Ki Tae! - Look over here!

1058
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,590
- Move aside. Move. - Look over here!

1059
00:56:08,053 --> 00:56:10,723
In 2004, the kidnapping and murder of an elementary school student...

1060
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:13,924
in Bongu-dong, Gyeonggi Province almost remained unsolved,

1061
00:56:13,924 --> 00:56:16,433
but this case was also found to be the crime of Nam Ki Tae.

1062
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:19,033
This afternoon, Nam Ki Tae was sent to the prosecution.

1063
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:23,033
He confessed to all the crimes he committed in the past two years.

1064
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,604
The crimes include 3 murders and 5 attempted murders...

1065
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,104
in the southwestern area of Seoul,

1066
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:28,803
Mogu-dong Arson Murder Case,

1067
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,214
Imyeong-dong Murder Case,

1068
00:56:30,214 --> 00:56:32,914
two murders in Gunpo, Gyeonggi, and in Bongu-dong,

1069
00:56:32,914 --> 00:56:35,314
- the kidnapping and murder. - Yoon Ji.

1070
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:38,183
You really refuse to go out and cover this case?

1071
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:41,624
The prosecution plans to conduct additional investigations...

1072
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:43,323
- Then what? Should I go? - into seven murders and arson...

1073
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:45,394
- Fine, I'll go. - among the cases from the police,

1074
00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:48,424
then they will decide whether to indict him additionally.

1075
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:52,294

1078
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:09,653
Choi Yoon Ji isn't so bad, but she never gets it right.

1079
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:12,553
Song Ha Young throws him a bait, then Nam Ki Tae gives him...

1080
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:13,984
the whole story.

1081
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:17,924
Why the heck is she going on about people who are left behind?

1082
00:57:20,464 --> 00:57:21,723
I'm telling you.

1083
00:57:21,924 --> 00:57:24,863
He looked straight at the victims when he killed them.

1084
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,664
What do you think was on his mind?

1085
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:32,133
It'd be awesome if I can get an interview on that.

1086
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:34,504
Bye.

1087
00:57:44,814 --> 00:57:46,984
Goodness, Inspector Song. Hello...

1088
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:49,493
What? What are you doing?

1089
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:54,863
You aren't so different from Nam Ki Tae.

1090
00:57:54,863 --> 00:57:55,924
What did you say, you jerk?

1091
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:58,394
Are you insane?

1092
00:57:59,803 --> 00:58:02,133
Darn it, let go. Let go of me.

1093
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:04,403
How dare you disrespect a reporter like this?

1094
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:06,473
You're going to regret this.

1095
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:08,573
I'll sue you immediately!

1096
00:58:10,444 --> 00:58:11,444
Listen up.

1097
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:13,883
You completely disregard the victims saying you have the right to know,

1098
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:15,714
as if you reporters are something.

1099
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,553
You should be thankful that I'm not suing you first.

1100
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:26,863
That's for using my photo without permission.

1101
00:58:31,394 --> 00:58:32,794
That crazy jerk.

1102
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:38,073
- Who made this? - Gosh, that's nice.

1103
00:58:38,073 --> 00:58:39,504
- Daddy. - Look at Daddy.

1104
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:41,343
- How do you feel? - That's it.

1105
00:58:41,573 --> 00:58:43,444
The weather is wonderful.

1106
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:45,314
Thanks for making gimbap, babe.

1107
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:47,743
What should we eat for dinner?

1108
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:49,044
How about pizza?

1109
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:53,254
Hey! Wait for me!

1110
00:59:01,294 --> 00:59:02,363
Detective.

1111
00:59:03,564 --> 00:59:05,633
- Detective? - Yes?

1112
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:07,903
Song Ha Young.

1113
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:09,734
Detective.

1114
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:17,274
Blame her bad luck.

1115
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:20,113
It is her fault for catching my attention.

1116
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:21,183
Look at me.

1117
00:59:21,984 --> 00:59:24,584
I ended up in here trying to get some freebies.

1118
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:27,323
Well, I wouldn't say I have the right...

1119
00:59:28,223 --> 00:59:29,894
but killing is sort of like a job of mine.

1120
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:31,254
Because I need to live a long life.

1121
00:59:31,993 --> 00:59:33,823
That way, I can kill more people.

1122
00:59:53,783 --> 00:59:55,914
Every time I saw her just putting up with it,

1123
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:57,283
it made me so angry.

1124
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:10,394
Arms and legs... Cut them off...

1125
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:11,863
and divide them into two. How many do you have?

1126
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,734
You know the bathroom threshold?

1127
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,073
The threshold is...

1128
01:00:21,174 --> 01:00:23,714
the line that separates the living realm and underworld.

1129
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:30,783

1133
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,593
Oh, no! What do I do?

1134
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:59,473
Do you know how scary it is when you're deep underwater?

1135
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:07,044
She must've been scared and sad.

Gosh. It's freezing.

1143
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:18,883
I'm trying to go to Daejong Lake. Which way do I need to go?

1144
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:20,223
Pardon?

1145
01:03:21,153 --> 01:03:23,223
I'm not dangerous.

1146
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:25,593
I've never been here before.

1147
01:03:28,794 --> 01:03:29,894
There.

1148
01:03:30,294 --> 01:03:33,933
Turn right at the intersection up ahead. And then go straight.

1149
01:03:34,133 --> 01:03:35,703
When you see another intersection next,

1150
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:37,504
- you can turn left... - Where are you going?

1151
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:39,203
Pardon?

1152
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:41,444
If you don't mind, I can give you a ride.

1153
01:03:42,243 --> 01:03:44,274
No, it's okay. I can take the bus.

1154
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:47,314
I'm not dangerous, you know.

1155
01:03:47,613 --> 01:03:49,544
I'm driving down anyway.

1156
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:51,914
If you're going in the same direction, I'll give you a ride.

1157
01:03:52,113 --> 01:03:54,953
Meanwhile, you can tell me how to get to Daejong Lake.

1158
01:03:54,953 --> 01:03:56,323
That will be helpful for me.

1159
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:04,334
Don't you have to wait for a long time for the bus?

1160
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:08,803
You must feel uncomfortable.

1161
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:12,803
Then could you tell me how to get there one more time?

1162
01:04:13,004 --> 01:04:15,743
Turn right at that intersection.

1163
01:04:16,944 --> 01:04:18,144
What was that?

1164
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:20,644
You'll see a smaller intersection.

1165
01:04:20,644 --> 01:04:23,584
- Then turn left there. - Hold on. Let me write it down.

1166
01:04:31,323 --> 01:04:32,823
Gosh. I don't even have paper.

1167
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,933
Why don't you get in and make things easier for both of us?

1168
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:40,763
Aren't you cold?

1169
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:51,814
Then I'll accept your offer.

1170
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:54,414
Of course.

1171
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:56,013
Please get in.

1172
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:58,683

You must like dogs.

1174
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:30,283
You can drop me off somewhere over there.

1175
01:05:30,783 --> 01:05:33,013
You can turn left over there.

1176
01:05:33,823 --> 01:05:36,723
Right here. This will do.

1177
01:05:41,664 --> 01:05:43,093
Wait. You missed it.

1178
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:46,164
I had to go right from there.

1179
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:49,104
Drop me off here, please. I'll get out here.

1180
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,403
Hey. Stop the car.

1181
01:05:57,013 --> 01:05:58,174
What are you doing?

1182
01:05:58,174 --> 01:06:00,283
What are you doing? Stop the car now!

1183
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:03,914
I want a quiet ride.

1184
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:05,183
Stop the car now!

1185
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,624
If you don't, I'll call the police!

1186
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:09,323
I'm calling the cops.

1187
01:06:15,464 --> 01:06:17,334
Open the door. Open it!
