On the 5th, the 1st boat to open the course to Mount Kumgang...

8
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:20,104
was Bongraeho.

00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,374

10
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:25,075
who reserved a trip...

11
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,234
to Mount Kumgang that had been postponed on Bongraeho.

12
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:32,574
Well, I can't say that for sure. But I...

13
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,214
They murdered and dismembered a member of their gang.

14
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,314
And they also ate up the intestines. This shocking and bizarre murder...

15
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:39,613
shocked the public.

23
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:35,674
Okay.

24
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:42,613
Inmate 3585.

25
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,044
He refused the visitation request.

26
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:50,654
- Have a good day. - Thanks.

27
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:58,723
Inmate 3585. He refused the visitation request.

28
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,603
Inmate 3585. He refused the visitation request.

29
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:11,203
Inmate 3585. He refused the visitation request.

30
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:22,584
Detective, why don't you put some money under his name next time?

31
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:23,923
Come on.

32
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,143
(Keep quiet)

33
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,554
What's this about?

34
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:06,064
You don't even know who I am. Why did you refuse to see me?

35
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:09,233
Well, I don't have anyone who would visit me.

36
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:13,374
And whenever someone came to see me, it was never good news.

37
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:17,203
Why did you think he wasn't the culprit?

38
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,043
He's not the culprit.

39
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:30,353
I see. You have a good memory, Detective.

40
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,953
But you kept coming here because of what I said?

41
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:39,364
That's odd.

42
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,464
I want to know...

43
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:43,834
why you thought he wasn't the culprit.

44
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,263
Why do you want to know?

45
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:46,434
You won't tell me?

46
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,203
Why should I tell you that?

47
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:49,404
You don't need money?

48
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,703
Well,

49
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:55,943
I can tell just by looking at their eyes.

50
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,383
Here's a thing about hunches.

51
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:00,754
Detectives aren't the only ones who have them.

52
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,723
He stripped the girl naked.

53
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:10,263
And he killed her in the heat of the moment.

54
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:14,233
If he did it in the heat of the moment, why strip her naked?

55
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,804
And she was his girlfriend.

56
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,843
Right? Allegedly, he killed her in the heat of the moment.

57
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:30,114
Well, they must have been in love. Right?

58
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:32,783
Even if he killed her, it was a mistake.

59
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:35,383
Or an accident?

60
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,184
Okay. Let's call it an accident.

61
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,354
Then he would have dressed her if she was naked.

62
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:41,424
That's what a normal guy would do.

63
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:45,823
People who have killed before would strip their victims naked.

64
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:47,533
That's my point.

65
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,374
You know what habits are, right?

66
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,474
Old habits die hard.

67
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:01,314
And you end up doing these habits before you realize it.

68
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,614
What does that have to do with this case?

69
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,684
When I was a kid, my father always beat me up...

70
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,823
during our meals. Do you know why he beat me up?

71
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,323
Because I always left a spoonful of rice instead of finishing it.

72
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:21,064
It's odd. I just didn't want to eat the last spoonful of rice.

73
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:22,734
Eating the last spoonful made me feel...

74
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,874
like I was losing my spirit.

75
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,573
Well, I digress.

76
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,513
Anyway, he beat me up for leaving rice because it'd be bad luck.

77
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,114
But I still can't eat the last spoonful.

78
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,643
I don't have anyone...

79
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,754
who would beat me for leaving the last spoonful now.

80
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:44,754
Let me sum it up.

81
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:47,323
No matter how meticulously you plan something,

82
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:51,364
your habits come out like second nature.

83
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,434
That's my point.

84
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,403
I'm sure there was a reason behind stripping her.

85
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:01,974
He had to strip her to get off. And whoever did that...

86
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,604
is the real culprit.

87
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,984
Just like no matter how badly my father beat me up,

88
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:15,083
I had to leave the last spoonful of rice for me to be satisfied.

89
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,254
I bet I'm right about this.

90
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:24,463
Detective Song Ha Young.

91
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:31,703
Gosh. Again?

92
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,104
His MO is bothering me.

93
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:36,073
I'm sure it's related to Won Mal Sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

94
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,604
What MO?

95
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,273
It's the way she was killed.

96
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,244
She was also found naked without any signs of sexual assault.

97
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,684
He's doing that to humiliate the victims.

98
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,754
The case is closed. Stop causing trouble.

99
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,354
It's not advice. I'm warning you.

100
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:56,593
Hey. Answer me.

101
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,023
Don't do anything.

102
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,794
I warned you!

103
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,593
Hey! Darn it.

104
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:25,402
(Won Mal Sook's residence)

105
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:49,914
Signs of forced entry.

106
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,184
But no numbers.

107
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,163
(Service, Order)

108
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:48,903
- Here, this is for you. - Thank you.

109
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:03,653
My gosh, you must have a sweet tooth.

110
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:05,183
Yes.

111
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:07,724
All the detectives at Dongbu Police Station are busy,

112
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:10,163
so we thoroughly investigated the case, but...

113
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,763
I bet you couldn't catch that petty thief.

114
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:14,334
Like you suggested last time,

115
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,163
we interviewed all the delivery guys who work in the area...

116
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,163
but couldn't track him down.

117
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,334
I suppose that made him feel alarmed though.

118
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,803
It's been quiet since then.

119
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,803
We've further enhanced patrols in the area.

120
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:27,643
Was there anyone who seemed suspicious?

121
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,783
There was a kid who looked quite suspicious.

122
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,313
He's just a punk who bullies other kids in the area...

123
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,183
and extorts chump change from them.

124
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:37,254
We brought him in to interview him...

125
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,653
and checked his alibi too.

126
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:41,694
The thing is, he always wore a red cap.

127
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:44,724
The Red Cap has been caught.

128
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,433
That I know, but we all thought he seemed suspicious,

129
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,094
so we brought him in and questioned him.

130
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,104
I heard the man the lady at the store saw...

131
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,734
was wearing a red cap.

132
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:54,874
Witness statements are confidential.

133
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,773
I'm a regular at the store,

134
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,074
so that lady and I are quite close.

135
00:09:58,344 --> 00:09:59,944
She was scared because she saw him,

136
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,714
so she asked me to keep an eye on her store,

137
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,883
which was why I made sure to patrol the area more often.

138
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,224
I found that cap.

139
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,254
It's true. Believe me.

140
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,094
Is it common for youngsters your age...

141
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,893
to use things that others threw out?

142
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,893
It was from a designer brand.

143
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,403
- Can I see it? - I threw it out.

144
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:27,504
- You did? - Darn it.

145
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,903
I had to go to the police station because of it.

146
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,474
I said it wasn't mine, but no one believed me.

147
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,643
- How tall are you? - Me?

148
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:35,944
I'm 183cm tall.

149
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:39,043
Anyway, he was short enough to be a girl.

150
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,754
- I can go now, right? - Wait.

151
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,923
The houses in the area have numbers like this by the entrance.

152
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:47,194
Do you know what this means?

153
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:50,964
Isn't it the street address?

154
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,633
How would I know?

155
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,633
This is so annoying.

156
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,313
Captain.

157
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:12,543
About the Uyeong-dong case, Won Mal Sook's prints...

158
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:13,883
were the only thing they found.

159
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,454
(Fingerprint Analysis Report)

160
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,754
(Won Mal Sook, Fingerprint Analysis Results)

161
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,124
Who is this jerk?

162
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:23,994
His MO is bothering me.

163
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:27,094
I'm sure it's related to Won Mal Sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

164
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:42,874
Hand it over at once.

165
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:50,423
Thanks, guys.

166
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,824
Catching the culprit doesn't mean it's over.

167
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,263
What? Our job's done the moment we lock them up.

168
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,694
What more do we have to do?

169
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:01,533
We should record everything these criminals said and did...

170
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,433
so we can help prevent future crimes and...

171
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:07,004
You always have to make everything sound so important.

172
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:08,604
No! My goodness.

173
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,074
Whatever.

174
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:12,403
Hey, those case files too.

175
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,944
You requested them for no reason. They're just sitting on your desk.

176
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,244
Because of you, everyone from the 31 police stations in Seoul...

177
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,913
cursed me and Superintendent Baek like there was no tomorrow.

178
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,053
I'm telling you. It'll be useful one day.

179
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:23,553
When? How?

180
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,354
Gosh, why are you so negative?

181
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:29,124
Come on. It helped us organize all the files on serious crimes.

182
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,893
It wasn't so bad.

183
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,523
I guess you're a glass-half-full kind of person.

184
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:37,204
By the way, we detectives are satisfied...

185
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,864
when we can run around and cuff criminals...

186
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:41,604
with our own hands.

187
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,903
That profiler or whatever it's called. Are you sure...

188
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,403
that person is on board?

189
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:49,374
Don't you worry about that. Just create the department.

190
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:50,643
Well...

191
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,614
That's not something I can decide.

192
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,454
- Yes, you can. - Goodness.

193
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,023
Give us this new department.

194
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,754
Excuse me. Could you give us more radish kimchi?

195
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:00,793
Goodness.

196
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,163
(Family Visitation Room)

197
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,974
I suppose what I told you wasn't useless.

198
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,773
Did something else happen?

199
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,474
What floor?

200
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,883
The ground floor. But I believe he's targeting other houses too.

201
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,183
Some of them are on the second floor.

202
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:31,984
I guess he's skilled at picking locks...

203
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,183
and jumping over walls.

204
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,954
You see, home is the safest place.

205
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,023
No one else can see what you do,

206
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,133
except for you and the victim.

207
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,004
But there were no signs of sexual assault.

208
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:47,033
Gosh. The victims were found naked. Obviously, he's a pervert.

209
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,074
Is that not sexual assault?

210
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:51,744
And that's why you came to see me. Am I wrong?

211
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,104
Hey, look.

212
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,744
I got caught because I dragged her to the parking lot.

213
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,813
It's not something I usually do. I only did it because I got horny.

214
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:02,984
Oh, boy.

215
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:07,053
This is why you should always plan everything and stick to it.

216
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,354
You know?

217
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:11,594
Then why did you deviate from your plan?

218
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:14,663
Because I was confident that I wouldn't be caught.

219
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:26,543
Then should I look for ex-cons in the area first?

220
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,374
Well, that's an idea.

221
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,643
What? You're leaving already?

222
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:39,883
I'm telling you. This guy is sick in the head.

223
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,094
He's obsessed with undressing his victims.

224
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:46,663
Detective.

225
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:49,663
Will you visit me again?

226
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:53,903
You know,

227
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,533
I'm an orphan,

228
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,173
so no one ever sent me a commissary deposit.

229
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:01,344
But now that I got a little taste of it...

230
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:03,944
I must say, it's very nice.

231
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,043
Oh, boy.

232
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:09,013
An orphan?

233
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,153
You went on about how your father...

234
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:14,893
always scolded you at mealtimes.

235
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:15,893
Goodness.

236
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:19,194
I only call him like that because I don't know what else to call him.

237
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,063
He does not deserve to be called a father.

238
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,563
He sent his own child to an orphanage.

239
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:26,933
That is all I remember...

240
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,874
about the man called my father.

241
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,150
(Dongbu Police Station)

242
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,283
That's nuts.

243
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,254
Okay.

244
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:49,694
Hey.

245
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,194
Goodness.

246
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:58,403
I heard you visited Yang Yong Chul again and even deposited cash...

247
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,163
into his commissary account.

248
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,244
What an embarrassment. I'm humiliated.

249
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,574
Criminals understand each other better.

250
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,574
What?

251
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,543
Hey, kiddo. What's he saying now?

252
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,624
I clearly warned you not to cause trouble.

253
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,854
Apparently,

254
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,023
Yang Yong Chul is going on about it, all excited.

255
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,964
That a police detective...

256
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:31,364
That some stupid detective keeps visiting him...

257
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:34,173
and asking him for advice!

258
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,374
The things that Yang Yong Chul is saying...

259
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:39,903
It makes sense.

260
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,844
You've clearly lost your mind.

261
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:43,643
Fine.

262
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,383
Criminals understand each other better.

263
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,043
- So what? - We should catch him.

264
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:48,614
- Who? - The real culprit.

265
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,354
Are you doing this...

266
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:59,094
to rebel against me? Is that it?

267
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,464
What do you mean, sir?

268
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,763
I caught the culprit and put him behind bars.

269
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:07,204
But you're digging it up again, insisting he's not the real culprit.

270
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:09,734
- Talk about being disrespectful. - No, don't get me wrong.

271
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,744
I'm just trying to tell you that it's related to this case.

272
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:16,073
What will you do if Yang Yong Chul starts running his mouth,

273
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,343
talking nonsense?

274
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,744
You'll ruin the police's reputation.

275
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,244
But that's secondary.

276
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,083
What will you do if the higher-ups hear about it?

277
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,384
Who will take responsibility for it?

278
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:28,293
I will.

279
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,293
Who do you think you are?

280
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,934
Who do you think you are to take the responsibility?

281
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,174
If you were big enough to take the responsibility,

282
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,573
then why were you sent here?

283
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:44,904
If the real culprit is somebody else,

284
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:47,573
who'll take responsibility for Bang Ki Hoon's life?

285
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,914
You little rascal. I'll get you.

286
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,714
Hey, you should...

287
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,053
just be the culprit.

288
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,593
You said, criminals understand each other better.

289
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:04,363
You can become a culprit yourself.

290
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:09,164
I'll arrest you, break your neck, and throw you in prison.

291
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,533
The culprit for Bang Ki Hoon and Won Mal Sook's case is the same.

292
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:15,734
He couldn't lose the habit of leaving the victim naked.

293
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,043
And he's become even bolder.

294
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:20,974
He won't stop here.

295
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,843
You weren't listening to anything I said, did you?

296
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:29,884

But he doesn't show up in the system.

302

The MO looks the same, but this one didn't have a sign.

303
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,113
Has he become bolder?

304
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,835
Or was this really done by someone else?

found at Choi Hwa Yeon's place?

311

- Yes. - It's from opening it by force.

I'll narrow them down to those who have worked as a deliveryman.

Deliveryman?

00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,093
were marked like this. Look.

00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,184
I'm not acting cheeky.

359
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,684
Look at me.

360
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,353
I ended up in here trying to get some freebies.

361
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:35,063
Man, you make me sad.

362
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,863
Then you should go.

363
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,234
That some stupid detective...

364
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,873
keeps visiting him...

365
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:44,873
and asking him for advice!

366
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:49,244
Yang Yong Chul.

367
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:55,013
That's enough.

368
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,283
All I did was give an answer to your question. Right?

369
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:02,293
Only someone like I would give you an answer.

370
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:05,664
If it had been other punks, they would never say a word.

371
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:08,533
It'll expose all their methods. They'd be insane to answer you.

372
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,803
Man, fine.

373
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,734
You must've grown on me in that short while. What's with me?

374
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,303
Family Visitation Room.

375
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:24,144
My heart feels soft because I keep seeing you here...

376
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:26,613
Hey, you're very scary.

377
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:31,853
This is my final warning.

378
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:33,083
Do not step over the line.

379
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:37,254
You really don't know how I feel, do you?

380
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,623
This is for sure.

381
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:45,563
Once he gets a taste of this, he'll never be able to quit.

382
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:50,004
If you don't catch him, yes.

383
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:51,904
It'll happen again.

384
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:00,184
(Eradicate petty thugs that eat away our economy)

385
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:03,184
You little punk! How dare you do this?

386
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:06,184
You broke into my home in the broad daylight!

387
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:07,894
Darn it.

388
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:12,123
So your girlfriend was asleep,

389
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:14,224
then you caught him trying to break in, right?

390
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,934
- Yes. - Okay, I understand.

391
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,964
This isn't the place to talk.

392
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:19,103
There's a room for interrogation...

393
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:22,504
No, I said this guy had a knife in his pocket!

394
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:25,704
- What? - If I didn't show up then,

395
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:26,944
my Young Sook...

396
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:30,144
and my unborn child would've died in his hands!

397
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:33,144
Hey, this is attempted murder!

398
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:35,313
- Darn it. - Excuse me, sir.

399
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,484
Please don't shout. Calm down.

400
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:39,424
Well, hey.

401
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,823
That thing in your pocket. Pull that out.

402
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,593
Pull it out now.

403
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:50,593
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:53,234
- You jerk! - Sir, calm down.

405
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:57,033
Calm down, sir. That's public property.

406
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:59,504
I can't see it, so lift it up.

407
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,004
Higher.

408
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,583
Scissors? Why do you carry that around?

409
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:06,914
I'm really sorry.

410
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:10,184
- What's the charge? - Housebreaking.

411
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:13,684
It's attempted murder! He has a weapon!

412
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:16,654
Yes, sir, we get it. So please stop shouting.

413
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:18,464
Your child will get shocked.

414
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,323
Well, hey.

415
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:22,593
Take it as evidence.

416
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:24,033
Okay.

417
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,833
Grab a seat, please.

418
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:28,004
Put it in.

419
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:30,474
Hurry up and put it in.

420
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,744
Name.

421
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:40,414
Cho Kang Moo.

422
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:43,813
- Age. - Eighteen years old.

423
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:45,623
Give me your ID.

424
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:47,623
I don't have one. My birthday hasn't passed.

425
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:53,123
Man, you aren't even fully of age.

426
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,934
How did you get in?

427
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,234
I just picked it open.

428
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:58,134
Yes, so how?

429
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:00,363
I used those scissors.

430
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,004
You should be studying instead of doing that.

431
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:05,504
Who taught you to pick doors by using scissors?

432
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:07,543
I just learned it from friends.

433
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:11,144
Oh, you have some wonderful friends.

434
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,613
What happened to your hair?

435
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:14,984
Sorry?

436
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,984
Were you wearing a hat? You have helmet hair.

437
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:19,424
Oh, yes.

438
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:22,894
Where's your hat?

439
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:27,164
- Sorry? - Where's the hat you wore?

440
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:29,563
I lost it on the way here.

441
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,904
I knew it. You're that clumsy.

442
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,134
Get up for a second.

443
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:41,773
- How tall are you? - I'm 167cm.

444
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:45,813
Kids who say they're 167cm are always 165cm.

445
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,313
No, I'm 167cm tall.

446
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,914
Then let's compare. I'm 175cm tall.

447
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,083
Let's compare.

448
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,083
People who claim to be 175cm are just barely over 170cm.

449
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,353
No, you jerk. I'm 175cm tall.

450
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:56,494
What are you doing?

451
00:26:57,023 --> 00:26:58,194
Is this a blind date?

452
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:00,623
Sit down.

453
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,464
As for his height...

454
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:06,464
(Turtle Supermarket)

455
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,204
I'm not sure.

456
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,704
Anyway, he was short enough to be a girl.

457
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,573
His fingerprint identification will be ready by tomorrow, right?

458
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,343
What?

459
00:27:18,343 --> 00:27:20,583
The scissors. You just took those in as evidence.

460
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,613
It's not yet...

461
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:23,013
It'll be ready by tomorrow, right?

462
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:24,654
Fingerprint identification.

463
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:30,654
Right?

464
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:33,724
Yes.

465
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:36,164
It'll be ready by tomorrow.

466
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,934
What's your address?

467
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,004
Where do you live? You little...

468
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:58,454
Write down why and how...

469
00:27:58,454 --> 00:27:59,823
you broke into that house in detail.

470
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:01,894
I just thought...

471
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,964
no one was inside, so I went in.

472
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,123
Write it down.

473
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,593
And don't speak unless spoken to.

474
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:13,033
- Write as many details as you can. - Okay.

475
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,704
Hey, when we were working on Bang Ki Hoon's case...

476
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:22,144
Yes?

477
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:25,644
We had a statement from a witness about the Red Cap.

478
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,414
- Did she say the guy was short? - Yes.

479
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,823
But I doubt that it's him. He's still wet behind his ears.

480
00:28:35,194 --> 00:28:37,053
Can you ask the victim if he was wearing a cap...

481
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,593
before he was brought in?

482
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,394
And check if there were any caps...

483
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,863
thrown out on the way here.

484
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:47,434
Go.

485
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,174
Okay.

486
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:52,674
Hold on. Not yet.

487
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,113
I'm calling from Dongbu Police Station.

488
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:01,283
I'm going to register an item under evidence.

489
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,083
Can you run a fingerprint test on it?

490
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:05,224
It's urgent.

491
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:07,783
Put a rush on it.

492
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:22,134
What you just did is a serious crime.

493
00:29:22,704 --> 00:29:24,904
You were caught red-handed picking the door with scissors.

494
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:26,543
That could have been a murder weapon.

495
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:28,674
They were just scissors.

496
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,773
You can kill people with just scissors...

497
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,043
because you can stab them.

498
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:34,013
How can you stab someone with scissors?

499
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,184
That's horrible.

500
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,184
- You think it's horrible? - Yes.

501
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:40,823
Which part is horrible?

502
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,424
Stabbing someone?

503
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:44,424
Or killing someone?

504
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,924
It's both, of course.

505
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:52,704
How many times have you done this before?

506
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:55,573
Of course, this is my first time.

507
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:58,073
You can climb walls too, right?

508
00:29:58,244 --> 00:29:59,474
I saw some thieves in action.

509
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:01,043
They can easily climb up three floors.

510
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:04,414
Is it because you're young? You guys are so full of energy.

511
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:05,714
It's easy with the pipes.

512
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,254
You can climb through the pipes too?

513
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,083
How tall was the previous house you broke into?

514
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:19,464
I know this isn't your first time.

515
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:22,394
No matter how petty the charge is, if you don't come clean now,

516
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:23,833
you'll end up with a heavier sentence.

517
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,603
So just come clean when you have a chance.

518
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:28,273
That's better for you.

519
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,474
It was on the first floor.

520
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:34,504
What about the second floor?

521
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:38,843
Do you remember which house it was?

522
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:42,384
Your confession must be true for you to get a lenient sentence.

523
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:49,894
It was just an ordinary house.

524
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,924
I guess no one was home seeing how you didn't get caught.

525
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,994
Right. I don't break into houses unless they are empty.

526
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,494
What if someone was there when you broke in?

527
00:30:57,033 --> 00:31:00,303
Then I would come out or hide.

528
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,434
You've never been caught other than today?

529
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:03,704
No.

530
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:11,984
Write everything down there.

531
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:14,083
Write down all the houses you broke into so far.

532
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:16,984
I'm going to.

533
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,754
But when you keep talking to me, I get confused.

534
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:36,967
Wait.

535
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,616
(Suspect Information)

536
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:53,916
(Grandmother: Park Hyun Ja)

537
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:56,217
How long has it been just you and your grandmother?

538
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,247
Did you talk to my grandmother?

539
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:02,217
You're a minor.

540
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,826
It's our duty to call your guardian.

541
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:06,086
Right.

542
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:11,197
How long has it been just you and your grandmother?

543
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,167
Ever since I was ten.

544
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,296
- What about your parents? - I don't talk to them.

545
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,796
- Both of them. - Yes.

546
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:19,267
- Did they get a divorce? - I'm not sure.

547
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,876
My mom ran away, and my dad abandoned us.

548
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,417
Is my grandmother here?

549
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,447
Why?

550
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,786
You don't want to worry her?

551
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,487
Darn it.

552
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:47,197
(Interview Room)

553
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:48,697
He didn't lose it.

554
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:54,066
He put it behind a telephone pole.

555
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:58,677
- Isn't this expensive? - What?

556
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:02,116
- Look at this brand. - Right. It's pretty expensive.

557
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:05,316
By the way, did you get anything from him?

558
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:08,556
He can't be the culprit for...

559
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,627
Can you run a fingerprint test...

560
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,357
on the scissors he brought in?

561
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:16,096
Captain Park already requested it to be expedited.

562
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,096
I see.

563
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,596
Hold on. Let me borrow that.

564
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,506
- If it's not urgent, let me use it. - What?

565
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:26,607
I just need it for a while.

566
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,326
Is this your hat?

567
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,797
It's yours, right?

568
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,067
It's expensive. Don't lose it.

569
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,797
Thanks.

570
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:00,406
- You must like hats. - Yes.

571
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:03,176
Write a new one, and number the houses you robbed this time.

572
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:06,147
The one you just wrote about is number 1. The next one is number 2.

573
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,650
(Daebong-dong)

574
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,326
Then you must have a lot of expensive hats.

575
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,857
I only have one. This is really expensive.

576
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:23,527
It's just you and your grandma. You must need bigger allowances...

577
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,696
- to buy a hat like that. - She doesn't give me allowances.

578
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,897
I earn money for them.

579
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:35,437
- You must have a part-time job. - Yes.

580
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,636
But you still robbed houses?

581
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,377
I guess you needed more money.

582
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:42,977
I was bored.

583
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,446
- You were bored? - Yes.

584
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,017
I just did it a few times for fun.

585
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,687
Kids around my age steal other people's stuff.

586
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:51,886
You've never done that?

587
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:56,256
I'll never do it again.

588
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:58,056
I'll promise that I'll never steal again.

589
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,596
Can't I go home?

590
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,366
I can promise that I'll never do it.

591
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,897
Can't you just send me home?

592
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:05,837
I can't. I told you earlier.

593
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,067
This could have been attempted murder.

594
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,136
You...

595
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,446
How is this attempted murder?

596
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,156
I was just trying to steal a few bucks.

597
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:26,486
Besides, I couldn't even steal anything because I got caught.

598
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:28,556
Once you break in with a weapon, it's not a simple theft charge.

599
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:29,957
It's grand larceny.

600
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:33,397
It's a serious criminal offense that can put you away for ten years.

601
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:34,727
And you.

602
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,397
This wasn't your first time.

603
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,966
We need to know how much money you stole...

604
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,377
and what you did with the money or the stolen valuables.

605
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,176
So write down when, where, and how you broke in...

606
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,147
and how much you stole.

607
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,147
And write down every single thing you stole.

608
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,747
What...

609
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,687
Isn't robbing empty houses better than extorting money...

610
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,857
- from other kids? - Is that what you think?

611
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:58,116
My neighborhood is full of those kids.

612
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,786
But you don't interrogate them like this.

613
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:03,457
Is that how your grandmother will think too?

614
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:12,636
Write them down.

615
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:23,517
What kind of part-time job do kids around your age have?

616
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,017
You...

617
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,417
Do you want me to write it down or not?

618
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,357
Can I just plead the Fifth?

619
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,156
Your questions are really annoying me.

620
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:37,227
Okay, you're free to do so,

621
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,767
but it could work to your disadvantage.

622
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,337
If our investigation reveals that you're indeed guilty of everything,

623
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:48,107
you may be subject to a heavier punishment.

624
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,047
I've worked as a delivery boy.

625
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:01,917
We interviewed all the delivery guys who work in the area...

626
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,817
but couldn't track him down.

627
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,386
And as a server.

628
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,397
I'm going to say a bunch of numbers. Write them down.

629
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,406
Two.

630
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:25,247
Twenty two.

631
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,846
Twenty three.

632
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,687
Now, 233.

633
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:43,596
What are these numbers?

634
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:45,897
I'm sure you know what they mean.

635
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:52,707
The number 2 at 214 Daebong-dong means a woman lives alone there.

636
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,096
Okay, what is this?

637
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:19,696
Two means an adult female.

638
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,497
Three means a kid.

639
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,897
And the number one means...

640
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,406
an adult male.

641
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,777
What's wrong? Are you anxious?

642
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:34,076
What... What do you mean?

643
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:37,377
You were...

644
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:40,747
too meticulous for someone who robbed houses a few times "for fun."

645
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,306
You know them, don't you?

646
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:02,777
No, I don't.

647
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:04,707
We found a fingerprint at the scene.

648
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:07,846
Yes, I heard you! Why do you keep telling me this?

649
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,446
Because when we get the results back tomorrow,

650
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,017
we'll find out that it matches yours.

651
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:22,527
Kang Moo.

652
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:27,897
Why did you undress them?

653
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,076
Because it's what that scumbag did all the time.

654
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:38,877
"That scumbag?"

655
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,417
My dad.

656
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,457
- Get out! - No, please! I'm sorry.

657
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:52,056
- Get out. - Forgive me.

658
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:56,457
- Please, I'm sorry... - Come here, you witch.

659
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,326
I'm sorry! Please forgive me.

660
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:10,036
Darn you.

661
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,716
Every time I saw her just putting up with it,

662
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,317
it made me so angry.

664

Darn it.

665
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:10,966
Tell me honestly

666
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:14,136
But I'm the only one

667
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:18,236

668
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,607

672
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:02,486
You forgot to take an umbrella, right?

673
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,656
How did you know?

674
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:05,627
The floor was wet, so I wiped it.

675
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:09,096
It's just a tent bar. Can't you play hooky...

676
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,426
and hang out with me today?

677
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,627
Look at you belittling me again.

678
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:26,547
Hey!

679
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,377
Gosh, seriously.

680
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,576
Hey, why would you...

681
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:30,736
Are you sure you found it at the scene?

682
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:33,346
My fingerprint.

683
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:37,417
You lied to me, didn't you?

684
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:39,286
What do you mean?

685
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,817
I wiped everything I touched.

686
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,227
Where did you find it? Which house?

687
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,067
There is no such thing as a perfect crime.

688
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:04,236
And come tomorrow, you'll find out whether or not I lied to you.

689
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,687
He confessed.

690
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,366

The unidentified fingerprint does belong to Cho Kang Moo.

697

It wasn't in the system because he's a minor.

(99.99 Percent Match)

700
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:45,607
This is the first news this morning.

701
00:45:45,707 --> 00:45:48,846
A teen boy pretended to be the Red Cap to confuse the police...

702
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,486
and committed murders. The brutal details of his crimes...

703
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:53,817
have now been revealed.

704
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:56,386
The suspect, Cho, used his image as a diligent young man...

705
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,786
- to go about his daily life... - Hello?

706

even after murdering two women who lived alone.

708
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,527
Cho is an 18-year-old minor.

709
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,596
He does not have a resident registration number yet,

710
00:46:07,596 --> 00:46:09,567
so his fingerprints weren't registered in the system,

711
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,136

- Why did you kill them? - Did you kill anyone else?

715
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,277
How many people did you kill?

716
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:22,616
Did you copy other murderers?

721
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,357
Get out of the way, please.

722
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,196

Settle down.

727

Bring her back to life!

728
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,176
You attacked the victim who was in her room.

729
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:51,337
Then you strangled her.

730
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:53,607
You got on top of her...

731
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:58,716
and then you took her top off? Is that right?

732
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:01,517
Right. You took her top off.

How is the victim doing?

739
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:25,176
Yet why is it so hard to catch a criminal?

740
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:29,576
Anyway, good job.

741
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,616
It's a real relief that we ended up catching him.

742
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,417
If we weren't able to catch him...

743
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:40,886
there may have been a third victim.

744
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,426
Do you think so?

745
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,596
I feel bad for the victims to say this...

746
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:47,397
but for a guy who committed the same murder twice,

747
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,397
committing a third one would be nothing for him. You know that.

750
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,946
He already showed boldness in his second crime.

751
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:09,957
He saw her house key on her...

752
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:11,957
and suspected she lived alone.

753
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:15,556
He erased his traces with the toilet paper from the bathroom.

754
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:19,366
When I checked again, from both Choi and Won's homes...

755
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:22,567
they only had the cores of toilet paper rolls left behind.

756
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,397
Why was I so stupid to not notice that?

757
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,406
You can't be perfect. We're human too.

758
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:32,877
It's our job to find as many clues as we can.

759
00:48:34,806 --> 00:48:35,917
Which is why I'm saying...

760
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:39,017
we need to do research on criminal behavior analysis.

761
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,216
We have to find that out.

762
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:43,817
Also, it's not as if these guys stop because they go to jail.

They don't!

764
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:47,486
Yes, it's important to catch them.

765
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:50,357
But we have to be prepared for when they enter back into society.

766
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:53,127
If we do research and make data...

767
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:54,497
out of these similar criminal cases...

768
00:48:55,196 --> 00:48:56,736
I'm certain it will come in handy.

769
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,036

How are things with Captain Park?

772
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:10,647
Since it was Captain Park who got a confession out of Bang Ki Hoon.

773
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:13,547
Nothing changed.

774
00:49:14,716 --> 00:49:16,017
That's a relief then.

00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,777
He does not deserve to be called a father.

781
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:40,176
He sent his own child to an orphanage.

782
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,616
Because it's what that scumbag did all the time.

783

"That scumbag?"

784
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:45,946
My dad.

785
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:48,886
Cho Kang Moo's unusual behavior stemmed from...

786
00:49:49,216 --> 00:49:52,656
his resentment and hatred towards his parents.

787
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:55,087
He feels absolutely no remorse for the murders he committed.

00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:25,917
I'm back.

898
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:28,786
- You're home. - Yes.

899
00:55:30,756 --> 00:55:33,227
- Did you eat? - I already ate.

900
00:55:55,363 --> 00:55:58,193
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

901
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,240
Ha Young was the one who caught the real culprit,

902
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,111
not Yang Yong Chul.

903
00:56:02,111 --> 00:56:04,080
If it hadn't been for him, that poor man...

904
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,050
would've finished serving his sentence, get it?

905
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,481
Well, that's what you'd like to believe.

906
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,821
The FBI had been using interviews with culprits...

907
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:14,461
for the last 20 years as a part of their investigation.

908
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:15,961
It's nothing wrong.

909
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,530
Rather, no one taught him, but he thought of that alone.

910
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,600
Yes, okay. But the thing is,

911
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,030
no one knows that out there.

912
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,240
If they don't know, we must let them know.

913
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:27,600
This is the perfect timing...

914
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,541
to create the Behavioral Analysis Team.

915
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:32,311
Young Soo, please learn to read the room, will you?

916
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,280
We're about to get dragged to the commissioner's office.

917
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,580
Sounds great. Go ask him to make that team.

918
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,620
Darn you. Good grief.

919
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,620
Please trust me this once.

920
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:50,530
It's the old man.

921
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,160
- The commissioner? - Yes.

922
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,361
You go ask him to make you that team.

923
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,530
Let's go.

924
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,941
- Darn it. - We got this. We'll be back.

925
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:03,841
Not only did the police accuse an innocent man as the culprit,

926
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:05,740
but they also arrested Cho, an 18-year-old...

927
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,350
What will you do about the public sentiment?

928
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,021
If the Special Crime Squad took the case and put an end to it,

929
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:14,751
this wouldn't have happened.

930
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,720
It wouldn't be good manners for us to work on a culprit...

931
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,260
caught by the Dongbu Police Station.

932
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,821
They're already going crazy...

933
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,930
about how you locked up an innocent man for a year.

934
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:27,231
Can we let them ridicule us saying a convict caught the criminal?

935
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:29,571
I've had enough of this incompetence.

936
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:32,870
Who leaked the fact that he's the Red Cap?

937
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,901
Well, it's not that someone leaked the information.

938
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,041
That jerk is putting on a show to grab people's attention.

939
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:44,080
What have you done right as detectives?

940
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,151
- We'll do better. - We're sorry.

941
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:47,421
Everyone at Dongbu Police Station will be disciplined!

942
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:56,530
And simply disciplining you won't turn the tables, okay?

943
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,501
What are you going to do about this?

944
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:00,501
I'm sorry.

945
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,530
- Darn it. - Tell him.

946
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,370
Sorry?

947
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,041
- Tell him what? - That thing.

948
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:13,381
- That thing? - Pilot thing.

949
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:14,780
What are you two doing?

950
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,180
I'm sorry. He just whispered to me.

951
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:20,251
I didn't get that. I'm sorry.

952
00:58:20,421 --> 00:58:21,821
That pilot thing.

953
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,291
Commissioner, well.

954
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:29,390
- There might be a way. - Yes.

955
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:33,131
What is it?

956
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,300
I'll give you some more.

957
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,001
- Thank you. - Sure.

958
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:38,901
Enjoy. Hello.

959
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:46,481
May I have ramyeon?

960
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:06,760
- How much do you take? - Just go.

961
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,361
I don't take money from a friend.

962
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:16,870

963
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,441
the real culprit.

964
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,381
You were always like that.

965
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,651
You pretended like you didn't care about people,

966
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:34,921
but you were always considerate behind their back.

967
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:40,100
We'd like to pay the tab.

968
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,771
Sure, eight dollars, please.

969
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:02,151
Thank you for finding the real culprit.

970
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:26,510
If you're my friend, take it.

971
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:41,361
You rascal. Why didn't you come out sooner?

972
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:44,591
You weren't on a stakeout, were you?

973
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:46,160
Have you read the book?

974
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,561
The one I gave you last time.

975
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,071
We can finally create...

976
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:51,731
the Behavioral Analysis Team,

977
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,600
as long as you agree.

978
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,571
Sorry?

979
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,311
Do you remember what I said about profilers?

980
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:00,580
If you didn't catch Cho Kang Moo,

981
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,711
he would've continued to murder people.

982
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:04,510
We can stop that from happening.

983
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,151
Well, we pretty much stopped Cho Kang Moo too.

984
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:09,651
- Can you explain in simple terms? - Okay.

985
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:13,220
You can officially go around interviewing inmates.

986
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,521
How is that possible?

987
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:17,260
You said it was helpful to visit Yang Yong Chul.

988
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:20,930
We can just say it was the duty of the Behavioral Analysis Team...

989
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,231
to go interview Yang Yong Chul.

990
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:25,470
Those above will have an excuse to calm the people down.

991
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,501
And for me, I'm thrilled because I can finally do some real work.

992
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,571
It'll definitely help in resolving similar cases.

993
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:33,910
It's belated, anyway. We should've made this long ago.

994
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:36,140
But I don't exactly know...

995
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,450
what a profiler does.

996
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,151
It's all right. Just do as you've done.

997
01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:44,850
Others couldn't understand,

998
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,921
but you instinctively knew that this was necessary.

999
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:50,430
That's why you continued to visit Yang Yong Chul.

1000
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:54,461
And as for studying, you and I can start doing that now.

1001
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:02,071
I believe this was something someone had to do someday.

1002
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,111

1003
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,481
that you're the perfect person for this.
