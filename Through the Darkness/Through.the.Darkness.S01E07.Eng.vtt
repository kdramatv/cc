This team is always working very hard.

6

But there still has to be someone preparing for what may happen.

7
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,026
I need you to take up a case.

8
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:19,855
A married couple was murdered in their home two weeks ago.

9
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,555
There was cash lying around, but he didn't even touch it.

10
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,395
They think it's an act of resentment masked as a burglary.

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,165
It's clean.

12
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,436
It means the victims were overpowered...

13

(Gungok-dong Family Murder Case, September 24, 2003)

15
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:39,845
A type of systematic crime committed according to a plan.

16
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:42,775
Is this a way of expressing...

17
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,815
the culprit's emotions caused by a grudge they hold?

18
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:45,985
They are both hiking shoes.

19
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:48,485
This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.

20
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,425
And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.

21
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,686

(Jinjung-dong, Gangnam-gu)

23
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:56,326
There was another case in Jinjung-dong.

You're not an investigator. Why are you here?

25
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,866
Please. I must check the crime scene.

27

Darn it.

28
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,606
This is important.

29
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,806
The victim was hit by a blunt instrument.

30
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,315
And the safe wasn't touched either.

31
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:18,285
This is the third murder, and his only purpose is...

32
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:20,156
to kill.

33
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:22,916

36
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,826
A senior citizen was murdered.

37
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,395
Why did he suddenly start a fire?

38
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:30,966
He tried doing something he had never done before.

39
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,636
I'm sure he came across an unexpected situation.

40
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,936
He either wanted to destroy traces he didn't want anyone to see.

41
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,205
Or it could've been his trace.

42
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:38,365
I mean the CCTV footage.

43
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,975
We got a shot of the back of the culprit.

44
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,576
Let's put out an APB.

45
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:45,076
You want us to do that with just the footage that shows his back?

46
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:47,016
Are you suggesting that we give him a warning...

47
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:49,216
- that he could get caught? - That's correct.

48
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:51,746
The only way to stop him from striking again...

49
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,145
is this.

50
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,455
The footage shows a man walking. He's wearing a black jacket.

51
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:58,285
The police have identified this man in the footage...

52
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,455
Even after you let out the APB...

53
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:02,156
At least share the information with me!

55
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,425

The decision for an open search.

57
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,566
Is this the police's lifeline?

58
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:10,865
Or is this the beginning of doom?

59
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,435
Did he give up on committing another crime to hide?

60
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,905
Or is he still planning another crime?

Also considering the depth of the dent,

157
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,062
it's not a light weapon.

Richard Chase was also abused by his parents as a kid.

179
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,991
He experienced bed-wetting,

180
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,022
committed arson, and animal abuse,

181
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:21,262
which are common characteristics of serial killers.

182
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:23,221
He killed adults and children...

183
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,692
in a brutal manner.

184
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,662
He didn't have hostile relationships with the victims.

185
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:29,932
Why did he brutally murder victims chosen at random?

186
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:33,532
Most murderers like him kill for pleasure.

187
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,071
For pleasure, not because of anger?

188
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:37,912
That is the most frightening part.

189
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:41,481
It means killing makes them happy.

190
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,341
Killing satisfies them,

191
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,182
so they can't stop.

192
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:47,951
They actually become bolder, looking for bigger pleasures.

193
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,022
- Correct. - That's why he mutilated...

194
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,251
and even cannibalized his victims.

195
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,721
Sexually deviant killers tend to commit such acts.

196
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,632
So Richard Chase's cases are often categorized as lust murders...

197
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,461
and as sexual homicides.

198
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,831
Sexual homicides?

199
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,032
That's right.

200
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,871
The way he mutilated his victims doesn't show a specific pattern.

201
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,571
There's no pattern at all.

202
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:11,272
He didn't know much about human anatomy,

203
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,571
nor did he try to study.

204
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,882
Right, and he didn't even bother tidying up the scene.

205
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,912
He didn't even try to conceal evidence.

206
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:22,481
So we could say that Chase's murders were unsystematic.

207
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,751
He chose his victims at random, and it wasn't premeditated.

208
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,451
And even when he was caught at the scene,

209
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,321
he was very confused.

210
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,532
On top of that, he suffered from schizophrenia.

211
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:33,262
His cases were typical unsystematic murders.

212
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,361
We need a list of your psychiatric patients...

213
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,802
from the past 5 years, dating back to 1999.

214
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:50,782
Don't you feel all cooped up being stuck in the press room?

215
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,581
You're still doing field coverage and writing all the articles.

216
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:56,621
I commend you for your enthusiasm, but your juniors will hate you.

217
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:00,192
Aren't we both used to people hating us?

218
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,792
Don't you worry.

219
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,162
Not me.

220
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,292
What are you talking about? Your juniors hate you way more.

221
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,402
So?

222
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,571
Are you going to do it for me or not?

223
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,532
We have to catch the serial killer.

224
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,172
You know that the Special Crime Squad is busy.

225
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,871
Come on. Don't be like this.

226
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:24,512
Of course, Mr. Kwak knows how busy you are.

227
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,652
He keeps filing a report every time his girls go missing,

228
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,121
but the police don't seem to care,

229
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,292
so he's getting all anxious.

230
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,991
Good grief.

231
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:38,762
Hey, over here!

232
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,731
He's here.

233
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,601
This is the detective. Say hello.

234
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,672
Reporter Im told me a lot about you.

235
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:51,871
Hello, Chief Kim.

236
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,081
I'm Kwak Man Hyun.

237
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,542
(Mr. Kwak in Mapo, Girls in their 20s)

238
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,652
You didn't have to introduce him to me.

239
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,721
Come on. You two should meet.

240
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,221
- No pressure. - Yes.

241
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,121
In any case, pretend not to know me when you run into me at police HQ.

242
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,162
I always do. Are you worried I'd suddenly say hi to you?

243
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:12,461
Who knows?

244
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,402
The one thing I learned while working as a detective...

245
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:18,032
is that you should never trust anyone.

246
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:25,512
- What brings you by? - Hello, sir.

247
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,942
This is my first time back here after the team was formed,

248
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,981
and this office still looks crummy.

249
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:33,851
Hey, do you have water?

250
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,182
- Water? - Forget it.

251
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,121
Shouldn't you at least be able to tell...

252
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,662
whether it's a killer's hideout...

253
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,262
or a place for catching killers?

254
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:46,762
Why are you already trying to pick a fight?

255
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:50,302
Hey, those red marks. What are they about?

256
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:53,841
Today is the 154th day after the 1st case broke out.

257
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,001
And the 105th day after we put out the APB on him.

258
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,912
Do you guys even remember your families' birthdays?

259
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,882
If you're going to tell us to drop it, just leave.

260
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,882
Must you kick me out already?

261
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,882
Why else would the chief of the Special Crime Squad be here?

262
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,351
Goodness. Are you a psychic or what?

263
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:16,091
A scary wolf is roaming around inside the rabbit burrow.

264
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,662
We won't stop until we catch the wolf. End of discussion.

265
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,562
Goodness. Okay, I heard you.

266
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,302
Just be careful and stay out of Bong Sik...

267
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,532
and Captain Yoon's sight.

268
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,302
You're the chief of the Special Crime Squad.

269
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,841
Why do you always walk on eggshells around them?

270
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,942
What? Do you not walk on eggshells around your juniors?

271
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,081
A little bit.

272
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,581
Captain Yoon is one thing,

273
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:40,951
but Bong Sik has such a nasty temper.

274
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,981
I do too.

275
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,192
What do you say? Should I go ahead and load my gun?

276
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,762
That lunatic will actually pull the trigger. That's the problem.

277
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:54,302
He's been on everyone's case with that temper of his.

278
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:57,971
Still, we can't just sit back and do nothing.

279
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,932
We don't know when the culprit will kill again.

280
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,371
It's not like I don't know that! Goodness.

281
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:04,042
My head hurts.

282
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,542
I'm leaving. This place is giving me a headache again.

283
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,711
Would you like a cup of tea...

284
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,512
Why couldn't you ask sooner?

285
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,711
Why are you getting mad at that perfectly nice kid?

286
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,481
Goodness, taking your teammate's side?

287
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,961
Be good. I'm watching you.

288
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:22,821
Goodbye.

289
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,491
So why were you really here?

290
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,861
I came because I missed you. Happy?

291
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:29,501
Goodbye.

292

307
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,142
- I'm sorry. - Okay, fine.

308

That article was really harsh.

00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,172
Why? It's true. What about it?

326
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,841
Inspector Song won't show it,

327

but he is already in a tight spot after he let out the APB.

Yes, so who on earth is this Inspector Song?

330

Yes.

332
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:03,251
After I heard something from Inspector song on my first day,

333
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:04,622
I never once regretted...

volunteering to join the Behavioral Analysis Team.

What did he say?

336
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,422
He asked me that day for the reason why I volunteered.

337
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,162
Nothing really came to my mind,

338
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,902
so I immaturely replied, "Because it seemed cool."

339
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,701
He said this to me after a while.

Do you know the story of the blind man and a lantern?

341

Someone asked a blind man...

342
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,842
who was walking down a dark road with a lantern in his hand.

343
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:28,142
You can't see anyway. Why do you carry that around?

Why do you think so?

345
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,991
He wanted others to see clearly and not fall down while walking.

346
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,162

- Can you put it in here? - Okay, sure.

355
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,971
- Yes, okay. Thank you. - Sure.

356
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,442
- Enjoy. - Goodbye.

357
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:34,342
My gosh, why is it raining so much?

358
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,791
I'm home.

359
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,701
Mom?

360
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:01,362
The receiver cannot be reached.

361
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,592
I'm sorry. I'm late.

362
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,332
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

363
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,031
I left it at the bakery.

364
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:37,132
When I went back, they were already closed.

365
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,301
You didn't have to get this.

366
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,001
And from now on, tell me to get these.

367
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,271
No.

368
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:47,241
I'm much better than you at picking out food ingredients.

369
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,382
Goodness, I'm glad I made the soup earlier.

370
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:58,791
Honey, you should also celebrate Ha Young's birthday with us.

371
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,261
The sky is blue, and cherry blossoms are in full blossom.

372
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:19,001
The weather continues to stay nice and makes us feel warm.

373
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,872
The temperature will rise tomorrow,

374
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,471
and it'll be a bit hotter in the south like early summer.

375
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,842
But the air is a bit drier.

376
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,582
In Chungcheong and Gangwon Provinces...

377
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,281
- What's that? - Daily case report.

378
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,112
I said we won't return to the office...

379
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:35,422
after visiting the prison,

380
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,922
and Woo Ju gave these to me.

381
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,051
Where did we find such treasure like that kid?

382
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,692
I think I still have the luck to be with good people.

383
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,561
Am I included in that luck?

384
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,231
Why? Do you think you aren't?

385
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,761
You're worried over nothing.

386
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,501
- Nothing, right? - No.

387
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,731
No, but I'm not sure if that's good or finding something is good.

388
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,342
I wouldn't feel so frustrated only if we could figure out...

389
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,142
if he stopped or changed his MO.

390
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,981
A residential district, in public, stabbed in the right side,

391
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,682
serious injury inflicted by the stab.

392
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,951
Camping knife?

393
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,922
- Camping knife? - Yes.

394
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,122
Why?

395
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,261
May I see that again?

396
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,721
- Which one? Sinheung 4-dong? - Yes.

397
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,791
This is just an assault case.

398
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,892
- May I see it? - Which one? Right here?

399
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:23,862
"April 15, 3:30am."

400
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,332
"A residential district, in public, victim, female."

401
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:29,442
"Serious injury inflicted by the stab on the right side."

402
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:32,771
- "Weapon, camping knife." - Camping knife.

403
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,541
Camping knife.

404
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,182
(Attacked with a camping knife.)

405
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,721
Could you please make a call to Woo Ju?

406
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,221
Sure. One second.

407
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,261
Hey, Woo Ju.

408
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,731
Can you look up "camping knife" and find some reports?

409
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,761
- Camping knife? - Yes, this year.

410
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:56,932
I remember seeing it.

411
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:58,102
One second.

412
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:01,031
You should begin with Dongjak Police Station.

413
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:02,041
(Dongjak Police Station 1st quarter, 2004, Daily Case Report)

414
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,541
(Camping knife)

415
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:08,741
Two cases popped up.

416
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,082
Two cases?

417
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,281
Yes. In Sinheung 2-dong and Sinheung 5-dong.

418
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:14,451
And both cases took place in February this year.

419
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,582
Tell me about the victims.

420
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,551
Both of them were women in their 20s.

421
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,291
And they have serious injuries.

422
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,021
Both were categorized as assault cases.

423
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,862
Print the case reports.

424
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,362
Let's go.

425
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:32,731
(Conference Room)

426
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:35,372
Captain Yoon.

427
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:36,942
Did you look into it?

428
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:41,811
The cases in Guo-dong and Borim-dong took place...

429
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,342
in January and February.

430
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:46,352
Captain Yoon. Do you think the culprit is the same guy?

431
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:48,281
Both victims had serious injuries.

432
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:50,021
And they were reported as assault cases.

433
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,322
So both victims can't remember his face, right?

434
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,822
They only remember seeing his back when he was running away.

435
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:57,991
Both victims said that he was short and had a small build.

436
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:01,301
But it might be a bit of a leap to say that they were attacked...

437
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,602
by the same guy.

438
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,932
But the wealthy senior citizens who were murdered...

439
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,332
lived in different districts.

440
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,402
But even if we assume that his MO changed,

441
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,971
it's still confusing because the victims didn't die.

442
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,942
Both victims were...

443
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:19,352
stabbed in the abdomen by a camping knife.

444
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:22,322
The same weapon and location of the stab wounds.

445
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,251
Based on these factors,

446
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,622
we can deduce that the culprit might be the same guy.

447
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,662
But I'm not sure if that's enough to report this...

448
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:30,721
as criminal intelligence.

449
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:33,461
This part bothers me the most.

450
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:38,102
A 170cm-tall suspect with a small build.

451
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,741
The description is similar to the guy we're looking for.

452
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:45,241
This is from Geumcheon Police Station?

453
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,612
Yes. I went to school with the detective in charge.

454
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,412
And we recently had drinks.

455
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:51,241
When he was telling me about the case, something was off.

456
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:52,682
So we looked into this ourselves.

457
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:54,112
What about this?

458
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,551
At our last meeting, Inspector Song...

459
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,951
mentioned the possibility that he might change his MO.

460
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,291
I remembered what he said that day.

461
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,392
So we kept an eye out to see if there were any cases,

462
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:06,832
following a specific pattern.

463
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,801
So these cases...

464
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:14,372
could have been executed by him? Did I get that right?

465
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,372
Whether it's true or not,

466
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:17,701
it still bothers me.

467
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,642
But this isn't a homicide.

468
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:23,842
We don't have any excuse to take over the cases.

469
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:25,711
They are just two assault cases.

470
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,451
Let us investigate this ourselves.

471
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,751
Goodness. It's all because of this jerk.

472
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:33,021
I'm starting to see everything as serial murder.

473
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,692
Whenever we get a case, I immediately think it might be him.

474
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:35,892
Same here.

475
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,432
But these cases don't seem to suit his style.

476
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,961
Whether it's the same guy or not, once there's a reasonable doubt,

477
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,432
we must investigate.

478
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:45,231
Even if it might be a waste of time,

479
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,332
that's better than losing him because we didn't try.

480
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:49,971
Woo Ju, you got the reports, right?

481
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,211
Are they important cases?

482
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,172
- We're not sure yet. - Is it him?

483
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,781
There's a small possibility if he changed his MO.

484
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,511
We'll be back. Let's go.

485
00:26:58,511 --> 00:26:59,652
We'll be back.

486
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:05,791
(For people's safety and happiness)

487
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,051
Okay.

488
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:08,322
(We can find your lost items!)

489
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,362
The victim is in the hospital now.

490
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,461
She needs to rest. So you can't interview her.

491
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,102
- This is her statement. - Okay.

492
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:19,771
He kept following him, so she even threw her purse at him.

493
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,872
But he wasn't interested in that.

494
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:24,142
How did you confirm it was a camping knife?

495
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:26,241
Given the size of the stab wound,

496
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:27,572
we knew it wasn't a kitchen knife.

497
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,342
The victim also said that the knife was small.

498
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,281
It came up to about a half of our palms.

499
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,281
I showed her a few photos.

500
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:36,182
She said camping knives looked the closest.

501
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,491
- Was there an eyewitness? - Yes.

502
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,991
He heard screams, so he opened the window and yelled.

503
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,322
Then the culprit ran away.

504
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,261
He was short, skinny, and balding.

505
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,632
He was wearing a shabby tracksuit.

506
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:52,271
Can we meet with him?

507
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:53,701
Sure.

508
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,942
And what about the other two cases?

509
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,271
The other two cases?

510
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,912
Two cases with a similar MO took place in February.

511
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:00,912
Take a look here.

512
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,781
- Sinheung 5-dong. - Okay.

513
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:05,412
Sinheung 2-dong.

514
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,852
You need to ask the team in charge. I don't have information on them.

515
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:11,721
He's in charge. Detective Kim, come here.

516
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,521
He followed her to the door of her house.

517
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:17,521
He stabbed her when she had her key in the hole.

518
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:19,491
He sounded like a total nutcase.

519
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,701
Did he try to steal her wallet?

520
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,261
After stabbing her, he left without even touching her bag.

521
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,932
So the victim was about to go in.

522
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,372
And this jerk came at her all of a sudden.

523
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:31,041
He grabbed her arm and turned her around.

524
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,372
Then he stabbed her right away.

525
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:35,481
She couldn't remember his face as she was shocked.

526
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:39,481
She said he was short. Right.

527
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,682
He was about 170cm tall.

528
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,781
Not having surveillance cameras in a blind spot like this...

529
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:44,991
is always a problem.

530
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:46,822
But we have more cameras compared to last year.

531
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:48,192
This is an improvement.

532
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,221
Right. That's good.

533
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:54,862
- But we still need more. - Right.

534
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,731
- Is that the house? - Yes. The one on the second floor.

535
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,771
That's where I screamed.

536
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,241
Where was the culprit?

537
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,701
Over there. Under the street lamp.

538
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:06,142
Something seemed off, so I was watching them.

539
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:08,241
All of a sudden, the woman started screaming.

540
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:14,582
So I screamed, "Hey! What are you doing?"

541
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:15,852
When I screamed,

542
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,622
he ran away. And he was really fast.

543
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,192
You also said that he was short.

544
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,261
He was short.

545
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:25,592
He was losing hair. He had a bald spot on his head.

546
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,632
Didn't he wear hiking boots?

547
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,932
I'm not sure about that.

548
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:32,731
Right. You were pretty far.

549
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,001
What do you mean by he was fast?

550
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:38,372
The light was bright, so I could see him running away.

551
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,612
Enough for you to see that he was a fast runner?

552
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,642
Yes. I was surprised how fast he was.

553
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:49,021
The victim suspected it could've been an act of retaliation.

554
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,521
So we also thought that he knew the victim personally.

555
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,152
And we started questioning her friends.

556
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:56,461
So you didn't find any fingerprints or evidence for both cases?

557
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,362
Right. He followed her...

558
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,632
to her house as if he was determined to hurt her.

559
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:01,761
She wasn't sure if he was following her.

560
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,832
But he came into the building too.

561
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:05,872
And she looked when he took out something from his jacket.

562
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,501
And he stabbed her right away.

563
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,902
This case took place in Guo-dong.

564
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:12,112
But it's the same MO with Borim-dong.

565
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,041
Only the location changed. And no evidence either.

566
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,541
On top of that, it rained that night.

567
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,082
A camping knife, a stab wound in the abdomen,

568
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:22,951
and no valuables or money were taken.

569
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,221
She didn't know she was being followed because of the rain.

570
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,551
The victim was attacked and on the ground.

571
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,561
When he saw a car coming into the alley,

572
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,961
he was surprised and ran away.

573
00:30:31,491 --> 00:30:33,991
The victims gave similar descriptions. But no luck yet?

574
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:35,301
He was short.

575
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,632
And when she was on the ground, she saw his feet running away.

576
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,572
He was wearing sneakers.

577
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,402
Not hiking boots?

578
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,271
She only said he wore sneakers.

579
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:47,211
Sneakers.

580
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,041
(Keep people safe, and enforce the law fairly.)

581
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,152
The fact that he didn't take money or valuables bothers me the most.

582
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:56,382
Right?

583
00:30:56,781 --> 00:31:00,051
He committed crimes in January and February.

584
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,392
It's April, but he hadn't committed any crimes afterward.

585
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:06,662
Is this the cooling-off period the Analysis Team mentioned?

586
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:12,031
Let's check the scene first.

587
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,471
Is this the place?

588
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:19,741
Yes.

589
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:31,021
- This is way too bright. - Yes.

590
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,721
That's odd.

591
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,662
Three people had serious stab wounds from a camping knife...

592
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,791
after these attacks.

593
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,362
All of them took place late at night.

594
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:44,162
All of the victims were young women.

595
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:45,672
The only difference is...

596
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:46,672
one of them happened in an alley at a residential area.

597
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,741
And the other two, in front of the victims' houses.

598
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:50,801
They were attacked in different locations,

599
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:53,241
but having three cases with the same MO...

600
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,711
implies that there might be more cases.

601
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,451
And all of the victims were stabbed...

602
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,011
in their stomachs.

603
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,352
Do you think it's him?

604
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:06,221
I doubt it.

605
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,622
The weapon, MO, and time don't match at all.

606
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,721
But they seem to have a similar build.

607
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,561
Right. That's why we can't be certain.

608
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:15,231
But he said the culprit was a fast runner.

609
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:16,801
If he was visibly fast,

610
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,872
I don't think he could've done that in hiking boots.

611
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,372
Right. You can't run fast in hiking boots.

612
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,201
There's a photo of him from behind, and we know he wore hiking boots.

613
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,642
So he probably didn't wear them.

614
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:26,912
But the culprit we're looking for...

615
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,511
brutally murdered his victims with a blunt weapon,

616
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,112
not even giving the victims to resist.

617
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:32,951
Even if he wanted to change the MO, I don't think he would use...

618
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,582
such a small knife.

619
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:37,251
Let's say that it is him.

620
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,721
All of these assault cases would be attempted murder cases.

621
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,822
That wouldn't have satisfied him.

622
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:44,422
Then he wouldn't have used the same weapon three times.

623
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:47,432
Seeing how he repeated his crimes, can't we interpret that...

624
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,602
he didn't know if the victims were dead or not?

625
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,632
Even if you're right, that doesn't change anything.

626
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,531
He rarely left any evidence after breaking into the houses.

627
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,041
Someone like him followed his victims?

628
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,971
There could've been witnesses. He wouldn't take risks like that...

629
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:02,882
because he's super careful.

630
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,451
What if it's not him?

631
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,152
Since all the victims were injured,

632
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:12,592
we're not looking for a murderer, but a violent man who robs people.

633
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,461
No. He wasn't interested in valuables. He's not a robber.

634
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:17,892
What if our guess is right?

635
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:19,991
What if the victims were only injured...

636
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,731
because he couldn't finish the job?

637
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,672
Then...

638
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,372
we have two serial murderers in this country.

639
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,872
(Mr. Kwak in Mapo, Girls in their 20s)

640
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,652
This one didn't die either?

641
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:10,972
The same weapon was used in the three cases.

642
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,072
A camping knife?

643
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:15,742
Look, these three locations...

644
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,282
aren't far from each other.

645
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,981
The type of weapon, where the victims were attacked,

646
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,822
and even the time. These cases have a lot in common.

647
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:23,981
"Seriously injured..."

648
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,192
Why? We can't investigate them because they're not murders?

649
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,161
Is there something else?

650
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,391
Where are you going?

651
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:36,561
Captain Yoon, come here for a moment.

652
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,371
Guo-dong, Borim-dong.

653
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:45,271
These cases took place in January and February of this year.

654
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,641
We believe these were done by the culprit...

655
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:51,581
of the serial murders. We're investigating at the moment.

656
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,481
It's not the same guy.

657
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,222
What?

658
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,121
This is a different guy.

659
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:03,061
But the height and the build look similar.

660
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,362
But they have nothing else in common.

661
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,891
From the MO to the weapons, everything's different.

662
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:10,262
Didn't you say the MO could change?

663
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:11,762
Yes, it could change.

664
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:14,001
But he already got a taste of killing people with a blunt weapon.

665
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:16,742
There's no way he's now using a camping knife, which is smaller.

666
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,641
Then there's an even lesser chance that this is a serial case, right?

667
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,612
These victims didn't die.

668
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,112
Thankfully, the victims didn't die.

669
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:31,121
But it could actually make the culprit even more violent.

670
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,351
We must catch him...

671
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:34,621
before there's another victim.

672
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,192
What are you talking about?

673
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,692
This serial killer is already giving us a huge headache.

674
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:43,161
How will we track down a murder that hasn't even happened yet?

675
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,032
Let's draw a facial composite.

676
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,802
Yes, let's start with a facial composite.

677
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:53,271
All the victims are alive.

678
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,242
And we have a witness too, so it can be done.

679
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,382
The victims are still traumatized...

680
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,981
and don't remember his face.

681
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:02,681
Let's try forensic hypnosis.

682
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,251
He has a slim face.

683
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:09,862
(Use of hypnosis in the investigative process to find clues)

684
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:12,291
He has small, slanted eyes.

685
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:14,532
And...

686
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:16,601
Oh...

687
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:19,731
He looks like he's losing hair.

688
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,442
Where? At the hairline on the forehead?

689
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,672
Yes.

690
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:34,711
(National Forensic Service)

691
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,382
As you know, the killer isn't after money.

692
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:39,922
(Facial Composite)

693
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:41,492
If it's not about money or personal grudges,

694
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:44,492
there can be only one goal.

695
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:46,862
Killing.

696
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:53,831
(Facial Composite)

697
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:55,802
Yes, he looked like this.

698
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,501
He was skinny. He had a skinny face like this.

699
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,572
This is pretty accurate.

700
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:01,472
- Thank you. - No problem.

701
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,782
- Thank you. - No problem at all.

702
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,782
Let's go.

703
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:07,811
Oh, you're here.

704
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,822
Take a look at this.

705
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,492
We had the witness verify the accuracy of this composite.

706
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,021
Looks good, right?

707
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:18,291
So this scum may be the one who killed the senior citizens.

708
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:20,362
It's not the same guy.

709
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:22,501
No.

710
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,302
We'll continue to investigate keeping in mind the possibility...

711
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,331
that it could be the same guy.

712
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:29,641
Whether it's the same guy or not,

713
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,242
we're investigating the same case, aren't we?

714
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,211
- Yes, we are. - Very well.

715
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:37,742
- Let's go through it again. - Okay.

716
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:39,512
It took place late at night...

717
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:44,081
under a brightly lit street lamp.

718
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,922
The Borim-dong case also took place under a street lamp.

719
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,222
Normally, perpetrators...

720
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:51,362
look for dark spots to hide themselves.

721
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,762
And the victims were attacked from the front, not from behind.

722
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,362
Did he reveal his face on purpose?

723
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,532
- Hold on. Watch this. - Okay.

724
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,172
The victim...

725
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:08,242
was walking this way.

726
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:10,512
She suddenly felt that someone was following her.

727
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,811
She threw her purse, so he'd just take it and leave.

728
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:15,822
But he didn't care about the purse and kept following her,

729
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:19,891
so she started walking fast, terrified.

730
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,092
The culprit must've continued to follow her.

731
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:27,032
Then he suddenly swung his knife at her.

732
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,782
- Hold on. - He made her turn around.

733
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:59,231
But it could've happened the moment she happened to turn around.

734
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,331
The one thing these cases have in common is that...

735
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:04,762
the victims were stabbed in their abdomen.

736
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:07,931
They were all attacked from the front.

737
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,052
They all took place in the southwestern part of the city.

738
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,052
Could it be someone who lives in the area?

739
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,722
Why does the Special Crime Squad think that these cases...

740
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:31,362
were committed by the culprit who killed the rich senior citizens?

741
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,592
That scum targeted houses in the affluent neighborhoods...

742
00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:34,891
of Gangnam and Gangbuk.

743
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,331
But as you can see on this map, this isn't a rich neighborhood.

744
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:39,731
Let's go through everything again.

745
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:43,771
Our theory is that he attacked the victims to kill them.

746
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:48,112
And these attacks took place five times in southwestern Seoul.

747
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,612
That could mean he didn't know that the victims didn't die.

748
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:55,181
Do you think his MO will change once he finds out they didn't die?

749
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:56,552
It's highly likely.

750
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,722
If he didn't know they didn't die,

751
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,922
and if that was why he kept using the same MO,

752
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:02,222
these "attacks"...

753
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:05,291
could turn into murders once he finds out.

754
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,431
In fact, that is what I'm most worried about.

755
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,501
Then how would he find out?

756
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,132
Through the news or the newspapers, probably.

757
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:15,501
Or he could visit the scenes again.

758
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:19,811
You said it rained when the attack took place.

759
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,811
Yes.

760
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:23,382
You can't see clearly when it's raining,

761
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:27,681
which makes things easier for the perpetrator.

762
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:30,081
On top of choosing a brightly lit spot,

763
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,592
he purposely revealed his face. Why?

764
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:39,161
This wasn't about a personal grudge, so why did he reveal his face?

765
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,461
Why? Why did he do that?

766
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:43,402
I really don't get it.

767
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:47,402
What time did the incident take place?

768
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,041
Around 9pm.

769
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,882
Let's go back to the scene in Borim-dong.

770
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,081
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,981
So we'll check this area every day from now on, right?

772
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:01,311
Yes.

773
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:04,882
Do you really think the culprit will return to the scene?

774
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,452
First, we have to put ourselves in his shoes.

775
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:11,822
Why did he choose these areas?

776
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:15,492
Did he look for easy spots where he can attack someone and run?

777
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:18,532
Or is he familiar with this area?

778
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,012
Gosh, this feels like a waste of time.

779
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,581
I feel like we're on a stakeout...

780
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,621
because of something that hasn't even happened yet.

781
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:42,322
No, we're not. We're trying to track down...

782
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:46,961
a serial killer who has already committed murders.

783
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:53,132
It is the same case, but remember that we're looking at it...

784
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:54,871
from a different perspective,

785
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,601
on the premise that it's the same guy.

786
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:07,751
(Pureumae Park, Dongjak-gu)

787
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:10,711
This morning at Seoul Pureumae Park...

788
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:14,051
a woman in her 20s was found stabbed to death.

789
00:44:14,412 --> 00:44:16,321
The victim had been stabbed with a knife multiple times...

790
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,051
and had been bleeding a lot when she was found.

791
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,921
People were heartbroken to hear she passed away in the ambulance...

792
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:23,392
on the way to the hospital.

793
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:27,162
The crime occurred at a blind spot...

794
00:44:27,162 --> 00:44:28,361
where no CCTVs were installed.

795
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:31,832
It's been a struggle to find traces of the culprit due to no witnesses.

796
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:35,571
The importance of having safety measures in parks...

797
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:36,702
has been raised with this incident.

798
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,901
Seoul City has announced that...

799
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,841
they will inspect the park's street lamps...

800
00:44:41,841 --> 00:44:45,042
and install more CCTVs to remove blind spots.

801
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,051
(Map of Seoul Metropolitan City)

802
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,452
The Pureumae Case...

803
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,151
also occurred in the southern district of Seoul.

804
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:53,091
This happened at a park though, not a residential street.

805
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,222
On top of that, the weapon wasn't a camping knife but a kitchen knife.

806
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:58,821
You're seeing this as the same punk when it is this different?

807
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,662
Or is it a third suspect or something?

808
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:02,602
Come on, just hear him out.

809
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,032
Carry on.

810
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:07,202
Woman in her 20s with stab wounds in her stomach.

811
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:08,671
The time of the crime and area of attack...

812
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:11,242
match with the other victims.

813
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:13,211
Although it's a park...

814
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,571
it's a shortcut from the subway to the residential area...

815
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:19,082
so residents of this neighborhood used this route often.

816
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:20,751
Why does that matter?

817
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,782
I'm saying, it has to be considered as a residential street also.

818
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,122
We have a description of the suspect too.

819
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:29,421
Wait, there was a witness?

820
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,622
No.

821
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:34,191
The victim gave testimony...

822
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:35,461
while being transported into the ambulance.

823
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,202
I guess...

824
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,401
she was alive up until then.

825
00:45:43,372 --> 00:45:47,071
It was a man in his 30s, about 170cm in height...

826
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:48,872
with little hair...

827
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,582
dressed in dark workout clothes.

828
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,582
In a phone call with her boyfriend right after the incident, she said,

829
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,582
"A stranger followed me and stabbed me with a knife."

830
00:45:56,682 --> 00:46:00,392
The conversation ended with that.

831
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:01,551
Just as we feared...

832
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,662
the culprit wasn't satisfied with his last crime.

833
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:05,461
So our guess is that he committed another crime...

834
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:07,992
with a larger and sharper weapon.

835
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:10,832
- I still disagree. - With what?

836
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:13,631
I disagree with everything that the Analysis Team says.

837
00:46:13,631 --> 00:46:16,242
Don't you think it's time we stop being swayed by them?

838
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:20,611
- Darn it. - Gosh, that temper of his.

839
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:22,242
Just let him be.

840
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:25,542
So then the Analysis Team thinks...

841
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,881
that the culprit of the Southwest Case and this one...

842
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:31,321
is the same guy, right?

843
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,952
Yes. If you take a look at the pictures from the scene...

844
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,662
it's neither sexual assault nor mugging.

845
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:40,062
It's a different guy from the serial murders of the rich elderly then?

846
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:41,432
Yes.

847
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,231
I don't want to say this...

848
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:46,301
but we have to catch...

849
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:47,901
two serial murderers.

850
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:52,102
Don't blow this matter up hastily.

851
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,611
If we announce there are two serial murderers...

852
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,941
without clear evidence...

853
00:46:58,312 --> 00:47:01,211
the level of anxiety the people will feel will only multiply.

854
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:03,952
Their trust in the police will also waver.

855
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:06,792
Physical evidence found at the scene is not the only clue.

856
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:10,591
There are bound to be traces in the time and place he resided that day.

857
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,432
A trace that may seem trivial...

858
00:47:13,432 --> 00:47:15,292
becomes an important clue to help find the culprit.

859
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:19,032
We can't only look at the weapon, but we must expand the conditions...

860
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:22,671
and look to see if there are any similar cases.

861
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:23,872
What are you saying then?

862
00:47:24,472 --> 00:47:26,742
You want us to request cooperation...

863
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,211
from 36 police stations in Seoul?

864
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:32,111
I think if we can, we must do it.

(Special Crime Squad 1, Team 1)

866
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,082
- Is he serious? - Seriously?

867
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:45,421
We have so much to do.

868
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:46,961
- Gosh. - What a headache.

869
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:49,762
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Special Crime Squad...

870
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:53,131
held a meeting with 31 chiefs of police...

871
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,702
to solve the serial attacks on women in the southwest of Seoul.

872
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:59,841
They established an information room for crimes with no motives...

873
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:03,711
and announced they'll be increasing cooperative investigations.

874
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:06,182
We are a personal bodyguard service.

875
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:08,312
A bodyguard just for myself.

876
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:10,222
We're starting our special event for these self-defense sprays.

877
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:14,392
Now offering a huge discount.

878
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:15,622
The reason is...

879
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,722
With violent crimes targeting women happening consecutively...

880
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:20,631
in the southwestern district of Seoul,

881
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,062
the level of anxiety has jumped amongst the people.

882
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:27,171
Within this year, there have been six cases of attacks in this area.

883
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:29,901
It's been revealed that one of these cases was a murder case...

884
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:32,171
causing huge shock in the community.

885
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:34,012
We'll connect to Reporter Kim Ju Young.

886
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:37,182
On the morning of the 16th at Pureumae Park,

887
00:48:37,182 --> 00:48:38,981
a murder occurred.

888
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,981
Pureumae Park is looking empty...

889
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:43,452
due to no visitors coming by.

890
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:46,392
One citizen expressed her anxiety by saying...

891
00:48:46,392 --> 00:48:49,122
"I'm scared to walk alone, so I'm refraining from going out."

892
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:51,961
The police have increased the amount of questioning...

893
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,861
and have been doing their best in trying to obtain evidence.

894
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:57,131
But it seems like they haven't seen much result.

895
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:27,032
(Looking for witnesses, 10,000-dollar reward)

896
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:28,332
("Please report if you saw the victim around 1:30am at this park.")

897
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,042
You're coming home way past midnight today too. You must be tired.

898
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,981
- Are you going to the morning mass? - Yes.

899
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,051
I'll drop you off.

900
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:52,551
Gosh, it's fine. I go there every week anyway.

901
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:54,421
It's bright outside already. Don't worry.

902
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,222
No, I'm going to drop you off. Come on out.

903
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:58,921
My goodness. I told you, it's fine.

904
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:01,332
Please think of your servant Michael...

905
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,262
who you called away from this world.

906
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:08,532
He participated in the saint's death through baptism.

907
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:12,071
So please let him enjoy his resurrection too.

908
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:14,912
Those who are sound asleep with the hopes of resurrection...

909
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:18,412
The devil has hid himself again.

910
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:19,751
Please think of them...

911
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,682
and let them meet your shining face.

912
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:30,591
(July 2004)

913
00:50:58,452 --> 00:51:00,992
Why are they under construction every day?

914
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:02,892
They're going to build a house at this point.

915
00:51:03,062 --> 00:51:05,521
The noise is killing me.

916
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,401
Police.

917
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:48,401
(Senior Inspector, Kook Young Soo)

918
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:49,872
I'm a police officer.

919
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:54,441
Yes, I'm a police officer.

920
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:14,832
"Spooky Thursdays," my gosh.

921
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:17,332
They've stopped night studies at girls' high schools.

922
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,731
I'm having nightmares every day...

923
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:22,102
because I'm worried this may end up a cold case.

924
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,602
I think the world is becoming strange.

925
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:27,012
Seriously.

926
00:52:27,472 --> 00:52:29,711
I feel like I'm running in circles.

927
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:34,582
What does he want to nag about now?

928
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:36,622
Yes?

929
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:38,782
Where are you, Young Soo? Hurry up and come in.

930
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:39,792
Why?

931
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:40,992
I think we caught that punk.

932
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:43,521
"That punk?" Which punk?

933
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,961
That punk has a forged ID card.

934
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,892
Forged ID card? What are you talking about?

935
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,202
Don't tell me you're talking about the one I lost four years ago?

936
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:51,961
Gosh, just stop talking and hurry on over here!

937
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,872
The serial murderer of the wealthy senior citizens...

938
00:52:55,432 --> 00:52:57,001
we caught that punk!

939
00:52:58,001 --> 00:53:00,472
Turn the car around, Ha Young.

941
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:16,562
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

942
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:21,392
(Statement Recording Room)

943
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:12,618
(Personal information)

944
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:15,529
You arrested him as a suspect of a sex worker's abduction?

945
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:16,529
Yes.

946
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:19,968
The women on the staff continuously couldn't be reached.

947
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,968
The pimp reported him after much suspicion.

948
00:54:22,328 --> 00:54:25,038
He was arrested around 05:30am today.

949
00:54:25,368 --> 00:54:27,569
He had his victim, Gu Young Chun's phone,

950
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,638
as well as articles from the lost women.

951
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:31,709
Mapo Police Station is done investigating them.

952
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:34,078
We're also in the process of searching through the car...

953
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:36,518
of the woman who went missing two days ago.

954
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,618
What about the missing victims?

955
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:42,049
"I killed them. I didn't."

956
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,658
"I buried them. I didn't."

957
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:45,118
His statement is everywhere.

958
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,129
Anyway, Chief Kim Bong Sik.

959
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:48,959
How did you come to catch him together?

960
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:51,229
The owner of the business, Kwak Man Hyun,

961
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:53,868
is an acquaintance of Chief Kim Bong Sik.

962
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:57,738
That's why he's not showing up?

963
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:02,569
Anyway, are you sure that guy said he did bad stuff...

964
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:04,408
to those elderly people?

965
00:55:04,408 --> 00:55:06,209
Yes, I think so.

966
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:10,479
But he kept going off speaking nonsense on our way here.

967
00:55:15,288 --> 00:55:18,058
What do you think, Inspector Song?

968
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:20,529
We should first check...

969
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:22,359
if he has a mental condition...

970
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:23,759
or a history of receiving personality disorder treatment.

971
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:26,768
Oh, the one you wrote down in the most recent profiling report?

972
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:28,198
Yes.

973
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:29,399
- Detective Nam. - Yes, sir.

974
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:30,868
- Run over and check. - Yes, sir.

975
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:37,609
You!

976
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:40,209
You're at Seoul Agency's Special Crime Squad.

977
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:41,808
So get your story straight!

978
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:48,819
Did you kill those ladies...

979
00:55:48,919 --> 00:55:50,359
and buried them in secret too?

980
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:52,589
Yes.

981
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:57,499
What's this about killing the elderly?

982
00:55:58,328 --> 00:55:59,828
What do you think?

983
00:56:00,698 --> 00:56:02,899
I literally killed those old people.

984
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:04,698
How dare you smile?

985
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,968
Are you referring to the elderly you killed...

986
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:10,109
as the victims of the murder case of the wealthy senior citizens?

987
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:23,718
Detective!

988
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:26,089
Gu Young Chun is still under questioning, right?

989
00:56:27,488 --> 00:56:29,229
I came all the way here from Mapo Police Station.

990
00:56:29,229 --> 00:56:31,828
- Can you share something? - I have nothing to share.

991
00:56:33,629 --> 00:56:34,698
Detective!

992
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:40,339
Is Jung Woo Ju my only chance?

993
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:47,509
Not there. This way. Come.

994
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:55,018
Are you sure this is it?

995
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:17,979
(The date and place of the case October 30, 2003, 32 Hwanghwa-dong)

996
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:20,948
(Suseong-dong Case)

997
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:22,609
Write down how many you killed.

998
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,078
The elderly or the young girls?

999
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:28,448
You jerk.

1000
00:57:29,448 --> 00:57:30,859
Every single one!

1001
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:32,158
Don't go any further than that.

1002
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:56,518
What's with him? He keeps ticking me off.

1003
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,319
How dare he smile? Stop smiling, you jerk.

1004
00:58:04,058 --> 00:58:06,189
Man, that jerk.

1005
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:09,089
Gil Pyo, you should smoke outside.

1006
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:13,569
Man.

1007
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:17,868
Keep an eye on him.

1008
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:20,468
And let me know right away once Detective Nam calls.

1009
00:58:20,468 --> 00:58:21,509
Yes, sir.

1010
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:25,609
Do you think his words are...

1011
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:28,249
worth trusting?

1012
00:58:28,979 --> 00:58:30,479
I don't think he's lying.

1013
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,419
But we'll have to keep an eye on him.

1014
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:40,988
Why don't you have any instant coffee in the office?

1015
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:43,428
It means we can't spare any time to drink coffee.

1016
00:58:45,198 --> 00:58:47,198
You held out here for the last four years?

1017
00:58:48,129 --> 00:58:49,428
I didn't hold out.

1018
00:58:49,428 --> 00:58:51,268
I've been working well with pride.

1019
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:53,439
I went to Mapo Police Station after getting a call...

1020
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:54,908
that they might have a story.

1021
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:57,379
When I went there, I saw a guy named Gu Young Chun.

1022
00:58:57,779 --> 00:58:59,979
He was there as a suspect for murdering sex workers.

1023
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:03,419
This guy first said he killed and buried many young women,

1024
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:04,879
then insisted he didn't.

1025
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:07,319
He went on to say he remembers where he buried them, then not.

1026
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:09,089
He kept talking nonsense.

1027
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:12,589
Then he also said he killed the elderly too.

1028
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:15,229
Isn't that weird?

1029
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:16,959
Then three detectives of the Seoul Agency...

1030
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:18,729
dragged that man together and left.

1031
00:59:18,928 --> 00:59:21,268
That's why I had no choice but to come down here.

1032
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:23,638
I gave a thought...

1033
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:25,939
on Gu Young Chun.

1034
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:28,268
Do you think...

1035
00:59:29,308 --> 00:59:30,479
he's the one?

1036
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:36,749
Don't you want to know where I buried them?

1037
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:44,689
Isn't that why you brought me here?

1038
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:48,759
- What happened? - Not yet.

1039
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:50,799
I think we're almost done.

1040
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:51,859
We're still waiting.

1041
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:54,569
Let's check the bodies first.

1042
00:59:54,569 --> 00:59:55,729
What do you mean?

1043
00:59:58,198 --> 00:59:59,598
Seven. Eleven.

1044
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:01,868
What? Eighteen people?

1045
01:00:01,868 --> 01:00:04,279
- What? - That crazy jerk.

1046
01:00:04,538 --> 01:00:07,348
Killed seven after breaking and entering a house?

1047
01:00:07,348 --> 01:00:08,779
Abducted and killed 11 women?

1048
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:11,279
Could he be the same guy?

1049
01:00:11,479 --> 01:00:13,118
If he changed the MO, then it's possible.

1050
01:00:13,118 --> 01:00:15,348
MO? Are you talking about the method of his crime?

1051
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:16,419
You're right.

1052
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:19,158
If he wanted to feel something stronger,

1053
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,189
there's a good chance that his MO could change.

1054
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:23,859
Do you think he's the culprit for all those cases?

1055
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:25,359
I doubt it.

1056
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,499
No, we can't come to any conclusion right now.

1057
01:00:28,828 --> 01:00:30,799
Let's check everything one after the other.

1058
01:00:31,038 --> 01:00:32,138
Wait.

1059
01:00:32,138 --> 01:00:34,069
It doesn't matter if he's the same guy or not.

1060
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:36,979
If what he said is true, this is a serious situation.

1061
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:39,238
Make sure you keep this highly confidential. Understood?

1062
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:42,178
And you should go with Forensics.

1063
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:43,618
I'll go now.

1064
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:45,479
Find out if he really buried those women.

1065
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:46,518
Okay.

1066
01:00:49,288 --> 01:00:51,759
- Man. - How can he do this?

1067
01:00:52,988 --> 01:00:54,288
How is this possible?

1068
01:00:55,158 --> 01:00:56,399
Why? What's wrong?

1069
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,899
- What's with him? - What's wrong?

1070
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,169
Hey, Gu Young Chun!

1071
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:04,468
Gu Young Chun, wake up!

1072
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:05,839
- What's with him? - What?

1073
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,038
- Gu Young Chun. - His head.

1074
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,538
- Tilt his head. - Give me a pen.

1075
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:11,879
What's with this jerk?

1076
01:01:14,149 --> 01:01:15,249
Man.

1077
01:01:15,979 --> 01:01:17,279
Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

1078
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:19,419
Let's call one if he doesn't calm down in five minutes.

1079
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:20,788
What did you do?

1080
01:01:20,788 --> 01:01:22,649
I didn't do anything.

1081
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:24,689
Wake up! Gu Young Chun!

1082
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,229
Get up. Hey.

Do you have epilepsy?

1088
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:06,499
You still have to go to the scene.

1089
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:16,169
We're ready.

1090
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:20,109
Can you let me...

1091
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,018
breathe in fresh air one last time?

1092
01:02:27,718 --> 01:02:28,848
Put the cuffs on him.

1093
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:48,209
I want to use the toilet.

1094
01:02:48,209 --> 01:02:50,839
Gosh. Do you think this is a hotel?

1096

Hey! Catch him!

1101
01:03:29,078 --> 01:03:30,118
Take that. And...

1102
01:03:30,149 --> 01:03:31,948
Hey! Catch Gu Young Chun!

1103
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,488
Hurry! Catch Gu Young Chun!

1104
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:44,729
Gu Young Chun!

1105

Hey! Stop him!

Go! Hurry up!

1108
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,558
Catch him!

1109
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,788
Catch that jerk.

1110
01:04:42,919 --> 01:04:43,919
Where did he go?

1111
01:04:44,988 --> 01:04:46,158
I'll go that way.

1112
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:50,299
If we lose this guy, we'll be in big trouble.

1113
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:53,098
Give out the wanted posters. And locate him as soon as possible.

1114
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,768
We must be discreet for now.

1115
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:56,428
So let's say he committed theft.

1116
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,968
Yes. Let's do that. I assigned resources for you.

1117
01:04:58,968 --> 01:05:01,738
Focus on searching subway stations, train stations, bus terminals,

1118
01:05:01,738 --> 01:05:02,808
and any easy access points to run away.

1119
01:05:02,808 --> 01:05:04,879
- Yes, sir. - Okay. Go on. Now!

1120
01:05:05,009 --> 01:05:06,578
- Hurry up. - Okay.

1121
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,249
I'm sending them out now.

1122
01:05:26,029 --> 01:05:28,868
Get the posters. Go to restaurants, motels, saunas,

1123
01:05:28,868 --> 01:05:31,468
and coffee shops. Just put them up everywhere.

1124
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:34,238
So every citizen in Seoul can recognize this jerk's face.

1125
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:35,709
- Got it? - Yes, sir.

1126
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:38,178
Let me emphasize again. This is an emergency!

1127
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:40,649
If we don't catch him, we'll be humiliated!

1128

- Got it? - Yes, sir.

1129
01:05:41,779 --> 01:05:43,178
Run. Go out now!

1130
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:44,448
- Go. - Go!

1131
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:49,448
- Come on. - I'm sorry.

- No. - Call us if you do.

1135
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:57,799
Sure.

(Through the Darkness, Part 2)

1138
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:21,669
I know today was a busy day.

1139
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:23,038
You don't need to prepare a birthday meal for me.

1140
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:26,509
What are you talking about? I want to.

1141
01:08:27,078 --> 01:08:28,478
It wasn't much of work.

1142
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:33,179
To me, your birthday is as important as your dad's memorial day.

1143
01:08:37,858 --> 01:08:39,019
Happy birthday.

1144
01:08:40,828 --> 01:08:42,288
It must've been difficult to raise me alone.

1145
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,028
So thank you.

1146
01:08:46,228 --> 01:08:48,099
No, I should thank you.

1147
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:53,639
I wouldn't have been able to get through it without you.

1148
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:57,408
I am proud...

1149
01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:00,179
of you...

1150
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:03,209

look into people's hearts better than anyone.

1152
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:12,019

1153
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:14,328
You know that, right?

1154
01:09:15,228 --> 01:09:16,288
Yes.

1155
01:09:24,639 --> 01:09:25,938
Good morning.

1156
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:29,809
You're here.

1157
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,049
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1158

- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

1159
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:40,118
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

1160
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:43,688
- Happy birthday, dear Ha Young - Happy birthday, dear Ha Young

1161
01:09:45,059 --> 01:09:46,788
Gosh. This is so delicious.

1162
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:47,959
- Dig in. - Hey.

1163
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:49,929
Your mother is an excellent cook.

1164
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:50,999
Gosh, it's just some food.

1165
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:52,328
We're feasting thanks to you.

1166
01:09:52,358 --> 01:09:53,528
This chocolate looks great.

1167
01:09:54,169 --> 01:09:55,429
- Well... - That's expensive.

1168
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:56,728
It was 35 dollars.

1169
01:09:56,728 --> 01:09:59,238
I like this. It's gotten so small.

1170
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:01,538
You don't need tapes now. Just charge that.

1171
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:03,009
- Really? - Can you hear it?

1172
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:06,009
Hello. Check. This is great.

1173
01:10:06,009 --> 01:10:07,908
We got it. It's the hill in Nojin-dong.

1174
01:10:07,908 --> 01:10:10,478
- Right here! I found it. - Here too!

1175
01:10:10,478 --> 01:10:11,618
Here too!

1176
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:14,019

How's Captain Yoon?

1178
01:10:16,318 --> 01:10:17,818
Did you even help her, Song Ha Young?

1179
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:18,988
Why me?

1180
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:21,528
Why did you pick me for a position like this?

1181
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:24,299
To get what I want, I must fully understand my target.

1182
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:25,858
Song Ha Young, what are you doing? Are you going?

1183
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:28,328
To do that, I must become Gu Young Chun now.

1184
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:30,228
I am you now.
