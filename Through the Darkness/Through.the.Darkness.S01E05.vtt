1
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:06,898
(The drama was based on a book, and all people, organizations,)

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,453
(locations, and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,876
(It was filmed in accordance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:12,533
(The crime-related scenes were staged.)

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,785
(This drama may contain disturbing and brutal scenes.)

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,331
Right before the Chuseok holidays...

7
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:18,670
I'm sorry I was late. There was heavy traffic.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,870
No, it's fine. You picked me up when I had just gotten out.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,140
Hey, my cousin got married pretty late.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,010
So everyone at the wedding cried.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,151
And my mother wanted to pack up some food from the buffet.

12
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,581
Look at all this food she packed for me. My goodness.

13
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:34,391
This sure makes us feel like normal people, doesn't it?

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,590
I went to a wedding on Saturday.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,590
And we're stuck downtown in the middle of a congested road.

16
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,090
It'd be perfect if only we weren't headed to a prison.

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,200
Seoul Tollgate announced that cars leaving Seoul...

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,901
Hey. How do office workers wear ties every day?

19
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:48,571
This is so suffocating.

20
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,171
And the Honam Expressway...

21
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:52,840
Gosh. Maybe, I should have brought some clothes to change into.

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,740
Do you want to switch shoes at least?

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,111
- No, it's okay. - By tonight...

24
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,641
- Do you want some rice cakes? - What?

25
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,810
- Open your mouth. - I'm good.

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,921
- Open up. - It's expected to take longer.

27
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:05,820
- There. Chew it. - Hello, everyone.

28
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,650
Yes. That's it.

29
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:09,751
Let's go.

30
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,790
(Seoul Detention Center)

31
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,160
- Gosh. Isn't it nice? - Gosh.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,001
It does look big and nice.

33
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,471
I spent two months' salary on this.

34
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:21,800
It better look fancy.

35
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,141
You're spending more than you're earning.

36
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,371
You need the right tools to put your skills to use.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,111
Hey, this kind of looks lame.

38
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,311
I'll put it away.

39
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,380
But I'm more comfortable with it. Let me use it.

40
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,050
- You want to? - Yes.

41
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,081
- Okay, it's all yours. - Thank you.

42
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:37,650
All right. Hold on.

43
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,550
This should be...

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,921
Should we put this here?

45
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,520
(Keep quiet)

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,231
Inmate 4709, you have visitors.

47
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,460
Who's here?

48
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,740
Look at him dusting off his feet again. Gosh.

49
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,111
- That fool. - Just go, will you?

50
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,781
- Idiot. - Gosh, seriously.

51
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,111
(Do not flush leftovers down the toilet.)

52
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:08,451
- Hurry up. The officer is waiting. - Goodness.

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,911
Gosh, that fool.

54
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,381
- I'm sorry, man. - What? What the...

55
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,990
You can't blindside me like this.

56
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,250
I can't even stand the way he walks.

57
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,691
- Goodness. - That idiot.

58
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,261
What's with him?

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,180
Well, we're not here to interrogate you, so relax.

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,821
Did you put on a suit to meet me?

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,050
Why do you ask?

62
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,120
I feel special.

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,470
But it's all over now, isn't it?

64
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,240
Do you think it's over?

65
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,970
You caught me.

66
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,970
Mr. Cho, we still have...

67
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,541
many questions for you.

68
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,511
But I told you everything last time.

69
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,180
That lady too. I told her everything.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,780
She is a detective, not a "lady."

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,891
We want to hear more about you, not about the case.

72
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,060
You could tell us about your childhood...

73
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,131
or how you feel. Feel free to tell us anything.

74
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:38,101
It's just for our record, so don't worry about it.

75
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,571
Right.

76
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,381
Well... Is there anything you'd like to tell us?

77
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,411
It's okay. You can tell us anything.

78
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,921
You're not interrogating me, but you want to hear my story?

79
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:56,150
- That's right. - No one wants to hear my story.

80
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,990
- What's your reason? - We visited your place.

81
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,530
My place?

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,090
Yes, it was very clean.

83
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,060
Everything was neatly organized,

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,131
even your socks.

85
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,300
I don't like it when things are messy.

86
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,770
I know.

87
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,181
So you must be having a hard time here.

88
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,581
Right?

89
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,811
Every day, you have to eat and sleep...

90
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,980
right next to strangers who committed all sorts of crimes.

91
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,920
It must be awful.

92
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,621
It is awful.

93
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:32,590
So...

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,931
why don't you...

95
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:36,761
tell us more about yourself?

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,631
The people here...

97
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,670
probably think that you're like them and treat you as one of them.

98
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,470
But in our eyes,

99
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,270
you seem a little different.

100
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,811
Well...

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,081
They don't even wash themselves often.

102
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,081
They stink, and the cell is small and filthy.

103
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,020
It's really driving me crazy.

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,020
Right, I'm sure.

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,891
So this was what we were wondering.

106
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,131
Perhaps you...

107
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,871
didn't actually intend to kill Soo Hyun...

108
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:17,371
That's right, I...

109
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,371
I never intended to kill her.

110
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,210
That is why we want to hear your story.

111
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,980
To find out exactly how different you are from the others.

112
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,520
You look like you've lost quite a bit of weight.

113
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,860
Have you been eating well?

114
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,900
Then why don't we...

115
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,571
eat something first before we start talking?

116
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,371
How are you feeling?

117
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,141
I got to have a proper meal for a change.

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,540
I wish every day was like today.

119
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,051
Do you regret it?

120
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,150
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

121
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,590
Are you talking about Soo Hyun? What exactly do you mean by that?

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,991
Blame her bad luck.

123
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,770
It's Soo Hyun.

124
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,801
Her name.

125
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,540
Lee Soo Hyun.

126
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,410
Had she not come to that place that day,

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,410
nothing would have happened to her or me.

128
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,280
Do you think...

129
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
it's Soo Hyun's fault that you ended up like this?

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,321
It is her fault for catching my attention.

131
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,691
I wonder what was on his mind...

132
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,821
as Cho Hyun Gil was watching such an innocent child.

133
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,431
Why does he feel differently from the rest of us?

134
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,100
Are you from Samcheonpo?

135
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,540
I don't hear an accent though.

136
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,811
I moved to Seoul when I was 15.

137
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,350
In eighth grade?

138
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,951
I didn't go to middle school.

139
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,220
I started working as soon as I graduated from elementary school.

140
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,251
What kind of work?

141
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,191
I worked at factories,

142
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,160
sold fish, and worked at butcher shops.

143
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,331
I did everything I was told to do.

144
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:33,730
I had to work all sorts of jobs too.

145
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,600
My family was very poor when I was young.

146
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,510
Since I'm the eldest son,

147
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,240
I had to help my parents on their farm...

148
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,681
and sell our harvest.

149
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,610
I did all sorts of things.

150
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,551
Detective, what did you say your name was?

151
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,151
My name?

152
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,821
I'm Kook Young Soo.

153
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:59,760
Detective Kook, then did you also quit school after elementary school?

154
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:04,860
I entered middle school a year later than everyone else.

155
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,171
I see. At least you went to middle school.

156
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,271
- You think you two are different? - What do you mean?

157
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,171
You were both poor, and both of you struggled.

158
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,610
But he attended middle school, so his situation was different.

159
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,581
My life could've turned out differently too.

160
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,051
Do you think that's why you ended up becoming a criminal?

161
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,691
Because you had to quit school?

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,031
Well...

163
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:41,831
I...

164
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,470
- Detective. - Yes.

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,870
Can you get me a soda?

166
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,740
I have a habit of drinking one after every meal.

167
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,500
(Please keep this cubicle clean.)

168
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,421
(If you have a dream, you can start afresh.)

169
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,250
(Korea Correctional Service)

170
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,970
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

171
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,201
Blame her bad luck.

172
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:24,771
Hey.

173
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,541
- Are you all right? - Of course.

174
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,370
Let's go.

175
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,720
You quit smoking.

176
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,490
Yes, what's up?

177
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,321
Why do you carry a lighter around?

178
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:49,890
Oh, this thing?

179
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:52,331
For emergencies.

180
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,671
I'm sure there will come a day when I'll crave a smoke.

181
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,441

so let us do this for just one more year.

187
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,701
Yes, there's our proposal.

195

- Sure. - Okay.

309
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,461
If you knew Kim Bong Sik was coming as our new chief,

310
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,561
you of all people could've let me know.

311
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,660
I thought you'd only get stressed if I told you ahead of time.

312
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,501
Also, nothing would change anyway.

313
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,241
Nothing could be changed,

314
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,011
so I happened to be the only one who didn't know?

315
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,870
No, that's not what I meant.

Well...

317
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,680
There's no need for you to apologize.

319
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,021
Forget it.

320
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,090
It probably wasn't easy for you either.

321
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,761

322
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,930
Back when they were at Jungbu Station,

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,200

00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:52,311
don't they?

(Hwang Dae Sun, rape and mutilation murderer)

328
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,481
Why are you back?

329
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:04,390
We still do not understand why you committed these crimes, Mr. Hwang.

330
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,590
(Keep quiet)

331
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,021
So we came...

332
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,390
to hear the story of your life, Mr. Hwang.

333
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,491
What story?

334
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,900
Well, can you share the stories of your childhood?

335
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,301
What will you do with the stories of my unfortunate childhood?

336
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,640
I guess you had lots of bad memories.

337
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,140
In that case,

338
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,211
can you tell me one thing that made you the angriest?

339
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,011
It's my dad.

340
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,521
He always beat me up without a reason.

341
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:39,620
He'd beat me up during meals,

342
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,991
and beat me for going to school.

343
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,991
There were days when I actually skipped school...

344
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,400
because he hurt me so badly.

345
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,831
Whenever he beat me, he stripped me down to my underwear,

346
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,100
then kicked me out of the house.

347
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,910
So I sat in front of the gate.

348
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,281
So if your neighborhood friends saw you,

349
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,650
they would've teased you a lot.

350
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,450
Kids would make fun of me until I went to middle school.

351
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,991
I'd beat them up too.

352
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,090
I never hung out with them.

353
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:15,291
Those emotions must have been tough on you.

354
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,761
And it must've been embarrassing that you weren't wearing clothes.

355
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,571
How did you usually deal with your anger?

356
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,571
There wasn't much I could do as a kid.

357
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,011
All I could do was kill animals because they couldn't talk.

358
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,781
I killed my next-door neighbor's cow with a sickle.

359
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,610
I caught a dog in my neighborhood...

360
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:39,321
and watched it jump and bark in the hot, boiling water.

361
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,821
Watching that got me off.

362
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,321
My father stripped me and kicked me out countless times.

363
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,160
So I still hate it when my body is exposed.

364
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,501
It infuriates me.

365
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:57,630
No matter how hot it is, I never wear shorts or short sleeves.

366
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,271
After you killed animals,

367
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,241
did you dismember them too?

368
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,071
Sometimes.

369
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,880
I tried cutting them up.

370
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,551
I learned cooking at a restaurant.

371
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:11,981
Using a knife to cut them into pieces was fun.

372
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,590
Your second female victim.

373
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,291
Is that why you cut off the flesh on her leg...

374
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,791
after you raped and murdered her?

375
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,561
I don't know.

376
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,130
I wanted to cut it off when she was alive.

377
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,071
But she kept moving, and her blood splattered.

378
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,370
So I stopped for a bit.

379
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:36,440
After I killed her,

380
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,311
I sat next to her and tried to cut it off again.

381
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:47,120
But I don't remember much because I was drunk.

382
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,521
Then you took it home.

383
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,521
But no one saw you?

384
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,890
It was dripping in blood.

385
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,130
I bet it must've scared people.

386
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:58,761
Why? They wouldn't know what it was.

387
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,461
I thought it was meat for a second...

388
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,001
when I woke up the next day.

389
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,971
Which one is it? You don't remember? Or you don't want to talk to us?

390
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,110
It's both.

391
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,051
Must I tell you everything?

392
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:21,051
You said it wasn't an interrogation.

393
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,991
(Implement an improved reform system for the future)

394
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:28,961
- Good day. - Good day.

395
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,430
Hwang Dae Sun definitely shows the behaviors of serial killers.

396
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,370
Right. But why do you think he cut off the flesh on her leg?

397
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,340
It looks like he didn't know either.

398
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,711
I think his rage against his abusive father...

399
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,711
developed into abnormal sexual behaviors.

400
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,811
Then his rage caused him to mutilate the body too.

401
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Right.

402
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,781
Gosh.

403
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,650
Many organizations are trying to support flood victims...

404
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,791
from Typhoon Maemi which struck the Korean Peninsula pretty hard.

405
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,630
The civic organizations...

406
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:05,961
How may I help you?

407
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,900
(No smoking)

408
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,541
Is this the Behavioral Analysis Team?

409
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,110
- Yes. - Where's Song Ha Young?

410
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:22,110
Inspector Song? He's out for an interview.

411
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,781
"Inspector"?

412
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,350
Should I tell him you stopped by when he comes back?

413
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:30,690
("Sky, Wind, Star, and Poetry" by Yun Dong Ju)

414
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,521
He hasn't changed.

415
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,001
What brings you here?

416
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,461
Don't mind me.

417
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,130
Get back to work.

418
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,910
It's like nothing ever happened. This isn't fair.

419
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,450
What?

420
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,481
The weather.

421
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,021
The weather can't be this good. It's cheating.

422
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,221
The pain and sense of loss.

423
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:09,561
The suffering...

424
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:13,130
is only up to the victims to bear.

425
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,531
I bet some people are enjoying this good weather.

426
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,551
All right.

427
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,850
He's not even investigating the case. Why is he reading...

428
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,360
the case reports for the detectives?

429
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,930
Seriously. This nosy jerk.

430
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:44,491
Hey. When he comes back, I'll tell him you were...

431
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:45,561
You!

432
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,600
"Hey"?

433
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,571
Read what it says on my name card.

434
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,571
"Special Crime Squad Chief, Kim Bong Sik."

435
00:25:57,571 --> 00:25:59,041
Are you blind?

436
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,751
You seem to have picked up bad habits from Song Ha Young.

438
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,551
You're still wet behind your ears.

439
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,620
No, I just mean this is the office for the Behavioral Analysis Team.

440
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,321
You need to tell me why you are here.

441
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,991
You are going to make me repeat myself.

442
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,160
You just mind your own business!

443
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:19,930
I'm back.

444
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,231
Have you been well, Assistant Inspector Song?

445
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,640
Right. I heard you're an inspector now. Inspector Song.

446
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,870
Goodness. You seem well.

447
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:34,281
What do you guys do here? Why are you dressed up?

448
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:36,850
Why are you here?

449
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,120
I don't expect you to give me a warm welcome.

450
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,150
But it's only polite to say hello when you see your superior.

451
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,150
Don't you agree?

452
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,620
Seriously. This team is full of rude punks.

453
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,791
Hello. I'm Statistics Analyst Jung Woo Ju.

454
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,160
Statistics analyst?

455
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,900
You guys have difficult titles here.

456
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,531
Dumb people won't be able to remember them.

457
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,670
What was it called?

458
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:00,471
Right. A profiler.

459
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:05,211
If you need to talk to me, let's talk outside.

460
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:08,311
I have nothing to say to you in private.

461
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:10,910
I just wanted to say hello since I was in the building.

462
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,021
And I wanted to check out what you do here.

463
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,690
Why is the door open? Did...

464
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,590
It's been a while, Captain Kook.

465
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,860
I've been transferred to the Special Crime Squad today.

466
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:25,231
We'll be running into each other a lot.

467
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,860
I look forward to working with you.

468
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,771
- Okay. - It was nice to see everyone.

469
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,900
Right. I bought this for you.

470
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,640
I almost forgot.

471
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,781
You still eat chocolates like a little kid, right?

472
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,650
We'll be seeing each other every day even if you don't want to.

473
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,961
Let's put our past behind us.

474
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,491
See you around.

475
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,860
All right.

476
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:04,301
Who was that?

477
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:07,400
Just as I heard, he's one rude cop.

478
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,910
I was wondering how great his career was going...

479
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:17,711
after he stabbed me, his mentor, in the back.

480
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,920
You've got to be kidding me. An inspector?

481
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:40,900
(November 1996)

482
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,840
Search every nook and cranny of the neighborhood.

483
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,821
He's wearing a black jacket with a hoodie and black sneakers.

484
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:53,821
Find him now!

485
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:20,311
I'm chasing a man who fits the description.

486
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,950
I'm sorry. I lost him.

487
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,880
Yoon Tae Gu, where are you?

488
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,521
Where are you?

489
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,011
Let go of me.

490
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,890
Gosh.

491
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Darn it.

492
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,241
Jung Soo Chan.

493
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,301
You're under arrest...

494
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:56,541
for robbery, murder, and fleeing.

495
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,811
You have the right to consult an attorney...

496
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,081
- and to remain silent. - Get him!

497
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,450
Gosh.

498
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,650
Did you catch him?

499
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,090
Gosh. You really are a detective now.

500
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,190
Hey. We got him.

501
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,890
Don't stand there. Get him.

502
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,360
Yoon Tae Gu caught Jung Soo Chan.

503
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,531
Nice, Detective Yoon.

504
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,100
She got him.

505
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,541
This punk.

506
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:29,241
You set an example for your fellow officers...

507
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:32,011
by promptly arresting a robbery and murder suspect...

508
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:34,541
who was on the run after committing a brutal crime.

509
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,850
Hence, I hereby award...

510
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,311
Inspector Yoon Tae Gu.

511
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:42,950
(Special Promotion Ceremony)

512
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,630
Yoon Tae Gu!

513
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,700
- Come on. Let's shout together. - Tae Gu, you rock.

514
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,640
- Well done! - Go, Yoon Tae Gu!

515
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,380
Oh, my. You really look like a cop now.

516
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,981
Who knew you'd last this long? I thought you'd quit to get married.

517
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:08,981
- Come on. - She's so cool.

518
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:10,751
At this rate, you'll be promoted to commissioner in no time.

519
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,380
- For sure. - Tae Gu can definitely do that.

520
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,920
Could you take a photo of us?

521
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,721
- Sure! - Can we join?

522
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,090
You even got a special promotion thanks to Song Ha Young.

523
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,961
I'm surprised you're holding out so well, Yoon Tae Gu.

524
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,930
Okay, let's try that one more time.

525
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,370
Nice, that looks great. Make a V.

526
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,551
Captain.

527
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,751
- Captain Yoon. - Yes.

528
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,920
Superintendent Baek wants to meet with you.

529
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,950
Superintendent Baek? Why?

530
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,090
I have no idea.

531
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,860
He asked for Chief Kim Bong Sik too,

532
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,261
but I don't know where he is now.

533
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:57,031
Cheers.

534
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,961
It's nice to have you back.

535
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,440
You're the only one who's happy to see me,

536
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:10,271
so I'm not sure whether or not I've been doing well so far.

537
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:13,840
Come on. I really meant it. Must you twist my words like this?

538
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,850
What you need is my intel, not me.

539
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,680
That's what makes you indispensable.

540
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Anyway, pretend not to know me when you see me at HQ.

541
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,920
Goodness. Don't you worry.

542
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,061
Life is full of ironies.

543
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,590
Song Ha Young and even Yoon Tae Gu.

544
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,491
Who knew I'd meet them again here?

545
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Is this fate or something?

546
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:37,071
Did you meet Inspector Song Ha Young?

547
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Yes, I sure did.

548
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,640
I can't figure out what his team does.

549
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,471
When you stab someone in the back, it all comes back to you...

550
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,481
Darn it. There's one exception.

551
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,511
Who? You?

552
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,110
You little...

553
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:56,190
Remember? The head prosecutor...

554
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,251
who asked for Yoon Tae Gu back then.

555
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,590
(Head Prosecutor Lee Dong Ju)

556
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,620
Here.

557
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:04,630
It's classified information, so don't reveal your source.

558
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,961
Investigate it alone, quietly.

559
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,001
This is credible info, right?

560
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,600
Have I ever lied to you?

561
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,501
Go through it. There's solid evidence too.

562
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,211
Why did I miss all this?

563
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:21,140
Yoon Tae Gu is one of your direct reports, right?

564
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,381
Yes, sir.

565
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,981
- Hello. - Where is Room Ten?

566
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,751
It's this way. You'll find it on your left.

567
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,450
Yoon Tae Gu.

568
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,050
I mean, Detective Yoon.

569
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,561
We're now getting the hang of working together as a team,

570
00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:37,131
and you worked hard on this case,

571
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,530
so I want to buy you a drink.

572
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,731
Hurry up and meet me here, okay?

573
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:43,200
- I'm telling you. - My goodness.

574
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh, there she is. Come on in.

575
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,901
You made it. Take a seat.

576
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:49,611
Come on. Take a seat.

577
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,611
Come on!

578
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,611
Hey, where are you going?

579
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:55,441
Are you a bar girl or what?

580
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,550
Goodness, it's such a hot mess.

581
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,550
How dare you disgrace the entire police force?

582
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,651
- Detective Yoon, this is nuts. - How embarrassing.

583
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,191
Remember? The head prosecutor...

584
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,720
who asked for Yoon Tae Gu back then.

585
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,361
I ended up taking bribes...

586
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,961
from a building contractor against my will...

587
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,800
and arrested a fake suspect.

588
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,570
Because of that, I was branded a corrupt cop.

589
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,100
Everything was set up so he'd look like the real culprit.

590
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,501
Anyone would have believed it.

591
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:23,010
Song Ha Young didn't buy it!

592
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,311
That punk really gets on my nerves.

593
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:27,640
He has to get in the way of everything I do.

594
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,450
I got demoted because of that jerk.

595
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,711
But you're back now.

596
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,850
Song Ha Young was branded...

597
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,390
a backstabbing troublemaker...

598
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,620
who betrays his superiors.

599
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,120
That's why he's working in that dump of an office now.

600
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,561
That's not enough.

601
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,030
He acts like a gentleman to your face...

602
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,831
but skims the cream off the top behind your back.

603
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:49,800
Everyone needs to know that.

604
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,831
Bong Sik.

605
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:54,771
I'll only trust Chief Kim Bong Sik, who's back in Seoul now.

606
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,311
Why would you trust me? Don't trust anyone.

607
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,640
Goodness, you're hurting my feelings here.

608
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,211
You don't even trust me?

609
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:03,211
You little...

610
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,091
By the way, the Suseong-dong case in Gangnam.

611
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,120
Who is the victim?

612
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,990
Those at Gangnam Police Station are keeping it on the hush-hush.

613
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,861
Hey, today is my first day.

614
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,331
You must've heard something, even just in passing.

615
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,200
Can I please eat first?

616
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,800
Captain Yoon, you're here.

617
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,740
- I heard you asked for me. - What? You came alone?

618
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,341
Is Bong Sik not at his desk?

619
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,841
Detectives must be ready to mobilize at all times.

620
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,180
Today is his first day, and we can't even reach him?

621
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,211
Darn it.

622
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,021
We need you to take on this case.

623
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,981
The victim is Han Seok Hoon,

624
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,720
an economics professor at Hankuk University.

625
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,620
He and his wife were murdered in their home two weeks ago.

626
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,430
(Murder of Elderly Couple in Suseong-dong)

627
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,791
We need you to investigate it.

628
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,561
This case belongs to Gangnam Police Station.

629
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:56,901
It does fall under their jurisdiction,

630
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,800
but he's related to someone who is very high up.

631
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,541
I was asked to look into it quietly,

632
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,941
so that's all I know.

633
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:05,680
But I think they're struggling to find leads.

634
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,581
How do I find a phone number?

635
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,881
I think the reporters already caught a whiff of it.

636
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,680
The higher-ups want us...

637
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,320
to prevent further media coverage and investigate it swiftly.

638
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,021
Everyone at Gangnam Police Station will help you out.

639
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,791
Okay.

640
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:23,030
- I'll be off, then. - Okay.

641
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:24,691
There, I found it.

642
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,461
Look at this.

643
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:30,100
This punk, Kim Bong Sik. He's not picking up.

644
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,370
Is it an important case?

645
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,600
All homicide cases are equally important.

646
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:35,001
That's true.

647
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,441
Why are we investigating Gangnam Police Station's case?

648
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,180
We should go there to find out more.

649
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,140
- Chief Kim still isn't at his desk? - No.

650
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,611
People really don't change.

651
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:46,081
(September 29, 2003)

652
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,751
Are we leaving now? Just the two of us?

653
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,850
(Gungok-dong, Jongno)

654
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,751
(September 24, 2003)

655
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
No, please...

656
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:02,830
(Victim Han Seok Hoon, economics professor)

657
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,870
Darn it, this scumbag...

658
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,841
(Murder of Elderly Couple in Suseong-dong)

659
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:14,841
The victims of the murder of the couple in their 60s in Suseong-dong.

660
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:15,941
Han Seok Hoon,

661
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,310
a Hankuk University professor, and his wife.

662
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,450
I bet there's something about Professor Han Seok Hoon.

663
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,751
Gosh, seriously.

664
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:30,060
I told you not to say the victim's name.

665
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:33,660
Come on. You need to give me something to write about.

666
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,030
Loyalty isn't a one-way street.

667
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,171
They've been preserving the scene for over two weeks now.

668
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,470
There's definitely something.

669
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,041
Will you really not tell me anything?

670
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,140
Over here.

671
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:51,841
Good day.

672
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:53,481
I'm Yoon Tae Gu from the Seoul HQ.

673
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,211
- This is... - Nam Il Young, also from HQ.

674
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:57,051
Yes, they called me. This way, please.

675
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:58,481
- Okay. - Hey, tidy up here.

676
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,470
(Do Not Enter)

677
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:29,881
There was cash lying around, but he didn't even touch it.

678
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,651
They think it's an act of resentment masked as a burglary.

679
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,461
It's clean.

680
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,600
It means the victims were overpowered...

681
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,171
without any sort of resistance.

682
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,771
If they had resisted, the blood would have splattered...

683
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:56,680
to the ceiling because his weapon was swinging around.

684
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,481
You'll see that the victims' bodies are clean...

685
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:02,421
with no sign of defense when you get to the morgue later.

686
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,921
Gosh, I don't know what this horrifying guy hit them with.

687
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:09,291
We're trying our best to find out but weren't able to identify it yet.

688
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,990
He came into a rich house like this...

689
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,830
and he didn't touch the cash but only pretended to look for it.

690
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,490
Do you think he had a grudge against them?

691
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,330
We looked into that, but that seems highly unlikely.

692
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,231
Both husband and wife had a great reputation.

693
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,801
Their identities are accompanied by their social position.

694
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,611
So they may have incurred a grudge from someone without knowing.

695
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,541
You're saying it may be the doings of an acquaintance holding a grudge?

696
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,611
Shall we start by investigating around the school?

697
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,810
We already did.

698
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,151
Even if we consider this to be an act of resentment...

699
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:42,220
his method is too bold and violent.

700
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,760
Overkilling is common amongst murder targeting acquaintances.

701
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,691
I doubt that a mentally ill person...

702
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:49,461
could have casually walked into a house like this.

703
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,600
Could you please give us the list of acquaintances you interviewed?

704
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,801
Yes, I will.

705
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:58,100
Once you get the list, check to see if there's anyone...

706
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,941
with records of previous convictions and mental illness.

707
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,271
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,111
Why did a detective from Seoul HQ come to a case in Gangnam?

709
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Yes, sir?

710
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:13,850
Hey! Didn't I tell you to release first and fact check later?

711
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:15,551
An article has been released...

712
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,260
identifying the Suseong-dong victim as Professor Han Seok Hoon!

713
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,591
What?

714
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:23,030
You try to be respectful, conscientious, and even loyal.

715
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,001
So when do you plan on trying to get an exclusive?

762
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,461
Out of all the prisoners we've met until now,

763
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,301
Hwang Dae Sun is closest...

764
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,240
to the serial murderer category that we've been researching.

765
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,140
He can be viewed as a serial killer since he killed three people.

766
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,910
But to be exact, he ended up with three victims...

767
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,280
from two different cases.

768
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,541
He killed one out of impulse.

769
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,611
He may have been planning on murdering...

770
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:54,481
but it was one that derailed from his plans.

771
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:57,580
I see two were raped then murdered and the other was a man.

772
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,321
He had been drinking when committing both cases.

773
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:05,191
The man was the second victim's boyfriend.

774
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,461
Then the boyfriend was the target of his impulsive crime?

775
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:08,631
Exactly.

776
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:10,430
He was murdered...

777
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,001
when he came over to see his girlfriend and witnessed the rape.

778
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:16,771
All three victims were murdered while he was under the influence...

779
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:18,541
it must have been categorized as an unsystematic crime.

780
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,970
Just because he murdered when under the influence...

781
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,010
doesn't mean that it was an unsystematic crime.

782
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,580
An unsystematic crime...

783
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,111
is when the culprit becomes confused while committing the crime.

784
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,620
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun, we can interpret his acts of...

785
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,490
binding and carving out the skin, as abnormal sexual behaviors.

786
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,120
So it doesn't add up perfectly.

787
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,260
If you look at it according to the FBI's categories of crime...

788
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,691
a systematic type is someone who has problems with their personality.

789
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:41,830
An unsystematic type...

790
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,160
is categorized as someone delusional or schizophrenic.

791
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,571
With that in mind, Hwang Dae Sun...

792
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,700
isn't someone who has a mental illness...

793
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:52,740
but a systematic type with a personality disorder.

794
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:54,910
Gosh, this is really difficult.

795
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,611
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun, he showed systematic behavior...

796
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,251
in how he searched for his victim, planned, and bound them using tools.

797
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:02,151
I understand when you tell me...

798
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,620
I think the process of reasoning is always very difficult.

799
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,921
All right then.

800
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,321
I think the reason for Hwang Dae Sun's case is...

801
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,530
this one. Killing more than three.

802
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,530
Okay.

803
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:17,861
But I think it's more accurate to label it a rape and murder case...

804
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,001
which has more continuity to it.

805
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,470
Right, since he had a sexual purpose to it.

806
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:24,771
Right, but there was a bigger chance of him becoming...

807
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:26,810
a serial killer like in our study if he hadn't been caught.

808
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:30,140
I was shocked when I heard he killed animals as a kid.

809
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:33,211
It's a classic feature that a serial killer has.

810
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,910
He didn't have a cooling-off period though.

816
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,330
as Hankuk University's Professor Han Seok Hoon.

817
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,330
Not only did Professor Han...

818
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,501
teach economics at the university,

819
00:46:57,501 --> 00:47:00,841
but he also appeared on TV often to give his economical insights.

820
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:03,981
His bold attitude led to his popularity.

821
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,180
But does there always have to be a psychological cooling-off period?

822
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,220
Serial killers feel the highest form of pleasure...

823
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,720
in the pure act of killing.

824
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,751
Once that feeling ends,

825
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,751
they look for another victim who will satisfy their need.

826
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,921
To put it simply, a cooling-off period...

827
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,961
is a period where their sense of fulfillment and satisfaction...

828
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:21,591
from the murder continues to last.

829
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:23,930
Once that psychological satisfaction comes to an end...

830
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,961
they'll move on to the next murder.

831
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:27,271
Then what about Hwang Dae Sun?

832
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,501
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun,

833
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,301
we can't view those periods as a cooling-off period...

834
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:33,041
since he was under the influence for all the cases.

835
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:37,211
But the fact that they murder again once the cooling-off period ends...

836
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,140
is so horrifying.

837
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,510

A type of systematic crime committed according to a plan.

892
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:58,941
The crime is too cruel and daring to conclude...

893
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:01,381
that it was done by an acquaintance.

894
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:06,450
(Jinjung-dong, Gangnam)

895
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:14,560
The culprit did not take any money or valuables.

896
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,671
Who is it?

897
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:25,671
(Disguised as robbery...)

898
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,611
(Theft, valuables, not taken. Holding a grudge?)

899
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,350
- Who is it? - Is somebody here?

900
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,881
Yes, but I don't hear anything.

901
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:39,791
It must be a prank.

902
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,620
Goodnight.

903
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,660
That's odd. Okay. Goodnight.

904
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,660
Night.

905
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,930
(Disguised as robbery, presumed as an acquaintance with a grudge)

906
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,390
But is there someone...

907
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,200
who is an ex-convict around Professor Han?

908
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,071
Is this a way of expressing...

909
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:56,970
the culprit's emotions caused by a grudge they hold?

910
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:47,191

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

916
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,450
Are you coming to work just now?

917
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,720
Yes.

918
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,220
What happened at the crime scene yesterday?

919
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,890
I thought you weren't interested. Are you actually curious?

920
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,861
I'll tell you once we're inside.

921
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,930
You got a lot bolder, Tae Gu.

922
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,560
You still have that feisty charm.

923
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,631
I do not want your evaluation of my charms.

924
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,740
I hope we can just carry out our duties...

925
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,271
without getting in each other's ways.

926
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:42,410
You know how important teamwork is...

927
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,541
when it comes to violent crimes.

928
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,211
How can you only do your duty and end it there?

929
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:50,551
Tae Gu, do you still have a grudge against me?

930
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,051
A grudge?

931
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:58,890
You're quite delusional.

932
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,791
I do not have any feelings about you.

933
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,030
I'm sorry about that.

934
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,841
But everyone already knows that I'm a big jerk.

935
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,041
Right?

936
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,041
I was also aware of how you were a jerk too.

937
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,111
Isn't that so?

938
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,080
Let's go inside.

939
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,551
I should not stop the ace of the Special Crime Squad.

940
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,111
Shall I, then?

941
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,751
Gosh, heartburn.

942
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:30,299
You still think you can do this job by keeping loyalty...

943
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:32,299
even after three years you spent here.

944
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:33,874
What should I do with you?

945
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:35,104
You know how strict...

946
00:55:35,104 --> 00:55:36,945
Detective Kang and Park are.

947
00:55:37,074 --> 00:55:38,374
I'm sure Moo Sik...

948
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:40,485
won't get any information from Gangnam Police Station anymore.

949
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:42,485
Detective Park isn't the only detective there.

950
00:55:43,045 --> 00:55:44,854
If anyone leaks information to Daehan Daily,

951
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,724
it all turns into Im Moo Sik's article,

952
00:55:46,724 --> 00:55:49,525
while you're sitting around depending on Detective Park.

953
00:55:49,525 --> 00:55:50,824
Moo Sik...

954
00:55:50,824 --> 00:55:52,655
even steals articles from juniors?

955
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:54,865
Man, talk about lack of conscience.

956
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,135
Yes, conscience.

957
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:58,894
You'll starve to death after keeping your conscience.

958
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:02,565
I've been running around a lot trying not to starve to death.

959
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,445
Okay, sure. You work so hard. You're very commendable, aren't you?

960
00:56:06,744 --> 00:56:09,074
My diligent boss is doing a great job at making me slave away.

961
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,144
Forget it.

962
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:12,775
Go out and find an item that'll become as good a story...

963
00:56:12,945 --> 00:56:14,514
as the one you had stolen.

964
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,315
It wasn't ours anyway. What do you mean it was stolen?

965
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:21,684
It's Detective Park.

966
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:26,095
Another case at Gangnam Police Station.

967
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:27,224
- Again? - Yes.

968
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:30,635
Hey, Reporter Choi, keep it up. Run!

969
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:33,604
Forget all about your conscience and loyalty!

970
00:56:33,604 --> 00:56:35,835
Reporter Choi, get us just one good story!

971
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:38,934
Keep up the good work, then.

972
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,945
Man, I like how big this office is.

973
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:54,755
Are you satisfied with the result of your first duty on the job?

974
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:57,425
Captain Kook already did all the work.

975
00:56:57,425 --> 00:56:59,025
If I just sit there taking up someone's spot,

976
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:02,095
think of how awkward I'd feel.

977
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:06,604
So what will they do with all that information?

978
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:08,365
No idea.

979
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:10,335
He said he'll use it as his pillow or something.

980
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:15,445
I'm sure Captain Kook will make good use of everything.

981
00:57:24,284 --> 00:57:26,755
Make sure you check and take everything as needed!

982
00:57:26,755 --> 00:57:27,885
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

983
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,925
- In Tak. - Hey, Young Soo.

984
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:31,824
Is something going on?

985
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:33,565
Gangnam Station needed backup,

986
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:35,065
so we're all going to Jinjung-dong.

987
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:36,124
What about you?

988
00:57:36,295 --> 00:57:38,095
I have to check some footprints.

989
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:39,335
I see. Keep it up.

990
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,135
- Okay. - Wait.

991
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:43,905
- To the Behavioral Analysis Team? - I'm fine. Get back to work.

992
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:45,074
I'll go with you.

993
00:57:45,074 --> 00:57:47,374
Hey, I'm still going strong.

994
00:57:47,374 --> 00:57:48,675
You look busy. Get back to work.

995
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:49,945
- Hey. - Bye.

996
00:57:50,045 --> 00:57:51,675
- Are you sure? - Yes.

997
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:54,345
If you get stuck, feel free to bring it to us.

998
00:57:55,085 --> 00:57:57,655
- Bye. - Be careful!

999
00:57:58,815 --> 00:57:59,854
Darn it.

1000
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:03,494
- Over here. - Salute.

1001
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,095
Grab everything there.

1002
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:16,204
- Yes, there. - News flash.

1003
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:18,374
Today afternoon in Jinjung-dong, Gangnam-gu,

1004
00:58:18,374 --> 00:58:20,244
a woman in her 50s was found dead...

1005
00:58:20,244 --> 00:58:22,144
after being struck by a blunt weapon.

1006
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,945
The police were dispatched for an investigation...

1007
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:26,885
after a report made by Lee, the maid,

1008
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:28,784
who saw the collapsed victim in her home in Jinjung-dong.

1009
00:58:28,784 --> 00:58:30,255
Can you share something with us?

1010
00:58:31,615 --> 00:58:32,854
Gangnam Police Station said...

1011
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:35,354
the culprit of today's Jinjung-dong incident...

1012
00:58:35,354 --> 00:58:36,485
and the Suseong-dong incident is...

1013
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:40,195
Chief Heo, what on earth is going on?

1014
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:41,764
I told you to investigate this quietly.

1015
00:58:41,764 --> 00:58:43,335
Why is the case blowing up?

1016
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:46,034
Captain Yoon and Detective Nam are at the scene right now.

1017
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:48,005
Let's hear from them once they return.

1018
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:49,065
Good grief.

1019
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:50,735
Where's Kim Bong Sik?

1020
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,505
No idea. But he'll crawl back...

1021
00:58:52,505 --> 00:58:54,804
if he thinks this will affect his performance.

1022
00:58:54,804 --> 00:58:56,204
That's his deal.

1023
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:58,615
Look at how big this case has become.

1024
00:58:59,845 --> 00:59:03,755
We might end up taking over both of these cases.

1025
00:59:03,755 --> 00:59:05,155
Tell me about it.

1026
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:06,784
These reporters already began to say...

1027
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:08,554
that they're related or something.

1028
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:12,655
I have a bad feeling about this. We can't let this happen.

1029
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:15,565
Okay. Who is it?

1030
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:18,335
Excuse me.

1031
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:20,164
Hey.

1032
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:21,264
- Hello. - Hello.

1033
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:22,335
What brings you here?

1034
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:25,204
I found something weird. I wanted your opinion on this.

1035
00:59:25,374 --> 00:59:26,434
What is it?

1036
00:59:31,074 --> 00:59:32,074
They are both hiking shoes.

1037
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:33,585
- Yes. - What about them?

1038
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:36,184
This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.

1039
00:59:36,184 --> 00:59:38,284
And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.

1040
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:42,954
They match, right?

1041
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:48,595
They are from different districts, but it's the same culprit?

1042
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:54,405
(A posh residential house in Gungok-dong)

1043
00:59:57,934 --> 01:00:00,744
My mom cooked breakfast for me, and I ate it and went to work.

1044
01:00:01,345 --> 01:00:03,204
When I called, she didn't answer.

1045
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:05,914
So I came home and...

1046
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:09,244
Can you think of anyone who held grudges against her?

1047
01:00:09,244 --> 01:00:11,315
Or did she have any money problems?

1048
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:13,784
None.

1049
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:16,655
Did she ever sound upset on the phone?

1050
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:17,724
No.

1051
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:18,755
Hey.

1052
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:23,195
("A Woman in Her 50s Found Dead in Jinjung-dong")

1053
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:25,735
What? There was another case in Jinjung-dong.

1054
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,235
- What? - Look at this.

1055
01:00:27,235 --> 01:00:28,565
Yes. I'm reading it now.

1056
01:00:28,565 --> 01:00:31,275
"A woman in her 50s from a 2-story house in Jinjung-dong..."

1057
01:00:31,335 --> 01:00:33,104
"was found dead from blunt force trauma."

1058
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,505
(Blunt force trauma in the head)

1059
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,244
So was the victim in Gungok-dong.

1060
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:39,545
Right?

1061
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:40,615
I'll check out the crime scene.

1062
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:43,854
I'm going to the Special Crime Squad.

1063
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:46,054
As published in the news article,

1064
01:00:46,115 --> 01:00:48,324
this case had many similarities to Professor Han's case.

1065
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:51,195
What? Then it wasn't a revenge killing?

1066
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:54,394
We'll have to investigate more, but we don't have any suspects...

1067
01:00:54,394 --> 01:00:56,525
for Professor Han's killer.

1068
01:00:58,565 --> 01:01:01,434
They both died from a blunt force trauma in the head.

1069
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:03,135
And it was staged as a robbery?

1070
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:05,034
Yes.

1071
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:07,945
Gil Pyo. Chief.

1072
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:09,604
Hey, we're busy. Come back later.

1073
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:11,414
- Check this out now. - Come back later.

1074
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:13,914
Just look at this. They are both hiking shoes.

1075
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:15,085
What about them?

1076
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:16,445
In Tak brought them to me.

1077
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:19,315
One of them is from Suseong-dong. The other one is from Gungok-dong.

1078
01:01:19,485 --> 01:01:21,925
Suseong-dong is in Gangnam. And Gungok-dong is in Jongno.

1079
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,425
- Give me that. - It's the same guy.

1080
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:26,865
I read the reports. It's the same MO.

1081
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:31,065
- Blunt force trauma? - Yes. Exactly.

1082
01:01:31,195 --> 01:01:32,264
Suseong-dong and Gungok-dong...

1083
01:01:32,264 --> 01:01:33,365
They were both hit in the head.

1084
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:35,565
The victim in Jinjung-dong also died from blunt force trauma.

1085
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:39,604
You knew?

1086
01:01:41,704 --> 01:01:42,874
I just got back...

1087
01:01:44,615 --> 01:01:46,414
from the crime scene in Jinjung-dong.

1088
01:01:49,014 --> 01:01:50,184
Who on earth is this guy?

1089
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:51,784
The MO is the same.

1090
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,284
What are you doing here?

1091
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:26,954
Let me in.

1092
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,985
You're not an investigator. Why are you here?

1093
01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:31,295
I need to see the crime scene.

1094
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:32,295
Leave!

1095
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:35,195
Don't try to steal my case. Get lost!

1096
01:02:35,324 --> 01:02:37,394
Please. I must check the crime scene.

1097
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:41,005
Hey. Didn't you hear me? I told you to get lost, you punk!

1098
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:42,135
Darn it.

1099
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:44,775
This is important.

1100
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:03,324
(Scientific Investigations Team)

1101
01:03:07,164 --> 01:03:09,595
The victim was hit by a blunt instrument.

1102
01:03:10,365 --> 01:03:11,934
(Blunt force trauma in the head)

1103
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:23,845
There are no footsteps in the bedroom.

1104
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:25,974
And the safe wasn't touched either.

1105

(Crime scene stepping plates)

1106
01:03:55,574 --> 01:03:59,074
There's no trace of blood splattered on the ceiling.

1107
01:03:59,644 --> 01:04:00,684
It means...

1108
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:05,485
the culprit subdued the victim with one blow.

1109
01:04:13,054 --> 01:04:15,324
- Yes. - Are you there?

1110
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:21,365
What do we do?

1111
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:27,374
I thought we had ten years.

1112
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:30,675
But it happened sooner than I thought.

1113
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:34,945
Everything fits.

1114
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:40,155
(A psychological cooling-off period)

1115

(Crime committed against a stranger, for the sole purpose of murder)

1116
01:04:51,565 --> 01:04:53,704
The police admitted that the recent murder cases...

1117
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:55,335
in the wealthy neighborhood...

1118
01:04:55,335 --> 01:04:57,635
could have been part of a serial murder.

1119
01:04:57,735 --> 01:05:01,275
The police will consider the three murder cases...

1120
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:03,474
in Gangnam and Jongno as serial murder cases...

1121
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,275
and do their best to find the culprit quickly...

1122
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:07,815
by dispatching more resources in these neighborhoods.

1123
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:10,554
There have been murder cases in Suseong-dong...

1124
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:12,954
and Jinjung-dong, Gangnam-gu back to back.

1125
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:14,954
And between these two cases, a similar murder case...

1126
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,854
took place in Gungok-dong, Jongno-gu.

1127
01:05:17,854 --> 01:05:19,925
And the late discovery of the news...

1128
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:22,224
has put the residents in fear.

(Do Not Enter, Under Investigation)

1130
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:26,095
Move back.

1131
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:39,045
The culprit went to different neighborhoods...

1132
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:41,914
and was only after the act of killing.

1133
01:05:43,215 --> 01:05:44,385
Three murders.

1134
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,054
Step back.

1135
01:05:47,184 --> 01:05:48,525

(Do Not Enter, Under Investigation)

1137
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:04,275
What happened here?

1138
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:34,234
It's serial murder.

1139

(Through the Darkness)

1140
01:07:11,835 --> 01:07:14,305
A woman in her 60s was found dead...

1141
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:17,175
in her house in Pyeonghwa-dong. The police are investigating now.

1142
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:18,345
- A blunt force trauma. - The triangle again?

1143
01:07:18,345 --> 01:07:21,215
Something is off. I'm sure he saw something unexpected.

1144

Come on, Behavioral Analysis Team. Go back to your office.

1145
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:24,585
Entering the crime scene as you please...

1146
01:07:24,585 --> 01:07:25,855
is hindering our investigation.

1147
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:27,185
The answer must be at the crime scene.

1148
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:29,654
What should we do with that?

1149
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:30,725
We can buy time.

1150
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:32,895
I hope you're not buying this nonsense.

1151
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:35,324
The only way to prevent the killer from going after another victim...

1152
01:07:35,795 --> 01:07:36,965
is this.
