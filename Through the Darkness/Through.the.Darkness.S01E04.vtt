(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,879
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,250
(The scenes with dead bodies and animals were staged and fictitious.)

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,889
(This drama may contain disturbing and brutal scenes.)

5
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:54,997
The crime site and his residence...

6
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,067
may be within the walking distance...

7
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,336
between the point she went missing to the victim's home.

8
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:17,186
I think I found the place.

9
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:19,787
Wait for me.

10
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,912
(Item Storage)

11
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,116
Cho Hyun Gil!

12
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,407
If you search his house, it will be neatly organized.

13
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:45,046
The weapon he used will also be put away neatly.

14
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:56,056
That's not a shelf, it's the interior floor of the fridge.

15
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,556
Captain Yoon. What...

16
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,026
Captain Yoon.

17
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:11,293
(Through the Darkness, Episode 4)

18
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,967
It's caked with dust. I doubt he'll come back.

19
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,366
A man who lives alone doesn't clean.

20
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:21,207
But seeing how organized and neat he was,

21
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,407
he probably spends a lot of time cleaning too.

22
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:26,077
Seeing how dusty it is like Captain Kook said,

23
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,077
he didn't come here for a long time.

24
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,147
But...

25
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:32,246
we'll still wait for him.

26
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,717
I'll wait too.

27
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,157
You don't have to.

28
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,886
- Detective Nam and I can handle it. - Right.

29
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,457
Then I'll get going first.

30
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,397
Goodnight. Goodnight to you.

31
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:45,426
Bye.

32
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:47,636
You should go home too.

33
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:49,667
I don't want there to be a pile of cars here.

34
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,407
I'll park my car somewhere else.

35
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:53,636
What?

36
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,446
He never listens to others.

37
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:58,847
He doesn't.

38
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:00,977
Good luck.

39
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,616
If anything happens, give me a call right away.

40
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,236
Get some sleep if you're tired.

41
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,667
No. I'm fine.

42
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,207
If you're tired, you can get some sleep.

43
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,847
No. I'm good too.

44
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,217
Should I get off?

45
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:43,857
Wait.

46
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:54,066
Gosh.

47
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,267
That scared the wits out of me.

48
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:36,436
You carry around cat food?

49
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:38,207
Yes. Sometimes.

50
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,977
It's not cat food. It's just some snacks.

51
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,917
What are you eating?

52
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,217
Chocolates.

53
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:55,397
I'm good.

54
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,897
I didn't peg you...

55
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,866
to be an animal lover.

56
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,566
Animals can't talk,

57
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,236
so they can't lie.

58
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:12,707
Even when they're hungry...

59
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,417
or sick, they can't tell us.

60
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:18,686
So I just thought...

61
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,787
it'd be nice...

62
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,787
if someone recognized it first.

63
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:09,537
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

64
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:10,967
Oh, hello.

65
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:16,376
We're just waiting for someone.

66
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,246
Are you waiting for Cho?

67
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:24,886
Well, yes.

68
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:27,686
Do you know Mr. Cho Hyun Gil?

69
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,926
I'm his landlady.

70
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:35,057
Do you happen to know when he'll be back?

71
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,197
I actually came here to check because I couldn't reach him.

72
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,126
He's behind on rent,

73
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,437
but I can't get hold of him.

74
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:43,636
Well, anyway...

75
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,876
Why are you looking for him so early in the morning?

76
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:50,807
We're from the police.

77
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:55,817
(Scientific Investigations Team)

78
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,947
(Forensics)

79
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:11,996
- You're here. - Hey.

80
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,837
The description of the little girl the landlady saw...

81
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,197
matches that of Soo Hyun.

82
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:19,067
- Did you check the vehicle too? - Yes.

83
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,337
Gosh. Now, we just need to find Cho Hyun Gil.

84
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,406
Sir, you're here.

85
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,707
Hey, what are you doing here?

86
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:27,347
Darn it.

87
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,016
Hey, the Behavioral Analysis Team can't be here.

88
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,616
- Why not? - You know the answer.

89
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,916
You can investigate, but it must be done under the table.

90
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,616
If the higher-ups find out, they'll go bonkers.

91
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,187
If the media finds out, it'll be even worse.

92
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,087
This is so unfair.

93
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,256
Why is it unfair?

94
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,996
Don't you know that the commissioner...

95
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,697
is more afraid of the reporters than his wife?

96
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,666
What? You're here too?

97
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,097
I'm sure we'll find Soo Hyun's fingers around his house.

98
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,396
We must find them.

99
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:53,567
First, you'll have to help us search the scene.

100
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,607
Gosh.

101
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:59,547
- Check that spot over there. - This spot here?

102
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,847
Careful. Be careful not to touch that.

103
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,687
Check that spot in the back too.

104
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,016
Anything?

105
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,357
Did you find anything? Look, over there.

106
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,727
Over here!

107
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,727
What is it?

108
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,136
It has decomposed, but it is a finger of a child.

109
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,307
Let's keep on searching.

110
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,896
There are only eight fingers.

111
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,697
Let's keep looking.

112
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,136
I'm sure we'll find the rest.

113
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,236
They may have drifted away.

114
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,006
Let's search together all the way to the nearest sewer.

115
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,906
Let's keep on looking. We'll search together.

116
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:16,016
We're missing two fingers of a girl!

117
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:20,286
Look through the grass and check under the rocks. Search thoroughly!

118
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,697
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

119
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:38,807
Young Soo.

120
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:41,116
Yes.

121
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,047
We searched thoroughly all the way there...

122
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,047
but found nothing.

123
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,516
This is the last spot where we can search.

124
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:49,486
They must've rotten away by now.

125
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,986
The body was stored in the freezer...

126
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,727
before it was discarded at different times.

127
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,526
It'll help us determine the degree of decomposition.

128
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:58,396
We must find them, even just the bones.

129
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,697
We still have hope, so let's keep on looking.

130
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,597
Let's search some more.

131
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,337
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:12,146
Captain.

133
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:13,977
Did you find something?

134
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,957
Darn it. It's a sausage.

135
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,610
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

136
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,217
We checked the area where Cho Hyun Gil's home is located...

137
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,386
immediately after the incident broke out.

138
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:27,246
Right.

139
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,687
It didn't look like anyone lived there,

140
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,957
so we let it slip under the radar.

141
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:36,057
No, it's totally understandable.

142
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:38,297
Gosh, I couldn't even figure out where the entrance was.

143
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:39,927
I couldn't even find the door.

144
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,266
Why is it so hot in here? Am I the only one sweating?

145
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,937
Here, use this as a fan.

146
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,107
- Thanks. - Soo Hyun's fingers...

147
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,307
We'll find them.

148
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:55,947
We already found eight of them.

149
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:59,447
They were thrown out, so I'm sure we'll find the rest.

150
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:01,817
Yes, we must find them.

151
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,756
By the way, how did you know?

152
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,697
That her fingers would be there.

153
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,996
It was just...

154
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,227
a gut feeling.

155
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,967
You're as intuitive as Captain Yoon.

156
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:16,996
Why don't we call it a day?

157
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,636
Yes, let's do that.

158
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:21,906
You can all get going. I'll leave in a bit.

159
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:23,307
It was a long day.

160
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:24,776
Tomorrow will be another hard day. Get some rest.

161
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:27,077
I'm okay. You should all get going.

162
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:28,177
- All right. - Bye.

163
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,016
- Bye. - Bye.

164
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:32,986
Then I'll get going too.

165
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,486
Okay, good work today.

166
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,016
Take it easy.

167
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:45,427
Ha Young.

168
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,337
If you insist on staying late all by yourself,

169
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:52,837
everyone else will feel like they're not working hard enough.

170
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:56,477
My apologies. That wasn't my intention.

171
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:57,847
Don't overwork yourself.

172
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,707
- I won't. Have a good night. - You too.

173
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,047
- See you. - Bye.

174
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:17,327
My gosh. I'm sorry, honey.

175
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,297
I woke you up, didn't I?

176
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,896
Are the kids asleep?

177
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,707
I see, okay.

178
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:28,607
You know, tell Joo Hyun and Soo Hyun...

179
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,477
that I want to hear their voices.

180
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,587
Have them call me when they wake up. These brats.

181
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:43,087
Oh, boy. I'm being selfish again.

182
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,727
I woke you up.

183
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,457
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,026
Go back to sleep, Mi Yeon.

185
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,467
I love you.

186
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:54,437
Okay.

187
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,006
Kidnapped on May 20.

188
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,376
Body parts were found for the 1st time on May 29.

189
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,817
The torso and the head were also found on May 30.

190
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,447
On June 25, additional body parts were found in a toilet at an inn...

191
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:47,217
after the culprit spent a night there.

192
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,457
Cho Hyun Gil disposed of the body parts...

193
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,827
in different places on different days.

194
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,297
The two fingers that haven't turned up yet.

195
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,227
Where could they be?

196
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,396
Where could Cho Hyun Gil be hiding?

197
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,436
Where could Cho Hyun Gil be hiding?

198
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,087
(44 days after the incident)

199
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,886
(July 12, 2000)

200
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,456
(Forensics Squad)

201
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:23,517
(Every contact leaves a trace.)

202
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:24,787
- You're here. - Good work.

203
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:26,386
Where's In Tak?

204
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:27,956
He went to take a nap.

205
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:31,027
- May I see the analysis result? - Yes, one second.

206
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,067
Right here.

207
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,089
(Please keep the door closed.)

208
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,136
- Oh my. - You're here.

209
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,936
You haven't slept.

210
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,507
I lied down to take a nap,

211
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,607
but I kept having dreams of looking for the kid's fingers,

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,946
so I just got up.

213
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:49,277
You're doing good work.

214
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,287
We compared the fingerprints we got yesterday from his house,

215
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:55,057
and they're mostly of Cho Hyun Gil or that child victim.

216
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,587
Have you heard about the DNAs too?

217
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,787
Yes, the NFS called.

218
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,257
I don't see his middle and ring fingers here either.

219
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:05,267
So you only found fingerprints for three fingers on the weapon?

220
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,696
The fingerprints we found at his place are all partial.

221
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,936
All we have are five fingers.

222
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,366
For now, we know that it was done by Cho Hyun Gil.

223
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:15,077
We just have to find out where he's hiding.

224
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,007
We found out who he is, so he'll be caught soon.

225
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:18,976
- Anyway, keep it up. - Okay.

226
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,277
- Let me know if you find anything. - All right.

227
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:22,747
- Take care. - Goodbye.

228
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,747
Cho Hyun Gil. Age 40.

229
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:31,327
He lived in 39-1 Changeui-dong.

230
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,386
In September of 1997,

231
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,426
He has a history of molesting a four-year-old girl in Songju-dong.

232
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:40,466
So how did he get omitted from the list?

233
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,337
After he moved, he did not register his new address.

234
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,567
That's why he was left out.

235
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,936
I went to his house,

236
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:51,347
and it could hardly be called a home where one lives.

237
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:56,047
His house was in a corner, so we missed it when we went around.

238
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,616
- I'm sorry. - We missed him right before us.

239
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,557
Hey, wait.

240
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,926
If he was previously convicted in 1997,

241
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,726
it hasn't been that long.

242
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:09,757
He was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months.

243
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,626
He was released this March.

244
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:15,136
Goodness, that means it has only been four months.

245
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,837
The ink on the paperwork probably didn't even dry, that jerk.

246
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,706
Anyway, we found the DNA of the missing kid in his house?

247
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,237
The NFS just called.

248
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,577
We also confirmed his fingerprints all over the weapon.

249
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:31,277
Make sure you find where this Cho Hyun Gil is.

250
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:33,987
If he did this only two months after his release,

251
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:35,716
we don't know what he'll do next.

252
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:38,057
Captain Yoon, let's hurry.

253
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:41,087
The entire team went out to search around Changeui-dong area.

254
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:45,567
I sent Detective Nam out to the butcher shop Cho worked at.

255
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,737
He must've worked here while Moon Soo was here.

256
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,636
- Moon Soo? - He's my nephew.

257
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,866
I had to go out for some business,

258
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:56,537
so my nephew was looking after my shop.

259
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,876
Oh, I see.

260
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:02,017
That man suddenly quit even before a month was up.

261
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:05,317
Most people won't pay the man after leaving like that.

262
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,517
I'm a good man, so I paid him what he deserves.

263
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:09,456
Do you have anything to show that you paid him?

264
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,587
You know, on your bank account history.

265
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:16,226
People who take up jobs like that do it for the cash.

266
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:17,997
You paid him fully in cash?

267
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:21,097
Right, I gave him some checks too.

268
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:25,436
Yes, do you remember which bank it was?

269
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,936
Was it Johong Bank?

270
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,107
May I see the transaction history of this check?

271
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,136
(Johong Bank)

272
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:33,706
I guess we came for a search when his nephew was at the shop.

273
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,916
That's why we missed him.

274
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:39,287
I'll send you the address of where the check was used.

275
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,956
- Prints from only three fingers? - Yes.

276
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:51,626
When you grab a knife or a saw,

277
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,597
your fingerprints are printed at a certain location.

278
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:55,696
Like this.

279
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,807
I'd get it if we didn't find any fingerprints at all.

280
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:02,476
You'll see even partial prints from the middle and ring fingers.

281
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:05,247
Right thumb, right index, and right pinky.

282
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:07,077
Isn't it weird that we only found those three?

283
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,176
It's either one of the two.

284
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:14,146
He either has an odd habit when he grabs things,

285
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,257
or he's missing those two fingers.

286
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,936
I'm going to make you fly.

287
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,466
Here we go.

288
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,166
Just push me.

289
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:37,676
Don't do it so hard.

290
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,777
What are you doing? Come on!

291
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,534
By any chance, have you seen this man?

292
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,656
(Dairy Products)

293
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,720
Hey, have you seen this customer?

294
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,366
Could you please try to remember?

295
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:09,376
He used a check here on June 26.

296
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,206
I'm not sure about the date,

297
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,007
but I remember getting a check.

298
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,646
I've never received one as a part-timer here.

299
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,446
But...

300
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,686
I don't remember what he looked like.

301
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:22,956
Do you have a CCTV?

302
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:28,757
He's only missing his right middle and ring fingers.

303
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:32,666
No matter how meticulously you plan something,

304
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,366
your habits come out like second nature.

305
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:39,307
I'm sure there was a reason behind stripping her.

306
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,676
He had to strip her to get off.

307
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:45,347
And whoever did that is the real culprit.

308
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,587
- Gil Pyo. - Hey.

309
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:01,226
The culprit. He's probably missing two fingers, okay?

310
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:03,027
Will you please stay quiet?

311
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:06,097
The visitors who come to Seoul are over...

312
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,267
How long will you treat us like a shadow?

313
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,607
I didn't treat you like a shadow.

314
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,436
You're banning a solid team from doing any work right now.

315
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,607
You are treating us like a shadow.

316
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:18,777
What is it?

317
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,347
Be honest. Something is going on, right?

318
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:21,976
No, nothing is going on.

319
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,047
Look at this.

320
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:25,787
I can always tell when you're lying.

321
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:26,886
I know you.

322
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:30,257
You can't fool me.

323
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,567
Wait, one second.

324
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:42,866
Okay.

325
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,307
- Stay here. I'll go. - Okay.

326
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,037
Hello.

327
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,847
(Soju)

328
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,446
A pack of cigarettes, please.

329
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,987
That will be 3 dollars and 20 cents.

330
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:04,787
Wait.

331
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,057
Is that him?

332
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,237
Your change is 1 dollar and 80 cents.

333
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:36,317
Thank you. Goodbye.

334
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:42,156
What? The guy who just went out.

335
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:46,926
Just now?

336
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:49,837
Yes, he looks like the man who just left.

337
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:51,037
His clothes.

338
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:52,567
Is that him?

339
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,047
Mr. Cho Hyun Gil?

340
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:12,557
Darn it.

341
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,067
Cho Hyun Gil!

342
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,716
Darn it.

343
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,287
Cho Hyun Gil!

344
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:58,767
Darn it.

345
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,107
Captain Yoon.

346
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:06,976
Cho Hyun Gil.

347
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:09,676
You're under emergency arrest for Lee Soo Hyun's murder.

348
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,946
You have the right to consult an attorney...

349
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,416
and to remain silent, but do you have anything to say?

350
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:16,216
Darn it!

351
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,696
- Are you okay, Il Young? - Yes.

352
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,366
Chief Heo, we caught him.

353
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:34,607
We caught him!

354
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:36,906
- Cho Hyun Gil? - Yes.

355
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:38,136
What about his fingers?

356
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:46,646
So you drank through the night on May 19,

357
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,916
then abducted Lee Soo Hyun...

358
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,087
around 3pm the next day.

359
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,557
Is that correct?

360
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,527
Why was your target Soo Hyun, a girl who was only five years old?

361
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:00,666

00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,547
but he was released back to society without turning over a new leaf.

544

Who is responsible for creating a world like this?

545
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:02,087
Perhaps, the only thing we can do...

546
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:06,487
is remember the short life of Lee, the little girl who died,

547
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,898
and truly lament...

548
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:12,297
and grieve her death.

Hey, you're getting in late.

562
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,268
Why are you still up?

563
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:28,168
I couldn't fall asleep.

564
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,748
You know, that kid's case.

565
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,308
Wasn't it the case you were working on?

566
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:35,918
Yes.

567
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:37,518
Are you all right?

568
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,288
Yes, of course.

569
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:45,558
Here, have some.

570
00:40:47,587 --> 00:40:48,927
I noticed that you'd completely run out of it.

571
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,668
You no longer need to worry about me. I'm an adult.

572
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,237
I'm not worried.

573
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,498
Get some sleep.

574
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,117
This is exactly why I get worried.

575
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:13,688

587
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,958
Get home safely, sir.

588
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,128
What are you up to? Let's grab a drink together.

589
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,438
I'm not in the mood for a drink. Maybe another time.

592

Have you adjusted to your position?

What are you talking about?

- Young Soo, where are you now? - You know,

596
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:41,637
when I see our boys rip out a piece of paper...

597
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:45,578
to use it as a fan in this sweltering heat,

598
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:48,208
it really breaks my heart.

599
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:51,177
I'll ask for an AC unit.

600
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:54,487
We don't even have a table where we can sit down and eat together.

601

I'll ask for that too.

602

A big table.

603
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:01,058
It'll be winter before you know it. Do we even have a heater?

604
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:02,728
Of course, we don't have one.

605
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:05,058
Don't you worry. You can't hold out that long anyway.

606

Anyway, just hang up and go home.

607
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:16,108
Why is everyone so worried about me getting home?

608
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:21,708
I'm not the one you should be worried about.

609
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:25,418
You know that.

610
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:03,887

I guess you managed to get home safely after all.

623
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:11,987
Of course. Did you think I'd die on the street or something?

624

As if.

625
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:15,387
Even the fortune-teller said you wouldn't die so easily.

626
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:17,757
So the fortune-teller wouldn't want you to die like that.

627
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,297
And you know that I never blackout when I drink, right?

- Get out of my way. - Look.

I told you that he'd be perfect for the job...

633

and that he'd help us identify the culprit.

before we decide on whether they'll put out results or not?

711

Gosh, I know! I'm aware of that too. Just give them some time for now.

How much time do they need? This is so frustrating.

714
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:41,887
to at least give them some time...

715
00:49:42,328 --> 00:49:44,628
to interview criminals and gather data on criminal types.

716
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:47,228
You did? What are the higher-ups saying?

717
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:49,328

by helping us narrow down the list of suspects...

00:49:51,398 --> 00:49:53,237
for this Cho Hyun Gil case too.

720
00:49:56,478 --> 00:49:58,237
Do you think we have an open-ended budget?

721
00:49:58,777 --> 00:50:00,608
You know how they are.

722
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,717
They always groan in complaints...

723
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:06,587
about how we don't even have enough to work the field.

724
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,918
Goodness.

725
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,558
It's because you're too soft.

726
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,887
This is why I can't quit smoking.

727
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,297
It's cinnamon-flavored candy? Darn it.

728
00:50:19,297 --> 00:50:22,168
Choi Yoon Ji has always been a bit different back in school too.

729
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,898
I guess you can say that's her strength too.

730
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,007
I don't think that.

731
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:30,308
I'm grateful she chose to work here.

732
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,947
Yes, I'm grateful.

733
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:36,648
But I still need to make a living.

734
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:38,478
What's the point of being a conscious reporter...

735
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:40,788
when the media is crumbling down?

736
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:43,217
Yes, that's right.

737
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:45,317
Don't just talk about it, but put it to action.

738
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:51,828
- Is your hangover bad? - I'm all right.

739
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:54,967
Do you even remember drunk dialing me yesterday...

740
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,737
and how you harassed me by saying how miserable you are?

741
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,808
I didn't say that because I was drunk.

742
00:51:02,637 --> 00:51:05,078
I get it. It wasn't an easy case.

743
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:07,808
Good job. You did well.

744
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,717
But don't think that your job as a reporter...

745
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:11,018
starts and finishes with appealing to the reader's emotions.

746
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:12,418
You see, a reporter...

747
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:15,047
That's enough advice for today, Director.

748
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:17,257
What's with the, "But?"

749
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:18,518
Why do you think so?

750
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:21,128
It's because that's my role, you rascal.

751
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:23,558
Let's get some food to soothe your stomach.

752
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,598
I need to get going in a bit.

753
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:27,467
At least get a bite of food in before you leave.

754
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:28,927
You'll upset your stomach.

755
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:30,598
All right, I'll eat before I go.

756
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,072
Aren't we done since we caught him?

757
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:36,612
Even if everyone else thinks that way...

758
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:38,112
we have to think about what comes after.

759
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:39,712
- After this? - Yes.

760
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:42,427
- Analyzing the mind. - "Analyzing the mind?"

761
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:44,257
It's true that criminal profiling...

762
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:46,627
is used in order to catch the culprit.

763
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:48,596
But what comes after that is extremely important too.

764
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:50,866
What does that have to do with analyzing the mind though?

765
00:51:52,136 --> 00:51:53,636
It's not over because we caught the culprit.

766
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:55,567
There will always be another one who appears.

767
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:56,607
Hold on.

768
00:51:56,936 --> 00:51:59,607
You said you were going to speak comfortably to me.

769
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:05,777
Did I say that?

770
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:08,647
I'll speak comfortably to you if you don't do it first.

771
00:52:08,886 --> 00:52:11,116
Why don't you go ahead and do that, since we're talking about it?

772
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:12,357
Should I do that then?

773
00:52:17,326 --> 00:52:18,397
Captain Yoon!

774
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:22,967
Over here, Captain Yoon! Come sit here.

775
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,936
- We'll sit over there with them. - Okay.

776
00:52:26,197 --> 00:52:28,737
We just need to bring a chair over.

777
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:30,737
We just got started eating too, so let's eat together.

778
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:32,036
Yes, we'll join this table.

779
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,377
Two more orders of the set please, ma'am!

780
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:36,246
- Got it! - Please excuse us then.

781
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:39,547
What's there to excuse? We're all on the same team.

782
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,616
Carry on with your conversation.

783
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:46,627
It seems like we interrupted it.

784
00:52:46,927 --> 00:52:48,627
Whether criminals who committed serious crimes...

785
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:51,127
can be rehabilitated in prison or not.

786
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:54,667
Or if the rehabilitation program needs some sort of change.

787
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,927
Or if there is a chance they'll repeat the crime.

788
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:58,766
We have to figure those things out. That's what we were talking about.

789
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,967
Cho Hyun Gil committed the same crime in the end...

790
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:02,936
after just two months of being released.

791
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:06,576
That's why you want to interview Cho Hyun Gil!

792
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:09,007
What? You're interviewing Cho Hyun Gil again?

793
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,016
There's a lot we have to ask him.

794
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,447
Not only is he our team's first case...

795
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:15,717
but if we want to write our report on criminal psychology analysis...

796
00:53:15,717 --> 00:53:18,257
I think we'll have to meet him at least once more.

797
00:53:18,556 --> 00:53:20,326
This team is always working very hard.

798
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:22,956
If we want people to know that the Behavioral Analysis Team...

799
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:26,567
contributes to catching the culprit, we'll have to work harder.

800
00:53:26,897 --> 00:53:28,266
We have to show that it's not interest that motivates us...

801
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:30,737
but our sense of duty instead.

802
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:36,536
It may just be an intriguing case to you and your team,

803
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:38,237
but my team has a duty to solve it.

804
00:53:43,277 --> 00:53:46,786
Whatever the case, more heinous criminals will show up.

805
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,147
I hope my guess is wrong.

806
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:50,357
I'd be happy if I'm wrong.

807
00:53:50,987 --> 00:53:54,357
But there still has to be someone preparing for what may happen.

808
00:53:57,096 --> 00:53:58,596
Thank you!

809
00:53:59,226 --> 00:54:00,897
We have more than enough already.

810
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:04,096
Just how much more heinous will they get for us to need to prepare?

811
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,766
Daesung Serial Murder Case.

812
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,377
That punk. We even released his montage...

813
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,007
but why won't he get caught?

814
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:18,877
Those punks that commit serial murders...

815
00:54:19,177 --> 00:54:22,087
aren't in the range of normal that we think of.

816
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:25,056
It's hard to track them down the way we normally do.

817
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:28,927
What do you mean it's hard to track them down...

818
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:30,257
the way we normally do?

819
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,427
If we look at the pattern of a crime...

820
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:36,536
we can tell to an extent whether it was resentment or blind passion.

821
00:54:36,536 --> 00:54:38,866
That's right. It's clear as day.

822
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:40,507
But when it's none of these...

823
00:54:45,237 --> 00:54:48,047
Guys who commit crimes randomly and recklessly...

824
00:54:48,047 --> 00:54:49,647
we can't read their behavior pattern.

825
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:52,377
Why is that? Because they don't belong to any category.

826
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:55,616
Are you saying that's the case with the Daesung Serial Murder Case?

827
00:54:55,886 --> 00:54:56,917
That's right.

828
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,556
Once our team settles down...

829
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:02,226
he's the first one I want to catch.

830
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:05,197
He'll be caught before that.

831
00:55:06,297 --> 00:55:07,596
Even though he stopped,

832
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:09,837
our investigation will continue.

833
00:55:09,837 --> 00:55:11,096
Yes, he has to be caught.

834
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:14,422
He's the most wanted criminal by the Korean police.

835
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,090
Please excuse me.

836
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:19,846
Wait for us. We're almost done too.

837
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:21,877
It's okay. You can take your time to eat.

838
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:23,277
Please excuse me.

839
00:55:23,602 --> 00:55:26,102
- It's on me. Just go. - Thank you.

840
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:35,257
Goodness. He is always so predictable.

841
00:55:36,627 --> 00:55:37,627
Goodness.

842
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:53,316
(Unresolved Case File, 1991)

(Daesung Serial Murder Case)

844
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,304
Anyway, what does that have to do with a potentially atrocious case?

845
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,603
Listen up.

846
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:13,813
In the US, heinous criminals who only seek to murder...

847
00:56:13,813 --> 00:56:16,943
began to surface during their biggest economic change.

848
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:18,744
There's a report on the correlation.

849
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:21,753
That's why we must be prepared.

850
00:56:23,753 --> 00:56:25,124
Anyhow,

851
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,793
Daesung Serial Murder Case was way too shocking for me,

852
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,023
so I studied it extensively.

853
00:56:30,693 --> 00:56:33,193
After I saw the cases from overseas, I saw that...

854
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:34,994
they're like smart criminals.

855
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:38,704
Their brains are wired only to murder.

856
00:56:39,034 --> 00:56:42,034
That's why their MO and patterns evolve over time.

857
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:43,074
(Grass field in Uhyeong-ri, waterway in Hyungsan-ri)

858
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:44,374
Here's what I mean.

859
00:56:44,644 --> 00:56:47,614
That the atrocity of their murder and their crimes...

860
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:49,313
will be taken to an extreme.

861
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:53,353
That's why they change the patterns in an attempt to flee from us.

862
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:59,023
When they change the pattern and the MO, catching them...

863
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:02,193
will be even harder.

864
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:05,463
If we do not get prepared,

865
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:09,664
we'll see another cold case like the Daesung Serial Murder.

866
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:14,434
I see.

867
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:16,273
It'd be wonderful if it doesn't happen.

868
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,213
I'm just trying to be prepared, for just ten years.

869
00:57:21,344 --> 00:57:23,883
I want to put in some work for just ten years.

870
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,514
Then will our team last for ten years?

871
00:57:26,753 --> 00:57:28,514
- Can you do this? - Yes, I can, sir.

872
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:33,494
Anyway, thank you for listening to my boring story.

873
00:57:33,494 --> 00:57:34,653
Lunch is on me.

874
00:57:34,653 --> 00:57:36,124
No, it's all right.

875
00:57:36,124 --> 00:57:38,094
Thank you so much. Thank you for lunch.

876
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:50,943
Goodness.

877
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,744
I have finally gone insane.

878
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:55,074
What's wrong?

879
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:56,543
My wallet.

880
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:00,813
- I'll pay. - No.

881
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:02,554
That's not what I meant.

882
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:08,753
- Captain Yoon. - Oh, thank you.

883
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,423
Captain Yoon, something he said has been bugging me.

884
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:14,864
What is?

885
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:18,403
I mean, no matter how crazy we are, we have to say the right things.

886
00:58:18,403 --> 00:58:20,773
To be frank, we caught Cho Hyun Gil.

887
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:24,244
Okay, I give them credit for analyzing him and stuff.

888
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:26,273
But so what?

889
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:28,414
It's not like we don't try to guess what the culprit is like.

890
00:58:28,414 --> 00:58:30,744
We just can't be right all the time.

891
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:33,083
And if you think about it, the same goes for that team.

892
00:58:33,483 --> 00:58:36,353
They somehow ended up guessing Cho Hyun Gil right.

893
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:37,983
They can't say they took part in...

894
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:39,624
That's mine.

895
00:58:40,024 --> 00:58:42,753
Why? Did they say they caught Cho Hyun Gil?

896
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:45,264
No, it's not like that.

897
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:47,793
I knew they'd get cheeky.

898
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:50,304
I told you not to let them take credit.

899
00:58:50,304 --> 00:58:52,403
They should be grateful that they still have a job.

900
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,574
Everyone knows about the Red Cap Incident.

901
00:58:55,434 --> 00:58:58,204
People in this field are unbelievably talkative.

902
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:01,744
We're the ones who ran around doing the footwork.

903
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,813
- Isn't that so? - Stop it already.

904
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:06,083
Are we here to play a game of dart?

905
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:10,923
Trying to be infallible in getting things right.

906
00:59:11,784 --> 00:59:14,353
I don't appreciate the expressions you've been using recently, okay?

907
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:15,394
I...

908
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:19,193
Okay. I'll be careful.

909
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:22,934
Try to think things over before you say them out loud.

910
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:24,233
Yes, ma'am.

911
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:26,866
Finish your coffee and come.

912
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:28,696
Yes, ma'am.

913
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,607
What's with her?

914
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:33,977
You owe me 20 cents.

915
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:35,837
(March 5, 1991, 9:30am, Dongji-myeon, Daesung-gun)

00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:38,676
(Daesung Serial Murder Case)

917
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:44,606
(Serial Murder Case)

918
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:11,506
Please relax your shoulders. Good.

919
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:13,437
All right. Look into the camera.

920
01:01:14,276 --> 01:01:17,046
I'll take the photo now. Smile.

921
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,486
The train is approaching.

922
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,627
Please step back from the safety line.

923
01:01:30,627 --> 01:01:33,057

(Senior Inspector, Kook Young Soo)

926
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,816
You can relax.

927
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:40,296
I'm the police.

928
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:46,127
It's too dangerous for a woman to go around alone at night.

929
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,096
Thank you.

930
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:50,096
Let me escort you.

931
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:53,466
I'm fine, but sure.

932
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:54,577
Let's go.

933
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:13,727
(Through the Darkness)

934
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,886
Did you dress up to see me?

935
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:47,057
I feel like getting treated.

936
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:48,457
You want to hear my story?

937
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,156
- Like what? - Something like your childhood...

938
01:03:50,156 --> 01:03:52,196
or how you feel around the day.

939
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,736
I need you to take up a case.

940
01:03:53,736 --> 01:03:55,937
A married couple was murdered in their home two weeks ago.

941
01:03:55,937 --> 01:03:57,837
- What are you looking for? - We haven't specified him yet.

942
01:03:58,707 --> 01:03:59,906
There's another old man.

943
01:03:59,906 --> 01:04:00,906
Another case broke out.

944
01:04:00,906 --> 01:04:03,037
One of them broke out in Suseong-dong, Gangnam,

945
01:04:03,037 --> 01:04:04,707
the other, Gungok-dong, Jongno Police Station.

946
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:07,276
- Don't these look similar? - What is this? The MO are the same.

947
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,877
This is the third murder, and his only purpose is to kill.

948
01:04:10,587 --> 01:04:11,886
It's a serial murder.
