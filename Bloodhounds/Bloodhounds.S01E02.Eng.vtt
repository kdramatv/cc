WEBVTT

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.764
No, just...

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.311
Please hurry.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.312
What should I do?

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.689
Calm down.
Calm down, just a moment...

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:23.815
My mother is very...

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:24.858
Ah, until when...

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.402
She couldn't sleep the other day either...

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.405
I'll see her soon.
Please sit down, okay?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.033
I'm coming through.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.325
I'm coming through, here.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.081
Doctor, we really...

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.708
Come out! Come out!

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.501
Come out!

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.170
You can't lose consciousness.
Open your eyes.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.421
Patient! Patient!

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.738
Thank you.
Yes.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.704
Mom.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.664
Huh?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.006
Oh.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:37.555
I'm sorry.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.724
Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.606
Let's go.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.528
An Mun-ju?
Yes.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.579
It's really a relief that your nerve wasn't damaged.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.415
Are you not getting scar removal treatment?

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.626
This is a wound that has been stitched.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.422
If you don't want a scar, it's best to get the treatment as soon as possible.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.590
It'll be expensive, right?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.425
I can introduce you to someone.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.427
Ah, here.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.096
If you look at the photos of recent procedures,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.891
you see the scar on the left side of the forehead, right?
Yes.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.226
This is a photo before the procedure.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.437
And this is a photo after the laser procedure.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.396
Yes.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.773
It's your face, and you're young.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.568
I think it would be good to get the procedure.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.655
No, I'm fine, thank you.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.492
Is Choi Han-kyung here?

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:23.703
Yes, would you like to come in?

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:24.621
Hyung.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:29.667
Are you okay?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.921
Look.
Uh-huh.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.589
Look.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.348
Damn it.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.269
How many stitches did you get?

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.146
30 stitches.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.025
Ah, damn bastards.
I'm so pissed off.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.028
Let's report them.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.365
If we report them,

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.450
your mom dies.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.083
No.
Why?

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.252
Mom could be in danger.

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.171
Ah, damn it, really.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.548
Oh, the contract, hyung?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.511
Oh, here.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.098
"Loan extension fee." I've never seen it before.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.474
Until the loan is fully repaid,

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.477
10% of the principal
is paid as a weekly fee.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.813
Your mother's loan is 50 million.
But the fee alone is 5 million.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:32.981
5 million.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.358
And if you miss that fee once, it doubles.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.819
The interest rate also immediately goes up from 5% to 20%.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:41.114
These bastards wrote it small on purpose so no one would read it.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.574
This is fraud. There's no way you wouldn't fall for it.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.076
What should we do?

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.078
We have to pay it back as soon as possible.

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.455
The interest will be 100 million in a month.
The house is collateral.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.166
We don't have money.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.296
Ugh, damn it, really.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.178
Let's eat first.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.180
I'll treat you. What do you want to eat?

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.393
Ribeye?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.688
Hey, do you even have the energy to joke?

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.773
I really want to eat it.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.859
Okay.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.738
I'll buy you pork stir-fry that tastes like ribeye.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.824
No, hyung.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.329
Hey, this is where I always come after my workout.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.331
It's just my routine. A perfect routine.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.459
You just eat it without asking any questions, okay?

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.086
Yes, okay.
Aigo, auntie!

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.213
Aigo.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.923
Oh.
Two pork stir-fries.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.050
Oh, okay, okay.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.593
Oh, I've never seen him before.
Hello.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.927
He's my boxing friend.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.179
Oh, really?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.019
Hey, I'm going to make a call.

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:53.936
Okay.

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:55.563
Yes, boss.

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.691
Yes, boss, it's Woo-jin.
How have you been?

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.486
Ah, it's nothing else, ah...

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.497
Oh, Geon-woo.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.916
Hyung looked at the contract for me,

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.877
and he said those people are professional fraudsters.
There's no way you wouldn't fall for it.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.046
It's not Mom's fault.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.714
Thank you, son.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.968
How's your face?

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.388
It's healing well.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.264
Ah, that's a relief.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.518
Mom, Hyung and I will clean the cafe later.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.520
So you should rest at home today.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.608
No, no, no.
I'll clean it, just leave it, okay?

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.653
No, I'll do it when I go home later, okay?

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.822
Dinner's ready.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.869
Oh, Mom, I'll call you again when I get home later.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.788
Oh, okay.
Yes.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.964
Hyung, please, just this once.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:05.049
Ah, not me, but a friend of mine.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.135
I'll collect the interest and loan payments on time.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.928
I'll bring it to you. I'll make sure there are no problems.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.391
Ah, Hyung, you can get the 2nd loan from somewhere else, really.

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.226
Please, just the 1st loan. I really...

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.937
I'm really asking you.
Just this once. I...

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.523
It's because he's a friend I really care about.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.192
Please help me just once, Hyung.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.319
Do you remember how much overdue payment I collected for you back then?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.114
I did that for you for free.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.979
Oh! Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:01.481
Ah, it just came out.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.524
Try it.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.068
It's the best pork stir-fry in Korea. Just amazing!

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.035
Right?
Yes, yes.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.828
Let's eat.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.303
He's a bit prickly, so just bear with him a little.

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:34.138
I'll talk to him nicely.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.056
Okay.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.560
Manager Seo.
Yes.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.020
How much is this worth?

00:08:41.562 --> 00:08:43.231
That one is about 20 million won.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.148
Boss!

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:45.942
Woo-jin is here.

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:48.361
You, you bastard.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:49.904
After not contacting me for years,

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:52.073
you suddenly show up and then what?
Huh?

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.575
Am I supposed to say nice things? Huh?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.911
Ah, I'm sorry.
Forget it.

00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:58.037
Ah, why are you like this?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.957
Ugh, damn it, really.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.333
Sit down.
Hey, sit.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.251
Yes.

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:08.381
[Woo-jin makes a sniffing sound and exhales]

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:09.298
So,

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.551
what did your friend do to get into debt?

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.637
He got caught by those gangster bastards.
It's called Smile Capital.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.222
Smile Capital?

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.057
The one in Gwangang-dong?

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.101
I don't know the location.

00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.645
Aigo, this, damn.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:26.023
Hey, Smile Capital there,
they're not gangsters,

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.441
they're a big corporation, a big corporation.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.360
How much did he borrow?

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:30.820
10 million.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.076
We're screwed, man, huh?

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.078
Ah, so
please help me, Hyung.

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:40.580
Ah, you have a lot of money.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.752
I'll lend you 100 million at 1% interest for a year.

00:49:50.045 --> 00:49:51.046
Oh, thank you, Boss.

00:49:53.134 --> 00:49:56.095
Instead, you work for me
like before, collecting daily loans.

00:49:56.178 --> 00:49:58.848
Thanks to Corona, our industry is booming.

00:49:58.931 --> 01:00:01.183
Let's make a lot of money now and build a building.

01:00:01.767 --> 01:00:03.060
Ah, help me with work.

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:04.562
Whatever you bring in, I'll...

01:00:04.645 --> 01:00:06.480
I'll give you a generous bonus.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.443
Ah, that suddenly...

01:00:10.526 --> 01:00:11.652
Ah, damn.

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:14.155
Let's be hunting dogs together for just one year.

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:17.283
Hey, this is
an opportunity, an opportunity.

01:00:17.366 --> 01:00:19.827
It's an opportunity
to make bigger money.

01:00:20.328 --> 01:00:22.038
Ah, when else will you get to make this much money?

01:00:22.997 --> 01:00:24.665
I understand what you're saying, but

01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:26.334
suddenly like this...

01:00:27.627 --> 01:00:29.378
Ah, decide quickly.
Hyung, let's go.

01:00:31.213 --> 01:00:32.048
Huh?

01:00:32.131 --> 01:00:34.383
If I do daily loans, won't I have to hit people?

01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:39.055
Hitting weak people to make money, that's what thugs do.

01:00:40.473 --> 01:00:41.390
We're boxers.

01:00:44.018 --> 01:00:44.977
Listen, friend.

01:00:45.645 --> 01:00:48.564
If you can't repay Smile Capital's money quickly, you'll really die.

01:00:48.648 --> 01:00:50.274
They'll take all your organs.

01:01:02.536 --> 01:01:03.579
What are you doing?

01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:04.497
Boss.

01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:06.499
Thank you. I'll come back later.

01:01:06.582 --> 01:01:08.125
Yes.

01:01:08.209 --> 01:01:09.752
Hey, let's go, oh.

01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:12.088
Ah, damn it!
Are you playing games with me right now?

01:01:14.048 --> 01:01:15.007
Does it look like a game?

01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:26.018
It's a game, Hyung.

01:01:27.436 --> 01:01:28.688
See you again.

01:01:31.524 --> 01:01:32.400
Hey, let's go.

01:01:35.903 --> 01:01:37.905
Ah, damn it.

01:01:39.365 --> 01:01:40.366
Hey, boxer.

01:01:47.039 --> 01:01:48.708
Stamp it.
Yes.

01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:51.377
If your business goes well,

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.462
give me a cut, okay?

01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:56.132
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very much.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:02.930
You worked hard.
Let's go.

01:02:56.108 --> 01:02:57.985
Where is it?

01:03:11.457 --> 01:03:12.458
No problem?

01:03:13.459 --> 01:03:14.543
No problem, sir.

01:03:15.252 --> 01:03:17.338
Oh, and this...

01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:20.007
This is the money collected today.

01:03:20.966 --> 01:03:23.219
I'm currently going around to various places

01:03:23.302 --> 01:03:25.596
and securing homeless people's IDs.

01:03:25.679 --> 01:03:27.181
Who are you?

01:03:27.264 --> 01:03:29.433
What are you looking at? Get back to work.

01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:30.434
Yes.

01:03:31.894 --> 01:03:34.563
I will work hard
to reach your target amount as soon as possible.

01:03:34.647 --> 01:03:36.524
I'll work hard.

01:03:39.693 --> 01:03:41.987
Can you do it by this week?
By this week.

01:03:42.071 --> 01:03:43.322
I'll try my best. Yes.

01:03:56.544 --> 01:03:59.713
Oh, you've been waiting a long time. Yes?

01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:04.760
Why are you not wearing a mask?

01:04:05.511 --> 01:04:06.345
I'll put it back on.

01:04:06.428 --> 01:04:10.182
No, I'm not saying put it back on, I asked why you took it off.

01:04:10.266 --> 01:04:12.434
I've been waiting for over 30 minutes.

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:13.519
I took it off because I felt stuffy.

01:04:13.602 --> 01:04:14.812
Hey!

01:04:14.895 --> 01:04:17.523
How can a guy with no patience like you
protect other people?

01:04:17.606 --> 01:04:20.442
What does a mask have to do with protecting people?

01:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.735
Get out.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.363
Go, you punk! Tsk.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:26.949
Ah, damn.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.035
Ugh, damn!
Huh?

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:31.036
That bastard, he...

00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:34.248
Ha, damn.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.002
You weren't wearing a mask, were you?
No.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:38.919
I saw you.

00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:40.796
I wasn't wearing it,
but I had it pulled down.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.299
You bastard, if you didn't wear it, you took it off.
Why are you trying to twist your words? You!

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:44.258
Get out!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.135
You're not leaving?

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:47.928
Ah, damn it.

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.307
"Ah, damn it"?

00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:53.893
"Ah, damn it"?

00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:55.394
Me, you!

00:04:58.606 --> 00:04:59.648
Pull your mask down.

00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:05.112
What's your name?

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:06.780
My name is Cheon Dong-woo.

00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:08.198
Oh, your height?

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:10.242
187 cm, 74 kg.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.869
What sports did you do?

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:14.288
I practiced kickboxing and hapkido for 10 years.

00:05:14.872 --> 00:05:15.873
What was your major?

05:15:956 --> 05:17:499
I graduated from Yongheon University, Department of Security.

05:20:294 --> 05:23:255
Ah, this is an elite, huh?

05:23:339 --> 05:24:298
Military service?

05:24:381 --> 05:25:299
I was exempted.

05:26:425 --> 05:28:260
My ACL was torn playing foot volleyball.

05:29:428 --> 05:30:262
Ah...

05:32:014 --> 05:32:848
See you next time.

05:32:932 --> 05:34:767
Why are you doing this? Can I ask?

05:34:850 --> 05:36:727
I'm looking for a Marine.

05:36:810 --> 05:38:228
Does it have to be a Marine?

05:38:312 --> 05:40:147
Yes, yes, yes.

05:40:648 --> 05:44:193
Ah, damn, then you should have written that in the job ad.

05:44:276 --> 05:46:362
Wait a minute, "Ah, damn"?

05:46:445 --> 05:48:447
Ah, you just wasted my time!

05:48:530 --> 05:50:991
Ah, you shouldn't talk like that in front of an elder.

05:51:075 --> 05:52:284
Elder or not,

05:52:368 --> 05:54:370
an elder shouldn't act like that.

05:58:374 --> 06:00:167
See you next time, okay?

06:00:751 --> 06:01:585
Yes!

06:23:315 --> 06:24:274
Come on.

06:25:734 --> 06:26:902
Why are you suddenly running?

06:26:986 --> 06:28:112
I'm 734th batch!

06:31:865 --> 06:33:492
In Korea,

06:33:575 --> 06:36:370
there's only one person who can move 1 trillion won in cash
with a single phone call.

06:36:453 --> 06:37:579
Chairman Bang Sung-ho.

06:38:330 --> 06:39:540
Ah...

06:41:667 --> 06:43:836
And there's only one person
who knows Chairman Bang's face.

06:43:919 --> 06:45:004
Only one of each, it seems.

06:45:087 --> 06:46:797
Hold on.

06:46:880 --> 06:49:341
Chairman Bang, a legendary figure,
only trusted and raised one person:

06:49:425 --> 06:52:553
CEO Choi.

06:52:636 --> 06:54:096
And because CEO Choi is here,

06:54:179 --> 06:55:889
I'm able to make a living in this industry.

06:55:973 --> 06:58:600
You understand this worldview, right?

06:58:684 --> 07:01:103
Yes.
Ah, yes.

07:01:186 --> 07:02:229
Oh, good, oh.

07:02:312 --> 07:04:523
CEO Choi
is currently looking for someone.

07:04:606 --> 07:07:359
"Someone who can risk their life to protect people at any moment,"

07:07:860 --> 07:09:198
"someone with extremely excellent character,"

07:09:699 --> 07:11:321
"and who has at least some knowledge of our business,"
he said.

07:11:864 --> 07:13:198
So I've been meeting people since yesterday and today,

07:13:282 --> 07:17:286
but every single one is inadequate.

07:17:369 --> 07:21:623
At that moment,

07:21:707 --> 07:23:125
my junior Marine called me.

07:23:208 --> 07:24:752
The timing is perfect!
Ah, great!

07:24:835 --> 07:27:796
My brother is also a Marine.
He's my senior.

07:27:880 --> 07:31:008
He's a Marine!
Ah, great!

07:31:091 --> 07:33:677
"What batch is he?"

07:34:261 --> 07:35:137
What batch is he?

07:35:220 --> 07:36:722
He's from the 1207th batch.

07:36:805 --> 07:38:974
I'm from the 734th batch.

07:40:267 --> 07:43:103
Oh? Oh.
Ah, excellent, oh?

07:43:187 --> 07:46:607
I'll specially recommend
two Marines to the boss, so

07:47:691 --> 07:49:026
write your resident registration number here.

07:49:109 --> 07:50:527
Um, Senior...

07:51:987 --> 07:55:699
Actually, we needed a loan,
so we contacted you.

07:56:325 --> 07:59:536
That's why I'm telling you
to go see the boss.

08:00:120 --> 08:01:705
He's like a Baekdu Mountain tiger, but

08:01:789 --> 08:04:792
he's truly, really, deep and broad-minded.

08:04:875 --> 08:06:835
Once he accepts someone as his own,

08:06:919 --> 08:09:296
he takes responsibility until the end. He's a true Marine!

08:10:005 --> 08:11:340
Is he a senior?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.343
Is CEO Choi a Marine?

08:14.426 --> 08:15.511
Yes.

08:17.387 --> 08:20.140
He, uh, dropped out of middle school,
so I think he was exempted.

08:21.517 --> 08:23.685
Ah, it's like how hip-hop artists say

08:23.769 --> 08:25.395
"this is hip-hop" or "that's hip-hop,"

08:25.479 --> 08:27.773
he must have said it symbolically, right?

08:30.567 --> 08:33.987
What, what are you saying?
Ah, write your resident registration number!

08:34.488 --> 08:35.322
Ah, yes!

08:42.412 --> 08:43.539
I saw the senior's expression.

08:43.622 --> 08:45.457
It wasn't bad, I think it'll work out.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.668
Thank you, Hyung.
Let's go.

08:47.751 --> 08:49.419
What are you thanking me for, kid?

08:50.337 --> 08:52.464
Hey, but
how many people did you fight?

08:53.549 --> 08:54.424
About ten?

08:54.925 --> 08:56.927
But I got beaten by one person.

08:57.469 --> 08:58.303
One person?

08:58.804 --> 01:02:141
He was really big, and after he grabbed me, he headbutted me.

01:02:224 --> 01:04:309
Ah, damn, a headbutt, there's no answer to that.

01:06:812 --> 01:08:564
Hey, so what if

01:09:565 --> 01:11:275
instead of paying off your mom's debt,

01:11:775 --> 01:13:610
they tell you to be a hunting dog?
What would you do?

01:19:491 --> 01:21:34
Let's think about it together.

01:34:631 --> 01:36:49
It's Moon Kwang-mu after all.

01:36:550 --> 01:37:801
Yes, thank you.

01:38:302 --> 01:39:469
Oh, no, no, no.

01:39:553 --> 01:41:430
No, we'll take care of that.
Mr. Oh is very good at that.

01:41:513 --> 01:43:682
Yes.

01:44:266 --> 01:45:392
Okay, let's eat at Yang Joong's place soon.

01:45:475 --> 01:47:352
Yes.

01:47:436 --> 01:49:553
Yang Jae-myeong collected 400 million in cash
from seven private loan sharks in Chungjeongno and Myeong-dong today.

01:50:157 --> 01:53:577
He handed it over to an executive at a company called Smile Capital in Gwangang-dong.

01:53:657 --> 01:54:912
Do you know them?

01:55:001 --> 01:55:835
Ah, no.

01:57:331 --> 01:58:916
This Yang Jae-myeong creates
ghost corporations under homeless people's names,

01:58:999 --> 02:02:001
and then borrows money from loan sharks.

02:02:084 --> 02:03:961
Private loan sharks don't share information with each other,

02:04:545 --> 02:07:547
and since they don't know this trick, they fall for it.

02:07:631 --> 02:10:217
They realize they've been tricked when they go to the company to collect the money, right?

02:10:300 --> 02:12:890
This was designed by someone
who knows the flow of money well.

02:13:732 --> 02:15:359
Yang Jae-myeong is just a pawn.

02:15:442 --> 02:17:362
How does Grandpa know?

02:17:445 --> 02:20:001
2001? 2002?

02:20:084 --> 02:22:877
He pretended to volunteer
at a facility for the disabled,

02:22:961 --> 02:24:034
stole the IDs of disabled people,

02:24:534 --> 02:27:329
created ghost corporations,
and with those corporate accounts,

02:27:412 --> 02:28:956
he borrowed over 7 billion won
from Myeong-dong loan sharks,

02:29:456 --> 02:32:084
and fled to the Philippines.

02:32:167 --> 02:33:627
That's tens of billions in today's money.

02:34:419 --> 02:36:88
Are we just going to stand by?

02:36:971 --> 02:37:805
Huh?

02:38:467 --> 02:40:467
Ah, those loan sharks are being taken advantage of.

02:40:550 --> 02:42:930
In a way, they're your grandpa's juniors.

02:42:999 --> 02:44:001
Ah, well, they'll figure it out themselves.

02:44:084 --> 02:47:432
Loan sharks can't report it to the police, can they?

02:47:516 --> 02:48:977
Hyun-ju.

02:49:061 --> 02:51:145
This is a problem they have to solve themselves.

02:51:983 --> 02:53:401
I

02:53:026 --> 02:54:444
am a man who doesn't exist in this world.

02:55:028 --> 02:56:571
I've lived that way for 10 years.

02:57:155 --> 02:57:990
Ugh.

02:58:073 --> 03:01:285
Then what happened to
the person who went to the Philippines then?

03:01:368 --> 03:02:244
Did they catch him?

03:02:327 --> 03:04:329
The people who had their money stolen by that guy

03:04:413 --> 03:07:082
gathered hunting dogs and sent them to the Philippines.

03:07:582 --> 03:08:458
Did he die?

03:12:713 --> 03:14:631
That's brutal.

03:14:715 --> 03:15:882
Hey, Hyun-ju.

03:15:966 --> 03:18:510
How about I assign someone to work with you?

03:18:557 --> 03:19:934
Ah, no, I don't want that.

03:20:414 --> 03:22:979
No, it's a bit dangerous, isn't it?
You get hurt like this.

03:23:061 --> 03:24:930
Ugh, it's just a scratch.

03:25:013 --> 03:26:848
Ah, even so...

03:26:932 --> 03:28:808
Oh, it's faster and easier for me to go alone.

03:28:891 --> 03:29:725
No.

03:29:809 --> 03:30:927
Go to sleep!

03:32:679 --> 03:33:513
Ah, nice shot!

03:34:722 --> 03:35:532
Representative.

03:35:615 --> 03:37:242
Why did you do that to the kid's face?

03:44:249 --> 03:45:500
Who told you?

03:45:584 --> 03:47:627
I asked In-beom.

03:48:462 --> 03:49:838
Beom tells you things like that?

03:49:921 --> 03:51:882
Well, he tells me.

03:51:965 --> 03:52:841
Just this one for me.

03:57:262 --> 03:59:056
Ah, that's good.
Good shot!

04:02:434 --> 04:05:187
He spat on my face in front of all the kids.

04:06:813 --> 04:08:482
He showed it off as a showcase, I guess.

04:09:483 --> 04:11:943
If you step in directly, I'll have more work.

04:17:199 --> 04:18:158
Jang-do.

04:19:242 --> 04:23:413
You have to step in when you have to.
That's how the kids get scared.

04:23:597 --> 04:24:298
Yes.

04:26:552 --> 04:29:878
By the way, why hasn't this rich kid called yet?

04:29:961 --> 04:31:254
It's been over a week.

04:31:797 --> 04:34:299
I'll talk to Manager Park and arrange a meeting quickly.

04:34:383 --> 04:35:634
Let's win him over in one go.

04:36:343 --> 04:37:177
Let's do that.

04:58:490 --> 05:01:785
Oh, you've really built your body well.

05:01:868 --> 05:04:704
Didn't you also do boxing in the past, Chairman?

05:04:788 --> 05:07:165
Oh, I was just an amateur.

05:07:249 --> 05:09:084
Just by looking at this body,

05:09:167 --> 05:10:877
I can see diligence and passion.

05:10:961 --> 05:13:296
The body doesn't lie, does it?

05:13:380 --> 05:14:798
That's right, Chairman.

05:14:881 --> 05:19:302
But that friend knows nothing about private loans.

05:21:847 --> 05:22:681
Ah, yes.

05:22:764 --> 05:25:809
This friend has been hanging out with Kim Geon-woo lately.

05:25:892 --> 05:27:436
According to the detective agency,

05:28:562 --> 05:31:314
he beat up some gangsters in Incheon
and then fled to the Marines.

05:31:398 --> 05:33:400
He lived diligently after being discharged.

05:33:483 --> 05:35:777
And he's collected daily loans, so he probably knows the basics.

05:35:861 --> 05:39:406
I thought it would be good if they both came in together.

05:40:615 --> 05:43:827
I'll just see the friend named Geon-woo for now.

05:43:912 --> 05:44:746
Yes.

05:45:541 --> 05:46:375
Oh, there he is.

05:47:027 --> 05:48:737
Come in.
Ah?

05:48:820 --> 05:50:197
Yes.
Ah...

05:50:280 --> 05:51:115
Yes.

06:28:693 --> 06:30:612
Hello. My name is Kim Geon-woo.

06:30:695 --> 06:32:781
Ah, sit down.

06:32:864 --> 06:33:698
Yes.

06:42:415 --> 06:44:751
Um, can I speak informally?

06:44:834 --> 06:46:253
Yes.

06:52:551 --> 06:54:344
Ah, did you hurt your face?

06:54:886 --> 06:59:349
Ah, loan sharks damaged my mother's cafe,
and I got hurt trying to stop them.

07:02:143 --> 07:04:312
I used to do private loans.

07:05:772 --> 07:08:900
Uh, it's been a while since I quit.

07:08:984 --> 07:10:360
Yes.

07:10:443 --> 07:14:030
Now, I lend money without interest
to people who are sick and can't afford treatment.

07:15:156 --> 07:17:409
Yes.

07:17:993 --> 07:18:827
Yes.

07:21:871 --> 07:23:456
Ah, I'm looking for someone.

07:24:833 --> 07:28:295
There's a young friend who's learning the ropes from me...

07:28:962 --> 07:30:046
Ah...

07:30:130 --> 07:31:881
Uh, not by blood,

07:33:466 --> 07:35:093
but he's the only family I have.

07:35:677 --> 07:36:720
Yes.

07:36:803 --> 07:39:222
I worry a lot that he might get hurt
if he goes around alone.

07:39:306 --> 07:40:599
I worry a lot.

07:41:891 --> 07:46:313
Uh, so I wanted a good person
to watch over him.

07:47:564 --> 07:50:275
Ah! Then it's not daily loans?

07:50:358 --> 07:52:736
Uh, uh, not daily loans.

07:54:487 --> 7:55:363
It's bodyguard work.

07:55:447 --> 07:57:198
Uh, uh, yes!

08:00:243 --> 08:03:038
This might sound offensive, but

08:03:788 --> 08:05:915
I looked into your story, Geon-woo.

08:05:999 --> 08:08:001
Uh, I'm not offended at all.

08:08:084 --> 08:11:296
You didn't lose your good heart
even in difficult circumstances,

08:12:547 --> 08:14:507
and I heard you lived diligently.

08:14:591 --> 08:16:926
Ah, meeting you in person,

08:17:010 --> 08:18:720
your eyes are strong, and

08:21:431 --> 08:22:974
I trust you.

08:23:058 --> 08:24:100
Thank you!

08:29:356 --> 08:30:190
Ah...

08:32:776 --> 08:34:235
Why did you start boxing?

08:34:819 --> 08:36:446
I wanted to be strong when I was young.

08:37:030 --> 08:37:864
Why?

08:38:740 --> 08:41:368
My father wasn't someone who drank originally,

08:42:369 --> 08:44:996
but when I was in 7th grade,
things got a bit difficult for us,

08:45:080 --> 08:47:540
and he started drinking and hitting my mother.

08:48:124 --> 08:50:794
Seeing that, I wanted to become strong, even as a child.

08:54:089 --> 08:55:131
Do you live together?

08:55:215 --> 08:56:049
No.

08:56:132 --> 08:59:219
Uh, they divorced when I was in 9th grade.

08:59:302 --> 09:00:387
I haven't seen him since then.

09:01:513 --> 09:03:932
I'm a country person.
Yes.

09:04:015 --> 09:07:394
My father was a tenant farmer.

09:07:477 --> 09:08:436
Ah, yes.

09:08:520 --> 09:10:897
When I was ten,

09:10:980 --> 09:13:191
I remember it vividly.

09:13:775 --> 09:16:986
There was a severe drought,
and the harvest failed that year.

09:17:070 --> 09:18:988
Since we couldn't pay the rent,

09:19:572 --> 09:21:950
the landlord made his servants

09:23:034 --> 09:24:828
beat my father mercilessly
in front of the villagers.

09:27:414 --> 09:29:582
They beat my father
so badly.

09:30:166 --> 09:32:168
Mm.
My father's head

09:32:252 --> 09:33:795
was severely injured,

09:33:878 --> 09:36:506
but we had no money for a hospital, so

09:38:258 --> 09:40:427
he suffered at home and then passed away.

09:41:094 --> 09:44:347
So I clenched my teeth and decided to make money.

09:44:931 --> 09:47:726
I thought I would help
people who couldn't get treatment because they had no money.

09:49:519 --> 09:51:563
I thought I would help.

09:58:737 --> 10:02:866
Ah, we should overcome these difficult circumstances
with a good heart.

10:02:949 --> 10:06:369
That's what I'm saying, with a good heart.

10:06:453 --> 10:09:748
Yes, I always have a good heart.

10:15:879 --> 10:17:297
The conversation's stopped?

10:17:380 --> 10:20:800
Yes, ah, I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at talking.

10:20:884 --> 10:23:052
Ah, really?
Yes.

10:26:431 --> 10:28:016
"Investigator Hwang"

10:28:099 --> 10:29:434
Hey, come here.
Yes.

10:31:311 --> 10:32:145
How was it?

10:33:605 --> 10:35:106
I think I did well.

10:35:190 --> 10:37:901
The chairman talked a lot,
so I listened well.

10:37:984 --> 01:41:738
Ah, see?
I told you it would go well. Damn.

01:42:238 --> 01:44:324
Hey.

01:44:407 --> 01:45:658
How was it?

01:46:242 --> 01:48:620
He's definitely not fun.

01:51:456 --> 01:52:582
But he's a good kid.

01:54:918 --> 01:56:085
Yes.

01:59:798 --> 02:01:674
Be careful.

02:03:259 --> 02:06:679
He seems to be in a hurry for money.
Please resolve it by today.

02:06:763 --> 02:07:597
Yes.

02:08:890 --> 02:10:141
Hey, hey, just give me a little, just a little.

02:10:225 --> 02:11:893
Eat a lot, Hyung.
Too much...

02:15:980 --> 02:17:190
Yes.

02:17:273 --> 02:19:192
Even without side dishes, it tastes good.

02:19:275 --> 02:22:153
Mom, I really like kimchi stew.

02:22:237 --> 02:23:571
Let me try this...

02:23:655 --> 02:24:739
Ah, yes, yes.

02:27:158 --> 02:28:576
Ah!
Oh, it's hot, but...

02:28:660 --> 02:30:995
Oh, it's so delicious.
Ah, I'll eat well!

02:31:079 --> 02:32:747
Yes, please enjoy your meal.

02:34:082 --> 02:39:003
Ah, I don't know how reassuring it is that you helped me this time.

02:39:087 --> 02:42:382
Ah, not at all.
He's my precious friend, and also...

02:43:591 --> 02:44:926
Marine Corps, 'Ack'!

02:45:009 --> 02:46:845
Everything will be resolved well.

02:48:680 --> 02:49:514
Thank you.

02:49:597 --> 02:51:266
Ah, eat quickly.

02:51:349 --> 02:52:475
Yes!
I'll eat well.

02:52:559 --> 02:53:977
Oh, yes, eat a lot.

02:56:104 --> 02:57:146
Who is it?

02:58:147 --> 02:59:440
I'll go out.
Oh.

03:00:275 --> 03:01:359
Who are you?

03:04:445 --> 03:06:114
Oh, who...

03:06:197 --> 03:08:074
I'm someone who serves Chairman Choi.

03:08:825 --> 03:09:742
Ah...

03:13:121 --> 03:14:455
Ah, hello.

03:14:539 --> 03:16:749
Here's 100 million won.

03:16:833 --> 03:17:750
Yes?

03:17:834 --> 03:20:461
He said it's two years' worth of salary in advance.

03:22:672 --> 03:23:506
No...

03:31:014 --> 03:32:932
Your shift starts at 10 AM tomorrow.

03:33:016 --> 03:35:643
I'll send you the office address by text.

03:40:148 --> 03:41:399
Thank you, I...

03:41:900 --> 03:43:943
Really, really thank you.

03:44:027 --> 03:46:863
Ah, you should thank Chairman Choi.

03:46:946 --> 03:48:031
Yes.
Alright then.

03:48:823 --> 03:50:950
Thank you very much.

04:17:644 --> 04:19:562
This egg roll is so delicious.

04:20:063 --> 04:21:439
I'll make you more, eat.

04:23:358 --> 04:25:109
Who is it?

04:27:612 --> 04:28:446
This...

04:31:824 --> 04:34:077
Uh, Mom, I actually,

04:34:160 --> 04:36:663
through a friend of Woo-jin Hyung,
found a job.

04:37:497 --> 04:38:414
What kind?

04:38:998 --> 04:43:378
It's a job protecting a family member
of a very wealthy CEO,

04:44:545 --> 04:46:798
and the CEO took a real liking to me,

04:46:881 --> 04:50:301
so he gave me 100 million won
as two years' worth of salary.

04:53:638 --> 04:55:932
R-really?
Yes.

04:56:015 --> 04:59:352
Mom, let's pay off our debt quickly with this first.

04:59:435 --> 05:00:311
So the interest doesn't increase.

05:08:695 --> 05:11:531
I feel like I ruined all your dreams.

05:12:824 --> 05:14:075
No, Mom, I...

05:16:202 --> 05:19:497
The most important thing to me is
living happily with you, okay?

05:19:580 --> 05:21:290
I'll work hard and exercise,

05:21:374 --> 05:23:292
and after Corona,
I can start exercising again, Mom.

05:23:376 --> 05:24:210
It's okay.

05:26:629 --> 05:28:464
I'm so sorry, Mom.

05:32:176 --> 05:33:219
Let's...

05:33:720 --> 05:37:056
Let's smile, Mom, okay?
Let's smile, it's a good thing.

05:39:100 --> 05:39:976
Yes.

05:45:231 --> 05:46:441
Thank you, Hyung.

06:08:337 --> 06:09:881
Hello.
Hey, you, come out.

06:09:964 --> 06:11:007
Brother, come here.

06:12:967 --> 06:13:801
Why?

06:14:635 --> 06:16:012
The customer came 20 minutes ago.

06:16:095 --> 06:16:929
He came early.

06:17:013 --> 06:19:182
He's the eldest son of Ail Group, right?

06:19:265 --> 06:20:349
You know him?

06:20:433 --> 06:22:727
Brother, be careful with him.

06:22:810 --> 06:24:187
Why?
Here!

06:24:270 --> 06:26:230
Yes.

06:26:314 --> 06:28:066
Give me some wet wipes, wet wipes.

06:28:149 --> 06:30:401
Ah, I pressed the bell so many times, but no one came.

06:30:485 --> 06:32:570
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'll bring them right away.

06:32:653 --> 06:34:697
When I was a junior madam at Speed,

06:34:781 --> 06:36:657
he drank with our head madam and fought with her.

06:36:741 --> 06:37:950
Hyun-ji?

06:38:034 --> 06:38:993
Yes.

06:39:077 --> 06:41:662
Ah, they argued a bit while drinking and talking politics,

06:41:746 --> 06:43:372
and a few days later,

06:43:456 --> 06:45:166
the store got a tax audit.

06:45:750 --> 06:48:169
She even sold her house to prevent a tax bomb, she said.

06:48:795 --> 06:52:173
I later found out that there's no one in his family who isn't connected.

06:52:256 --> 06:54:717
National Tax Service, Financial Supervisory Service, National Police Agency.

06:55:468 --> 06:56:761
They have family everywhere.

06:56:844 --> 06:58:554
That's how chaebols are.

06:59:263 --> 07:00:515
Really?

07:00:598 --> 07:03:059
The politician Hyun-ji cursed at
could be a family member.

07:03:142 --> 07:04:644
Ah...

07:05:520 --> 07:07:730
No, I'm just worried about you, brother.

07:09:232 --> 07:10:108
Okay.

07:10:942 --> 07:12:527
Did you set up some pretty girls over there?

07:13:444 --> 07:14:946
He said not to set any up.

07:17:990 --> 07:19:700
Okay, don't worry, okay?

07:22:078 --> 07:24:038
I brought someone.
Who?

07:24:122 --> 07:25:248
My senior from the police academy.

07:28:668 --> 07:29:502
Active duty?

07:30:002 --> 07:32:046
Yes, he graduated at the top of his class at the police academy.

07:35:341 --> 07:36:175
Do you know him?

07:37:844 --> 07:39:804
I don't think so, there's a big difference in our batches.

07:46:727 --> 07:48:271
No matter what happens, hold it in.

07:48:980 --> 07:50:898
Understood?
Yes.

07:55:236 --> 07:56:737
I'll ask him to make a call.

07:57:905 --> 08:00:199
Tsk.
Ah, why bother...

08:00:825 --> 08:02:493
Hello.

08:02:577 --> 08:03:452
Ah, you're here?

08:04:662 --> 08:07:540
Ah, this is my cousin.

08:07:623 --> 08:09:167
His name is Min Kang-yong.

08:09:667 --> 08:10:835
Ah, you have a good voice.

08:10:918 --> 08:12:587
Yes, my name is Kim Myeong-gil.

08:12:670 --> 08:15:339
Ah, I was going home, and my brother said he was drinking whiskey,

08:15:423 --> 08:16:424
so I shamelessly joined in.

08:16:507 --> 08:19:844
I heard you're a big shot, so it's an honor to meet you.

08:19:927 --> 08:21:095
Ah, the honor is mine.

08:21:971 --> 08:24:724
This is Lee Jin-su, who works with me.

08:25:308 --> 08:26:517
Ah... we...

08:26:601 --> 08:28:603
I've seen him somewhere.
Right?

08:28:686 --> 08:30:521
I have a common face, so.

08:30:605 --> 08:32:023
I'm sorry.

08:32:106 --> 08:34:025
Please sit.

08:34:108 --> 08:34:942
Yes.

08:37:653 --> 08:39:113
I didn't want to receive without giving, so

08:39:655 --> 08:40:531
I brought my own.

08:41:157 --> 08:42:450
I was planning to buy tonight.

08:46:495 --> 08:47:371
Please take it.

08:52:793 --> 08:55:046
This friend can't drink.
I'm sorry.

08:55:129 --> 08:58:174
Ah... it's awkward if he's the only sober one.

08:58:257 --> 09:00:009
Ah, still,

09:00:092 --> 09:02:595
if we all get drunk together,
no one can deny anything later.

09:02:678 --> 09:05:890
Then our representative will be a loyal knight for him.

09:05:973 --> 09:07:225
You seem like a good drinker.

09:07:308 --> 09:08:684
Loyalty is good.

09:10:269 --> 09:11:562
Okay, give it to me.

09:25:576 --> 09:27:286
Wow, you drink well.

09:27:787 --> 09:28:829
It's smooth, right?

09:29:538 --> 09:30:373
Yes.

09:30:915 --> 09:32:291
I'll pour you a drink.

09:33:834 --> 09:35:002
Would you like it in a glass?

09:35:920 --> 09:37:755
Ah, you seem to be thinking of a cup.

09:38:256 --> 09:40:007
Give it to me in a cup.
Yes.

09:44:011 --> 09:45:888
This,
a civil servant who only drinks soju and beer

09:45:972 --> 09:49:433
is drinking Blue Label in a cup.
I'm so lucky today!

09:54:105 --> 09:56:023
Ah-ah!

09:57:233 --> 09:58:484
Here, have a drink.

01:26:929 --> 01:28:472
Wow, you drink well.

01:29:056 --> 01:31:892
It's my drink,
give me a glass too.

01:32:852 --> 01:33:686
Huh?

01:34:312 --> 01:35:896
Then I'll just hold it with one hand.

01:41:193 --> 01:42:028
Go ahead.

01:56:667 --> 01:57:752
Have a drink.

02:03:883 --> 02:05:801
Oh, damn.

02:07:011 --> 02:07:845
Cheers!

02:09:388 --> 02:10:264
Bottoms up?

02:24:236 --> 02:26:614
You two are good drinkers.

02:26:697 --> 02:29:450
Hyung, if I make a mistake while drunk today,

02:29:533 --> 02:31:077
stop me.
Okay.

02:31:160 --> 02:31:994
If it's too much...

02:32:078 --> 02:33:746
Where'd he go? Hyung...

02:38:250 --> 02:39:126
I'll arrest you.

02:45:925 --> 02:47:176
Let's raise our glasses, yes.

03:04:777 --> 03:05:903
Damn... damn.

03:07:113 --> 03:09:532
We're all men drinking together,

03:10:783 --> 03:12:118
so how about we be honest?

03:13:119 --> 03:14:036
Let's do it.

03:15:830 --> 03:16:747
Do you have a lot of money?

03:16:831 --> 03:19:417
I'm a dirt poor, so I'm working hard to earn it.

03:21:168 --> 03:22:211
Do you have 100 billion won?

03:23:379 --> 03:24:422
With money,

03:25:131 --> 03:26:590
I don't lie.

03:26:674 --> 03:28:259
Ah, really?

03:29:760 --> 03:31:220
But that's strange.

03:31:303 --> 03:34:598
Someone we know said that even if you completely empty
Smile Capital,

03:35:307 --> 03:36:934
it wouldn't even have 500 million.

03:37:017 --> 03:38:477
Ah, right.

03:38:561 --> 03:41:355
These days, it seems the National Tax Service
isn't doing its job properly.

03:41:439 --> 03:42:440
Should I make a call?

03:43:691 --> 03:45:151
Our friend is drunk.

03:45:234 --> 03:47:945
Representative, you just got serious.
Apologize quickly.

03:48:571 --> 03:49:655
Ah, ah, I'm sorry.

03:50:239 --> 03:52:241
Ugh, I drank on an empty stomach, so

03:53:325 --> 03:54:785
Ah, it's really getting to me, damn it.

03:54:869 --> 03:57:538
You don't have to worry about money.

03:59:123 --> 04:00:207
Is that so?

04:00:875 --> 04:01:917
I see.

04:02:877 --> 04:05:629
I definitely shouldn't worry about money then.

04:07:798 --> 04:09:550
But my mother

04:10:259 --> 04:12:136
told me to say hello to Chairman Bang.

04:12:970 --> 04:14:555
She said thank you very much for that day.

04:16:056 --> 04:18:601
But the person who brought the money that day was...

04:22:229 --> 04:24:356
She said he was in his mid-40s.

04:25:483 --> 04:29:487
How is it that you're still in your mid-40s after 20 years, Chairman?

04:30:696 --> 04:31:780
Did he get a facelift?

04:33:616 --> 04:35:117
It's common these days.

04:37:661 --> 04:41:165
Ah, you thought I wouldn't ask my mother?

04:41:248 --> 04:43:250
Huh?
Ah, what?

04:43:334 --> 04:44:835
You're silent?

04:45:503 --> 04:46:337
Huh?

04:46:837 --> 04:49:548
Are you the type to shut up when things get difficult?

04:52:468 --> 04:54:678
Did they teach you that in prison?

04:58:057 --> 04:59:642
Aigo, he's laughing now.

04:59:725 --> 05:01:852
Ah, yes, laugh, laugh.

05:01:936 --> 05:04:730
Ugh, damn it.

05:04:813 --> 05:05:648
Hyung!

05:05:731 --> 05:09:318
The fun's over, let's just end this.

05:10:569 --> 05:11:612
Representative.

05:12:238 --> 05:13:572
I made 1000 of them.

05:14:740 --> 05:17:034
So we won't see each other again, and

05:19:078 --> 05:20:162
Mr. Kim, come here.

05:22:289 --> 05:23:541
Come here, quickly.

05:29:922 --> 05:31:632
Mm.

05:34:426 --> 05:35:678
Just one more time.

05:36:262 --> 05:38:347
If you mess with my family's name,

05:40:182 --> 05:41:392
you'll die.

05:47:439 --> 05:48:315
Understood?

05:49:316 --> 05:50:776
Huh?

05:52:486 --> 05:56:198
You really lived diligently.
You have a stab wound here, huh?

05:56:282 --> 05:57:741
My intuition was right.

05:57:825 --> 05:58:826
Ah, go.

05:58:909 --> 06:01:453
Ah, let's go, ugh.
We stayed too long, damn it.

06:01:537 --> 06:04:415
Oh, Representative.
I tried to see you in a good light, tsk.

06:04:498 --> 06:05:874
Because it seemed like you lived diligently.
Oh, get out of here...

06:05:958 --> 06:06:792
Ah, damn it.

06:19:305 --> 06:20:556
Jang-do.

06:20:639 --> 06:21:890
Yes.

06:22:891 --> 06:25:728
Go out with Beom
and find a weakness for him.

06:26:478 --> 06:27:646
A strong one.

06:29:690 --> 06:30:524
Understood.

06:32:693 --> 06:33:944
"Antique Art Market"

06:37:948 --> 06:39:033
Oh!

06:40:367 --> 06:42:703
Thank you for coming with me, Hyung.

06:42:786 --> 06:44:330
Ah, no, no.

06:46:540 --> 06:47:374
Why?

06:48:459 --> 06:49:460
Why?

06:49:543 --> 06:51:295
Ah, are you going in too, Hyung?

06:51:378 --> 06:53:672
Uh, I also
made an appeal to the chairman,

06:53:756 --> 06:55:007
thinking about getting a job.

06:55:090 --> 06:55:966
It'd be good to have me there, wouldn't it?

06:56:050 --> 06:57:760
Uh, I'd love it.

06:57:843 --> 06:59:970
Right, so you just chime in beside me.

07:00:054 --> 07:01:472
Add a little MSG!

07:01:555 --> 07:02:389
Yes.

07:02:473 --> 07:03:307
Good, let's go.

07:25:704 --> 07:27:373
Hello!
Hello!

07:30:084 --> 07:31:126
Yes, you found your way well.

07:31:210 --> 07:34:254
Yes! This morning, with the money the chairman gave me,

07:34:338 --> 07:35:881
I paid off all the loans.

07:35:964 --> 07:38:842
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very much.

07:40:928 --> 07:42:805
I trust you'll do well.

07:42:888 --> 07:44:765
I'll do my best.

07:44:848 --> 07:46:100
Hello, Chairman!

07:46:183 --> 07:48:185
My name is Hong, Woo, Jin,

07:48:268 --> 07:50:896
and I briefly worked for Manager Moon in the past.

07:51:397 --> 07:53:232
Geon-woo and I became sworn brothers
during our Marine Corps days.

07:53:732 --> 07:54:858
We're very close.

07:54:942 --> 07:56:026
Yes.

07:56:110 --> 07:58:904
I've been watching Geon-woo's situation
by his side,

07:58:987 --> 08:00:322
and I wanted to help him somehow.

08:00:406 --> 08:02:408
Honestly, with my abilities,
there was nothing I could do to help,

08:02:491 --> 08:04:993
so as his older brother, I was in a lot of pain.

08:05:077 --> 08:06:704
But I'm so relieved that a good person
like you, Chairman,

08:06:787 --> 08:08:455
gave us help, and I'm very grateful as Geon-woo's brother.

08:08:539 --> 08:10:124
And furthermore, I, Hong Woo-jin,

08:10:207 --> 08:12:167
felt that I could be of help.

08:12:251 --> 08:14:253
As I'm more familiar with this type of work...

08:14:336 --> 08:16:296
Uh, I'm too embarrassed to mention my experience
in front of you, Chairman, the legend of Myeong-dong.

08:17:673 --> 08:20:050
However, I know more than Geon-woo,

08:20:050 --> 08:22:886
so I thought it would be helpful for Geon-woo to adapt to the work

08:22:970 --> 08:25:889
if I joined him at the beginning.

08:25:973 --> 08:27:725
I thought, 'Wouldn't it be helpful?'

08:27:808 --> 08:29:601
'Wouldn't it be helpful in a small way?'

08:30:269 --> 08:31:270
'No, perhaps in a quite large way.'

08:32:020 --> 08:34:356
'Wouldn't it be quite helpful?'

08:34:440 --> 08:35:441
'Wouldn't it be quite helpful?'

08:35:524 --> 08:36:650
'Wouldn't it be quite helpful?'

08:36:734 --> 08:39:278
With that in mind, I came here despite being rude.

08:39:862 --> 08:41:113
If you grant me permission, Chairman,

08:41:196 --> 08:43:323
I want to work with Geon-woo and help him!

08:50:205 --> 08:51:790
Sure, why not?

08:55:502 --> 08:56:420
Thank you!

08:57:755 --> 08:59:465
Uh, sit down.
Yes!

09:02:301 --> 09:03:927
Thank you.
Thank you!

09:05:012 --> 09:07:431
There's one thing I didn't tell you.

09:07:514 --> 09:08:474
Ah...

09:08:557 --> 09:10:267
I'll give you the salary,

09:10:350 --> 09:11:727
but I'm not the one who hired you.

09:12:436 --> 09:13:270
Yes?

09:13:353 --> 09:15:564
There's still an interview left, with Hyun-ju.

09:17:775 --> 09:18:942
Ah...

09:19:026 --> 09:23:030
Uh, if, if I fail the interview, what happens?

09:23:113 --> 09:25:073
Well, I'd have to take back the salary.

09:25:657 --> 09:26:492
Uh...

09:26:992 --> 09:30:245
I, I, I already spent it all paying off my loan.

09:30:329 --> 09:32:080
I trust you'll do well.

09:32:748 --> 09:33:582
Yes?

09:34:082 --> 09:35:793
Ah...
Hyun-ju

09:36:502 --> 09:39:463
is very much against
having someone assigned to her.

09:39:546 --> 09:42:633
But I'm really not good at talking, Chairman.

09:42:716 --> 09:44:009
Fighting!

09:44:092 --> 09:46:428
Uh, Chairman, if, uh, what if...

09:46:512 --> 09:50:599
If I can persuade Hyun-ju to hire me and Geon-woo,

09:50:682 --> 09:52:059
can I also get a salary?

09:54:645 --> 09:55:979
Sure.

09:56:814 --> 09:57:648
Hyung...

09:58:774 --> 01:01:485
I have a scalp massage appointment, so...

01:01:568 --> 01:02:861
Ah, yes.
Oh.

01:02:945 --> 01:04:571
Yes, please go comfortably.

01:04:655 --> 01:05:656
And...

01:07:032 --> 01:08:367
With this,

01:08:867 --> 01:11:328
buy yourselves a delicious lunch.

01:11:411 --> 01:12:246
Ah...

01:13:121 --> 01:15:332
Ah, thank you.

01:16:792 --> 01:19:253
I really want to get a job at this company, which has perfect welfare.

01:19:336 --> 01:20:587
Yes.

01:21:171 --> 01:23:841
You two...

01:26:552 --> 01:28:136
You must always stick together.

01:29:763 --> 01:30:597
Ah...

01:30:681 --> 01:31:598
Yes.
Yes!

01:32:099 --> 01:33:016
Fighting!

01:33:100 --> 01:34:142
Fighting!

01:45:904 --> 01:46:738
Whoa!

01:54:830 --> 01:55:831
Oh, damn!

01:57:124 --> 01:58:125
Why?
Hey!

01:58:208 --> 01:59:334
Why? Why? What is this?

01:59:918 --> 02:02:212
It was in here.
Really?

02:02:796 --> 02:05:132
This... it must be over 100 million.

02:05:215 --> 02:06:174
100 million?
Hey!

02:12:431 --> 02:13:265
Hey!

02:14:933 --> 02:16:518
Whoa, there's more here.

02:18:186 --> 02:19:104
Wait a minute.

02:42:461 --> 02:43:545
Ah, damn.

02:45:505 --> 02:47:716
1.7 billion, 1.8 billion.

02:48:467 --> 02:49:635
1.9 billion...

02:51:803 --> 02:53:513
2.1 billion, 2.2 billion...
Hyung...

02:54:014 --> 02:55:557
I...

02:56:350 --> 02:58:477
Actually, I've met Hyun-ju before.

02:59:269 --> 03:01:480
Huh? What are you talking about?

03:02:064 --> 03:04:316
A few days ago, when I went to see you, Hyung,

03:04:399 --> 03:07:694
uh, some homeless-looking person was being chased, so

03:07:778 --> 03:11:031
I chased after them and got hit with a Taser by Hyun-ju.

03:11:114 --> 03:12:366
A Taser?

03:12:449 --> 03:13:283
Yes.

03:13:367 --> 03:15:577
Ah, so, did you two fight?

03:15:661 --> 03:16:495
Yes.

03:16:995 --> 03:19:164
I just got yelled at and that was it.

03:19:247 --> 03:20:749
Ah...

03:22:834 --> 03:23:835
Don't worry.

03:24:670 --> 03:26:296
I'll take care of everything.

03:26:380 --> 03:28:507
You just stay still.
Yes.

03:28:590 --> 03:30:801
Just stay still.

03:31:885 --> 03:33:595
I forgot what number I was counting to.

03:33:679 --> 03:35:430
Sorry.
Damn...

03:42:646 --> 03:43:689
Ah!

03:44:856 --> 03:46:149
Hello, Hyun-ju.

03:46:233 --> 03:48:819
Ah, to make your work even safer,

03:48:902 --> 03:52:072
we are the directly hired bodyguards
by the chairman.

03:52:656 --> 03:56:743
Hashtag bodyguards.
Hashtag them, agents.

03:56:827 --> 03:58:996
Hashtag manager, hashtag.

03:59:621 --> 04:00:706
Oppa.

04:00:789 --> 04:02:374
Oppa.

04:02:916 --> 04:04:501
What did you say?

04:04:584 --> 04:07:212
You can think of us as oppas.
Nice to meet you.

04:10:799 --> 04:12:843
Uh, if you need anything, just say the word.

04:12:926 --> 04:15:470
We'll take care of everything for you.

04:15:554 --> 04:17:014
I don't need anything.

04:19:558 --> 04:22:561
Slowly, from now on.

04:22:644 --> 04:24:062
Just tell us what you need.

04:24:146 --> 04:27:107
No, I won't need anything in the future, so please leave.

04:30:986 --> 04:33:071
Mm...
Mm...

04:33:155 --> 04:34:573
Do you dislike us?

04:35:198 --> 04:37:492
How can I dislike you when I just met you?

04:37:576 --> 04:38:577
I just don't need you.

04:38:660 --> 04:41:830
How do you know you don't need us without even letting us work?

04:42:414 --> 04:44:875
Because I've been fine on my own until now.

04:44:958 --> 04:47:127
It's clear I don't need you.

04:47:627 --> 04:49:421
And I hate people who argue the most.

04:49:504 --> 04:50:756
I'm not trying to argue...

04:50:839 --> 04:53:133
That is arguing.

04:53:216 --> 04:54:593
Get out.

04:56:177 --> 04:58:887
Get out now!

05:01:099 --> 05:04:186
Hey, can't you hear me?

05:04:270 --> 05:06:730
Get out! Damn it!

05:25:102 --> 05:27:562
I really need this job.

05:27:646 --> 05:28:939
Please hire me for just one month.

05:29:022 --> 05:31:441
If I'm really no help, then I'll leave.

05:31:525 --> 05:33:652
Please hire me for just one month.
Please, I beg you.

05:33:735 --> 05:35:237
Listen.

05:35:320 --> 05:38:448
If you need money,
my grandfather will lend it to you.

05:38:949 --> 05:40:784
I'll talk to him for you,
so please leave.

05:40:867 --> 05:42:869
It's really uncomfortable.

05:42:953 --> 05:44:913
The money...

05:45:747 --> 05:49:459
I, the chairman
already gave me two years' worth of salary in advance.

05:50:669 --> 05:53:713
My mother was tricked by Smile Capital
and took out a loan,

05:54:756 --> 05:56:383
and the debt quickly grew to hundreds of millions, so

05:57:217 --> 05:59:928
I paid it off today with the money
the chairman gave me this morning.

06:00:011 --> 06:01:513
I...

06:02:347 --> 06:04:766
It would be a really big problem
if I had to return that money.

06:04:850 --> 06:06:601
Please,

06:07:227 --> 06:08:770
I beg you just this once.

06:11:481 --> 06:12:774
Please get up.

06:13:358 --> 06:14:276
Let's eat.

06:24:035 --> 06:26:663
Why did you borrow money from Smile Capital?

06:27:581 --> 06:29:332
My mother was tricked.

06:30:625 --> 06:32:294
How much did you borrow?

06:33:420 --> 06:34:254
100 million.

06:35:422 --> 06:36:882
Did you just pay off the loan and that's it?

06:37:632 --> 06:39:092
No other damages?

06:39:718 --> 06:42:387
My mother used to run a cafe, but

06:42:470 --> 06:44:764
it was all destroyed.

06:45:515 --> 06:46:349
Ah...

06:47:934 --> 06:50:645
Was your face also injured then?

06:52:105 --> 06:52:939
Yes.

06:55:609 --> 06:56:735
That must be so unfair.

06:58:361 --> 06:59:779
Did you report it to the police?

07:00:822 --> 07:01:656
No.

07:04:409 --> 07:06:494
They threatened to kill my mother, so...

07:07:787 --> 07:08:622
Who?

07:30:248 --> 07:31:458
The representative there.

07:31:541 --> 07:34:920
Delicious hamburgers
have arrived. Here.

07:37:631 --> 07:38:757
Let's eat after we talk, okay?

07:45:347 --> 07:46:598
You heard me, but

07:46:681 --> 07:48:850
my grandfather got out of private loans

07:48:934 --> 07:51:353
and lends money without interest
to people in need.

07:51:937 --> 07:52:771
But sometimes,

07:53:313 --> 07:56:316
there are scoundrels who
take advantage of my grandfather's good intentions.

07:56:816 --> 07:58:568
Yang Jae-myeong did that.

07:59:569 --> 08:02:113
He lied that his mother needed surgery,

08:02:197 --> 08:04:115
borrowed 10 million won, and disappeared.

08:04:199 --> 08:06:493
I found that bastard
after half a year,

08:07:285 --> 08:09:621
begging in front of Nammun Station.

08:10:413 --> 08:14:167
At first, I thought Yang Jae-myeong
really became homeless, but

08:14:251 --> 08:16:461
when I passed by him closely,

08:17:045 --> 08:18:463
his teeth were too clean.

08:19:506 --> 08:21:549
So I followed him, and

08:21:633 --> 08:23:927
he was playing homeless
with his gang,

08:24:010 --> 08:25:136
going around at night,

08:25:804 --> 08:28:431
and stealing IDs from real homeless people.

08:29:182 --> 08:32:352
He used the IDs to create ghost corporations
and bank accounts,

08:32:894 --> 08:34:688
and then used them to trick private loan sharks

08:34:771 --> 08:37:691
into giving him tens of millions to hundreds of millions in loans.

08:39:567 --> 08:41:528
This method was too professional, so

08:41:611 --> 08:43:822
I suspected there was someone
behind Yang Jae-myeong,

08:45:615 --> 08:48:868
and I found out this person
was connected to Yang Jae-myeong.

08:50:620 --> 08:51:454
Do you know him?

08:56:001 --> 08:56:835
Yes, I do.

09:02:632 --> 09:04:718
What we have to do today is to accurately
determine how many IDs

09:04:801 --> 09:08:054
Yang Jae-myeong steals in one night.

09:08:138 --> 09:10:265
No matter what, don't interfere.

09:10:348 --> 09:11:808
If we get caught following him,

09:11:891 --> 09:13:560
all my plans will be ruined.

01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:32.889
There's a hat in the back, cover your face.

01:00:59.249 --> 01:01:00.875
Oh? How's this guy?

01:01:376 --> 01:02:627
Ah, this guy's too drunk.

01:02:710 --> 01:04:504
Ah, there must be something.

01:06:381 --> 01:07:340
Hyung, Hyung.

01:10:760 --> 01:12:303
Boss, that, that one.

01:12:387 --> 01:14:097
Hey, find someone who hasn't drunk too much.

01:14:180 --> 01:15:098
Ah, yes.

01:17:058 --> 01:18:393
Hey, come here, follow me.
Yes.

01:18:476 --> 01:20:228
Hey, let's go.
Yes.

01:40:957 --> 01:42:083
Hey, duck.

01:50:967 --> 01:52:719
Excuse me, sir, sir.

01:52:802 --> 01:54:137
Ah, yes, yes...

01:54:220 --> 01:55:763
Ugh, on this cold ground,

01:55:847 --> 01:58:433
how can you just lie down with only a thin newspaper?

01:58:516 --> 02:00:852
You should at least put something down before you lie down.

02:00:935 --> 02:02:020
Yes...

02:02:645 --> 02:05:064
Ugh, when did you last eat?

02:05:148 --> 02:07:400
Ah, the day before yesterday, I think...

02:07:484 --> 02:09:694
Ah, we're not strange people.

02:09:777 --> 02:11:154
We're from the Seoul City-supported

02:11:237 --> 02:13:156
Homeless Association.

02:13:239 --> 02:14:449
Ah, yes.

02:14:532 --> 02:16:784
This is an organization created by the government
for people in our situation to help each other.

02:16:868 --> 02:19:496
Why don't you join our association?

02:19:579 --> 02:21:080
Yes?

02:21:164 --> 02:24:250
If you join our association, you don't have to be like this.

02:24:334 --> 02:26:336
We'll find you a job right away.

02:26:419 --> 02:29:255
We also provide 20 masks free of charge every month,

02:29:339 --> 02:31:841
and we collect the 300,000 won subsidy from the government

02:31:925 --> 02:33:885
and give it all to you.

02:33:968 --> 02:35:220
You understand what I'm saying, right?

02:35:813 --> 02:37:065
Yes.
Yes.

02:39:192 --> 02:40:360
Here.
Ah.

02:41:486 --> 02:43:655
There's a limit to the number of people,
so you have to keep it a secret.

02:43:738 --> 02:44:697
Yes, shh!

02:45:573 --> 02:46:407
Thank you.

02:46:491 --> 02:48:451
He's so good at talking.

02:48:535 --> 02:49:369
Thank you.

02:52:455 --> 02:53:873
Fourth ID.

03:06:052 --> 03:07:637
Excuse me, sir.
Huh? What is it?

03:08:846 --> 03:11:057
Ah, we're from the Homeless Association.

03:11:140 --> 03:12:433
Ah, me...
It's not about anything else...

03:12:517 --> 03:14:060
You bastard!

03:14:602 --> 03:17:397
Hey, you bastard! Where's my ID?
Give me back my ID!

03:17:480 --> 03:19:983
Ah, what, you crazy old man.

03:20:066 --> 03:21:192
Damn, ugh!

03:22:360 --> 03:24:320
These guys, really!
Let go, let go.

03:27:407 --> 03:29:576
Hey! You can't leave!
