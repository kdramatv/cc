WEBVTT

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.395
‪Ah, damn it!

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.547
‪Aren't you going home?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.674
‪I was looking for a jeonse apartment.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.678
‪It's not easy to find a place
‪these days.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.221
‪What about your honeymoon?

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.183
‪My wife wants to go to Paris, but

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.060
‪it probably won't happen
‪because of COVID.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.936
‪Damn COVID. Argh.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.859
‪What brings you here so late?

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.530
‪Hey.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.532
‪Something big came up.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.993
‪I've been watching a loan shark

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.453
‪for about half a year now.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.663
‪This guy records videos

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.207
‪to blackmail people.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:23.541
‪And I,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.504
‪I got a list of his victims today.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.380
‪Anyway, once I organize it,

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.050
‪I'll share it. Let's go after him.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.261
Yes, Senior.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.931
Go back to looking for that thing.
Okay.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:43.978
‪Hmm.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.272
‪He said he got the list today.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.608
‪He wouldn't have done it alone.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.944
‪Find the guys who were involved,

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.071
‪and I'll give you 100 million won each.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:54.948
‪Yes.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.659
‪When will Driver Oh's location be ready?

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:01.663
‪His credit card usage locations
‪for the past week

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.999
‪should be available by tomorrow morning.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:08.461
‪I'll send the money as soon as I get it. Good job.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:14.968
‪100 million won.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.638
‪How's that?

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.059
‪Jang-do is the only one who knows
‪the location of the hard drive.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.479
‪He spilled it when
‪Boss Choi caught him.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.732
‪The guys who were with him then

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.861
‪got involved with Director Hong, damn it.

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:34.445
‪Oppa.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.115
‪Is there only one hard drive?

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.786
‪There's only one hard drive.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:44.998
‪But,

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.542
‪it's backed up on the laptop
‪used to put the videos

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.128
‪on the hard drive.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.590
‪Really?

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.218
‪It's best to stay quiet for now.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.597
‪If the videos get released by mistake,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.099
‪that son of a bitch, Director Hong,

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:06.227
‪will hit our company
‪with a tax audit.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.812
‪That bastard.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:11.733
‪Oppa.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.903
‪Wouldn't it be better to let them know
‪you have the videos?

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.237
‪Wouldn't it?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.533
‪They won't mess with us if they're scared.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.042
You're smart, huh?

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:29.959
‪Shall we toast?

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.253
‪Cheers!

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.531
‪Have you seen this person before?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.200
‪I don't know.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.202
‪Our customers wear masks, so

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:05.286
‪I can't tell.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.664
‪Oh, really?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.874
‪Ah, goddamn it!

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:11.793
‪Look again.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.798
‪Ugh.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.341
‪I don't know.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.384
‪Is it funny?

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.053
What?
Damn it, is it funny?!

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.222
‪No, it's not that...

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.599
‪Shit.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.977
‪Lower your eyes, you bastard.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.146
Look carefully, understand?
I don't...

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.773
‪Do you understand or not, you son of a bitch?

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.858
Get up, get up, get up.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:36.776
‪Do you understand or not?

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.027
No.
Do you understand or not?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.196
‪You son of a bitch, look carefully!
‪Do you understand or not?!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.198
You bastard!

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.534
Ah, damn it, tsk.
You little...

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.493
‪Look straight, look straight.

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:46.577
‪Hello, boss.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.787
‪Oh, yes, welcome.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.539
Can I ask you something?
Yes, yes.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.040
‪I'm looking for someone.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.167
‪He's a friend of my father's.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.629
‪Oh, yes, I know him.

04:56:713 --> 00:04:58.589
You do?
Yes, but what's the matter?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.341
‪I'm getting married this time, so

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.427
I want to give him an invitation.
Ah.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.220
‪Do you know where he lives?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.471
‪Of course, I know him well.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.640
‪I deliver rice to him once a month.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.518
‪Could I get his address?

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:12.395
‪Oh, yes, I'll tell you.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:01.819
‪Here he comes.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.241
‪Kang In-beom's info.

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.620
‪I've got all the dirt on him.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:12.246
‪Ah.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.623
‪You're fast, as always.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.376
‪Oh, well, speed is key
‪when it comes to this stuff.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.294
Thank you.
Yes.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.171
Okay.
Hmm.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.645
‪[Geon-woo and Woo-jin laugh loudly, then stop awkwardly]

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.148
‪That's it, that's all?

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.066
‪Huh?

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.027
‪Ah, you don't know.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.240
‪Usually, when you ask for this kind of work,
‪a small token of appreciation...

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.909
...like this is given.
Ah.

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:52.370
‪Ah, ah, yes.
‪Uh, how much should I give you?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.705
‪Okay, one "jang."

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.875
‪Ah, we're a team, we're family now.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.460
‪One "jang," let's go! Uh.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.838
Yes, yes.
Uh.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.423
Thank you.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.300
‪Ah, call me anytime.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.677
Take care.
Oh.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.262
Go home safely.
Yes.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.816
‪Ah, damn it, I said 1 million won.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:31.826
‪Ugh.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.788
‪Uh... he told me not to use it.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:40.168
‪You need a big screen to understand
‪the area around the house.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.919
‪What if Da-min comes in?

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:46.215
‪She won't. That time, she just
‪happened to be passing by and saw it.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.258
‪Bad luck.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.635
‪Hey.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.179
Gangdong-gu.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.597
Seonggu-ro.
Seonggu-ro?

07:57:602 --> 00:07:59.353
‪Ah, he said he's coming, bro.
‪Turn it off quickly.

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:08.237
‪Ah, what's wrong?

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.824
‪It smells like an old bachelor in here.

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:14.285
‪Why are you using the computer again?

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:15.745
‪I told you to go to the PC cafe.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.371
‪I'm sorry.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.582
‪I'm sorry about the bachelor smell too.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.917
‪Ugh, damn it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.336
‪It's fine, this room is ruined.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.253
‪Ruined.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.213
‪Da-min!

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.131
‪What?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.549
‪I'm sorry again today.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.635
‪I'll take responsibility for the bachelor smell.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.345
‪How?

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:33.262
‪Diffuser!

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.307
‪If we put diffusers,
‪we can get rid of the bachelor smell.

08:36:390 --> 00:08:37.642
Yes.

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.060
Really?
Well, first,

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.270
‪to get rid of the smell fundamentally,

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.522
‪you need to find an opposite scent.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.524
‪This bachelor smell, strictly speaking,

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.691
‪is a very strong musk scent

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.777
‪with a hint of rotten wood scent
‪that accidentally got in.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.779
‪To counter this, you need the opposite scent, which is,

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:53.908
‪floral and fruity.

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.910
‪I use Diptyque's Baies, Baies.

08:55:993 --> 00:08:57.828
I like that.
Good.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.539
‪Yeah, that's perfect.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.165
‪The refreshing sweetness of Baies

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.668
‪will completely get rid of
‪this bachelor smell.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.419
‪It will.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.548
‪We'll definitely buy it for you
‪when we leave.

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:10.591
A present.
Yes.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.635
‪We'll buy two.
‪One downstairs, one upstairs.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:13.761
‪One for the bathroom too.

00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:15.304
‪Okay, three.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.264
‪Deal!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.776
‪How does Kang In-beom have my number, bro? Look at this.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.112
‪Ah, it makes no sense.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.738
‪Isn't this wrong somehow?

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.998
‪Ah...

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.001
‪What's wrong with our grandpa?

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.336
‪Who did this to him?

09:47:420 --> 00:09:48.546
‪Uh...

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.676
Hey...

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:56.345
‪Come to Incheon Four Gardens Mall
‪within an hour.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:57.930
‪If you call the police,

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.182
‪I'll kill the old man.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.475
‪You're dead to me.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.312
‪Uh, no...

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.272
‪Uh, Da-min, you have to tell us
‪what he said.

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:08.816
‪He said to come to Incheon Four Gardens Mall
‪within an hour.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:09.984
‪If we call the police...

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.321
‪He'll kill grandpa.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.908
‪Let's go quickly.
‪No time.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.425
Geon-woo.
What?

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:35.760
‪How many of these bastards will come?

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.178
‪Ah, at least thirty?

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.971
‪They'll probably have weapons, and...

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.265
‪Kang In-beom and his team leader
‪will probably come too.

01:41:349 --> 00:10:44.185
Should I call Kang-yong?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.395
‪No.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.773
‪Then the driver
‪would be in too much danger.

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:51.275
‪Then what about senior?

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.318
‪Which senior?

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.235
‪Boss Moon.

01:53:319 --> 00:10:55.571
‪Oh, but his arm is injured.

01:55:655 --> 00:10:57.615
‪Wouldn't he help us somehow?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.867
‪Ah, I guess so, but...

01:10:0368 --> 00:11:01.952
‪Is everything ready?

01:11:02036 --> 00:11:02.870
‪Yes.

01:11:03371 --> 00:11:05.373
‪But Da-min, what are you going to use
‪that bow for?

01:11:06082 --> 00:11:07.041
‪To save Grandpa.

01:11:07.124 --> 01:11:09.752
‪Ah, ah, ah, ah, no.
‪Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.

01:11:09.835 --> 01:11:10.878
‪We'll go, just the two of us.

01:11:12.963 --> 01:11:13.798
‪Move aside.

01:11:15.466 --> 01:11:17.426
‪No, Da-min, what are you doing?

01:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.678
No...

01:11:26.477 --> 01:11:27.728
‪I also have something I can do.

01:11:28.896 --> 01:11:30.648
‪I'm going no matter what, so don't stop me.

01:11:32.274 --> 01:11:33.734
‪What are you doing? No time.

01:11:34.735 --> 01:11:36.821
‪Wow, she shoots well.

01:11:36.904 --> 01:11:37.738
‪Hey.

01:11:38.531 --> 01:11:39.532
‪She might be helpful.

01:11:43.911 --> 01:11:45.663
‪Senior, this is Woo-jin.

01:11:46.789 --> 01:11:48.290
‪Driver Oh

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:50.835
‪has been kidnapped.

01:11:52.253 --> 01:11:54.255
‪Could you possibly help us?

01:11:54.338 --> 01:11:56.632
‪I also owe the driver a debt.

01:11:57.341 --> 01:11:59.677
‪Don't you dare go in
‪until I arrive.

01:12:00.261 --> 01:12:01.095
‪That's an order.

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:06.202
‪Ah, my junior marines are here?

01:13:06.285 --> 01:13:07.620
Yes.
Senior.

01:13:07.703 --> 01:13:08.788
‪You prepared a lot, huh?

01:13:08.871 --> 01:13:11.415
‪Ah, I just put this on because it was at home, but

01:13:11.957 --> 01:13:13.793
‪it's itchy. It seems old.

01:13:14.293 --> 01:13:15.836
‪Take it off quickly before you get pimples.

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:30.059
‪I'll go
‪through the underground parking...

01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:31.644
‪Who are you?

01:13:32.228 --> 01:13:33.646
‪I came to save my grandpa.

01:13:35.314 --> 01:13:36.774
‪She's Driver Oh's granddaughter.

01:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.276
‪Ah, ah, I see.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.070
‪The features are similar, huh?

01:13:41.153 --> 01:13:42.780
An hour is almost up.

01:13:43.364 --> 01:13:45.699
‪Alright, alright.
‪But what's that bag?

01:13:45.783 --> 01:13:47.076
‪It's a compound bow.

01:13:47.952 --> 01:13:48.786
‪Kkwobarou?

01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.704
‪Compound bow.

01:50:788 --> 01:13:52.414
Kkwo...
Senior.

01:13:52.498 --> 01:13:53.958
‪It's an archery bow for athletes.

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:55.459
‪Ah!

01:13:55.543 --> 01:13:58.003
‪Ah, right, archery is Korea.

01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:00.631
‪You shoot well, right?

01:14:00.714 --> 01:14:01.841
‪Yes.

01:14:03.008 --> 01:14:03.843
‪Good.

01:14:03.926 --> 01:14:06.220
‪Archery and I will go
‪through the underground parking lot

01:14:06.303 --> 01:14:08.138
‪and up the stairs to the top floor.

01:14:08.222 --> 01:14:11.058
‪Our two marines will charge
‪through the front door.

01:14:11.141 --> 01:14:12.852
‪We'll provide covering fire from above.

01:14:12.935 --> 01:14:14.144
Understood?
Yes.

01:14:14.228 --> 01:14:15.104
‪Move.

01:14:16.856 --> 01:14:18.107
Follow me.
Yes.

01:14:23.988 --> 01:14:25.489
This way.
Oh, yes.

01:14:58.606 --> 01:14:59.857
‪Where's the driver?

01:15:01.275 --> 01:15:02.776
‪Kill them!

01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:04.987
‪You, damn it!

01:15:16.332 --> 01:15:18.751
‪One, two, three!

01:15:25.007 --> 01:15:26.216
Shit.

01:15:33.724 --> 01:15:34.558
‪Hey!

01:15:34.642 --> 01:15:35.476
‪Ugh, damn it.

01:15:37.353 --> 01:15:38.520
‪Hey!

01:15:46.987 --> 01:15:48.822
What, what's there?
Where, where is it?

01:15:48.906 --> 01:15:50.407
Where is it? Where is it?

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.701
‪Wow, archery!

01:52:785 --> 01:53:911
Catch her!
Where?

01:53:994 --> 01:54:828
‪Who is it?

01:54:912 --> 01:56:413
Good, good.
Where are they above?

01:56:497 --> 01:58:40
What? What? What?

02:04:338 --> 02:05:506
Above!

02:05:589 --> 02:07:91
That black one, that...

02:07:174 --> 02:08:342
‪Who is it? Who is it!

02:08:425 --> 02:09:885
Ah, damn!

02:17:559 --> 02:19:728
‪That, that blue one.
‪That, that, the blue one.

02:23:941 --> 02:24:775
Ah.
Ah, damn.

02:24:858 --> 02:27:736
‪Ah, ah, this.
‪I'm helping my juniors, alright?

02:27:820 --> 02:28:862
‪This, damn...

02:35:160 --> 02:36:453
Hey, bluey.

02:38:122 --> 02:39:498
‪Are you on the track team, you bastard?

02:40:124 --> 02:41:250
‪Ah, damn it.

02:46:868 --> 02:47:744
‪What happened?

02:48:411 --> 02:49:704
‪Hey, Driver Oh?

02:49:788 --> 02:51:39
‪We couldn't find him.

02:51:122 --> 02:53:208
‪They probably caught on and
‪moved the driver.

02:53:291 --> 02:54:667
‪Ugh, damn it.

02:54:751 --> 02:55:794
‪Did the gym rat spill anything?

02:55:877 --> 02:57:712
‪Ah, that guy, he's a tough nut.

02:57:796 --> 02:59:88
‪He won't open his mouth!

02:59:714 --> 03:00:673
Ugh.

03:00:757 --> 03:01:633
Huh?

03:05:136 --> 03:06:596
Is it fun, huh?

03:08:056 --> 03:09:432
‪Should I show you something more fun?

03:09:516 --> 03:11:267
‪What's this son of a bitch saying?

03:23:571 --> 03:24:572
‪Ugh, damn it!

03:25:156 --> 03:27:575
‪Bro! That bastard, he bit his tongue!

03:27:659 --> 03:28:868
‪Damn it!

03:28:952 --> 03:30:453
‪Quickly, quickly!

03:31:496 --> 03:32:330
‪Ah, damn!

03:32:413 --> 03:34:707
Ah, damn it!
Hey! Hey!

03:34:791 --> 03:36:376
Damn it!
Hey! Hey! Kang In-beom!

03:36:459 --> 03:37:877
Snap out of it! Hey!

03:37:961 --> 03:39:546
‪Bro, call an ambulance!

03:39:629 --> 03:40:755
‪Alright.

03:41:256 --> 03:42:924
‪Uh, wait, wait!

03:43:007 --> 03:45:593
‪If we send this guy away,
‪how will we find Kim Myeong-gil's safe?

03:45:677 --> 03:46:803
Still!

03:46:886 --> 03:49:138
‪We can't just let him die, Senior.

03:49:222 --> 03:51:474
‪If he dies like this, we still
‪won't find the safe.

03:52:809 --> 03:54:561
‪Ah, seriously, give it here, damn it.

03:54:644 --> 03:56:62
‪Uh, please let me
‪put this down, please.

03:56:145 --> 03:56:980
‪Oh! Alright.

04:03:903 --> 04:05:405
‪Patient.
‪Patient, are you okay?

04:06:114 --> 04:07:323
‪Snap out of it! Are you okay?

04:07:407 --> 04:08:700
Oh!

04:14:706 --> 04:15:874
‪Hello!

04:15:957 --> 04:17:83
‪Hello.

04:17:166 --> 04:17:791
‪Uh.
‪Where did the boss go?

04:17:791 --> 04:19:252
‪Ah, yes, he's on vacation.

04:19:335 --> 04:20:670
‪Ah-ha.

04:20:753 --> 04:21:880
‪Uh, I'd like an Ethiopian hand-drip,

04:22:839 --> 04:24:257
iced.
Yes.

04:24:340 --> 04:25:884
Yes, please wait a moment.
Yes, thank you, yes.

04:57:081 --> 04:58:666
‪Ah, damn!

05:04:255 --> 05:05:214
‪Uh, Min-beom.

05:06:215 --> 05:08:635
‪Kim Myeong-gil still has
‪my video.

05:09:135 --> 05:10:637
He just sent it.

05:11:137 --> 05:12:847
‪Ah, what...

05:15:433 --> 05:16:976
Hello?

05:17:060 --> 05:18:519
Kang-yong, bro?

05:19:020 --> 05:20:480
Hello?

05:26:653 --> 05:27:487
‪Damn it!

05:33:826 --> 05:34:702
‪Ah, damn.

06:12:407 --> 06:14:158
‪You sons of bitches!

06:14:242 --> 06:16:452
You son of a bitch!

06:20:039 --> 06:21:499
‪Salt...

06:21:582 --> 06:22:583
‪Huh?

06:22:667 --> 06:24:85
Salt!

06:48:443 --> 06:49:861
‪Ah, someone got hit.

06:49:944 --> 06:51:237
‪Oh, someone got hit. Go quickly.

06:52:697 --> 06:53:656
‪Call 911 quickly, 911!

06:53:740 --> 06:54:699
‪Oh, someone might be dead.

07:02:165 --> 07:04:333
‪Geon-woo, come here quickly. Quickly.

07:07:628 --> 07:09:5
‪He's here.

07:12:967 --> 07:14:469
‪Hey, you idiots.

07:15:219 --> 07:17:55
‪Why do you have to come out and cause trouble?

07:18:890 --> 07:19:807
‪What do you want?

07:22:310 --> 07:24:187
‪Come to the fish farm by 9 PM tonight.

07:25:188 --> 07:26:939
‪If you call the police again,

07:27:440 --> 07:29:984
‪I'll grind Driver Oh up and feed him to the fish, got it?

07:30:693 --> 07:31:903
‪Why are you quiet?

07:33:404 --> 07:36:949
‪I took care of Min Kang-yong
‪and his thugs, so don't mess with me.

07:37:825 --> 07:39:452
‪And I told you if you show up again,

07:40:036 --> 07:41:662
‪I'd kill your mom, right?

07:43:247 --> 07:44:82
‪Let's see.

07:46:417 --> 07:46:293
‪Mom.

07:51:631 --> 07:54:133
Power off...

07:55:134 --> 07:56:928
‪Kang-yong got caught too? The police?

07:57:804 --> 07:59:597
‪Bro, this time it feels really dangerous.

07:59:680 --> 08:01:140
‪I think it'd be better if just the two of us went.

08:01:891 --> 08:02:767
‪Excuse me.

08:04:977 --> 08:06:604
‪How long have you been there?

08:06:687 --> 08:08:231
‪I was here the whole time.

08:09:690 --> 08:11:150
‪Don't even think about leaving me out.

08:11:234 --> 08:12:568
‪I'm going to save Grandpa.

08:13:861 --> 08:14:987
‪Ah...

08:17:907 --> 08:19:534
‪Wait a minute.

08:29:710 --> 08:30:837
‪If,

08:30:920 --> 08:33:714
‪something bad happens to Driver Oh
‪right in front of us,

08:34:924 --> 08:37:760
‪Da-min will surely collapse
‪like Hyun-joo did. I...

08:39:220 --> 08:41:848
‪Bro, I don't want to see that again.

08:42:515 --> 08:43:391
‪But, Geon-woo.

08:44:600 --> 08:46:602
‪There's one thing different
‪between then and now.

08:47:270 --> 08:48:104
‪Do you know what it is?

08:49:355 --> 08:50:189
‪Back then,

08:51:274 --> 08:53:693
‪the invincible Marine duo
‪was separated.

08:54:694 --> 08:55:945
Not now.

08:56:028 --> 08:58:30
‪And we've gotten much stronger, huh?

08:58:114 --> 08:59:31
‪Remember?

08:59:991 --> 09:01:826
‪One, two, three, four, five.

09:01:909 --> 09:03:536
One, two, three, four, five!

09:05:079 --> 09:06:497
‪Uh, uh.

09:07:707 --> 09:09:667
So, huh?

09:10:334 --> 09:12:378
‪Let's combine our strength
‪and save everyone.

09:13:629 --> 09:14:964
‪Driver Oh, Da-min.

09:15:840 --> 09:18:426
‪Everyone hurt by Kim Myeong-gil.

09:23:306 --> 09:24:348
‪Ah!

09:24:432 --> 09:25:433
‪Ah!

09:27:226 --> 09:28:60
‪Ah!

09:29:061 --> 09:29:896
‪Ah!

09:41:073 --> 09:41:949
‪Why are you stopping?

09:42:950 --> 09:44:577
‪Bro and I will go in first, so

09:44:660 --> 09:45:661
‪wait outside and watch.

09:45:745 --> 09:47:538
‪When you find a good spot to shoot,
‪come in then.

09:47:622 --> 09:48:539
‪That's a good plan.

09:49:040 --> 09:49:874
‪Let's get out.

09:51:707 --> 09:52:583
I see you.

09:55:043 --> 09:55:877
You're so smart.

09:56:959 --> 09:57:960
To protect Da-min.

09:58:960 --> 09:59:848
Did you purposely drop her off so far away?

10:00:922 --> 10:02:649
Ah, for Da-min, of course.

10:04:155 --> 10:04:990
What about me?

10:05:073 --> 10:05:954
I'm fine.

10:06:954 --> 10:07:955
I'm also good.

10:08:956 --> 10:09:957
Let's go, it's getting cold.

10:10:040 --> 10:10:875
Ah, what?

10:11:000 --> 10:11:834
Let's just go.

10:12:000 --> 10:12:834
Oh, yeah.

10:13:000 --> 10:13:834
Let's go.

10:14:000 --> 10:14:834
Good.

10:14:917 --> 10:15:752
Yeah.

10:16:000 --> 10:16:834
Yeah.

10:17:000 --> 10:17:834
What?

10:18:000 --> 10:18:834
Let's go.

10:18:917 --> 10:19:752
Okay.

10:20:000 --> 10:20:834
Okay.

10:21:000 --> 10:21:834
Let's go.

10:21:917 --> 10:22:752
What?

10:23:000 --> 10:23:834
Ah, okay.

10:24:000 --> 10:24:834
Let's go.

10:24:917 --> 10:25:752
Okay.

10:26:000 --> 10:26:834
Okay.

10:26:917 --> 10:27:752
Let's go.

10:28:000 --> 10:28:834
Okay.

10:28:917 --> 10:29:752
Let's go.

10:30:000 --> 10:30:834
Okay.

10:30:917 --> 10:31:752
Let's go.

10:31:835 --> 10:32:670
Let's go!

10:33:000 --> 10:33:834
Okay!

10:33:917 --> 10:34:752
Let's go.

10:34:835 --> 10:35:670
Okay.

10:35:753 --> 10:36:588
Let's go.

10:36:671 --> 10:37:506
Okay.

10:37:589 --> 10:38:424
Let's go.

10:38:507 --> 10:39:342
Okay.

10:39:425 --> 10:40:260
Let's go.

10:40:343 --> 10:41:178
Okay.

10:41:261 --> 10:42:96
Let's go.

10:42:179 --> 10:43:14
Okay.

10:43:97 --> 10:43:932
Let's go.

10:44:179 --> 10:44:927
Ah.

10:44:927 --> 10:45:762
I just wanted to drop you off.

10:45:845 --> 10:46:680
Okay.

10:46:763 --> 10:47:598
So far away?

10:47:681 --> 10:48:516
It's just that I don't want to get caught.

10:48:516 --> 10:49:351
So I dropped you off early.

10:49:434 --> 10:50:269
I'm just going to go now.

10:50:352 --> 10:51:187
Let's go.

10:51:270 --> 10:52:105
Okay.

10:52:188 --> 10:53:23
What?

10:53:106 --> 10:53:941
Let's go.

10:54:024 --> 10:54:859
Let's go.

03:0:902 --> 03:1:321
These bastards.

03:1:321 --> 03:1:740
These bastards.

03:3:193 --> 03:3:829
Sit down!

03:4:193 --> 03:4:829
Sit down!

03:18:100 --> 03:19:310
‪Sit down!

03:26:817 --> 03:27.651
‪Move!

03:28.235 --> 03:29.653
‪You son of a bitch!

03:29.737 --> 03:31.322
‪Come here! Come here!

03:31.405 --> 03:34.116
‪You bastard! I told you to kill him quickly!
‪You bastards!

03:35.493 --> 03:36.577
‪Let go, you bastard!

03:43.751 --> 03:45.544
Let go, you bastard!
Let's go to the hospital.

03:48.130 --> 03:49.882
‪Kill him! Huh!

04:14.406 --> 04:15.241
‪Grandpa!

04:15.324 --> 04:17.701
Grandpa, are you okay?

04:17.785 --> 04:19.578
It's me, Da-min.

04:23.457 --> 04:24.917
Ah...

04:26.210 --> 04:28.587
‪My eyebrows are all pulled out.

04:30.798 --> 04:31.924
‪Ah...

04:32.007 --> 04:33.676
‪Driver,
‪are you okay?

04:35.427 --> 04:37.137
‪Thank you.

04:46.605 --> 04:48.607
Move! Come quickly.

04:49.441 --> 04:50.568
‪What is this?

04:50.651 --> 04:52.069
‪Move quickly!

04:52.152 --> 04:54.071
‪Get close quickly, get close!

05:01:453 --> 05:02.288
‪Who are you?

05:03.038 --> 05:04.164
‪Jajangmyeon delivery.

05:13.674 --> 05:14.925
‪What?! You bastards!

05:15.551 --> 05:17.803
‪Stay still, you bastard!

05:20.764 --> 05:23.017
Search every inch inside!
Yes.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.226
‪What's here?

05:28.022 --> 05:29.690
‪Found it! Everyone come here!

05:29.773 --> 05:30.608
‪Ugh.

05:31.609 --> 05:33.110
‪Ugh, what are these guys?

05:33.193 --> 05:34.236
‪What did they do?

05:38.907 --> 05:41.076
‪This is Yang Yun-seo,
‪Sergeant from the Central Investigation Bureau.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.411
‪Uh...

05:42.494 --> 05:43.662
‪This is a search and seizure warrant.

05:43.746 --> 05:45.748
‪We will execute the search and seizure
‪as of now.

05:45.831 --> 05:47.708
‪We request your cooperation.

05:47.791 --> 05:48.626
‪Come in.

05:49.418 --> 05:50.419
‪Come in quickly.

05:54.131 --> 05:55.257
‪This is...

05:55.841 --> 05:57.092
‪Kim Jae-min?

05:57.176 --> 05:59.970
‪You are arrested on charges
‪of murder, bribery, and more.

06:01.221 --> 06:03.932
‪Ah, damn it, this feels awful.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.434
‪Let's go.

06:07.519 --> 06:08.771
Chief.
Uh.

06:18.906 --> 06:20.074
‪Fortunately, the warrant came out quickly, so

06:20.157 --> 06:22.034
‪when we entered Kim Myeong-gil's house,

06:22.117 --> 06:24.328
‪we found a pile of cell phones
‪in a dresser drawer.

06:25.412 --> 06:26.955
‪When we traced the numbers,

06:27.039 --> 06:28.832
‪they all belonged to people
‪who were dead or missing.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.042
‪Seriously.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.210
‪This lunatic

06:32.002 --> 06:34.421
‪kept the cell phones of the people
‪he killed, brazenly.

06:35.172 --> 06:36.131
‪This is undeniable proof.

06:36.632 --> 06:38.676
‪Not even the US president
‪could get him out of this.

06:38.759 --> 06:39.968
‪What about fleeing overseas?

06:40.511 --> 06:42.930
‪It's difficult because he's on
‪a wanted list.

06:43.013 --> 06:44.556
‪Many people escape to China
‪on cargo ships, right?

06:44.640 --> 06:46.141
‪Kim Myeong-gil is a Grade A fugitive.

06:46.225 --> 06:48.394
‪All possible routes for illegal emigration
‪will be under intense surveillance.

06:48.977 --> 06:50.688
‪He won't be able to leave Korea easily.

06:50.771 --> 06:52.564
‪But it's not impossible, is it?

06:52.648 --> 06:54.525
‪Everyone seems to think
‪the job is done, but

06:55.567 --> 06:58.028
‪actually, I'm really anxious right now.

06:58.112 --> 06:59.530
‪That bastard still has my video.

06:59.613 --> 07:01:573
‪If he ever goes crazy and releases it,
‪it's over.

07:01:657 --> 07:03:909
If he ever goes crazy and releases it,
it's over.

07:09:415 --> 07:10.249
‪Bro.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.585
‪I really need to see that bastard
‪locked up in prison.

07:14.253 --> 07:15.546
‪Min-beom.

07:18.507 --> 07:19.758
‪I understand, but...

07:23.137 --> 07:25.013
‪Hangu is in this state too,

07:26.181 --> 07:27.766
‪and Tae-yeong still can't open his eyes.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.060
‪We also need some time.

07:38.402 --> 07:39.403
‪We'll help you, bro.

07:40.738 --> 07:42.656
‪It's not over until it's over, right?

07:43.824 --> 07:47.286
‪Uh, by any chance, could you
‪find Im Jang-do's location?

07:47.870 --> 07:48.829
‪Im Jang-do, why?

07:48.912 --> 07:50.372
‪Uh, Im Jang-do is probably

07:50.456 --> 07:52.958
‪hiding somewhere to avoid Kim Myeong-gil. But

07:53.542 --> 07:54.543
‪I think he might

07:54.626 --> 07:56.462
‪know where Kim Myeong-gil
‪is going to escape to.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.546
‪That's why.

07:58.046 --> 07:59.131
‪That's right.

07:59.214 --> 08:01.383
‪Im Jang-do might know
‪how to flee illegally.

08:01:467 --> 08:03:886
‪He said he used to be in charge
‪of that kind of thing.

08:05:471 --> 08:06.638
‪Alright, I'll look into it.

08:14.062 --> 08:15.522
‪How much is it in cash?

08:15.606 --> 08:17.399
‪I can do it for up to 18 million.

08:18.776 --> 08:20.736
‪Im Jang-do hasn't used his own cell phone
‪or credit card

08:20.819 --> 08:23.906
‪for half a year.

08:24.490 --> 08:25.741
‪He's avoided everything
‪that could be traced.

08:25.824 --> 08:26.658
‪Yes.

08:27.159 --> 08:28.786
‪Is there absolutely no way?

08:29.369 --> 08:31.914
‪Well, what we've found so far

08:32.414 --> 08:34.082
‪is just Im Jang-do's account number.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.000
‪Even that,

08:35.542 --> 08:37.920
‪the last time he withdrew cash
‪was in March in Suwon.

08:38.003 --> 08:39.505
‪Can't you track him with that?

08:39.588 --> 08:41.423
‪You'd have to check months of CCTV footage, so

08:41.507 --> 08:43.050
‪it would require a dedicated team.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.135
‪It'll take some time.

08:46.386 --> 08:48.055
‪Bro, can we get his
‪account number?

08:48.138 --> 08:49.765
‪This guy is probably
‪desperate for money.

08:49.848 --> 08:51.809
‪He's probably desperate for money.

08:52.309 --> 08:54.061
‪Okay, send money to his account.

08:54.144 --> 08:55.437
‪When you send the money,
‪put your contact phone number

08:55.521 --> 08:57.272
‪in the sender's name.

08:57.356 --> 08:59.274
‪Then,
‪he'll definitely contact you, 100%.

08:59.358 --> 09:00.692
‪How much should I send?

09:00:776 --> 09:01.819
‪Well, one "jang."

09:02.402 --> 09:03.278
‪Uh, 10,000 won?

09:04.363 --> 09:06.907
‪Ah, I meant to tell you this last time,
‪but I forgot.

09:06.990 --> 09:09.827
‪In our business, "one jang" varies.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.538
‪Last time, when I got you
‪Kang In-beom's info, that "one jang"

09:12:621 --> 09:14:748
‪wasn't 10,000 won, it was 1 million won.

09:14:832 --> 09:16.041
1 million won?

09:16.124 --> 09:17.626
‪Ah, of course, I'm not saying
‪I want it now, huh?

09:17:709 --> 09:19.169
‪I'm not a petty person.

09:19.253 --> 09:20.629
‪We're family, huh?

09:20:712 --> 09:21.964
‪So, what would "one jang" be
‪in our current situation?

09:22:047 --> 09:24.591
What would "one jang" be
in our current situation?

09:25.175 --> 09:26.301
‪He'd laugh at 1 million won.

09:27.010 --> 09:27.845
‪10 million won.

09:29.429 --> 09:30.806
‪He'll bite immediately.

09:39.481 --> 09:42.568
‪You, you, you keep drinking
‪like that, and your wound...

09:42.651 --> 09:43.735
Your wound will...

09:43.819 --> 09:45.612
You son of a bitch!

09:55.873 --> 09:57.583
Doctor.
Yes.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.001
‪Just treat me.

09:59.751 --> 10:01.295
Yes.

10:04.965 --> 10:07.009
‪Damn it.

10:07.092 --> 10:08.051
‪66.

10:08.594 --> 10:09.428
‪67.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.097
68, 69.

10:12.180 --> 10:14.224
Bro.

10:14.308 --> 10:15.392
‪No number.

10:22.274 --> 10:23.275
‪Hello?

10:28.113 --> 10:28.947
‪Hello?

10:31.575 --> 10:33.201
‪Hello?

10:35.037 --> 10:35.913
‪You.

10:36.955 --> 10:38.123
‪You're the kid who was with Boss Choi, right?

10:42.169 --> 10:43.003
‪Yes.

10:43.921 --> 10:45.464
‪The police told you my account number, and

10:47.799 --> 10:48.634
‪what?

10:49.593 --> 10:50.552
‪Why did you deposit money?

10:51.219 --> 10:53.388
‪Kim Myeong-gil is on the run.

10:54.181 --> 10:55.057
‪Why?

10:55.140 --> 10:57.184
‪The police found evidence at Kim Myeong-gil's house

10:57.267 --> 01:00:854
‪that he killed people.

01:01:396 --> 01:02:230
‪Two days ago.

01:03:231 --> 01:04:316
‪You know

01:04:399 --> 01:06:68
‪where Kim Myeong-gil is going to escape, right?

01:08:820 --> 01:09:655
‪I do.

01:10:322 --> 01:11:490
‪Please.

01:11:573 --> 01:14:701
‪We want to catch Kim Myeong-gil.
‪Please help us.

01:18:038 --> 01:19:247
‪How much will you give me?

01:22:125 --> 01:23:335
‪One, one "jang."

01:23:919 --> 01:26:421
‪Ah, damn it, screw you.

01:27.923 --> 01:28.757
‪1 billion won!

01:29.341 --> 01:30.175
‪1 billion won?

01:30.258 --> 01:32.844
‪I trusted Boss Choi and now I'm screwed.

01:32.928 --> 01:34.513
‪I deserve that much compensation.

01:34.596 --> 01:36.390
‪Uh, but we don't have that much...

01:36.473 --> 01:38.266
‪Boss Kim will flee overseas
‪within four days

01:38.350 --> 01:40.602
‪using the method I told him about.

01:41.770 --> 01:42.771
‪You have my account number, right?

01:44.189 --> 01:45.148
‪Think carefully.

01:48.235 --> 01:50.320
‪No way, hey.

01:50.988 --> 01:52.364
‪How do we get 1 billion won?

01:53.532 --> 01:55.534
‪Bro, should we ask the driver?

01:55.617 --> 01:56.910
‪The driver doesn't have money.

01:57.828 --> 01:59.663
‪He said that what he gave us then
‪was his last emergency fund.

02:00.372 --> 02:01.707
Wait a minute.

02:07.713 --> 02:08.755
‪How much is in it?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.385
‪It's probably only about
‪300 million won.

02:13.468 --> 02:14.594
‪That's nowhere near enough.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.975
‪Uh, should we ask Min-beom, bro?

02:20.058 --> 02:22.352
‪The one who filmed Min-beom, bro, was Im Jang-do.

02:23.437 --> 02:24.396
‪Will Min-beom, bro,

02:24.896 --> 02:25.897
‪help us with this?

02:26.815 --> 02:27.649
‪Still.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.861
‪Min-beom, bro, is the only one
‪with that kind of money.

02:32.154 --> 02:33.822
‪Let's just ask him once, huh?

02:42.581 --> 02:43.874
‪Director, I brought them.

02:49.379 --> 02:50.881
‪Do you guys trust Im Jang-do?

02:53.633 --> 02:54.468
‪Uh...

02:55.635 --> 02:57.637
‪I believe in Im Jang-do's information,

02:58.555 --> 03:00.182
‪bro.

03:01.141 --> 03:02.976
‪What if that bastard
‪takes the 1 billion and flees overseas?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.312
‪Then what?

03:10.022 --> 03:11.398
‪Bro, what if

03:11.898 --> 03:13.984
‪Im Jang-do breaks his promise and runs away?

03:14.818 --> 03:17.320
‪We'll chase him to the end of the earth
‪and bring him back.

03:17.404 --> 03:19.573
‪I promise you that, bro.

03:22.533 --> 03:23.826
‪Keep your promise.

03:25.077 --> 03:25.912
Yes.
Yes.

03:41.837 --> 03:43.213
‪Yes, confirmed.

03:43.296 --> 03:44.297
Move out.
Yes.

03:45.507 --> 03:46.341
‪You may go.

03:53.150 --> 03:53.568
‪Write it down.

03:53.651 --> 03:54.485
‪Write it down.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.570
‪The day after tomorrow, 1 AM.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.948
‪A 2,700-ton cargo ship called "Nike"
‪will depart from Pohang Shinilman

03:59.031 --> 04:00.074
‪for Ho Chi Minh.

04:00:157 --> 04:01.992
‪Boss Kim gave political funds to a person

04:02.076 --> 04:03.452
‪who is a high-ranking official
‪in the Vietnamese government.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.954
‪He'll take all his hidden slush funds
‪and cross over.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.540
‪The container number is TJBU 9004230.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.292
‪Inside the container,

04:10.375 --> 04:12.085
‪there will be a truck
‪hiding the slush funds.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.546
‪Should we aim for when Kim Myeong-gil
‪boards the ship?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.423
‪The ship is big,
‪so it won't be easy to find him.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.466
‪Then how do we find him?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.259
‪You two get on the ship too.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.514
‪You want us to take the ship
‪all the way to Vietnam?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.933
‪That's up to you.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.435
I'm hanging up.
Uh, wait, wait a minute.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.146
‪If we want to take that ship,
‪what should we do?

04:32.064 --> 04:34.024
‪I'll send you a contact number
‪by text.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.442
‪Tell them my name and negotiate well.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
‪For your information, they like cash.

04:43.954 --> 04:44.830
‪Got a text.

04:54.159 --> 04:57.130
‪I prepared a little bit of everything
‪because I didn't know what you'd need.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.424
‪Thank you.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.676
‪Be careful.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.594
‪Yes.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.596
‪Huh?

05:05.847 --> 05:06.807
Yes.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.185
‪Let's go up.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.312
‪You go up first.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.772
‪Let me just talk...

05:16.441 --> 05:17.276
‪Okay.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.409
‪Thank you for your help.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.911
‪We're more thankful.

05:36.004 --> 05:36.838
‪Da-min.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.464
‪Goodbye.

05:39.757 --> 05:40.591
‪Goodbye.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.051
‪Go up.

05:45.305 --> 05:46.139
‪Ah.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.017
‪You have my number, right?

05:49.976 --> 05:50.810
‪Yeah.

05:55.732 --> 05:56.566
‪Hmph!

05:57.734 --> 05:58.568
‪Let's go.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.246
‪Yes, bro.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.497
‪Uh, are you coming down?

06:12.332 --> 06:13.458
‪I'm on my way now.

06:14.334 --> 06:16.002
‪Don't get hurt, okay?

06:16.586 --> 06:17.420
‪Yes.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.756
‪I'll take care of the rest
‪with Kang-yong, bro.

06:20.631 --> 06:21.758
‪Drive safely.

06:21.841 --> 06:22.675
‪Yes.

06:56.204 --> 06:57.330
‪Let's go quickly.

06:57.413 --> 06:58.247
‪Just a moment.

06:59.248 --> 07:00.082
‪Just a moment.

07:12.719 --> 07:13.553
‪Bro.

07:17.056 --> 07:17.890
‪Okay.

07:30.986 --> 07:31.987
‪Set sail!

07:43.249 --> 07:44.741
‪Bro, check the inside first.

07:44.825 --> 07:45.659
‪Ah!

07:45.743 --> 07:46.744
‪Ah!

08:27.010 --> 08:28.136
‪Kim Myeong-gil!

08:48.448 --> 08:49.741
‪Ugh, damn it.

09:00.084 --> 09:01.503
‪Uh, uh.

10:02:57.356 --> 10:02:58.983
‪If you appear again...

10:03:01.903 --> 10:03:03.279
‪You're dead.

10:03:48.449 --> 10:03:49.283
‪Geon-woo.

10:03:53.704 --> 10:03:54.622
‪Are you okay?

10:04:06.759 --> 10:04:07.802
‪What's wrong?

10:04:10.972 --> 01:04:11.848
‪Bro.

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:17.228
‪I feel like I've become a hunting dog.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.874
‪Geon-woo,
‪have you forgotten a boxer's heart?

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.669
‪We just need to go back to how we were.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:43.504
‪Huh?

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.381
‪Let's go back together, you and I.

01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:51.971
‪Yeah.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:53.931
‪Let's go back.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:03.649
‪Here.

01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:23.711
‪Oh! Bro!

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.799
Ah, damn it!

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:30.343
‪Found it!

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.602
‪Oh.

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:40.895
‪Yes, bro, where are you?

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:42.229
‪Almost there.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.482
‪The gold bars, did you find them?

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.567
‪Yes, found them all.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:48.903
‪The cell phone?

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.489
‪I'll take care of it.

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:53.824
Ah, bro, this, this.
Uh, uh, uh.

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.409
Uh, uh.
Let's go.

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:05.252
‪What happened?

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.213
‪Finally, found the cell phone.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.300
‪Good job.

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:13.469
‪Requested support from Interpol.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:14.845
‪They'll be waiting in Vietnam.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.181
‪It's all over.

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:18.891
‪My younger brother worked hard.

01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:20.351
‪Thank you, bro.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.077
‪What would you like to do?

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:41.163
‪Hmm...

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.708
‪The boss always

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.128
‪wanted to help people who
‪couldn't afford treatment because they were poor.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.671
‪So, I

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.007
‪would like this money to be used
‪according to the boss's wishes.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.467
What do you think, bro?

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.886
‪You... how about you, bro?

01:06:57.513 --> 06:59:306
‪Don't you desire this money?

07:03:102 --> 07:05:229
‪Uh, I do, bro.

07:05:312 --> 07:08:107
‪But this money isn't mine.

07:08.941 --> 07:11:777
‪I'm just repaying the kindness
‪the boss showed me,

07:12.278 --> 07:14.155
‪and keeping my promise to the boss.

07:16.032 --> 07:17.158
‪Yeah.

07:18.409 --> 07:20.077
Kids.

07:20.161 --> 07:20.995
‪Right now, there are

07:21.579 --> 07:24.123
‪168 gold bars, each weighing 7 kg.

07:24.206 --> 07:25.875
‪At today's rate, one is 500 million won.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.835
‪Roughly 84 billion won.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.587
If you wish,

07:29.670 --> 07:30.921
‪I will take this money

07:31.005 --> 07:33.966
‪and establish a welfare foundation
‪under our group.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.802
‪Through that welfare foundation,
‪we can provide medical expenses

07:36.886 --> 07:38.304
‪to those in need.

07:39.263 --> 07:40.097
‪Or,

07:40.181 --> 07:42.308
‪we could add a little more money
‪from our group

07:43.059 --> 07:44.685
‪and just build a hospital?

07:45.311 --> 07:47.313
Oh, that's pretty innovative!
Isn't it?

07:47.396 --> 07:48.397
‪Yes.

07:48.481 --> 07:50.357
‪My father would like it too,

07:50.983 --> 07:52.860
‪and it would help our group's image.

07:53.402 --> 07:55.196
‪And we'd be doing good in the world.

07:55.279 --> 07:58.449
‪I'll finish up the hotel work
‪and push this forward immediately.

07:58.532 --> 07:59.366
‪Uh, bro, by any chance,

08:00.201 --> 08:03.329
‪could the boss's name
‪be included in the hospital name?

08:03.954 --> 08:04.789
‪His name?

08:04.872 --> 08:06.415
‪It's Choi, Tae-ja, Ho-ja.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.752
‪Honestly, it would be difficult, but

08:10.669 --> 08:12.379
‪I'll consider it.

08:12.463 --> 08:13.589
‪Thank you, bro.

08:21.472 --> 08:22.473
‪Uh, uh?

08:22.556 --> 08:24.350
‪I'll cover the missing money
‪with my own funds.

08:25.101 --> 08:27.144
‪It's a bonus for finishing the job well.

08:27.770 --> 08:29.855
‪Uh, bro, no.
‪I'm, I'm really fine.

08:30.439 --> 08:32.233
‪The boss would have done the same.

08:33.067 --> 08:33.901
‪Take it.

08:39.031 --> 08:41.117
‪You don't know what to say,
‪do you?

08:44.245 --> 08:45.287
‪"Thank you."

08:46.997 --> 08:48.666
‪Thank you, boss.

08:48.749 --> 08:49.667
‪No.

08:51.001 --> 08:52.419
‪I should thank you.

08:55.714 --> 08:57.383
‪Thank you very much, bro.

09:09.145 --> 09:09.979
‪Catch him!

09:10.062 --> 09:11.647
No.
Go.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.858
Here, uh?

09:13.941 --> 09:15.109
I have...
Huh?

09:16.277 --> 09:18.237
I have this too.

09:20.156 --> 09:21.365
‪Uh, Geon-woo!

09:22.241 --> 09:23.325
‪Uh, where is it?

09:25.161 --> 09:26.412
Hello.
Huh?

09:26.495 --> 09:27.454
‪Geon-woo!

09:30.624 --> 09:31.542
‪Ugh.

09:41.218 --> 09:42.720
‪Ah, my son.

09:47.975 --> 09:48.976
‪Uh, Woo-jin.

09:50.769 --> 09:52.605
‪Ugh, what happened to your face?

09:53.606 --> 09:55.608
‪Ugh, you worked hard.

09:59.486 --> 01:10:01.322
‪It's all over, Mom.
‪Let's go home.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.032
‪Okay.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.493
‪Ugh, you're so brave.
