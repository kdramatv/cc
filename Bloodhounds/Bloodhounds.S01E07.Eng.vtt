WEBVTT

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.802
Is the patient's condition stable?

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.095
BP is dropping again.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.930
Let me check.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.828
[Calm music plays without other sounds]

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:02.771
Here, have this.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.399
You need to eat well today.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.193
Thank you.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.110
You're welcome.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.510
Excuse me.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.929
Did you see where the person who was here went?

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.430
They left a while ago.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.598
Around when?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.558
About 10 minutes ago?

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:43.937
Th-Thank you.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.294
Um...

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.339
You're Mr. Hong Woojin's guardian, right?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.258
Oh, yes.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.594
The surgery went well.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.471
We'll have to monitor his progress, but

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.890
the surgery was a success.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.901
Ah, thank you.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.571
Thank you so much.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.075
Stay strong.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.161
Yes, yes.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.456
Thank you.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.969
Hey.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.555
It scares me every time.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:07.932
Let's go.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.144
Ah, ah, ah!

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.360
Let's go.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.200
Run.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.191
Ah...

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.014
86.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:31.891
88.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:33.476
89!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.977
Ten.
90.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:37.730
One!

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:38.856
Two.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.774
Three.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:41.901
Eleven.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:43.903
Twelve.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.446
Thirteen.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.491
Fourteen.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.909
Did you sleep well?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.620
Did you sleep well?

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.301
Let's keep going.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.553
Okay.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.598
Fifteen.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.934
Sixteen.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:16.519
One, two, three, four!

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:18.855
One, two, three, four!

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:19.772
Five!

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.107
One, two, three, four!

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.359
One, two, three, four!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.320
One, two, three, four!

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.489
One, two, three, four!

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.324
One, two, three, four!

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:51.053
Damn, we actually did it!

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.222
Wow! We actually did it!

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.938
Brother, get up, get up.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.192
I think we need to break their balance

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.776
by twisting them.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.028
Kids.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.946
Let's talk for a bit.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.035
I told you it wouldn't work.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.288
You'll just go up there and die for nothing.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.792
We understand why you're worried about us, sir,

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.211
Then why don't you listen?

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.962
Are you rebelling?

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.672
Sir.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.550
Today, I'll tell you.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:35.097
I believe we can fight and defeat Kim Myung-gil.

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.064
Yang Joong died, and Doo Young died.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:44.774
How can you win?

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.944
We just need to move as the boss taught us.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.029
Many people

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:51.531
lost their families to Kim Myung-gil

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.866
and had precious things stolen.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.203
The boss said if we gather them and unite our strength,

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.288
we can definitely win.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.375
They all know they can't win alone,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:03.876
so they're hiding. But,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.045
if people like my brother and I show up,

0m 9s685ms --> 0m 10s455ms
they will surely lend a hand.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.632
Before that,

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.926
what if Kim Myung-gil catches you?

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.678
Oh, you don't have to worry about fighting.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.221
My brother's wounds have healed,

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:17.723
and I've moved up two weight classes, so my punches are stronger.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.476
We're fully prepared to take down Kim Myung-gil's henchmen.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.479
If we use what the boss and the uncles taught us,

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.856
I believe we can definitely defeat Kim Myung-gil.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:28.609
I

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.486
cannot allow it,

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.655
so keep that in mind.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.408
Oh, come on...

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.905
By the time you open this letter,

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.866
I'll be in Rome.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.660
With the money Grandpa gave me,

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.621
I got a small place to stay.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.374
Grandpa and I promised to go to Rome together

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.418
after we catch Kim Myung-gil,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.712
but I ruined everything.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:33.507
I won't ask you to understand me.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:37.428
But if I stay here, I keep thinking of Grandpa,

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:39.055
and I can't bear it.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:42.224
Everywhere I go, I think of Grandpa,

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.311
and I can't stop crying.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.563
I feel like I'm going crazy.

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.816
It'll get better if I go to a faraway country.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.444
I love you.

00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:55.112
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:10.878
Oh, man, it hurts so much.

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.338
Brother, this isn't pain.

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.965
This is your weakness leaving your body.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.425
What are you talking about?

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.595
It means you're stronger today than you were yesterday.

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.059
Kids.

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:27.103
Follow me.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:31.691
Yes.

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.210
This is the last emergency money

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.129
the boss left for us.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:54.797
Take it upstairs.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:56.716
I'm sorry

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.552
for trying to trap you with my own thoughts.

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:02.096
I'll prepare lodging and a car in Seoul.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.390
Don't get hurt.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.268
Sir.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.103
Thank you.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.691
We will win.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.151
Room 809.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:01.655
Oh, brother.

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:12.541
Yes.

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:17.838
Hello.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.050
We were sent by Mr. Oh In-mook.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.601
Come in.

00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:31.644
Go in.

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:41.320
Alright.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:45.449
If the tape is torn or reattached when I return,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.951
I'll call the police.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:48.786
Why?

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:50.871
Because my underwear is in there.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:54.416
Oh, oh, that will never happen.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:58.003
There's a bed there and one up here.

00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.713
Who wants to sleep on the top bunk?

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.131
It doesn't matter.
Yes.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.342
Then you sleep on the top.

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:04.343
Yes.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:05.469
Excuse me,

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.931
may I ask why you made that choice, ma'am?

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:11.392
It's my choice.

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:13.477
Ah.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.107
Uh, here's the card for the front door,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.984
and the car key Grandpa told you to rent.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:23.529
And my number,

00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:24.947
but try not to call me.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.865
I'm busy.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.408
That's it?

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.701
Yes.

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:30.327
Then.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.461
Thank you.

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.130
Uh...

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.802
Hey, wait a minute...
Huh?

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.555
Didn't you just call driver Oh "Grandpa"?

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:51.348
Yeah, she must be his granddaughter.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.812
Oh, now that you mention it, she does resemble him. Huh?

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.231
She's petite and wears glasses.

00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:02.735
But don't you think she was forced to lend us the room?

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:04.445
Right?
Yeah.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:06.989
I feel bad.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.699
Hey, enough of that.

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.035
Let's quickly shower and plan our strategy.
Okay.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.039
Ugh, my stomach hurts.
Oh, oh, ow, ugh.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:39.647
Reason?

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.856
I think it's important

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.983
to catch Yang Jae-myung and get information first.

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:43.901
What about you, brother?

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.741
I think it's important to gather allies first.

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:52.534
We'll create synergy if we move together.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.619
That's a good point.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.790
But how do we find this person?

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:00.209
The boss also said he'd be the biggest help.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.878
I've been thinking about it on the way up,

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.713
and it won't be easy to meet him.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.091
I'll figure something out.

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:08.008
Okay.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.349
Oh, brother!
Huh?

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.232
Whoa, this model has a retractable roof.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.733
The roof opens?
Yeah.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.527
It's a convertible?

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:37.746
Brother.

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:42.418
Among the loan sharks in Myeongdong,

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.170
there are so many people like you who got robbed by Smile Capital.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.673
So you're saying we should gather them and combine forces?

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.466
Brother, honestly, the loan sharks in this neighborhood, huh?

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:52.052
Brother, everyone knows each other through one connection or another.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:53.512
If you take the lead, those people

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:55.514
will all move.

0m 16s595ms --> 0m 17s225ms
They'll all move.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.268
Then what?

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.395
Get back the money that was stolen,

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.480
and make sure Smile Capital can never again

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.107
do something like this to individual loan sharks, just completely

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:08.110
crush them, yeah?

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.903
You also lost hundreds of millions, didn't you, brother?

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.037
I can't do it.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.455
Ah...

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.707
If this goes wrong, I could actually die.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.375
Then what about the stolen money?

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:24.835
That damn money, sh*t.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.880
Ah, I can just earn it back, huh?

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.840
Anyway, I'm absolutely not getting involved.

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.468
My life is more important than money.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.595
Brother, please, just one more time...
Hey!

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.196
Hey, what the hell is this?

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:54.948
What's wrong with this?

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:57.993
Senior?

00:17:58.577 --> 00:17:59.495
Senior!

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.831
Hey, you can't come in here.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.794
Oh, what brings my junior marines here?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.921
Senior, what happened here?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.714
Huh?

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.008
Ah, these...

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.843
A few days ago,

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:18.305
those gangsters came and cleaned me out.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:20.557
Why?

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.236
I have 10 billion won in bonds with one month left on the statute of limitations.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:35.239
If you collect this money, Mr. President,

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:36.323
I'll give you a commission

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:38.575
of five percent.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:43.372
This is a business where I have nothing to lose, isn't it?

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:44.998
Then let's sign the contract immediately.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.545
It seems our graceful madam

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:52.172
isn't accustomed to such matters.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.216
Uh, these kinds of things,

00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:57.386
they are generally based on mutual trust,

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.930
uh, that's how we conduct business.

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:07.980
I'll find someone else.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.526
No, no, no, no...
No, no, no, that...

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.903
Generally, there are exceptions, uh.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.822
There are exceptions, so, uh.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.913
Later, I found out

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.542
that in the middle of the contract, in tiny letters, uh?

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:31.712
If I couldn't collect the bonds within a month,

00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:34.298
I'd have to pay back half the total amount.

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:35.883
That's what it said.

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.889
That contract is similar to Smile Capital's.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.807
What's that?

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.185
The representative is Kim Myung-gil.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.730
Oh, Kim Myung-gil, who was under the boss?

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.190
Yes.

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:53.483
Where is that son of a bitch now?

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:57.654
Senior, did you hear about what happened to the boss?

00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.239
What?

00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:00.824
The boss...

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.871
was killed by Kim Myung-gil.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.336
Damn, this isn't funny at all.

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.546
Ugh, damn it.

0m 20s419ms --> 0m 21s51ms
This isn't funny at all.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.605
Damn, this isn't funny.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.191
Damn, it's not funny!

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.967
Why would the boss die?

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:02.261
Huh?

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:04.805
Our boss...

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:07.015
Why did he die?!

0m 21s423ms --> 0m 21s805ms
Boss, why did he die?

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:11.436
Ugh, answer me, you bastards!

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.604
You, damn it!

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:18.944
Why did our boss die, you bastards?!

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.795
Ugh, I'm tired.

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.380
I'm so tired.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.632
Let's go inside and rest.

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.384
Yes.
Yes.

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.015
What is it?

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:52.102
Long time no see.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.982
You damn bastards.
Ugh, sh*t.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.400
Damn it!

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.943
Ready!

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:13.290
Hey, I'll tell you everything, just don't hit me, okay?

00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:15.876
The word got out among the homeless,

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.544
so these days, I'm going around disability facilities

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:18.795
picking up ID cards.

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.714
Who asked about you?

00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:22.466
How's Smile Capital doing?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.011
Ah, well, you could ask me something more specific.

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.804
Did the casino open?

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:30.682
Wait a minute.

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:32.267
Hey, lower your eyes.

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:34.770
You, come over here.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.104
Why?

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.901
Geon-woo, be a bit tougher.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.195
What should I do?

00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.030
First, no polite speech.

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.449
But, brother,

00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:49.993
that person looks over forty,

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.495
so I feel weird speaking informally to them.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.622
Alright, then.

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.791
If they look down on you, beat them with your fists.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:58.001
Okay.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:03.173
Look,

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:05.884
it might be hard to believe, but I'm 31,

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:08.970
and I'm not looking down on either of you, so there's no need to hit me.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.098
I don't have a single healthy part of my body.

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.265
Recently, some bastard

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:14.267
slashed both my Achilles tendons with a sashimi knife,

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.728
and it took me four months just for rehab.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.814
That bastard is our brother. Watch your mouth.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.067
I was wrong then.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.693
You had every right to do that.

0m 23s693ms --> 0m 24s123ms
You had every right to do that.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:26.321
You asked about the casino, right?

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.239
Yes.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.075
I overheard the director talking on the phone recently...

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:32.202
Director? What's his name?

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.161
Kim Jun-min.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.415
He's alive?

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.126
Some bastard slit his throat with a knife and he almost died...

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.585
Damn it.

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.462
Ah, ah.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.589
You're all together.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.301
Okay. I 100% understand now, alright?

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:51.471
I'll be careful what I say from now on, so you don't need to hit me.

00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:53.890
I hate Kim Jun-min.

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:55.392
He's a damn asshole.

00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:57.519
Smile Capital are also damn bastards.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.479
I'm only sticking with them for the money, okay?

00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:00.397
You came at the right time.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.107
I had a lot of pent-up anger.
I'll tell you everything.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.568
Alright, just get to the point.

00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.319
I overheard them talking,

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:08.822
and they're still fighting with Ail Group over the contract.

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:11.700
So Kim Myung-gil is apparently super sensitive.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:12.617
And?

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.454
There's Lim Jang-do.
A close buddy of Kim Jun-min.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:16.997
A real son of a bitch, huh?

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.041
That son of a bitch was in charge of the cops, but he suddenly disappeared?

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:23.044
But Kim Myung-gil was recently playing at a room salon,

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.421
and got into an argument with some guy,

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:25.839
and broke his wrist.

0m 25s839ms --> 0m 26s209ms
And broke his wrist.

00:24:26.423 --> 00:24:28.758
So the police were called, and it was a huge mess,

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:30.802
but it just passed as if nothing happened.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.305
Normally, when the police show up, it doesn't just pass like that.

00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:34.848
According to Kim Jun-min,

00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:36.433
Kim Myung-gil seems to have found a substitute for Lim Jang-do.

00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.351
Kim Myung-gil seems to have found a substitute for Lim Jang-do.

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:39.269
Oh...

00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:41.605
But he's still not saying anything.

00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:42.814
Why?

00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:45.233
He doesn't even trust his own people.

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:46.818
Anything else?

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:50.405
Oh, he's trying to acquire a golf course in Gyeonggi-do.

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:53.450
That's why we're slaving away like this, huh?

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:54.576
He doesn't pay worth a damn,

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:55.744
but he makes us work like hell.

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.412
Right? Huh?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.749
Ah, that's all the recent issues.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.168
Okay.

00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:04.669
Wait a minute.

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.555
You know you'll be screwed if you send this to Kim Jun-min, right?

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:17.140
Keep your mouth shut.

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:18.350
Don't worry.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.228
If you need anything, just contact me anytime.

00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:24.648
I'm also one of those who wish for Smile Capital's downfall.

00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:27.901
Can you also find the phone number of Ail Group's eldest son?

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.153
Ah, that might be difficult.

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:33.490
Ah, those people have very tight security, you see.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.200
Ah...

00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:45.210
Okay, his name is Hong Min-beom.

00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.336
Hey, we have the same last name.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:47.963
Brother.

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:49.673
Jajangmyeon in Seoul is still

00:25:49.756 --> 00:25:51.132
the best, I think. Yeah.
Yeah.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.890
Why are you using someone else's computer without permission?

00:55:59.391 --> 00:56:01.726
Oh, the messenger is all logged in, you know.

00:56:02.727 --> 00:56:04.646
I'm really sorry. I didn't open the messenger at all.

00:56:05.855 --> 00:56:07.482
Go to the PC bang in the basement of the next building.

00:56:07.566 --> 00:56:09.359
Alright, I'm sorry.

00:56:09.442 --> 00:56:10.735
Turn it off quickly.

00:56:10.819 --> 00:56:11.778
Alright.

00:56:11.861 --> 00:56:12.862
I'll just use it this once.

00:56:13.863 --> 00:56:15.865
Turn it off quickly.

00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:16.783
Yes.

00:56:17.409 --> 00:56:18.451
I'm sorry.

00:56:18.535 --> 00:56:20.036
Ugh, so tiring.

00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.082
But how did she know?
Ah, when I turned on the computer,

00:56:24.165 --> 00:56:26.001
the messenger automatically logged in, so she probably got an alert.

00:56:26.084 --> 00:56:27.043
Yeah.

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:37.679
Awesome.
Why?

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:41.266
Hong Min-beom has 500,000 followers.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.685
Wait a minute.

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.956
Oh, stop.
Stop, stop, stop!

00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.023
Did I tell you or not

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.443
to get the contract ready

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:35.528
so I could transfer the money by today?

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.947
I was going to, but...

00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:40.909
My father...

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.327
Hey, you bastard!

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.496
How dare you!

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.084
You bastard!

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.836
You bastard! You, you bastard! You bastard!

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.837
You bastard!

00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:57.926
Beom-ah.

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:13.024
Please help me, please help me!

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:13.942
Help me!

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:17.487
By this Friday,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.906
change the contract as I told you.
Yes.

00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:21.825
If you don't, I'll release the video,

00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:23.159
and because of that video,

00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:26.329
I'll make it look like you committed suicide. Got it?

00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:31.918
Yes, yes.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.216
Do you want to catch Kim Myung-gil?

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.343
We will help you.

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.096
Ah, damn it, what are these guys now?

00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:33.855
Let's meet once.

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:36.232
If we're going to meet, let's meet quickly, brother.

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.359
I have to give the contract by Friday.

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.112
Then ask them if they're available now.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.572
If they suddenly say yes, what do I say?

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.157
Let's call the bar you go to.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.909
If we get them drunk, their true intentions will come out.

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:48.495
Ah, damn.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.583
Don't worry, I'll send two of our team members with you.

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.348
In-seong-ah.

00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.599
Yes.
It's good, right?

00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:10.600
Ah, yes.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.269
Don't eat it, damn it!

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.562
Yes.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.566
Bro, bro, bro, bro!

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:22.904
Hello, hello.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:23.822
Hello.

00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:30.620
Ah, I'm Min-beom's cousin.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.664
Ah, I'm Kim Geon-woo.

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:34.415
I'm Hong Woojin.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.042
I'm the one who sent the DM.

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.837
Let's sit down.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.754
Yes.

00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:47.136
Well, let's have a drink and talk slowly.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.805
Uh...

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:52.308
Ah...

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:53.977
Ah... Uh...

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.145
Uh, I'm really sorry, but

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.315
I was stabbed by Kim Myung-gil's henchmen,

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:02.652
and my liver was slightly torn, so I can't drink alcohol.

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:06.281
If you don't want to drink,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.700
just say you don't want to drink.

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:09.701
It's okay.

00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.541
It's true.

00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:18.209
Here, here.

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:19.961
Here.

00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:23.590
Alright, yes, okay.

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:26.009
Put that down.
Ah, it's unsightly, put it down.

00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:27.635
Okay, well, you rest a bit.

00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:29.596
Did you get stabbed too?

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.390
Uh, no. I don't drink alcohol normally.

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:37.478
Ah, we're going to have a deep conversation, so let's have a drink.

00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.983
No.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.652
Let's all be honest with each other now.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.904
Didn't we agree to meet for that?

00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:47.614
Ah, if you back out on such a small thing,

00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.073
how can we trust you?

00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.659
Ah, and frankly,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.204
you also needed us, so you asked to meet, didn't you?

00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:06.132
I'll just have a drink.
Okay.

00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:08.718
No, I'll, I'll drink it.

00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:13.389
Alright.

00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:18.019
Here, Director Hong.

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.187
Uh, yes.

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:26.361
Alright, let's have a drink.

00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.073
Bottoms up.

00:32:31.407 --> 00:32:32.241
Yes.

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.961
Oh, he drinks well.

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:44.170
Alright, today,

00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:46.798
we busy people will drink from this glass.

00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:48.508
Whiskey is for glasses.

00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.676
Yes.
Alright.

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:51.594
Alright.

00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:52.595
Alright.

00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:42.395
Mm.

00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:43.312
Awesome.

00:33:43.396 --> 00:34:44.476
Slowly now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:56.659
Ah, this feels good now, ah.

00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:00.702
Damn it...

00:35:33.738 --> 00:35:34.655
This is fun.

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:37.075
Ah, brother, nice to meet you. I...

00:35:38.034 --> 00:35:40.703
I've been so stressed because of that Kim Myung-gil bastard.

00:35:40.787 --> 00:35:42.497
Brother, I'm Kang-yong.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.290
Kang-yong, yes.
Huh? I'm Kang-yong.

00:35:44.373 --> 00:35:45.333
Alright, pour me one.
Yes!

00:35:46.084 --> 00:35:48.544
Because of that son of a bitch Kim Myung-gil,

00:35:50.004 --> 00:35:52.590
I even got alopecia areata

00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:55.009
and hemorrhoids, damn it.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.096
Just now, I saw him and immediately hit him.

00:35:58.721 --> 00:36:00.348
That son of a bitch.

00:36:00.431 --> 00:36:04.185
Our Chief loves me so much!

00:36:04.268 --> 00:36:05.770
Hey, when we're alone, you tell me.
Ah.

00:36:05.853 --> 00:36:06.813
'Hey, Chief Min,'

00:36:06.896 --> 00:36:08.815
'Hey, brother! Don't do that, brother!'

00:36:08.898 --> 00:36:11.400
'Chief Min, if someone else hears, they'll misunderstand.'

00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:16.405
Brother, take good care of him. He's family now.

00:36:16.489 --> 00:36:18.658
Take good care of him, he seems nice.

00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:22.370
Woojin, you, and the two of you, do whatever you want.

00:36:22.453 --> 00:36:25.164
Damn it, brother, I'll support you all the way, brother, all the way.

00:36:25.248 --> 00:36:26.541
Shall I pour you a drink?

00:36:26.624 --> 00:36:28.126
Can't drink.
Yes.

00:36:28.209 --> 00:36:29.919
I can't drink because of my hemorrhoids.

00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:32.088
Ah, damn it, it's because I worked overtime yesterday.

00:36:32.171 --> 00:36:34.632
I should drink for two more hours.

00:36:54.443 --> 00:36:55.695
Ah, damn.

00:37:06.122 --> 00:37:07.081
Brother.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.174
What now, damn it?

00:37:18.467 --> 00:37:19.969
Huh? Brother, did you sleep well?

00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:22.972
Did you sleep well?

00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:26.392
Wh-What happened here?

00:37:27.852 --> 00:37:29.020
Oh, ah.

00:37:29.103 --> 00:37:31.063
Yesterday, you said you wanted to drink more at your place,

00:37:31.147 --> 00:37:32.273
and brought us here.

00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:33.274
Ah.

00:37:33.816 --> 00:37:35.735
I was just about to wake you because the ramen is ready.

00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:36.944
You need to sober up, brother.
Yeah.

00:37:37.028 --> 00:37:37.987
Brother, have a seat.

00:37:38.988 --> 00:37:40.865
Hey, Geon-woo, this.
Okay.

00:37:40.948 --> 00:37:42.867
I'll go wake up brother Kang-yong.
Okay.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.453
Ah, how much did we drink, damn it.

00:37:48.998 --> 00:37:50.708
Geonho? Geonwoo?

00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:52.960
It's 'woo'.

00:37:53.044 --> 00:37:54.712
Ah...

00:37:56.172 --> 00:37:57.423
What did we decide to do?

00:37:57.506 --> 00:37:58.716
Ah, brother Kang-yong said

00:37:58.799 --> 00:37:01.219
he'd bring a computer expert from the police station

00:37:01.302 --> 00:37:03.221
to hack Kim Myung-gil's phone, then

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:05.765
burn all the hard drives in his safe.

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:07.600
I made ramen.
You need to sober up, brother!

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.353
Brother.
Brother, get up, oh.

00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:11.854
This Friday, when Kim Myung-gil

00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:13.981
comes to Ail Group to sign the contract,

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.316
that's when we're doing it.

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.234
Who?

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.237
You, brother.

00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:21.864
Ah, well, of course it would be me.

00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:23.574
Ah, come on, let's eat, ugh.

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.576
How much did we drink?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.662
Careful, careful.

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.501
Please enjoy your meal.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:39.465
Eat, eat.

00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:42.593
Thank you for the meal.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.269
It's been a long time since I've had this.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.521
You cooked it well.

00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:04.407
Wow!
It's really big.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.784
It's so tall.

00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:08.411
Ah, how many floors is this?

00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:11.580
Ah, thank you.

00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:13.958
Oh, brother, hello, hello.
Oh, you're here?

00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:14.875
Hello.
Oh.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.210
Yes, hello, yes.

00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:18.963
Yes.

00:38:19.046 --> 00:38:20.131
I'll introduce our staff.

00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:24.427
You do it.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.222
This is Sergeant Yoon Han-goo.
Nice to meet you.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.017
Hello.

00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:32.518
Hello.

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:34.645
I'm Kang Tae-young, team leader of the Cyber Crime Investigation Division.

00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.147
My presence here is a secret.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.064
Nice to meet you.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:37.982
Ah.

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.901
My being here is a secret too,

00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:42.486
we're all secrets.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.529
Yes.

00:38:43.612 --> 00:38:44.989
Anyway, Tae-young

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:47.283
is the best in our country when it comes to cyber security.

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:49.243
From now on, I'll brief you on how to hack Kim Myung-gil's phone

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.871
and activate the safe.

00:38:51.954 --> 00:38:53.664
Yes, there are two methods.

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.416
The first method is Wi-Fi.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.751
First, I'll install a small jammer

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.753
in the meeting room where I have a meeting, to block signals,

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.671
which will temporarily make internet usage impossible.

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.298
Then, we'll naturally induce the suspect

00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:03.758
to connect to Wi-Fi.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.801
Uh, the moment the suspect connects to the transmitter I created,

00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:07.762
I can infiltrate their phone.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.056
Once I infiltrate the phone, it's game over.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:11.640
Uh, I've already completed a preliminary investigation

00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:13.976
into safe apps that the suspect might use.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.686
Uh, the second method is

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.230
for the suspect to open a more direct gate.

00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:19.607
Because of COVID-19, we

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.692
scan personal QR codes when entering buildings, right?

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:23.819
I'll place a QR code I created at the entrance

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.321
and have them scan it with their phone.

00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:26.989
The moment that QR code enters their phone,

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:29.367
uh, a door will open for me to hack.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.702
We'll use both methods simultaneously.

00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:33.120
No.

00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:37.249
What do I need to do?

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.711
Uh, it's best if you can make the suspect

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.838
use our Wi-Fi for as long as possible.

00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:45.841
Uh, I'll infiltrate the cloud and extract data,

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:48.552
and this can take some time depending on the size of the data.

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:49.720
If we're lucky,

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.597
we can sweep up all the criminal evidence

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.308
he's committed so far, and even his accomplices.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.436
But what if...

00:39:59.647 --> 01:00:01.065
What if that bastard notices?

01:00:02.024 --> 01:00:02.942
Do you have another plan?

01:00:05.403 --> 01:00:07.363
We're trying to prevent

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.740
such a situation by using two methods

01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:11.492
simultaneously.
No! No! No, no, brother!

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.119
That's not it! That's not it...

01:00:15.496 --> 01:00:17.623
No matter what it takes,

01:00:17.706 --> 01:00:20.251
it's right to destroy the hard drive tomorrow immediately.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.003
If it were me, I'd do that even if I had to snatch his phone.

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:25.548
It's a simple task, it's not difficult, is it?

01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:27.633
Why are you making it sound so hard, you'll choke.

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:30.344
I'll take the phone.

01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:31.887
Han-goo.

01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:37.935
Uh, can I ask what's on the hard drive?

01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:40.521
Ah, damn it! Seriously!

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:41.981
Ah, ah, you two,

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:44.817
stay put.

01:00:45.526 --> 01:00:46.360
Yes.

01:00:50.865 --> 00:40:52.908
Min-beom, can I see you for a moment?

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.682
Min-beom.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:18.934
You're very anxious, aren't you?

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.313
This is a pretty high-difficulty operation.

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.273
We're moving unofficially,

00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:25.858
so there are many limitations.
Brother.

00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:31.822
If I can't erase this hard drive, I'll be tied to Kim Myung-gil forever.

00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:33.032
I'll be in serious trouble.

00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:35.367
That's why I'll do my very best.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.536
Just trust me a little more, brother!

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:45.127
Alright.

00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:04.813
Ah.

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:09.777
Oh? No.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:16.617
Are you sure?

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.035
Of course.

00:42:57.324 --> 00:42:58.951
You can measure the temperature.

00:43:01.036 --> 00:43:02.871
Scan the QR code with the camera.

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.166
Isn't it usually the other way around?

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.210
It's our building system.

00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:11.505
Yes, it's a bit unusual.

00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:21.390
It's working.

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:33.569
Okay.

00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:35.237
Yes!

00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:41.452
Oh?

00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:43.495
Why? What is it?

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:45.205
There's nothing in the album.

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.248
Wait a minute.

00:43:46.332 --> 00:43:47.458
"No data found."

00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:58.886
There's no safe app here, as you mentioned.

00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.058
You guys heard it right, didn't you?

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.100
Yes.

00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:07.394
It wasn't a situation where Lim Jang-do could lie.

00:44:10.397 --> 00:44:12.024
Ah, did that bastard figure it out?

00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:22.034
Oh my!

00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:23.994
Director Hong.

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:28.332
How do you do?

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.751
Huh?

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:51.647
Ugh, damn it.

00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:54.733
Why?

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.112
He doesn't have the safe app on his phone.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.299
This bastard has two phones.

00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:21.427
What are you talking about?

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.679
The phone that scanned the QR code earlier was black, but

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.431
this one is silver.

00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:27.182
Ah...
Ah...

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.435
Then what do we do now?

00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:31.395
We need to make him connect to Wi-Fi.

00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.741
Oh, the team leader is coming back.

00:45:48.662 --> 00:45:49.955
Uh, Director...
No, it's fine, it's fine.

00:45:50.038 --> 00:45:52.166
Do you need anything?
No, no, it's fine.

00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:01.216
What happened?

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.594
Kim Myung-gil has two phones.

00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:05.763
We hacked one, but there's no safe app on it,

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:08.640
and the one with the app is in that pouch.

00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:10.184
So?

00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:13.353
We're still thinking, brother.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.231
We really don't have much time.
That, that will be over soon.

00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:21.278
Brother, let's talk among ourselves for a moment.

00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:22.196
Ah, damn it.

00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.741
Tae-young, Han-goo.

00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:28.035
Could you two excuse us for a moment?

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.453
Yes, yes.

00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:37.419
Brother, what did Lim Jang-do use to film the video then?

00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.171
His phone.

00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:40.798
Then wouldn't Lim Jang-do have sent the video

00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:42.216
to Kim Myung-gil's phone?

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:43.801
To confirm it?

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:45.010
Yes.

00:46:45.093 --> 00:46:46.470
Before you stamp the contract,

00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:49.389
just demand that he deletes the video first.

00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:52.184
Then Kim Myung-gil will have no choice but to take out his phone.

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:53.310
What if he didn't send it?

00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:55.646
If he denies sending it, what do I say?

00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:59.399
Tell him to show you the chat with Lim Jang-do if he's so confident.

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:03.028
And tell him that Lim Jang-do said he would send it to the representative.

00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:04.530
Ah, seriously?

00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:06.782
Criminals like Kim Myung-gil trust no one.

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:10.077
To confirm if Lim Jang-do finished the job properly,

00:47:10.577 --> 00:47:12.913
he would have told him to send the video after it was done.

00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:22.881
I'm not confident.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:26.969
Trust me, brother.

00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:28.053
No, that's not it.

00:47:29.304 --> 00:47:31.431
I don't have the confidence to confront Kim Myung-gil, brother.

00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:36.895
I'm scared!

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:41.525
Just looking at him makes my hands tremble, damn it, brother!

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.533
Min-beom.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.454
I

00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:56.790
believe you can do it.

00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:01.086
If there's even a slight hint of trouble, I'll step in immediately.

00:48:01.587 --> 00:48:03.589
And if, by any chance, things escalate,

00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:07.885
our family will mobilize all its resources to protect you.

00:48:10.512 --> 00:48:12.180
So let's be brave just this once.

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:21.231
Brother, we'll go in with you too.

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:22.941
You can do it, brother.

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.672
Everyone was waiting, but

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.716
where did you go?

00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:50.510
Lawyers, please step outside for a moment.

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.388
I have something to discuss with CEO Kim.

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:54.973
Ah, yes.

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.280
Do you want to be arrested as a現行犯 (in flagrante delicto)?

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.456
What?

00:49:20.374 --> 00:49:21.208
Trying to act cool?

00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:23.168
Before you sign,

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.796
delete the video first.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:28.924
It's at home.

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:32.719
Once we sign the contract, I'll go home and delete it right away.

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.804
I promise.

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.015
Are you messing with me right now?

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.143
I know your subordinate sent it to you on your phone.

00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:45.357
Delete it in front of me.

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:04.751
Oh ho.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.229
Deleting.

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.188
No.

00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:27.941
Let me delete it myself.

00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:29.901
I don't trust you.

00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:32.654
What if I refuse?

00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:35.282
Then, damn it, I won't sign the contract either.

00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:38.326
You're crazy.

00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:41.413
Hey.

00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:45.876
If you mess with me, do you think my family will just stand by?

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.795
I was so embarrassed that

00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.132
I've been working alone until now to resolve this quietly.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.426
Ah.

00:50:55.093 --> 00:50:56.636
My aunt is the Commissioner of the National Tax Service.

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:59.181
One phone call from me, and without you being able to stop it,

00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:00.974
your company will be audited tomorrow.

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.017
How about that?

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:04.686
Want to get hit with a tax bomb worth hundreds of billions?

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.605
Want to take this all the way? Huh?

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:15.947
Your way of speaking has improved a lot, hasn't it?

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.201
In a threatening tone.

01:00:19.993 --> 01:00:21.119
I learned it from you.

01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:26.333
I like it.

01:00:29.503 --> 01:00:30.504
I don't like it.

00:51:56.363 --> 00:51:57.322
It appeared.

00:51:58.615 --> 00:51:59.449
Wait a minute.

00:52:06.581 --> 00:52:08.291
The safe app, it's there.

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:09.960
Okay!
Hey!

00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:11.336
Shh, be quiet.
Okay.

00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:13.255
I'll open the safe.

00:52:19.886 --> 00:52:21.805
Is that all, Director Hong?

00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:24.641
Let's sign the contract.

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:36.570
Okay.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.405
Should I burn it?

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.084
Okay.

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:52.169
Okay.

00:52:54.337 --> 00:55:01.084
"Executing."

00:55:11.021 --> 00:55:12.230
It's done.

00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:15.525
Hey, it worked out, right?

00:55:15.609 --> 00:55:16.985
Yes, I'm sure of it.

00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:18.195
Ah, thank you.
I'll extract the data first.

00:55:18.278 --> 00:55:19.571
I'll extract the data first.

00:55:19.654 --> 00:55:21.489
Extract it, extract all of it.

00:55:24.117 --> 00:55:25.327
This is all thanks to you guys.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.037
Ah, not at all.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.622
I'll gather the evidence

00:55:28.705 --> 00:55:30.749
from his phone and put this Kim Myung-gil bastard in jail,

00:55:30.832 --> 00:55:31.666
so don't worry.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:32.709
Yes.

00:55:42.385 --> 00:55:43.345
You worked hard.

00:55:44.012 --> 00:55:45.138
Brother Kang-yong will contact you.

00:55:45.222 --> 00:55:46.389
Yes, thank you, brother.

00:55:46.473 --> 00:55:47.474
Thank you.

00:55:47.557 --> 00:55:49.559
I've been thinking about this for a while, but, uh...

00:55:50.602 --> 00:55:52.103
The scar, the wound...

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:54.981
I want to help you with the treatment.

00:55:55.065 --> 00:55:55.899
Ah.

00:55:56.608 --> 00:55:58.318
Your offer is very kind, but

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.445
I'm fine.

00:56:01.112 --> 00:56:01.988
Are you really okay?

00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:03.073
Yes.

00:56:04.115 --> 00:56:05.659
Thanks to this scar,

00:56:05.742 --> 00:56:07.994
I was able to meet truly good people,

00:56:08.078 --> 00:56:09.871
and I gained the strength

00:56:09.955 --> 00:56:11.498
to not give up.

00:56:12.415 --> 00:56:13.250
So, I

00:56:14.751 --> 00:56:16.169
am okay with this scar.

00:56:17.003 --> 00:56:17.963
Alright, I understand.

00:56:19.214 --> 00:56:20.048
See you soon.

00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:21.758
Yes.
Yes.

00:56:22.717 --> 00:56:23.760
Please take good care of things.

00:56:23.843 --> 00:56:24.928
Yes.
I won't go far.

00:56:25.011 --> 00:56:26.179
Yes, thank you, brother.

00:56:26.263 --> 00:56:27.097
Go on in.

00:56:30.976 --> 00:56:32.852
I'm glad it ended well.
Me too.

00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:37.482
I knew it would go well.
Yeah.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.736
Oh, right, Geon-woo.
Huh?

00:56:42.237 --> 00:56:43.697
Do you remember when the boss

00:56:44.197 --> 00:56:46.574
asked Lim Jang-do about the gold bars back then?

00:56:47.575 --> 00:56:48.910
Yeah, that only someone named In-beom

00:56:48.994 --> 00:56:50.954
knew the location of those gold bars?

00:56:51.037 --> 00:56:51.871
Yeah.

00:56:51.955 --> 00:56:53.164
How much do you think it would be?

00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:55.750
I don't know.

00:56:56.876 --> 00:56:59.004
In my opinion, it'll be hundreds of billions.

00:57:00.964 --> 00:57:01.798
Ah.

00:57:03.383 --> 00:57:05.969
That money includes the money stolen from the boss, right?

00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:06.886
Yeah.

00:57:07.595 --> 00:57:09.889
If the police let Kim Myung-gil go in this situation,

00:57:10.974 --> 00:57:12.767
Kim Myung-gil will take that money and gold bars

00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.769
and flee overseas immediately.

00:57:16.062 --> 00:57:16.980
We can't let that happen.

00:57:17.647 --> 00:57:18.732
That money belongs to the boss.

00:57:19.607 --> 00:57:20.442
Let's prepare.

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:23.320
Let's chase him down and rip him to shreds.

00:57:24.154 --> 00:57:24.988
Deal.

00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:33.955
Drink until you drop dead tonight!

00:57:34.039 --> 00:57:35.123
Good!

00:57:35.206 --> 00:57:37.375
Beom-ah, Jun-min-ah, you worked hard!

00:57:38.376 --> 00:57:41.212
Hey, we're going for a second round! To my place!

00:57:43.798 --> 00:57:44.841
Why?

00:57:44.924 --> 00:57:46.843
Don't you smell something?

00:57:47.927 --> 00:57:49.012
Why, what's wrong?

00:57:49.095 --> 00:57:51.681
Yeah, I think I smell something burning.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.477
Hey, be quiet!

00:57:58.688 --> 01:00:00.273
Oh, no!

00:58:18.124 --> 00:58:20.335
Damn it!

00:58:21.169 --> 00:58:23.296
Hey!

00:58:27.842 --> 00:58:29.969
Go, go in.

00:56:58.456 --> 00:56:59.499
Where are you?

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:00.667
I'm working overtime.

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.753
I'll send a call to the driver now, so

00:57:04.462 --> 00:57:05.964
find someone for me.

00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:07.382
How many people?

00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:09.050
For now, one old man.

00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:10.427
Is it urgent?

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:12.554
If you find him by noon tomorrow,

00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:15.014
I'll pay you triple.

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:17.725
Yes.
