WEBVTT

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:20.770
Bro?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.397
Yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.314
Director Hong.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.025
Don't hang up the phone.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.193
Flip it over and put it on the table.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.611
So I can hear.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.447
You know what I mean, right?

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.749
I'll get straight to the point.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:43.918
Uh, why are you doing this?

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.926
Stop whining and stay still.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.095
Can you hear?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.431
This bastard just said, "Can you hear?" Hey!

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.932
Do you want to die?

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.145
You're making a huge mistake, you bastard!

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.189
Tell him to shut up.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.232
Bro.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.609
Be quiet.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.819
I'll make you rot in jail for life!

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.779
You son of a bitch!

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.949
Hey, you fucker, just shut up, you son of a bitch!

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.120
Idiot.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:22.832
You're calm now, right?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.669
Aren't you going to answer?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.005
What do you want?

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.425
A report should have come into Yeongmunpo Police Station today.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.303
A guy on a motorcycle in the apartment's underground parking lot...

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.347
...cut someone's throat with a knife and ran away.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.057
Write down the number.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.893
Seoul, Gangdong, A,

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.312
6438.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.356
It's a motorcycle license plate.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.399
It's fake, so you won't be able to look it up.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.527
Find out where this motorcycle guy went.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.571
Hey, to find something like this...

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.365
I know it's difficult and takes a long time.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.242
That's why I'm telling you to do it.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.453
It's 10 now. I'll give you five hours.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:01.663
If you can't find it...

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.833
Your sister's strip show...

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.251
...will be online.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:09.045
Even if you try any tricks, it'll be online.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.841
If you don't want to see Ail Group's stock price halve tomorrow morning...

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.175
...do it right.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.430
What?

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.516
735629.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.275
See you again.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.030
Goddamn it!

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.239
You're here?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.200
Uh, you, you, damn... Ah, loyalty! Loyalty!

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.117
Ugh, damn.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.161
I'll buy you soju. I'll buy you soju.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.086
This way. Yes, thank you.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.338
Hello.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.255
Yes.

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.926
Uh, if you boil the corpse for a few days...

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.011
...until all the bones soften...

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:42.430
...then grind it up and pour it into the sea, they say.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.557
To dispose of one body like that, it's 1.5 billion won.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.309
You won't even find a bone fragment.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:49.145
Boiling human gomtang, these sons of bitches!

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.730
Who told you that?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.982
Uh, I heard it when I visited Seungdeok.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.193
How does that bastard in jail know all that?

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.862
Jail is usually the fastest with this kind of information.

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:01.532
Hey, are you guys okay?

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.992
Yes, we're fine.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.536
You've gone through a lot seeing things you shouldn't have.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.123
Um, but...

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.626
Uh, what happens if the casino opens?

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.627
What do you mean, what happens?

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.588
Kim Myeong-gil will just rake in money.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:16.881
Ah, Geon-woo.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.341
Yes.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:22.428
People addicted to gambling and drugs use a lot of private loans.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.390
Kim Myeong-gil will connect casinos and private loans.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.268
The more people come to the casino...

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.478
...the more people will use private loans.

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:32.981
Money just walks in every day.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.984
But only foreigners can go to casinos, right?

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:38.820
Does Kim Myeong-gil follow the law?

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:39.737
Ah.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.573
He accepts anyone with money through the back door.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.158
You can't make money by following the law.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.036
If Kim Myeong-gil makes money...

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.289
...he'll take out loans to buy buildings.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.999
Then, using the building as collateral...

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.668
...he'll get more loans and buy bigger buildings.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.713
He's quite a character.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.089
To repay those loans...

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:00.258
...he'll run the casino even harder.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.177
Smile Capital will squeeze even more people.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.389
Kim Myeong-gil's kingdom will open.

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.695
The money Myeong-gil stole from me...

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.364
...was over 20 billion won back then.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.284
If we get that back...

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.412
...shall we all go on a world trip together, Geon-woo and Woo-jin?

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.082
We have enough money even now.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:35.918
But, well...

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.671
We can't go out because of the pandemic.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.674
Well...

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.635
Let's go to Rome.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.556
Why Rome?

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.557
When I was twenty...

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.893
...I watched a movie called "Roman Holiday."

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.729
Later, if I make a lot of money...

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.774
...I resolved to definitely go, but I still haven't gone.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.734
Uh, you three...

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.611
...all together...

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.863
...I'd like it if you went together.

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.827
I'll buy you everything you want.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.040
Grandpa, there are a lot of expensive things in Italy.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:15.541
It's a country of luxury brands.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:16.959
Hey, you kid.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.669
I'm Choi Tae-ho.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.672
I'll show you how I spend money.

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:24.342
Grandpa.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:26.803
That's called 'flexing'.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:28.888
Okay, well...

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.516
I can just show you how to flex.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.102
It's not 'showing', it's...

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.020
It's just 'flexing'.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:38.940
Flex.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.531
Okay, after we finish this...

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.282
...let's all go together.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.591
Yes, boss.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.136
Yes, sounds good.

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:10.179
Yes.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.392
Bro, the boss wants to have a simple drink at home.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.937
He must be in a good mood.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.815
Can you guys hold your liquor?

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.651
Yes!

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.373
Shall we watch a little faster?

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.834
There's 2x and 4x speed. Which one...

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.252
Let's watch at 2x. Yes.

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.053
If I were Kim Myeong-gil...

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:35.681
...I'd think Im Jang-do confessed all his weaknesses by now.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.434
He would have moved the hard drive to a safer place.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.354
Would that bastard have had the time?

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:44.899
We've tied up Kim Myeong-gil's arms and legs.

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.859
Except for that Team Leader Jung...

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.569
...there's no one else who can really move.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.154
And...

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.699
Kim Myeong-gil wouldn't entrust such data to just anyone.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:56.911
But he doesn't need to move it far.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.413
Even if he hides it in his car trunk, we won't find it.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.541
Hmm... Kim Myeong-gil knows.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:02.792
Ah... That's true.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.255
If we make Myeong-gil's enemies our allies...

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.798
...the tide will turn in our favor.

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:13.553
To do that, we need the hard drive.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.180
Inside, there are people Myeong-gil has leverage over.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.348
There will be several.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:20.643
Those people have the same motives as us.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.230
Among them, there will be powerful people...

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.399
...like Ail Group's eldest son.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:31.821
The longer this fight drags on, the more disadvantaged we become.

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:35.741
This bastard Myeong-gil must have spread his influence far.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.619
Police
