WEBVTT

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.242
[takes a small breath in, then exhales]

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.463
Ah, yes, sir.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.048
You need to wear a mask, a mask.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.257
Ah, yes, let's go.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.635
You need to wear a mask
to use the bus.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:34.594
Please go.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.679
Alright, alright, please go down,
put on a mask, and come back.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.473
Hey, stop telling me
to wear a mask or not!

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.891
We'll get penalized...

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.102
Why, my mask!
It's my choice!

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.229
Who are you to tell me what to do, huh, damn it!
No, no.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.190
Just drive properly
like a bus driver.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.484
That's why I'm telling you
to wear a mask and come back.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.737
I swear! Don't do this, no.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.781
Ugh, really. Let go! Hey, what is it?

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.574
Put it down, hey!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.785
Ah, damn it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.953
What is it?

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.371
What is it, you? I'm sorry.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.997
Uh, you'll have to walk.
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.707
Damn it! Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.335
Hey, damn it!

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.628
I'm sorry. Hey!

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.171
I'm sorry.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.549
Oh oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.467
You shouldn't get hurt, oh oh!

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.094
Ah, damn it!

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.848
Ah, damn it, I swear!

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.475
I'm sorry. Ah, this is annoying, damn it.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.770
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.021
Sorry, my foot.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:30.525
Ugh.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.986
Uh, I'm sorry, yes.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.779
Sir, please get in.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.578
I'm really sorry.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.789
Ah, I didn't know
it would drag on like this.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.086
I'm really sorry for saying this to you, mm.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.756
Your sister will definitely try
to figure something out next month.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.928
Uh, look, could you wait
just one more month?

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.972
Your sister will definitely pay you back.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.726
Uh, I'll try to do something next month.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.561
Okay, thanks.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.026
Amidst the ongoing economic recession
due to COVID-19,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.903
a building whose construction has been halted

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.072
is threatening the safety of citizens.

00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:42.740
This building behind me

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.659
has had its construction halted twice

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.786
due to a confirmed COVID-19 case
among its workers.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.580
Ultimately, as the domestic construction company
went bankrupt,

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.292
it has been left as an eyesore
in the city center for four months.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.335
The city of Seoul's swift action
seems necessary.

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.179
Just the hotel employees laid off
in the US during the third quarter

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.681
exceed 3.5 million.

00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.017
Any foreign company looking to acquire
this hotel right now

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.228
I'm telling you, there won't be any
for at least the next three to four years.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.439
And certainly no domestic companies.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.857
You speak as if it's a fact?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.484
I have several friends who lead
Korea's top 50 companies.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.652
I have several friends.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.739
Since this is a conclusion I reached
after long discussions with my friends,

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.240
it's somewhat of a fact.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.200
No.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.536
It's just a fact, really.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.581
Negotiating with me is the right thing to do,
Vice President.

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:32.915
Director Hong.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:37.295
Our bank lent 400 billion won to this building.

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:40.131
Offering to repay only 300 billion won
isn't negotiating.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.841
In this situation, shouldn't some loss

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.176
be accepted?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.053
Otherwise, how can you do business?

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:48.723
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a banker.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.391
Ah, Director, uh...

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.392
Ah, Vice President, uh...

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.811
The reason I painstakingly
brought you two here is...

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.230
Yes, yes. For the safety of Seoul citizens,

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.107
the Mayor's earnest wish is
for the building

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.400
to be completed quickly.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.361
Ah, what can we do if it doesn't make sense!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.697
Are you saying what I'm saying
doesn't make sense, Vice President?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.699
What do you think makes sense?

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.293
I apologize, I'm a bit late.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.756
This is CEO Kim Myung-gil,
whom I mentioned before dinner.

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:23.257
Please introduce yourselves.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:26.928
Assemblyman Seo Woo-hyun,
who is close with the Mayor,

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.179
is the one who introduced him.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.598
Kim Myung-gil.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.814
I will contact you separately later.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:39.273
Yes.

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:44.946
Kim Myung-gil.

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.126
Excuse me, but what do you do
for a living?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.878
I do a lot of investment work,

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.172
and if good people call on me,
I go and

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.258
help them as much as I can.

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.552
Wait, are you a loan shark?

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.223
No, did you call a usurer?

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.476
The CEO does various things.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.020
This isn't a place for a usurer,
is it?

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:23.109
You are Chairman Hong Woo-geun's
eldest son, aren't you?

00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:27.447
When I was young, I served a man
named Chairman Bang in Myeong-dong.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.658
You were a baby then,
so you wouldn't remember, but

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.785
when the IMF crisis hit our country,

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.872
Ail Group, with 50 years of history,
almost went bankrupt

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.457
because it lacked a mere 6 billion won.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.168
At that time, Chairman Hong Woo-geun

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.463
came to our Chairman and asked for help.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.923
He knelt, saying he had to save the company,
no matter what,

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.133
he knelt down.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.218
And our Chairman was moved

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.762
by his passion and sincerity.

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:57.852
I went to his house with a bag full
of 6 billion won in cash.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.688
I remember his mother thanked me

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.733
and peeled a cool Korean melon for me.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.070
There is no bad money in the world.
It can be used for bad purposes.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.740
If it's used for good, it's good money.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.202
I came with the intention of being helpful.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:20.458
Now, where were we in the conversation?

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.377
There was a difference in the amount
you two had in mind,

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.837
so we were discussing it.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.215
Ah, how big is the difference?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.466
100 billion won.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.009
Well...

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.263
Will the Director personally

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.599
manage the hotel?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.519
I completed my Master's in Hotel Management
in Switzerland

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.437
and worked in Hong Kong for 4 years.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.648
Ah, you've prepared a lot.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.444
Would it be alright if I invested a bit?

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:51.239
How much?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.323
Well,

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.075
since you're short 100 billion,

00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:55.785
it has to be 100 billion.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.124
If needed, I'll invest more.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.167
And the conditions?

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.920
Just three.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.840
First, on the top floor of the hotel,

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.176
please build a small casino.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.804
Just as managing a hotel is your dream, Director,

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:17.848
opening a casino is my dream.

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:21.769
Ah, second, please help me open
a small bar in the hotel's basement.

00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.563
Please help me open one.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.314
Ah, and finally,

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.358
if something like COVID-19
spreads again in the future,

00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:28.651
please make sure our hotel

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.820
is opened as a free quarantine space

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.281
for those who don't have money.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.494
I hope we can care for each other
more during difficult times.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.412
Only then

00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:41.747
can we have a better world.

00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:47.712
I am ready to invest

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.506
100 billion won as early as tomorrow.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.524
Did I do well?

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:09.900
Yeah.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:11.819
Will they take the bait?

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.529
Yeah.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.740
Awesome!

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:17.283
Oh, yeah!

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:20.286
Then all I have to worry about now
is the shop's interior design.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.913
Sis, people don't go to bars
for the interior design.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.540
They go to see pretty girls.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.459
Diligently scout some pretty girls.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.128
You do it diligently, you bastard.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.713
Someone as pretty as my sister,

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.214
how great would it be
if she spoke as prettily?

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.884
What do you know, you idiot bastard!

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.013
Let me wipe your face.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.431
Ah!

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:44.226
Here.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:00.785
Let's go.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.290
What about Seong-eun Building?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.002
Among the tenants' families,
there was no one connected
to the police or prosecution.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.379
You even checked the in-laws, right?

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:14.340
Ah, CEO, I really only missed one time then.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.217
Their lover could be a cop.

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:18.552
You better do things right
so your brother doesn't worry.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.930
Oh, sis, you better do things right yourself.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.098
Jang-do?

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:25.601
You should speak more politely
to your sister-in-law, shouldn't you?

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.604
Yes, I'm sorry! CEO.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.606
Apologize to me, you idiot bastard!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.734
This idiot apologizes, sister.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.487
Ah, let's go quickly, I'm craving a drink.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.697
Yes!

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.536
Yes, we are with you for the 2020 KBFC
National Rookie Tournament.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:46.122
Yes, originally, the Rookie Tournament
should be filled with the cheers and love

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.290
of many spectators,
and held with their support,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.251
but due to the COVID-19 situation,

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.378
it's being held without an audience,
so the atmosphere feels a bit lonely.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.755
That's right. The Rookie Tournament is a match
that receives the support of many people,

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.465
It's a match that receives a lot of cheers,

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.883
but it's so quiet right now.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.009
As I speak,

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.303
Hong Woo-jin's Round 3 match has begun.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.972
Alright, this is a middleweight match.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.598
Hong Woo-jin in the red trunks

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.684
vs. Jung Jae-hoon in the blue trunks.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.768
Go deeper.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.562
Ah, good body shots on both sides.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.188
That's right. Hong Woo-jin leaning on the ropes.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.733
Ah, he hits both sides of the body
and, ah, provokes him.

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.277
Ah, indeed. He's still showing composure.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.987
'Hit me if you can,' yes.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.321
'You are enough...'

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.239
Ah, body shot!

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.157
That's it!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.450
A clean body attack landed.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.993
Alright, to the face, it landed!

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.537
He knocks him down! Hong Woo-jin, that's it!

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.039
One-two straight from a right double.

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.332
His footwork is also very...

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.042
His showmanship is amazing.

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:33.753
Ah, it's a KO.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.463
Yes, the next match is Kim Gun-woo vs.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.465
Kim Rae-hyun.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.550
Super rookie Kim Gun-woo in the blue trunks.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.511
That's right. Kim Gun-woo, while covering...

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.512
Body shot!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.556
Body! He kneels!

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.142
That's right. It landed precisely
on the solar plexus...

00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.186
Ah, the match is over. That's right.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.729
That one punch ended the match.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:54.440
Kim Gun-woo continues to finish
opponents with one blow.

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:56.150
He is a perfect fighter.

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.068
That's right. A terrifying rookie has appeared.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.446
As soon as he entered,

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.989
he's being pushed back.
He's being pushed back.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.827
Alright, he grabs him and, ah, throws him.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.245
He just throws his opponent.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:09.872
That's a foul, isn't it? Is it a warning?

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.791
That's right. Ah, first, to me...

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.375
He's too excited right now. Yes.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.877
Box! Let's go!

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.297
Alright, the parting, ah, indeed,
when it comes to showmanship, it's Hong Woo-jin.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.216
It's Hong Woo-jin. He provokes his opponent.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.884
That's it! He dodges.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.677
Oh, he dodges well.

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.807
Again, he goes for the face! Knockdown!

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.392
It's Hong Woo-jin's specialty. Yes.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.019
Straight from a double jab!

00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.979
Three! Ah, the Marines.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.398
Hong Woo-jin surges forward once again.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.860
Yes, the match between Kim Gun-woo
and Lee Yong-gyu.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.365
Ah, Kim Gun-woo in the red trunks,
a solid physique.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:45.783
That's right. He dodges well.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:48.452
Kim Gun-woo is also an infighter.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.288
Kim Gun-woo possesses a powerful infighting style.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:53.541
Another punch! Ah, he's dodging.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.167
Body shot, good!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.877
He grabs it the same way. One, two.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.170
That's right. It's a left punch.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:13:59.088
Three, four.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.005
When I was a player,

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.382
I had that kind of skill.

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:03.551
Are you okay? Yes, he hit very well.

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.760
That's why he won a gold medal.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.053
That's right. Yes.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.098
Alright, Kim Gun-woo and Hong Woo-jin. Yes.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:11.267
Alright, let's see who will take home the trophy.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.726
Don't try to throw big punches,

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.937
short, short, with your waist, snap!
Watch out for the left hook.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.856
His punches are no joke.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.240
Hyung, I'm a Marine.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.492
I said watch out for the left hook.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.911
I'm an invincible Marine, invincible!

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.081
If you get hit and cry, I'll kill you.

00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:40.254
Fighting! Fighting!

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.801
Alright, fight well. Go to your corners.

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.891
He has come up very impressively so far.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:54.476
And the terrifying super rookie
Kim Gun-woo

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.270
has a quite different style. That's right.

00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:57.813
Attacking an infighter... Let's go!

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.440
Kim Gun-woo possesses an infighting style.

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.567
Yes. In contrast,

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.194
uh, Hong Woo-jin, while outboxing, also

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.113
is a fighter who lands good counters.

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.031
That's right.

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.116
Hong Woo-jin, who plays with the match playfully, and...

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.034
That's right.

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.785
He's very solid,

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.037
following the textbook exactly...

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.831
Alright, he's going in, he's pushing,
he's pushing, he's pushing!

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.541
Can Hong Woo-jin escape?

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.500
Can he escape?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.960
Ah, he escaped well.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:23.047
That's right, and Hong Woo-jin
is also very fast.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.131
That's right.

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:26.425
Uh, Kim Gun-woo is also a middleweight, so...

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.594
Alright, miss! Hey, he swings wide.

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:31.055
That's right, he guarded, and a body shot.

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:33.015
Kim Gun-woo has very good covering...

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:35.351
Yes, just like...

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.770
Ah, continuously after guarding...

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:38.687
Uppercut!

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.481
That's right, he got caught once.

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.191
Ah, that's right.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.484
He's showing a terrifying display.

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.693
Right! Ah, he dodged well.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.862
This time, Hong Woo-jin is fighting well.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:50.074
Ah, Hong Woo-jin, Hong Woo-jin,
Hong Woo-jin keeps applying pressure.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.201
Another left body shot!

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:53.827
Ah, left. Ah, is he recovering?

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.996
Hong Woo-jin collapses. Ah, he falls down.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.665
It's a knockdown! One, two.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.375
Yes, really, the stomach... three, four...

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.085
The impact doesn't come immediately,

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:03.712
it takes about 5 seconds
to feel it then, right?

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.880
Woo-jin-ah!

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.716
Six, seven, eight. He got up in 5 seconds.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.803
That's right, he endured well...
Ah, he endured well, yes.

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.930
Ah, but the impact will be severe.

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.306
Ah, there are after-effects.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.307
That's right. Yes.

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.060
Come on in.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:22.606
Come on in!

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.008
Come on in.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.052
Hey, come on in.

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.472
You bastard.

00:16:57.891 --> 00:16:59.893
Come on in, uh!

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:03.105
Alright, will he take the bait?

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.523
Kim Gun-woo, wow!

00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:06.567
He's having a lot of trouble,
alright, he goes in!

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.735
Did it land?

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:11.155
Stop! One, two.

00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:12.698
The impact was continuous... three, four...

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.615
That's where it was.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.409
Ah, he fell victim to his own provocation.

00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:16.660
KO. That's right.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.412
Alright, Kim Gun-woo goes straight in

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:21.040
and with the same body shot once again,
hey, Woo-jin-ah! Hey, hey.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:24.168
He finished the match.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:29.590
Are you okay?

00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:32.843
I've tarnished the honor of the Marines.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.512
Everyone collapses when hit in the liver.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.639
I'm leaving.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.475
Food?

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.810
It's COVID.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:45.564
No, the kid struggled,
shouldn't we at least feed him?

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:02.915
Go home and order food.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:06.960
Bye.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.853
What? Why? What?

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:26.855
Want to eat?

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.274
Why would I eat with you?

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.277
I'm going to eat samgyeopsal,
so I thought maybe we could eat together.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.573
Are you pitying me?

00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:37.991
No.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:40.202
Go ask those other bastards
you KO'd to eat.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.912
They all went home.

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:44.248
Ah, damn.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.387
Isn't the prize money 10 million won?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.304
Yeah.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:03.392
Then why eat samgyeopsal?
Let's eat premium sirloin.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.102
I'm only going to spend 50,000 won.

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:06.145
Why?

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.563
I have to give the rest to my mom.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.107
Do you owe your mom money? No.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.066
Then why?

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.402
I have to pay my mom's shop rent.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.195
Such a filial son.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.614
Just spend 10,000 won more.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:20.242
The meat buffet I know is
29,000 won per person.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.743
The quality is awesome, they even
have Hanwoo (Korean beef).

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.911
Really? Where?

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.079
Just kidding, you idiot.

00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:27.666
How can they serve Hanwoo
for 29,000 won?

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:30.127
Have you, like, only
exercised your whole life?

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.881
Anyway, that buffet is good.
Just spend 10,000 won more.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:34.798
Mmm.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:38.135
Hey!

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:48.896
Let's go.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:51.815
Why is your left hook so strong?

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.067
When I worked part-time at a junkyard,

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:56.028
I practiced hitting tires with hooks.

00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:57.279
Only left?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.781
Why only left?

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.867
No, I'm asking if you only hit with your left.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.785
Oh, of course, I hit with both.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.537
But why is your left hand so strong?

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:07.456
My right hand is stronger.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.874
Then why did you only use your left hand?

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.293
There was no timing to use my right hand.

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:13.545
You're annoying.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:15.422
Why me?

00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:17.674
You're saying you could handle
everyone with just your left hand.

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.468
Today, yes.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.386
See, you're annoying.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.388
No, I'm lucky.

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:24.306
Just flip the meat.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.308
No, it needs 30 more seconds.

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.143
You can flip it now. No.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.355
Ah, this bastard, so stubborn, this.

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:33.398
Ugh, damn, you've done so many part-time jobs?

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:37.069
Are you poor? Yeah, my family went broke.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.405
Why?

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.327
My father was a researcher at a large corporation,

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.871
but he sued for wrongful dismissal
and lost after 4 years.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:51.250
All the legal fees from then became debt,

00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:54.753
you can't beat big corporations.
Those with money always win.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:56.046
Right?

00:20:58.674 --> 00:20:59.591
What other part-time jobs did you do?

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.551
Ah, I've done a lot of this and that, but

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.553
my mom and I did delivery jobs the most.

00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:06.265
He must have come
from a part-time job training camp.

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.980
There's nothing you can't do,
you've lived well.

00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:15.107
He's grilling the meat
with his right hand, actually.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:17.567
When did you start boxing?

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.195
Ah, me, about 3 years ago?

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.321
When was that?

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:22.281
After I got back from the military.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:23.282
Ah...

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.243
I've been wearing gloves
since 6th grade of elementary school.

00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:27.995
My father was a national representative.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.621
Wow, amazing.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.540
By any chance, your father's name?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.501
Hong Seong-geun,
Barcelona bronze medalist.

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:36.169
Ah... Do you know him? No.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:37.379
No.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.048
Most boxers know him.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.134
Ah, sorry.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.429
Ah, so you learned boxing
from your father?

00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:47.264
I'm not close with my father.

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:48.932
Why?

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.601
My father is never satisfied
with anything I do.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:54.354
Well, he won a bronze medal at my age, so.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.565
Everyone judges me by their own standards.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:59.067
Mm.

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.652
Ah, then,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.948
your father, uh, won a bronze medal
at 25, right?

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.617
No, 27.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.247
How old are you?

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.624
27.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.668
Uh, I'm sorry, Hyung.

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.879
I'm 25. I'm really sorry.

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:20.756
Ah, this bastard, damn it.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:21.673
Ah, I'm sorry.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:22.799
Hey. Yes?

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.593
From now on, you better straighten up,
understand?

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.886
Yes. Understand?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.304
Yes.

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:28.889
Flip it!

00:22:28.972 --> 00:23:00.692
No, it needs one more minute.

00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:02.297
Pil-Seung! I'm 1216th batch!

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.840
What are you doing? Sit, Hyung, sit.

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:05.550
I will sit if you accept my salute.

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.885
Ah, uh, mm.

00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:11.973
Ah, Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.767
Huh? Where did you serve?

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.227
1st Division.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.229
Uh, me too! Which battalion were you in?

00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.732
Reconnaissance. Amazing!

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.818
Ah, I wanted to join Reconnaissance too,

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:24.361
but I failed.

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:27.072
Yeah. The flower of the Marines, Reconnaissance!

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:29.324
Reconnaissance! Bam!

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.453
I'll just call you Hyung,
so let's be comfortable, okay?

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.205
Yes, understood.

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:36.998
Let's be comfortable.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.542
I will be comfortable!

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:39.584
Hyung.

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:40.961
Hmm?

00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:41.878
Here.

00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:49.219
Hey, Hyung is damn proud of the Marines.

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.137
Why?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.722
I used to be a bit of a delinquent in Incheon.

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:53.765
But I joined the Marines and

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.725
met really good people, and now,

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:56.935
I straightened up.

00:23:57.018 --> 00:24:00.230
I loved training hard together,
struggling, overcoming it,

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:02.774
that kind of thing was so good.
Looks delicious.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.360
Like waking up in the morning,
going for a run, sweating,

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.987
like showering together and like, *sigh*...

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.697
Hyung. Washing each other, like, huh?

00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:11.283
You're not misunderstood, are you?

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.451
No, I'm not.

00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:13.702
Try this.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:17.247
How is it? How is it?

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:21.126
It's steak, steak.

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:23.086
Really?

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.754
Hey, I'll show you one too.

00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.215
Three pieces, huh? Ah, yeah.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.259
Ssamjang too, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:29.342 --> 00:24:30.677
Shall we try kimchi too, huh?

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:34.973
Ah ah ah.

00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:37.017
Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir. Yes?

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.518
Ack! Ah!

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.523
Awesome, right? Awesome, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.983
Shall we have some soju? N-no.

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.943
Why? Because of your body? Yeah.

00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:49.237
Ah, this perfectionist bastard, so annoying.

00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:52.616
Auntie! Here!

00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:55.744
One Tesla!

00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:59.080
Uh, Hyung, how much are these shoes?

00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.124
1.2 million won. Really?

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.044
Why so expensive? That's my family's shop rent.

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.795
Hey, why are you so easily fooled?

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.297
Of course, it's fake.

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.133
It looks real though.

00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.802
This, fake ones have a smooth toe.

00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:15.680
The real ones are suede,
and the hole finishes are a bit rough.

00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:19.434
If you want to buy them, tell me.
I'll find you something better than the authentic ones.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:21.853
Really? Really?
What do you mean 'really' again? Really.

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:25.106
Hey, in this world, huh?
There's nothing better than authentic.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.693
You, let's learn about the world
while hanging out with Hyung.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.779
You seem to have only
worked part-time jobs.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.700
Hyung, do you know this?
There are so many things like this these days.

00:37:10.536 --> 00:37:12.454
'Korea Antique Art Market'

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.670
I found Yang Jae-myung,
and he bitched about not having money, so

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:37.588
I took this.

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.928
This is over 20 million won, though?

00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.054
So?

00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:48.057
The money Yang Jae-myung borrowed was 10 million won.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.101
You earned interest.

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.191
Wait, are you hurt?

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.735
Ah, damn it, while fighting with Yang Jae-myung...

00:38:00.736 --> 00:38:03.322
Ah, but speaking of which,

00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:04.448
let's talk a bit.

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:05.783
Eat the tteok, eat the tteok.

00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:09.203
I said let's talk, why suddenly tteok?

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:12.999
How long are you going to do this?

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:15.251
What?

00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:19.213
Lending money without interest.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.965
Ah, there's no profit for you.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.633
Why is there no profit?

00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:25.845
I consistently give you 30% as commission.

00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:28.097
Ah, not me, but you, Grandpa.

00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:33.644
You know Mi-yeon's mother, right?

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:35.771
So?

00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:39.358
She came earlier and paid back
the entire principal in cash.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.486
Is that the interest?

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.531
Hyun-ju-ya.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.909
A sick child received surgery on time
and got healthy.

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.661
Because I lent them money,

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:53.664
the child's parents didn't have to borrow money
with their house as collateral.

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:57.168
So the child has a home
to return to after being discharged.

00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:00.463
We saved a family.

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:04.633
This is the most valuable interest in the world.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.014
Oh dear, anyway,

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:12.016
I heard this while looking for Yang Jae-myung:

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:14.352
Yang Jae-myung and his gang

00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:16.520
are going around cosplaying
as homeless people,

00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:19.357
stealing real homeless people's IDs,
and taking out loans.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.067
What kind of guys were they?

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.277
They were guys who were in prison
with Yang Jae-myung,

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.403
they're said to be pretty bad.

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:26.447
No, you knew that and still went alone?

00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:28.991
Shall I go with Grandpa next time?

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.493
Ah, anyway.

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.078
I'll dig a little deeper.

00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:34.080
I think there might be something interesting.

00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:35.998
Uh, don't touch anything dangerous.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.541
Yes.

00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:52.681
"CEO Moon Gwang-mu"

00:39:52.765 --> 00:39:53.599
Yes.

00:39:53.682 --> 00:39:56.060
Uh, is it a good time to talk?

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.770
Yes, please say anything, CEO.

00:39:57.853 --> 00:40:00.856
Uh, I need to ask a favor. Find someone.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.857
Yes, just a moment.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:04.819
Please speak.

00:40:05.986 --> 00:40:06.904
'A good person'

00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.657
'Good at security'

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.411
'And good if they know daily loans'

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.748
Uh, yes, CEO, uh...

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.835
I will quickly select some good candidates.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.753
Alright, I'll count on you.

00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:23.754
Yes, loyalty.

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.256
Pil-Seung!

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:29.051
Mayweather is definitely the best, the best.

00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:32.471
But Mayweather seems more like a businessman
than a fighter.

00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:34.807
Right, that guy is just trying to make money.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.434
But he's a genius at it.

00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.727
Ah, he must have really earned
hundreds of billions.

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:40.771
Is money important to you, Hyung?

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.357
What's more important than money?

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:45.192
A boxer's heart.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.196
Why?

00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:54.076
Ah, why?

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:57.997
Ah, why? No, no.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.540
Ah, hey.

00:41:00.082 --> 00:41:01.375
Ah, you suddenly

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:04.462
got so serious, I think I was a bit flustered.

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.922
Ah, explain more. A boxer's heart.

00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:08.340
Hmm...

00:41:09.508 --> 00:41:11.927
I think Manny Pacquiao is the best, Hyung.

00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:12.845
Pow! Pow!

00:41:13.512 --> 00:41:15.306
Pow! Pow! Pacquiao, Pow! Pow!

00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:16.765
Ah, Hyung, just be still for a moment.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:18.642
I don't interrupt when you talk.

00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:20.644
I'm sorry, Marine, sir.

00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:22.646
I will absolutely not interrupt.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.983
I think Pacquiao's heart is so cool.

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:26.942
He doesn't know how to give up.

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:27.943
I acknowledge Pacquiao, Hyung.

00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:30.321
Still, Mayweather earned much more money.

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.281
But watching Pacquiao,

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:34.658
there are probably far more kids
who started dreaming of being a boxer, right?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:37.077
I was like that too.

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.539
Hyung, I want to be that kind of person.

00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:43.667
Someone who shows that if you have
strong will and unyielding passion,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.212
dreams can come true.

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:47.796
It's really windy.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.007
That's a true boxer's heart, and

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.259
No, watching a boxing match,

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.470
that's the feeling people should get,
I'm telling you.

00:41:54.553 --> 00:41:56.138
A boxer's he... Hey, it's all cooked.

00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:57.181
Let's eat.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.184
Hey.

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:07.399
Is it good? Yeah, it's good.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:10.819
Hyung, how do you make money?

00:42:10.903 --> 00:42:12.363
Originally,

00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:13.697
at an acquaintance's sister's kindergarten,

00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.366
I taught the little kids how to exercise.

00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:16.534
I was a gym teacher, you could say.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.536
Ah, it doesn't suit you.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:22.414
What are you talking about?
Kids f***ing love me.

00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:24.959
Anyway, I did that in the morning
and worked out in the afternoon, but

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.920
now, well, the kindergarten itself
is closed, so it's a bit awkward.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.633
Hyung, do you want to try delivery work with me?

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.176
Delivery work is no joke these days.

00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:36.637
Does it pay? Of course.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.305
If you and I put our minds to it, probably

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.766
we could each earn 200,000 won a day,
you know?

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:41.725
Really?

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:43.727
Yeah, doing delivery is good cardio.

00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.938
Plus, you use muscles you don't use in boxing,
so

00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:47.147
your balance gets really good too.

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:49.441
Ah, damn, two birds with one stone swag.

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:51.569
No, it's three birds with one stone. Why?

00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:54.572
You earn money, get cardio,
improve your balance.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:57.157
Hey, cardio and balance are one.

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.993
No, they're different.

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.911
Ugh, damn, tsk.

00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:04.373
Hey, whatever, you won the rookie tournament
this time,

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.709
weren't you supposed to go to the Super Series
as Korea's representative?

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:07.793
Yeah.

00:43:07.876 --> 00:43:10.212
But, uh, it's been indefinitely
postponed due to COVID.

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:14.592
When will that be?

00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:16.635
Can't be helped, I guess.

00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:23.142
Still, I'll always be ready
to fight anytime.

00:43:26.186 --> 00:43:27.062
You,

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:29.773
you have a boxer's heart.

00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:38.407
Hyung?

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.366
Come on in, Pacquiao.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.951
Now?

00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:42.411
Come on in!

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.168
Uh, ah...

00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.711
Ah, who actually hits for real?

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:51.962
Ah, Hyung, Pil-Seung, I'm sorry.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:54.715
Hey, come here, let go.

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:57.885
Wait, come here!

00:43:57.968 --> 00:44:00.054
Come here! Hey, Kim Gun-woo!

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.224
Alright, let's have a drink!

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:07.603
Let's go! Drink! Yeah! Yeah!

00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:10.939
Alright, tonight's main event!
The greatest show on earth!

00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:13.275
Watermelon smashing with In-beom!

00:44:15.027 --> 00:44:17.112
Alright, place your bets, come on!

00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.489
100 on "can't break it"!

00:44:20.115 --> 00:44:22.368
I'll bet 300 on "will break it"!

00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:27.122
If I win this today, I'm treating all of you!

00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.249
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Beom-ah.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.669
I know you'll break it, but I'll bet
400 on "can't break it."

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.340
Kang In-beom! Kang In-beom!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:39.134
Kang In-beom! Kang In-beom!

00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.178
Let's go! Kang In-beom! Kang In-beom!

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:43.972
He broke it!

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.768
Go buy tteokbokki!

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.645
Let's eat tteokbokki!

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:51.814
Awesome!

00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:53.565
Oppa, I did well, didn't I?

00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:56.068
Yeah, you did well.

00:44:56.902 --> 00:44:58.570
Shhh, quiet, quiet!

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:06.120
Yes, Mayor.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.415
Yes.

00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:13.627
Yes.

00:45:18.173 --> 00:45:20.092
Yes.

00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:21.385
Yes, understood.

00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:22.761
I will relay that.

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:25.055
Have a good night.

00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.770
Our Mayor is willing to promote
the casino attraction.

00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:34.690
He said he'd push for it.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.618
For your birthday today, Director,

00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:49.288
I've prepared a small gift.

00:45:53.709 --> 00:45:55.377
Please open it.

00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:03.594
It's 1,000 don.

00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:05.637
Director?

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:09.683
These turtles are very clean,
no one will know even if you eat them.

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:12.269
I hope our relationship

00:46:12.352 --> 00:46:15.272
lasts a long, long time,
so I prepared this for that,

00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:18.692
I'd appreciate it if you would accept it.

00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:29.870
You're not just going to stay
at City Hall, are you?

00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:33.415
I know you have big dreams.

00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:35.459
In the future, you'll go to the Blue House,

00:46:35.542 --> 00:46:38.170
and if you want to go to the National Assembly,
you'll need money.

00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:40.881
Let's go all the way together.

00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:43.759
I will definitely support you.

00:46:45.427 --> 00:46:48.889
My money has never failed, not once.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.564
Hmm.

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:05.864
Hey! Ugh, ugh.

00:47:06.365 --> 00:47:08.283
Hey, where are you going?

00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:09.451
Ugh, please ride carefully.

00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:11.036
I'll take you home.

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.913
Let's go, uh.

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.295
When will you clear out
Assemblyman Seo's building?

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:22.965
There's a slight difference
for each shop, but

00:47:23.465 --> 00:47:25.676
by this Friday, everyone's interest
will have accumulated to over 20 million.

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:26.593
Mm.

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.262
The smaller places,
if we hit them hard, they'll probably leave.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.139
Every day when they go to work,

00:47:31.223 --> 00:47:34.351
if they see a completely destroyed shop
on the first floor right before their eyes,

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:36.562
people will give up faster, you know?

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.606
I will do that, CEO.

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.485
Uh, Team Leader Jung isn't feeling well
and can't move for a while, so

00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:46.446
call and tell them to send a dozen
good-looking guys, and

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.489
Beom will handle it.

00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:49.491
Should we bring equipment?

00:47:50.117 --> 00:47:50.993
No need.

00:47:51.076 --> 00:47:54.162
Tell them to wear suits and masks,

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:56.415
CEO, I think five people would be enough.

00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:59.459
The CEO must have a plan.

00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:03.255
Ah, indeed.

00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:05.591
I really made a big mistake.

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.469
Look, these bastards are at it again.

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:12.055
Hey, hey. So?

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:13.891
Where should we hit first?

00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:52.054
Huh?

00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:54.848
Huh? Ah, hello.

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:57.184
Why didn't you keep your promise?

00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:59.645
Yes?

00:48:59.728 --> 00:49:01.521
Instead of lowering the interest rate,

00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:04.608
you agreed to pay an extension fee,
didn't you?

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:06.360
Yes?

00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:09.780
As a loan extension fee,

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:12.658
you stamped to pay 10% of the principal

00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:14.785
within 24 hours.

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:16.787
It's written in the contract.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.164
Because you didn't do that simple thing, now

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.084
the interest on the extension fee
has accumulated to 40 million.

00:49:22.584 --> 00:49:26.129
Your credit rating dropped,
and the interest rate also went up to 20%!

00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:29.257
We

00:49:29.341 --> 00:49:31.802
really started this with good intentions, but...

00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:35.514
You ruined everything, sir! Damn it!

00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:39.101
What are you going to do now?

00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.520
Do you have money to cover the fees?

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:46.650
I'm going to call the police.

00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:48.402
Police?

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.154
Yes.

00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:04.835
Oh, my goodness...

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:13.885
Uh, Mom? Uh, where are you?

00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:15.303
I'm almost there.

00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:17.389
Uh, Mom, I'm at the shop here,

00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:19.558
uh, strange people came and...

00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:21.435
Strange people? Who?

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:22.602
Right now, here...

00:50:24.771 --> 00:50:26.189
Mom? Mom, Mom!

00:50:42.497 --> 00:50:44.124
Alright, smash it all!

00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:01.183
Who are you, you bastard!

00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:04.019
What is it, you bastard? I swear,
damn it, leave, you bastard, damn it!

00:51:04.102 --> 00:51:07.272
Hey! Get out, you bastard!

00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:11.359
Ah, this bastard, hey! Hey, you...

00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:15.322
What is that? Hey, catch him!
This bastard! Damn!

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.615
What is it? What kind of bastard is this?

00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:18.784
Hey! You bastard!

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.501
Block him, that son of a bitch.

00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:29.169
That bastard!

00:51:29.669 --> 00:51:31.296
Hey, damn it! F***!

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.840
Hey, come here! Hey! Damn!

00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:46.436
Hey, you bastard!

00:51:53.568 --> 00:51:54.694
You bastard!

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.711
Hey, you f***er!

00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:26.226
Uh, Mom, are you okay?

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.519
Uh huh.

00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:28.728
Are you hurt?

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.981
I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:10.437
Who are you?

00:53:11.396 --> 00:53:14.691
Who are you to... our shop...

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:17.903
What are you?

00:53:47.098 --> 00:53:48.183
Student, calm down.

00:53:59.527 --> 00:54:00.695
Uh, your mother borrowed money
from our company.

00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:01.863
Mm.

00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:03.907
What do you want?

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:05.326
Pay back the money.

00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:07.453
First, pay for our shop.

00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:21.609
Beom-ah.

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:51.848
Mom, it's okay.

00:55:51.932 --> 00:55:53.433
Just go over there for a moment.

00:55:53.517 --> 00:55:54.434
Gun-woo-ya.

00:56:10.241 --> 00:56:11.076
Gun-woo-ya! No!

00:56:35.016 --> 00:56:35.934
Beom-ah.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:38.978
I,

00:56:40.855 --> 00:56:42.357
I like people with grit.
Ah, damn it. Guys with grit

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.442
they accomplish anything.

00:56:47.695 --> 00:56:48.863
Do you want to work for me?

00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:50.490
I...

00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:57.038
[Gun-woo gasps for air and coughs repeatedly]
