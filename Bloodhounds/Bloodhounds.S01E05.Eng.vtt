WEBVTT

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.055
Ugh, damn it!

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:16.933
Run!

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.313
Run, fast!

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.357
Ah, ah!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.755
Damn it! Hey! Damn!

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.010
You bastard!

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.428
Drop the bag!

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.972
Damn it!
Ugh!

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.807
Hey, you!

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:00.852
Start the engine!

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.730
Hurry, Hyun-ju!

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.565
Hurry! Run fast!

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.235
Hurry, hurry!

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.195
Hurry!

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.198
Start the engine!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.202
Those bastards!
Run faster!

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.453
Hurry!

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.498
Get in!
Get in, get in, get in, hurry!

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.083
Hurry! Bro, the door, the door, the door!

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.793
The door, the door, the door!

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.263
Damn it!

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.626
It seems like there are more people

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.254
than I thought using Kim Myeong-gil's money.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:13.091
People entered and exited the bar
every hour.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.718
There were people in police cars,

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.304
and I don't know his name,

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.474
but there was a pro baseball player
I saw on TV.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.519
Yeah, well,

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.813
he must have spread his network widely by now.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.356
Mm.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.960
I knew Myeong-gil
was an ex-convict.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.504
He begged me sincerely,

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.590
saying he wanted to start a new life
working under me.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.759
I was fooled.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.805
I was tricked.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.101
After Myeong-gil double-crossed me,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.438
when Driver Oh and I
hid in Namhae,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.816
I heard rumors that Myeong-gil
was starting a company

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.069
with my money and bonds.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.782
I should have
dealt with him myself.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.785
Because I was the one who taught him.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.375
Dealing with him...

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.171
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.925
At that time,
you said you'd take care of Myeong-gil,

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.927
and I stopped you.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.304
I'm sorry.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.475
I was scared of losing you too.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.359
You always cherished and protected me

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.321
like family, boss.

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.574
I'm always ready

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.120
to lay down my life for you, boss.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.289
Thank you.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.542
I'm sorry.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:21.678
Oh.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.347
Really?

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.600
Alright, come quickly.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.313
Boss.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.108
The kids were attacked by Kim Myeong-gil's men

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.860
while retrieving cash from the bookstore.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:38.861
Are they hurt?

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.446
No, there was no mention of that.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.073
But...

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.576
They lost all the money in the safe.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.287
Hey, are they hurt?

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.122
I think they're fine.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.876
Oh, and...

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.920
We've caught one guy at the commercial building,

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.089
but we couldn't deal with him. What should we do?

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.594
When a patient comes to the emergency room after committing a crime,

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.889
doctors are required to report it to the police.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.101
So I had secured this hospital

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.228
so I could operate at any time.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.399
Myeong-gil must have secured a hospital too.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.652
I'll send Du-yeong.
Motorcycles are advantageous.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.455
Good work.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:14.999
Hey.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.837
Good work.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.631
Oh, yes.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.425
You guys get some sleep,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.219
and come to the shop at lunchtime.

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:28.971
What, for what reason...

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.349
To feed you.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.434
Oh.

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:36.437
Don't you want to?

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:39.399
Actually, I don't usually eat lunch...

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.691
Wow.
Yes.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.319
Go.

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:52.662
Oh.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.793
Are you okay?

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.840
We lost the money in the safe. I'm sorry.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.383
No, are *you* okay?

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:07.427
Oh.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.262
Yes.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.806
I'm fine.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:17.270
Ah, I'll move the rest of the boxes. Please go to sleep first.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.276
You really weren't hurt, right?

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:28.948
Yes.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.880
I didn't give him the money back. He...

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:29.509
In-beom is fine everywhere else,

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.969
but his right eardrum ruptured.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.723
I'll check the car's license plate from the dashcam footage in the morning.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.558
You haven't done it yet?

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:41.604
Because the police haven't
come to work yet.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.608
Your words are a bit short, aren't they?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.111
Cool eyes.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.905
Ugh, damn it. Tsk.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.914
What if the car they rode in is a ghost car

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.457
or has a fake license plate?

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.377
Can you track how far the car went with CCTV?

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.798
It's not impossible, but it will take a long time.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:12.260
Checking a car's registration is as simple as typing the number into the police intranet,

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.345
but for CCTV, you have to go to the control center

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:16.180
and manually rewind and look for it, and...

00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.391
Each district has a different control center,

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.977
so it will take some time for me to find people.

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.522
Spend as much money as you need. Do it as fast as possible.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.607
Yes.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.193
Find out who owns the commercial building where the bookstore is.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.070
If it's Chairman Choi,

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.655
you'll be able to find his home address too.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.365
Yes.

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:37.618
Jang-do and I
need to talk for a bit.

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:40.037
Huh?

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:43.457
Didn't you hear me?

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:48.421
Yes.

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:10.484
Why did they

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.737
just leave Beom?

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.282
Perhaps they didn't have time because they were moving cash?

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.201
Jang-do, Jang-do, huh?

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:23.039
People who think positively
don't make progress.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.124
Think negatively.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.128
With the fear that those bastards
are desperately trying to kill me,

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.505
rack your brain.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.549
What do you mean?

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:37.678
To tail them?

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.767
Send more guys to the hospital.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.769
Dress them in patient gowns and arm them.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:46.437
Yes.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.857
And put guys
on Jun-min too.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.028
Did Director Kim do something wrong?

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:57.198
Ah, I told you to think negatively.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:01.494
Chairman Choi might have dug up his personal information.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.663
Yes.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.335
Jun-min gets scared easily, so he can't control his expressions.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.338
Even from afar, they might notice.

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.340
Ignorance is bliss for him, huh?

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.092
Yes.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.220
Because of him,

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.681
Hwang Yang-joong probably won't move.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:23.891
He'll send Lee Du-yeong.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:27.186
I told you, he moves widely on a motorcycle.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.104
Yes.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:31.065
Block him from front and back and catch him.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.026
Yes.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.072
This will be fun.

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.099
Good morning, boss.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.059
Ah, did you get any sleep?

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.644
Oh, yes.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.105
You came in early this morning, why don't you rest a bit?

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:12.857
I slept deeply enough.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.983
Ah, Geon-woo.

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:16.277
I had something to tell you.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.194
Oh.

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:23.784
Hyun-ju is

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.161
a lonely child.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.288
She always has a shadow in a corner of her heart.

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:28.622
Oh.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:13:2.292
So she intentionally
acts cold at times.

00:13:33.753 --> 00:13:35.421
Ah, yes.

00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:37.423
But our Hyun-ju

00:13:37.506 --> 00:13:39.884
became very bright after meeting you and Woo-jin.

00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:42.553
So I'm very grateful to you two.

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.556
We also like being with Hyun-ju.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.057
Ah, and,

00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:49.143
the money I advanced you

00:13:50.144 --> 00:13:51.020
is gone now.

00:13:52.104 --> 00:13:55.775
Ah, me...
Uh, uh, where, where did it go?

00:13:55.858 --> 00:13:58.068
Uh, what I mean is, it's all settled.

00:13:58.152 --> 00:13:59.612
Oh... why?

00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:01.530
Do you know how much money

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:03.741
you brought from the bookstore yesterday?

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:05.743
Uh, that...

00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.663
Uh-uh...

00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:12.500
Since you safely transported my money,

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.336
I'm giving you a bonus.
Oh, yes.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:19.548
Uh, I, I want to pay you back by working honestly.

00:14:19.632 --> 00:14:21.133
Uh, you did work honestly.

00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:24.845
The cash you brought is quite a lot.

00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:28.891
And you and I,

00:14:29.391 --> 00:14:30.935
we're no longer in a debtor-creditor relationship.

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:32.937
Take your mother

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:36.440
and open a cafe again in Jeju or somewhere nice.

00:14:37.983 --> 00:14:40.152
I'll invest everything for you.

00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:45.699
Boss, thank you so much.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.034
But...

00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:49.954
I want to help you catch Kim Myeong-gil

00:14:50.746 --> 00:14:52.081
until the very end.

00:14:52.164 --> 00:14:53.666
You've helped enough.

00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:56.418
No, I want to stay with you until the end.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.754
Why?

00:14:59.672 --> 00:14:0.965
I have to repay my gratitude.

00:14:1.507 --> 00:14:3.008
You've repaid enough.

00:14:3.092 --> 00:14:4.718
It's not enough for me yet.

00:14:5.928 --> 00:14:8.097
Because it's not over until it's over.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.351
Alright.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.313
It's not over until it's over.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.859
Let's have a drink soon.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.945
Oh, I don't drink.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:24.530
Ugh.

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.532
Instead, I'll pour for you.

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:28.117
Ugh.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.704
Go up!

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:32.621
Oh, oh, yes!

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.885
"Investigator Hwang"

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.733
Put wasabi on it and eat it with soy sauce.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.005
It's wild-caught, isn't it?

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.841
Actually, this farmed flounder

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.886
can be a bit oily because of the fat in the fin meat,

00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:30.638
but wild-caught ones like these

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.014
have very firm flesh,

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.475
and the fat is evenly distributed.

00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:37.478
Wow, the unique
mildness and flavor of this flounder is truly...

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.898
I can taste it in every bite.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.150
The aging is perfect too.

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.821
Do you... like raw fish?

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.281
Oh.

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.533
I briefly ran a raw fish YouTube channel before.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.328
I quit because I couldn't get more than 1,000 subscribers, no matter how hard I tried.

00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:56.789
Ha, this is the first time I've eaten it sliced this long.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:57.706
Oh.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.209
It wraps around my mouth
like a whip.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.587
It's the most delicious flounder
I've ever tasted.

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:05.547
'Like.'

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.258
Wow, bro, you're amazing.

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.636
Hey, I worked hard.
Oh.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:11.929
I'll subscribe.

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.722
It's closed.
Oh.

00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:15.766
You all worked hard yesterday,

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.060
so I called you to treat you to a meal.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.603
Thank you.

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.271
What are you going to do now?

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.357
Kill the big guy,

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:27.027
and catch that wildcat-like bastard and crush him.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.862
That wildcat bastard

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.155
is Kim Myeong-gil's cleaner.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.617
When Kim Myeong-gil caused trouble,

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.578
that bastard would go around,
bribing and threatening people,

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.205
to shut them up and cover things up.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:39.665
If we crush that bastard

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.043
and find just one body that Kim Myeong-gil ordered to be buried, it's over.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.170
If we find a body, money can't cover it up.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.756
Smile Capital is finished?
That's right.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.635
If we can't find a body,
what should we find?

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.138
Well, if we find the weapon used in the murder,

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.681
or a video, it's over too.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.309
Here.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.770
Also,
this yellowtail is...

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:03.731
This aged...

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.858
My bad, my bad, my bad.

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.193
Sit, sit, sit.
You're fast.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.488
I'm Lee Du-yeong.
I heard about you guys. Nice to meet you.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:12.990
Oh.
Yes, I'm Kim Geon-woo.

00:17:13.073 --> 00:17:14.033
Yes.
Hong Woo-jin.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.577
Hey, these boxers' fists are different.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.494
Nice to meet you.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.330
I actually went to the underpass that day.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.791
I rushed there as soon as I got the boss's call,

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.710
but I live a bit far,
so I arrived late.

00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:25.794
But,

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.379
seeing all those thugs knocked out,

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.090
I was truly amazed, 'Wow, these guys are real fighters.'

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.010
Oh, bro,

00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:35.679
your dream was to be a world champion once, right?

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.848
Ah, why are you dragging me into this?

00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:38.766
Why?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.351
Can you hit today?

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:43.353
What?

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:45.355
Ah, the sales director.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.066
Ah, talk when you two are alone.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.443
Ah, why?
These guys are coming with us.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.653
What are you talking about? Why are the kids going?

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:52.571
Ah, what's the problem?

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:54.740
If the police show up,
they'll all be accomplices.

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:58.702
Ah, the kids said they'd come.
Why are you yelling at me?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.665
Kids, if you get a criminal record,

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.168
you can't get back in the ring, you know that, right?

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.419
Yes.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.008
Why are you fighting Kim Myeong-gil, sir?

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.344
Ah, he killed our guys, so we have to get revenge.

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:18.055
You might die fighting Kim Myeong-gil, though.

00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:19.264
Aren't you scared?

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:20.933
I'm not scared of dying.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.060
I'm scared of not being able to kill those bastards.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.730
What about you guys? What are you going to do?

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.690
We'll go.
Me too.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:29.817
Why?

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.569
Kim Myeong-gil is a truly bad guy.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.738
If it weren't for the boss,

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.448
our family would have been ruined.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.618
All I know how to do is use my strength, but

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.662
I want to be helpful until the end.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.872
Me too.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.458
I believe our Marine Duo
will be a great help.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.918
You guys were Marines?

00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:48.836
Yes.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:50.379
Are you a Marine?

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:52.506
I was exempt, my brother was.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.424
Hey.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:56.760
"Pil! Seung!" (Marine Corps slogan)

00:18:58.762 --> 00:18:59.680
Pilseung.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.560
Hey, why do you keep leaking my personal life, are you crazy?

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:07.187
Ah, this is how we get to know each other gradually, what's the big deal?

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.316
Ah, get down, you bastards.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.526
Tell us your serial number!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.194
Won't you get down?

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.614
I want to call you senior!

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.868
Ah, look at this bastard.
He's making me get up.

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:22.828
You bastard, get down now!

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.331
Once a Marine,
always a Marine!

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:29.209
Oh, really?
Ah, give him a break, bro.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.252
This bastard.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:31.962
He's trying to get the better of me, is he?

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.630
No, sir!

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.090
The Marine spirit
is to win!

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.592
Ah, uh, senior, uh,

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.177
this brother is a bit... misguided.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.970
Uh, please just give him a pass this once.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.471
What's 'misguided'?

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.974
Ah, that, he has a strong Marine pride.

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:45.184
What's 'Marine pride'?

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.643
Marine Corps pride, sir.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:47.811
Ah.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.354
Tell him your serial number!

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.565
Bro, he has Marine pride.

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:52.900
Tell him your serial number!

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.321
I'm class of '571.

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:58.238
Happy now?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.533
Senior!

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.118
Pil! Seung!

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.000
Are you going too?

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:13.337
Do you think I can't fight?

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:16.340
I asked because I thought

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.217
the boss might worry.

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:21.011
I started this.

00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:22.596
I'm going to see it through.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.431
Alright.

00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:27.768
Alright then.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.062
We're going tonight.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.273
When Du-yeong hits the sales director, call me.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.608
I'll be waiting in front of the hospital,

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:36.026
and I'll go in when I get your call.

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.444
Understood?

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:38.820
Why wait before going in?

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.448
If Du-yeong hits the sales director and there are thugs,

00:20:41.531 --> 00:21:42.532
it means they've noticed.

00:21:42.616 --> 00:21:44.201
That means there are thugs
in the hospital too.

00:21:45.077 --> 00:21:47.162
Then isn't it dangerous for Mr. Du-yeong to go alone?

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.498
He's fine, he's fast.

00:21:51.333 --> 00:21:52.834
Isn't it safer to just catch Kim Jun-min together

00:21:52.918 --> 00:21:54.628
and go into the hospital to catch Im Jang-do?

00:21:54.711 --> 00:21:55.963
Much safer, no?

00:21:56.713 --> 00:21:58.757
If they know we're moving,

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:0.592
Kim Myeong-gil will unleash all his thugs.

02:01:4.68 --> 02:01:2.511
Then we die.

02:01:3.095 --> 02:01:4.179
We can't win by numbers.

02:01:4.888 --> 02:01:7.099
We have to split into two groups
and attack simultaneously.

02:01:8.517 --> 02:01:9.559
It's dangerous,

02:01:9.643 --> 02:01:11.228
but that's the only way to win.

02:01:14.898 --> 02:01:16.441
I ride a motorcycle, so I'll be fine.

02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:19.069
If it gets bad, I can just run away.

02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:23.115
What should we do?

02:01:24.324 --> 02:01:25.701
Can you ride a motorcycle?

02:01:26.618 --> 02:01:27.703
No.

02:01:27.786 --> 02:01:29.288
My kick scooter
is fast.

02:01:29.871 --> 02:01:30.706
What?

02:01:31.623 --> 02:01:32.749
No.

02:01:34.042 --> 02:01:35.377
Hey, I'll take the kids.

02:01:35.919 --> 02:01:37.004
They might be needed at the hospital.

02:01:38.005 --> 02:01:39.631
I'll go with Mr. Du-yeong.

02:01:39.715 --> 02:01:40.799
I ride a motorcycle.

02:01:42.009 --> 02:01:42.843
Alright.

02:01:43.677 --> 02:01:44.511
Alright, shall we eat?

02:01:45.095 --> 02:01:46.346
Yes.
Yes.

02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:47.973
Hyun-ju, do you ride a motorcycle?

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.516
Yes.
What do you ride?

02:01:50.142 --> 02:01:51.518
I ride a naked bike.

02:01:52.394 --> 02:01:54.229
Hey, don't you think we're a bit alike?

02:01:55.605 --> 02:01:56.606
Right?
Yeah.

02:01:57.566 --> 02:01:58.483
Ah, damn it.

02:01:58.567 --> 02:02:00.235
Ah, why are you swearing?

02:02:00.319 --> 02:02:01.445
Where did you serve?

02:02:01.528 --> 02:02:03.155
I told you not to talk about military, damn it.

02:02:03.238 --> 02:02:05.032
Stop it.

02:02:05.741 --> 02:02:08.493
Hey, Min-dong, bring some
soup and rice here.

02:02:09.536 --> 02:02:10.370
Yes.

02:02:12.331 --> 02:02:13.165
Duk-ah.

02:02:13.665 --> 02:02:14.583
How have you been?

02:02:14.666 --> 02:02:15.709
Yes, it's been a while, hyung-nim.

02:02:16.293 --> 02:02:17.377
This friend will ride.

02:02:17.461 --> 02:02:18.754
Hello.
Hello.

02:02:19.379 --> 02:02:20.505
I've prepared it here.

02:02:22.132 --> 02:02:24.343
Wow, that's nice. These days' things.

02:02:26.887 --> 02:02:27.804
Have you ridden a sport bike?

02:02:28.347 --> 02:02:29.931
Yes, I rode one for a short while a long time ago.

02:02:31.475 --> 02:02:32.934
When you were training in the military,

02:02:33.018 --> 02:22:34.311
you learned how to hold a knife, right?

02:22:35.062 --> 02:22:36.855
Hold it.
No.

02:22:37.898 --> 02:22:38.732
You didn't learn?

02:22:38.815 --> 02:22:39.900
Yes.

02:22:43.904 --> 02:22:44.946
Just hold it for now.

02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:46.156
Uh, senior.

02:22:46.865 --> 02:22:49.159
We have no intention of using knives, just...

02:22:50.243 --> 02:22:51.328
Who told you to use knives?

02:22:51.411 --> 02:22:53.413
You just gave it to us!

02:22:53.497 --> 02:22:54.623
Are you talking back?

02:22:55.290 --> 02:22:56.416
I'll do well!

02:22:59.127 --> 02:23:00.712
You need to know how to use a knife

02:23:00.796 --> 02:23:02.881
to understand the thoughts of those who use knives.

02:23:02.964 --> 02:23:04.925
You have to read their thoughts to win, right?

02:23:05.008 --> 02:23:06.718
Oh.
Ah!

02:23:06.802 --> 02:23:07.636
Oh, you startled me, damn it.

02:23:10.097 --> 02:23:12.224
Let's see, once you get used to it...

02:23:14.267 --> 02:23:15.102
This is the fastest.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:24.319
It suits you.

02:23:25.695 --> 02:23:26.905
This sashimi knife

02:23:27.489 --> 02:23:29.950
doesn't have a guard between the handle and the blade.

02:23:30.033 --> 02:23:31.827
It's not made for stabbing.

02:23:32.744 --> 02:23:33.745
Look.

02:23:33.829 --> 02:23:34.871
If you stab hard with this,

02:23:36.498 --> 02:23:39.501
your hand will slide forward, and all your fingers will be ruined by the blade.

02:23:39.584 --> 02:23:41.002
To stab deeply with this,

02:23:41.086 --> 02:23:42.587
you have to support the back of the handle.

02:23:43.338 --> 02:23:44.297
That way,

02:23:45.757 --> 02:23:46.675
it won't slip in.

02:23:48.385 --> 02:23:49.845
So, if someone comes at you holding a knife like this,

02:23:49.928 --> 02:23:50.804
what do you think they're aiming for?

02:23:50.887 --> 02:23:53.390
They're probably trying to cut the back of the hand or the wrist.

02:23:53.473 --> 02:23:56.101
That's right, it's not a deep attack.

02:23:56.685 --> 02:23:58.103
Uh, in boxing terms,

02:23:58.186 --> 02:24:00.021
it's like an out-boxer throwing light jabs from a distance.

02:24:00.105 --> 02:24:01.231
Mm.
Ah!

02:24:03.316 --> 02:24:05.485
One more time!

02:24:05.986 --> 02:24:06.987
It's okay.

02:24:07.988 --> 02:24:09.906
Relax and swing.

02:24:18.457 --> 02:24:20.834
If they come at you holding the back of the handle with both hands?

02:24:20.917 --> 02:24:23.170
They're trying to kill you, right? Just, *thwack*.

02:24:25.589 --> 02:24:28.175
Because you're pressing the back of the handle with your thumb,

02:24:28.258 --> 02:24:30.260
it won't slip no matter how much force you use.

02:24:31.136 --> 02:24:32.762
Holding a knife like this

02:24:32.846 --> 02:24:34.139
means you know how to use a knife.

02:24:34.222 --> 02:24:36.516
Just hit with the momentum.
Don't hit too hard.

02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:37.934
Relax.

02:24:38.018 --> 02:24:38.894
That's it.

02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:48.153
That's it!

02:25:00.999 --> 02:25:03.502
If you're caught cheating, you're dead. Seriously.

02:25:04.252 --> 02:25:05.462
What are you doing, bastard, hurry up and turn it over.

02:25:06.171 --> 02:25:08.131
Damn it, after one round. Hey, show me, show me.

02:25:10.759 --> 02:25:11.927
Aren't you going to greet him?

02:25:18.767 --> 02:25:20.810
You little bastards!

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.038
Let's wait here.

02:26:05.564 --> 02:26:06.690
Stop!

02:26:07.482 --> 02:26:08.316
Which room number are you visiting?

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:09.734
Room 603.

02:26:12.737 --> 02:26:14.072
One car is going in.

02:26:31.172 --> 02:26:32.257
One guy showed up.

02:26:32.882 --> 02:26:33.717
What should we do?

02:26:35.218 --> 02:26:36.469
Wait a bit more.

02:26:42.934 --> 02:26:44.144
Ah, damn it.

02:27:06.207 --> 02:27:07.042
Thank you.

02:27:08.043 --> 02:27:09.044
Drink as you go in.

02:27:09.127 --> 02:27:11.129
To survive in this business,

02:27:11.713 --> 02:27:13.006
you have to sell everything you have.

02:27:14.090 --> 02:27:14.924
Your fists,

02:27:15.634 --> 02:27:16.468
your soul,

02:27:17.010 --> 02:27:17.844
your dreams.

02:27:18.595 --> 02:27:19.888
If you sell everything, you won't die.

02:27:21.139 --> 02:27:23.850
But whatever happens,
don't sell your family and friends.

02:27:23.933 --> 02:27:25.477
If you're going to live like that, just die.

02:27:27.437 --> 02:27:28.271
Yes.
Yes.

02:27:29.898 --> 02:27:31.608
In a bit, I'll go into the hospital,

02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:34.152
and if I tell you guys to run,
run without a word.

02:27:34.235 --> 02:27:36.071
I'll take care of things inside.

02:27:37.864 --> 02:27:38.740
Uh...

02:27:38.823 --> 02:27:40.075
Are you not answering?

02:27:41.117 --> 02:27:42.369
Didn't you just say, senior,

02:27:42.452 --> 02:27:45.205
not to abandon family and friends?

02:27:45.789 --> 02:27:46.956
I'm a criminal.

02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.667
Even though we're in the same boat now,

02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:50.418
you and I are not family.

02:27:50.502 --> 02:27:52.170
We won't see each other after this.

02:27:52.671 --> 02:27:54.839
So don't get emotionally attached
or develop feelings for this.

02:27:54.923 --> 02:27:55.757
Understood?

02:28:01.554 --> 02:28:02.639
Understood?

02:28:03.515 --> 02:28:04.349
Yes.

02:28:06.685 --> 02:28:07.519
Yes.

02:28:26.621 --> 02:28:27.664
Kim Jun-min is here.

02:28:33.461 --> 02:28:34.796
What are you going to do?

02:28:36.506 --> 02:28:38.258
Sir?
What should we do?

02:28:39.342 --> 02:28:40.176
Can you hear me?

02:28:40.927 --> 02:28:42.303
Uh, please answer...

02:28:42.387 --> 02:28:43.221
I'm hitting him.

02:29:00.405 --> 02:29:02.282
Ah, this bastard, you!

02:29:12.333 --> 02:29:13.668
Damn it!

02:29:13.752 --> 02:29:15.754
Call the hospital, you bastard.

02:29:32.771 --> 02:29:34.606
You son of a bitch, you!

02:29:34.689 --> 02:29:35.815
You bastard!

02:29:35.899 --> 02:29:37.317
You bastard!

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:40.111
You son of a bitch, you bastard!

02:29:40.195 --> 02:29:43.239
You bastard, you son of a bitch! Damn it!

02:29:45.492 --> 02:29:46.367
Dong-woo.

02:29:46.451 --> 02:29:48.953
Put this in the trunk, you bastard.

02:29:49.037 --> 02:29:50.330
Hey, hurry up and put it in!

02:29:54.459 --> 02:29:55.293
What is it?

02:29:57.420 --> 02:29:59.214
What is it?
What is that bastard? Damn it!

03:00:05.553 --> 03:00:06.971
You son of a bitch.

03:00:09.182 --> 03:00:10.433
Oh, oh!

03:00:21.861 --> 03:00:22.821
Are you okay?

03:00:46.678 --> 03:00:47.637
Oh.

03:00:50.056 --> 03:00:50.974
Are you okay?

03:00:52.183 --> 03:00:53.059
Alright.

03:01:02.569 --> 03:01:03.403
Let's go.

03:01:04.195 --> 03:01:05.071
Yes.
Yes.

03:01:40.398 --> 03:01:41.232
It's Im Jang-do, Im Jang-do.

03:01:48.656 --> 03:01:50.199
Alright, let's go up.

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:55.204
Hey!

03:01:55.288 --> 03:01:56.289
This way.

03:02:06.090 --> 03:02:07.675
Put some effort into it, ugh!

03:02:07.759 --> 03:02:09.052
Ugh, damn it!

03:02:20.563 --> 03:02:21.481
What is this...

03:02:22.774 --> 03:02:24.275
Alright, push.

03:02:25.944 --> 03:02:26.778
Just a moment.

03:02:27.528 --> 03:02:29.030
Let go, damn it!

03:02:32.283 --> 03:02:33.409
Damn...

03:02:36.079 --> 03:02:37.997
What is this, damn it!

03:02:38.081 --> 03:02:38.957
Damn it!

03:02:59.644 --> 03:03:00.853
Ugh, damn it!

03:03:08.027 --> 03:03:09.737
Let's go.
Yes.

03:03:15.201 --> 03:03:16.202
Oh, bro, be careful.

03:03:59.954 --> 04:00:01.456
You're here?
Hello.

04:00:09.839 --> 04:00:11.716
Can you load it here?
Yes, yes.

04:00:13.968 --> 04:00:15.303
One, two.

04:00:15.386 --> 04:00:16.763
Be careful, be careful.

04:00:16.846 --> 04:00:18.097
Ugh, damn it.

04:00:19.474 --> 04:00:20.600
Where's the salt?

04:00:20.683 --> 04:00:21.517
Salt?

04:00:23.186 --> 04:00:24.062
It's in the office.

04:00:25.229 --> 04:00:26.397
You two, go mix some salt water.

04:00:28.232 --> 04:00:29.567
Find a bucket and put all the salt in.

04:00:29.650 --> 04:00:30.777
Yes.

04:00:30.860 --> 04:00:31.694
Let's go.
Oh.

04:00:31.778 --> 04:00:32.987
Uh, it's in the corner.

04:00:33.071 --> 04:00:33.988
Yes.
Yes.

04:00:35.490 --> 04:00:36.532
Ugh, damn it.

04:00:43.581 --> 04:00:44.582
Hyun-ju, are you okay?

04:00:45.249 --> 04:00:46.918
Uh, are you okay, oppa?

04:00:47.001 --> 04:00:47.835
Uh.

04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:51.506
We caught Im Jang-do.

04:00:51.589 --> 04:00:53.466
Yeah.
What about Kim Jun-min?

04:00:53.549 --> 04:00:56.344
Uh, I was outside so I didn't see him, but they caught him.

04:00:56.427 --> 04:00:57.512
Uh.

04:00:57.595 --> 04:00:59.305
Did they kill him, by any chance?

04:01:05.770 --> 04:01:07.230
Hey, let's just make the salt water quickly.

04:01:07.313 --> 04:01:08.731
Find it.
Yeah.

04:01:12.735 --> 04:01:14.445
This should work.

04:01:14.529 --> 04:01:16.030
Water?
I saw it downstairs.

04:01:16.114 --> 04:01:16.948
Let's go down.

04:01:17.031 --> 04:01:17.865
Hyun-ju, let's go.

04:01:32.797 --> 04:01:33.756
Yes.

04:01:33.840 --> 04:01:36.676
Uh, I'll arrive in 5 minutes, so shake him up a bit.

04:01:36.759 --> 04:01:37.927
Ah, and,

04:01:39.095 --> 04:01:41.097
tell Hyun-ju and the kids to watch from the side.

04:01:55.611 --> 04:01:56.779
What's wrong?

04:01:58.281 --> 04:01:59.824
They want Hyun-ju to watch too?

04:01:59.907 --> 04:02:00.783
Why?

04:02:03.536 --> 04:02:05.121
Will Hyun-ju be okay?

04:02:07.415 --> 04:02:08.958
Welcome.
This way.

04:02:23.681 --> 04:02:24.515
Stop.

04:02:25.099 --> 04:02:26.184
Let's look at the stairs too.

04:02:26.267 --> 04:02:27.894
Ah, there are no cameras
in that area.

04:02:28.519 --> 04:02:29.353
Why?

04:02:29.437 --> 04:02:30.730
There originally aren't any...

04:02:33.274 --> 04:02:34.692
What do you mean by that? Damn it!

04:02:35.776 --> 04:02:37.570
Uh, from outside,

04:02:38.446 --> 04:02:40.156
aren't there cameras that
view the hospital building?

04:02:40.865 --> 04:02:42.450
For that,
you have to go to the police station.

04:02:50.625 --> 04:02:52.376
What about Jun-min?

04:02:54.378 --> 04:02:55.588
He's still unconscious.

04:02:56.797 --> 04:02:58.299
Go to the apartment management office

04:02:58.382 --> 04:03:01.385
and find the license plate of the guys who hit Jun-min.
Yes.

04:03:03.137 --> 04:03:04.222
Should I put it here?

04:03:04.305 --> 04:03:06.307
Hey, grab it.
How much should I put in?

04:03:06.849 --> 04:03:08.434
Ah, didn't you
say to put it all in earlier?

04:03:09.143 --> 04:03:10.228
This is too much.

04:03:11.520 --> 04:03:13.481
Let's just put it all in, bro.
You answered earlier.

04:03:14.398 --> 04:03:15.441
Alright.

04:03:18.653 --> 04:03:19.612
What are you doing?

04:03:19.695 --> 04:03:21.155
Making salt water.

04:03:26.911 --> 04:03:27.870
Uh, salt water.

04:03:27.954 --> 04:03:29.080
Oh, yes.

04:03:33.209 --> 04:03:34.377
Come here and look at this.

04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:37.004
Why?

04:03:37.088 --> 04:03:38.673
The boss told us to look.

04:37:46.472 --> 04:37:50.059
I hate people who open their mouth and then close it again the most.

04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:52.144
So,

04:37:52.228 --> 04:37:54.814
if you're determined to tell me everything,

04:37:54.897 --> 04:37:56.649
nod your head.

04:37:57.275 --> 04:37:59.402
If you say you'll talk and then clam up,

04:37:59.485 --> 04:38:01.028
I'll cut off your lips with a knife.

04:38:01.112 --> 04:38:02.029
Understood?

04:38:40.651 --> 04:38:41.986
You're not going to talk, are you?

04:39:29.325 --> 04:39:30.159
Hey.

04:39:30.659 --> 04:39:31.660
Yeah.

04:39:48.052 --> 04:39:49.136
Uh...

04:39:49.720 --> 04:39:50.721
H-Hyun-ju, that...

04:40:05.194 --> 04:40:06.695
Why did he tell us to watch that?

04:40:07.530 --> 04:40:10.616
By now, Myeong-gil must have started looking for Im Jang-do.

04:40:10.699 --> 04:40:13.411
There isn't much time.

04:40:13.494 --> 04:40:16.288
I want to teach you guys something.

04:40:16.372 --> 04:40:18.499
What do you mean?

04:40:18.582 --> 04:40:21.252
This will only end when someone dies.

04:40:21.335 --> 04:40:23.754
I can't guarantee that I'll be alive.

04:40:23.838 --> 04:40:25.631
Ah, we'll win.

04:40:25.714 --> 04:40:27.174
Why are you only thinking negatively?

04:40:27.258 --> 04:40:28.217
Hyun-ju.

04:40:28.300 --> 04:40:29.343
Ah, that's enough.

04:40:35.141 --> 04:40:36.058
Hyun-ju!

04:40:39.437 --> 04:40:41.105
Driver Oh, please take care of Hyun-ju.

04:40:41.188 --> 04:40:42.064
Yes, boss.

04:40:43.399 --> 04:40:45.067
Ah, that kid, really.

04:40:48.863 --> 04:40:49.697
Uh, Geon-woo.

04:40:49.780 --> 04:40:50.781
Oh, yes.

04:40:52.783 --> 04:40:53.659
Uh, if,

04:40:55.744 --> 04:40:57.079
Myeong-gil and you guys

04:40:58.164 --> 04:40:59.999
end up fighting, you,

04:41:01.292 --> 04:41:02.668
you can protect the kids, right?

04:41:04.962 --> 04:41:06.338
I will protect them until the end.

04:41:07.882 --> 04:41:08.966
Alright, thank you.

04:41:10.593 --> 04:41:12.178
Uh, we don't have much time,

04:41:12.803 --> 04:41:14.638
so I'll just teach you one thing.

04:41:18.225 --> 04:41:20.519
To defeat a tightly-knit organization,

04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:22.396
two things are needed.

04:41:24.273 --> 04:41:25.149
Dispersion,

04:41:25.691 --> 04:41:26.692
and division.

04:41:28.360 --> 04:41:31.030
People trust those who know them well
and empathize with them.

04:41:31.113 --> 04:41:32.448
That's how it is.

04:41:34.575 --> 04:41:36.619
If you can't gain individual trust,

04:41:38.287 --> 04:41:40.331
you can't divide the organization.

04:41:55.387 --> 04:41:56.305
Take this off.

04:42:12.404 --> 04:42:14.073
Im Jang-do?

04:42:15.115 --> 04:42:16.867
Among Myeong-gil's subordinates,

04:42:16.951 --> 04:42:20.788
I think you understand Myeong-gil
most accurately.

04:42:21.997 --> 04:42:24.917
Myeong-gil is a very violent
and cruel person.

04:42:25.000 --> 04:42:27.503
But he reads people's minds
like a ghost.

04:42:28.671 --> 04:42:30.256
He knows how to gain.

04:42:31.257 --> 04:42:32.883
That's why
Kim Jun-min and Kang In-beom

04:42:33.384 --> 04:42:35.219
probably truly believe him.

04:42:35.928 --> 04:42:37.221
But you're smart.

04:42:37.805 --> 04:42:39.682
You know Myeong-gil better than them.

04:42:40.599 --> 04:42:41.725
Uh, Myeong-gil

04:42:41.809 --> 04:42:44.562
never empathizes passionately
from the heart.

04:42:45.312 --> 04:42:47.106
He only empathizes coldly with his mind.

04:42:47.189 --> 04:42:48.816
Even normally, he's always

04:42:49.441 --> 04:42:52.236
calculating how to use people.

04:42:52.319 --> 04:42:55.656
You knew that, but you still
went under Myeong-gil.

04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:57.283
Why?

04:42:58.576 --> 04:43:00.452
The first reason is money.

04:43:02.079 --> 04:43:04.415
Myeong-gil gave you a salary
that you would earn in 5 years

04:43:04.498 --> 04:43:06.166
working at a large corporation, didn't he?

04:43:06.709 --> 04:43:10.129
You wanted power after graduating from police academy,
but you were demoted,

04:43:10.212 --> 04:43:12.673
so you had to earn money.

04:43:12.756 --> 04:43:15.009
That way, you wouldn't lose face.

04:43:17.344 --> 04:43:18.178
However,

04:43:18.262 --> 04:43:21.390
the real reason you went under Myeong-gil
is the second one.

04:43:21.974 --> 04:43:25.185
You were confident that you wouldn't be used by Myeong-gil.

04:43:25.769 --> 04:43:27.146
You were certain you wouldn't lose to

04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:29.773
a criminal bastard like him.

04:43:30.816 --> 04:43:33.652
If, by any chance, Myeong-gil has a motive to kill you,

04:43:33.736 --> 04:43:34.987
then at that moment,

04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:37.114
you'd take the money you've earned from Myeong-gil

04:43:38.157 --> 04:43:39.908
and flee to Southeast Asia.

04:43:43.495 --> 04:43:45.164
Yes, your plan is very good.

04:43:46.457 --> 04:43:47.708
But right now, if I

04:43:48.334 --> 04:43:50.586
take a picture of you
and send it to Myeong-gil,

04:43:52.046 --> 04:43:54.381
and say you told me the names of the people
Myeong-gil ordered to be killed,

04:43:54.465 --> 04:43:57.259
Myeong-gil will definitely believe me.

04:43:57.343 --> 04:43:59.345
Because looking at your current state,

04:43:59.428 --> 04:44:01.597
your motive to talk is perfect.

04:44:04.183 --> 04:44:05.017
Then Myeong-gil will

04:44:05.100 --> 04:44:07.811
send back the men he sent to find you,

04:44:07.895 --> 04:44:10.689
and send his hunting dogs
to kill you and bury you secretly.

04:44:10.773 --> 04:44:12.441
They won't give you time to explain to Myeong-gil.

04:44:13.734 --> 04:44:16.945
Myeong-gil told them not to.
Myeong-gil doesn't care about the truth.

04:44:17.029 --> 04:44:18.989
It's just safest to bury you.

04:44:19.073 --> 04:44:21.367
Well, anyway,

04:44:21.992 --> 04:44:24.536
the one who knows most about the crimes
Myeong-gil has committed so far

04:44:24.620 --> 04:44:25.746
isn't Kim Jun-min or Kang In-beom.

04:44:25.829 --> 04:44:29.291
It's you.

04:42:5.897 --> 04:42:32.211
You know Myeong-gil as well as I do.

04:42:36.757 --> 04:42:38.967
If I were to just taint you

04:42:40.511 --> 04:42:41.512
with a very, very small amount of suspicion...

04:42:42.096 --> 04:42:45.057
Myeong-gil will kill you.

04:42:47.768 --> 04:42:49.353
Damn it.

04:42:49.436 --> 04:42:51.105
Wait, damn it.

04:42:53.065 --> 04:42:55.067
Why would I die?!

04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:56.527
You bastard!

04:42:57.403 --> 04:42:59.446
Damn it!

04:42:59.530 --> 04:43:0.406
Im Jang-do!

04:43:02.032 --> 04:43:03.826
Listen to me carefully!

04:43:03.909 --> 04:43:06.537
If you don't get a grip right now,
you'll really die!

04:43:11.417 --> 04:43:12.960
Tell me everything you know.

04:43:14.586 --> 04:43:17.047
Then I'll get you enough money
to live on for the rest of your life

04:43:17.548 --> 04:43:19.133
and send you to a safe country.

04:43:20.551 --> 04:43:22.845
Myeong-gil learned everything from me.

04:43:23.804 --> 04:43:26.348
I know all the places Myeong-gil doesn't know about.

04:43:27.057 --> 04:43:28.142
I promise you.

04:43:32.020 --> 04:43:35.065
You were going to exit anyway.

04:43:36.483 --> 04:43:38.068
Think of this as your chance.

04:43:43.824 --> 04:43:44.783
If I confess,

04:43:46.535 --> 04:43:47.828
how much will you give me?

04:43:50.998 --> 04:43:52.750
Answer quickly and honestly.

04:43:59.965 --> 04:44:03.135
I'm going to finish Myeong-gil
and Smile Capital completely.

04:44:04.178 --> 04:44:05.721
When the job is done, I'll send you to Guam.

04:44:05.804 --> 04:44:07.389
I know some people there.

04:44:08.182 --> 04:44:10.184
I'll support you with everything I have

04:44:10.267 --> 04:44:11.810
so you can start a new life there.

04:46:20.402 --> 04:46:21.528
Uh, get some clothes.

04:46:36.668 --> 04:46:38.378
How long have you been working for Myeong-gil?

04:46:39.463 --> 04:46:40.506
5 years.

04:46:40.589 --> 04:46:42.341
What exactly do you do?

04:46:42.925 --> 04:46:44.718
I prevent Manager Kim's illegal activities

04:46:44.802 --> 04:46:46.595
from reaching the police investigation,

04:46:46.678 --> 04:46:48.055
and if they do,

04:46:48.722 --> 04:46:50.182
I stop them from breaking out.

04:46:50.265 --> 04:46:51.809
Have you ever directly participated?

04:46:51.892 --> 04:46:54.186
For minor cases, In-beom and I sometimes go,

04:46:54.853 --> 04:46:57.523
but mostly it's handled by the subcontracting company
that Manager Kim operates.

04:46:58.148 --> 04:46:59.399
Minor cases?

04:46:59.483 --> 04:47:00.317
Well...

04:47:01.944 --> 04:47:03.987
We sometimes film
evidence videos and things like that.

04:47:04.071 --> 04:47:06.406
You blackmailed Ail Group, didn't you?

04:47:09.243 --> 04:47:10.244
What did you do?

04:47:11.328 --> 04:47:12.913
Manager Kim ordered me to do it.

04:47:12.996 --> 04:47:15.707
I didn't ask who ordered you, I asked what you did.

04:47:17.709 --> 04:47:19.711
I caught Ail Group's eldest son and filmed something.

04:47:19.795 --> 04:47:20.921
What?

04:47:21.713 --> 04:47:23.966
I just stripped him

04:47:24.049 --> 04:47:25.342
and filmed a video.

04:47:25.425 --> 04:47:26.260
Why?

04:47:28.971 --> 04:47:31.056
Tell me about this from the beginning.

04:47:32.724 --> 04:47:35.686
There's a 40-story boutique hotel being built in Gangnam,

04:47:35.769 --> 04:47:38.564
but construction was halted when the company went bankrupt due to COVID-19.

04:47:39.731 --> 04:47:41.567
Manager Kim heard that Ail Group's eldest son
was trying to acquire it,

04:47:41.650 --> 04:47:43.944
but he was 100 billion won short.

04:47:44.027 --> 04:47:45.279
From whom?

04:47:45.946 --> 04:47:47.906
Since the building had been abandoned for so long and become an eyesore,

04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:49.491
the Seoul City government got involved,

04:47:49.575 --> 04:47:51.535
and while looking for someone with cash,

04:47:51.618 --> 04:47:53.871
a National Assembly member who plays golf with Manager Kim every week

04:47:53.954 --> 04:47:56.456
recommended Manager Kim to the mayor.

04:47:57.124 --> 04:47:57.958
Manager Kim's

04:47:58.834 --> 04:48:01.169
dream is to build a casino in the hotel.

04:48:03.213 --> 04:48:06.216
The Seoul City government also promised to
immediately issue a casino license for foreigners,

04:48:06.300 --> 04:48:08.343
so Manager Kim
was excited,

04:48:08.427 --> 04:48:10.554
but then Ail Group's eldest son
suddenly tried to back out,

04:48:10.637 --> 04:48:13.056
so he had me
force him to stay.

04:48:13.932 --> 04:48:16.184
How many people did you film?

04:48:16.935 --> 04:48:17.769
50 people.

04:48:19.187 --> 04:48:21.481
And Myeong-gil is keeping those videos?

04:48:21.565 --> 04:48:22.399
Yes.

04:48:23.358 --> 04:48:25.819
He believes everyone's weakness is money.

04:48:26.695 --> 04:48:27.779
And,

04:48:28.363 --> 04:48:30.908
he never shares anything that can make money.

04:48:31.533 --> 04:48:33.368
Uh, where are those files?

04:48:35.287 --> 04:48:38.373
He keeps the hard drive in a small safe
inside Manager Kim's bedroom.

04:48:38.457 --> 04:48:41.001
But that safe is a German smart safe.

04:48:41.501 --> 04:48:43.462
It only opens with Manager Kim's
right palm vein,

04:48:44.254 --> 04:48:46.548
and if something happens,
he can remotely control it with his phone

04:48:47.174 --> 04:48:49.343
and burn whatever is stored inside the safe.

04:48:49.426 --> 04:48:51.845
There's liquid fuel in the safe ceiling,

04:48:51.929 --> 04:48:54.723
and when you press a button, it drops and catches fire.

04:48:54.806 --> 04:48:57.309
He knows that hard drive is a double-edged sword.

04:48:57.392 --> 04:48:59.144
It's a weapon if you have it, but

04:48:59.227 --> 04:49:01.229
it's evidence if the police seize it.

04:49:02.856 --> 04:49:03.857
That subcontracting company,

04:49:04.608 --> 04:49:05.442
are they thugs?

04:49:05.984 --> 04:49:06.818
Yes.

04:49:07.361 --> 04:49:08.195
How many people?

04:49:08.779 --> 04:49:10.656
I think there are about 30 people.

04:49:10.739 --> 04:49:12.157
Well, they call for more when needed.

04:49:12.240 --> 04:49:13.325
Who's the leader?

04:49:13.909 --> 04:49:14.952
Team Leader Jeong, they call him.

04:49:15.452 --> 04:49:17.579
He's the head of that company,
and he's Manager Kim's butcher.

04:49:17.663 --> 04:49:19.539
He was a mixed martial arts fighter,

04:49:19.623 --> 04:49:22.709
but he killed someone during a match
and had his fighter's license revoked.

04:49:22.793 --> 04:49:24.670
I heard Manager Kim scouted him.

04:49:24.753 --> 04:49:26.380
How does he dispose of bodies?

04:49:27.047 --> 04:49:28.840
Team Leader Jeong handles that side of things.

04:49:29.466 --> 04:49:31.134
Alright, tell me what you know.

04:49:32.594 --> 04:49:33.595
About 3 years ago,

04:49:34.429 --> 04:49:36.306
Manager Kim got angry while drinking once

04:49:36.807 --> 04:49:38.183
and beat someone to death.

04:49:38.767 --> 04:49:40.894
I happened to be nearby,

04:49:40.978 --> 04:49:43.730
so I was managing the situation
until Team Leader Jeong arrived.

04:49:43.814 --> 04:49:47.067
Team Leader Jeong called a fish truck
with a 3-ton tank,

04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.985
and took the body away.

04:49:48.527 --> 04:49:50.445
From what I saw of Team Leader Jeong and the driver talking,

04:49:50.529 --> 04:49:52.155
it seemed like they were a regular company they used.

04:49:52.239 --> 04:49:53.907
Their name?

04:49:55.617 --> 04:49:57.160
It's been so long, I don't remember.

0449:58.996 --> 04:50:59.955
Alright.

0450:0.747 --> 04:50:2.374
I know a hospital in Incheon.

0450:2.916 --> 04:50:5.252
I'll call an ambulance for you there, so go and rest.

0450:5.335 --> 04:50:6.545
When the job is done

0450:7.421 --> 04:50:8.422
and things are settled,

0450:9.047 --> 04:50:10.799
I'll send your passport and flight tickets.

0450:15.137 --> 04:50:16.888
Don't contact anyone.

0450:18.140 --> 04:50:19.391
Kim Myeong-gil will find you.

0450:24.771 --> 04:50:26.690
I'm taking your phone.

0450:34.031 --> 04:50:35.782
Let me ask one more thing.

0450:37.701 --> 04:50:39.870
Where are the gold bars Myeong-gil collected?

0450:41.663 --> 04:50:43.248
Only In-beom knows that.

0450:44.541 --> 04:50:45.834
What's their relationship?

0450:45.917 --> 04:50:48.920
In-beom is the only person Manager Kim truly trusts.

0450:49.004 --> 04:51:1.089
I heard they met in prison
and saved each other's lives multiple times.

0451:1.173 --> 04:51:3.425
In-beom will even sacrifice his life.

0451:3.508 --> 04:51:5.802
I can't know all of Manager Kim's true feelings, but

0451:6.928 --> 04:51:8.638
he definitely cherishes In-beom like a brother.
