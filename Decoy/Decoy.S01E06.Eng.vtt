(Gwangshin) You know singer Bang Hyun-min, right?

6
00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.423
Ah, why, in the old days
There was a singer who was popular.

7
00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:31.300
From a group called Axtage

8
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:34.345
That Bang Hyun-min
I created an entertainment company, right?

9
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.055
Wow, but

10
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:38.933
I got it from here and there
They say the investment amount is quite large.

11
00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:42.019
No, well, a celebrity.
It's like creating an entertainment company.

12
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.979
It's not surprising

13
00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:46.357

14

No, no matter what
Even if it’s a shitty company

18
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.620
Once you do a backdoor listing or whatever,

19
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.081
It's a bunch of bullshit, it's crazy.

20
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.583
But there's a problem with this

21
00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:05.876
Sales are slow?

22
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.046
So Bang Hyun-min
Are you looking for a place to increase sales?

So we
First, go to Hyunmin Bang’s subsidiary.

26
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.637
If it increases sales, it's a blessing.

27
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.265
And we hire celebrities from entertainment companies.

28
00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:21.392
It can also be used as a promotional model.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.636
When is the VIP reception?

172
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.264
(Secretary) After completing overseas tour
It's two months later when you come back.

173
00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.642
(Vocal cords) Oh, just in time
You can contact Jeong So-ram.

174
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.561
(Secretary) I write, even if I don’t

175
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.272
I keep getting calls from Senior Jeong.

176
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.398
Why?

177
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.524
I want to talk to the congressman.

178
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:05.068
Oh, there's no benefit in contacting you often.

179
00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:08.071
Now on Noh Sang-cheon’s side
How many times do I tell you to stick close

180
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.656
Okay, go out.

181
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.578
[sigh]
[The door slams shut]

182
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.333

Good ability, Noh Sang-cheon

[Youngjin’s cheers]
[Counter operating sound]

185
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.345
(Youngjin) Hey, this is...

186
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.305
I'm so happy

187
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.681
[The door clicks open]
(Sangcheon) Child...

188
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:35.766
[Gwangshin’s encouraging sound]

189
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.269
(fanaticism) Wow!

190
00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:44.733
Hey, how much is this?
No boss?

191
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:47.736
(Youngjin) Oh, this is it
I'll pay off all my debt, huh?

192
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.739
I did that, right? Everyone just trust me

193
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.076
(Soram) If you just get to this box,
This month's settlement is complete.

194
00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.580
(Sangcheon) Let me see for a moment.

195
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:00.332
[Sangcheon snaps his fingers]
[High Heaven's Whistle]

196

[Counter operating sound]

197
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.762
(Sangcheon) Take care of yourself.

198
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:14.846
(Youngjin) Yes

199
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.348
[Phone rings]

200
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.481
Hello?

201
00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.358
Where?

202
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.859
[The phone rings repeatedly]

203
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.742
A broadcasting station?

204
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:41.957
(Anchor 1 on TV) Recently, I received a free phone call.
Nowfree, which caused a craze

205
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.292
Due to frequent communication failures
I'm in trouble

206
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.751
Mr. Noh
[dark music]

207
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.295
(Anchor 1 on TV) Among some users,

208
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.756
Walkie-talkie, not a phone
Some say it was bought

209
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.841
Accordingly, our reporters

210
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.970
Nowfree's Fake Phone
We investigated suspicions of fraud.

211
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.263
[Sangcheon’s Sigh]

212
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.807
(Sangcheon) It exploded earlier than expected

213
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.892
(Gwangshin) Mr. Noh
What do we do now?
[Youngjin’s anxious breathing]

214
00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:03.061
(Youngjin) Even the money I have now
Should I lift it and jump?

215
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.731
This is still enough
You can live comfortably for several years.

216
00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.649
(Sangcheon) Be quiet so I can think about it.

217
00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:09.568
Shut up, even just for one minute! Mr.

218
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.862
(Gwangshin) Boy, this is the situation.
How can you be quiet!

219
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.120

[Sangcheon’s strengthening sound]

222
00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:25.125
Wake up, you bastards!

223
00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:30.172
In times like these, be proud and more confident!

224
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.009
We have to overcome it head on.

225
00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:37.304
(Gwangshin) So we only have Mr. Roh
Can I just believe it?

226
00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.482
[Rough breathing]

227
00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.692
Come to your senses, Sangcheon, okay?

228
00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:52.110
[Grunting]

229

[Sound of moon]

232
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.418
(Nayeon) If possible, please do not use it.

[Flashlight operation sound]

234
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.233
Have you really lived here?

[siren sound]

238
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:24.119
(Investigator) On-site verification has been completed.

239
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.413
The body will be moved to the autopsy room.

240
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.957
[rustling sound]
Let's check this out

241
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.420
Why is the black box in my pocket?
I don't know if it came out

242
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:47.684
[siren sound]

243

[Nayeon sniffles]

246

[sigh]

248
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.665
Are you Jaehwang’s brother?

249
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.543
[Sighing] Let’s hope something comes out.

250
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.004
[heavy music]

251
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:24.221
It's probably not suicide

252
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.264
I never said it was suicide

253
00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.310
I think the result will be suicide.

254
00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.062
Although it is a suicide under the circumstances

255
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.481
The autopsy procedure must be completed
It becomes clear

256
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.650
[cell phone vibrating sound]

uh

(Detective Shin) Team leader
I found Deputy Director Kang’s car.

259
00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:42.989
It was on the banks of Yangje Stream.

260
00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.783
Detective Park went to check the CCTV.

261
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:45.867
What is the condition of the car?

262
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:49.162
Some of the car windows are broken
The black box is completely torn apart.

263

black box

264
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.459
Just look at the state of the car
Under the circumstances, it seems like he was kidnapped.

265
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.421
(Dohan) For now, don’t let it be known to the outside world.
The search begins with internal personnel.

266
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.882
At the police box near Yangje
We ask for your cooperation in finding the missing person.

(Detective Shin) Did something come out?

271
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.681
(Police 1) Nothing has come out yet.

272
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.811
Deputy Director Kang kidnapped you? To whom?

273
00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.439
No way...

I worked

[Jaehwang’s heavy breathing]
[dark music]

281
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:16.124
(Jae Hwang) Due to a moment of anger
I committed a sin that cannot be washed away

282
00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:20.712
To the bereaved families who suffered because of me

283
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.964
I apologize.

284
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.093
I will pay for this sin with my death.

285

(Woman 6) What is it?
Shouldn’t that person be picked up?

290
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.910
(Man) Are you crazy? I know what kind of person you are

291
00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.537
Let's report it to the police.

292
00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.956

(Police 2) Please confirm your identity.

yes

297
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:33.243
Oh, that’s Magangcheong
I heard you are the deputy director, is that correct?

298
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.120
(Policeman 2) Oh, wallet and all.
Well, what can confirm your identity?

299
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.371

Is that right, really?

302
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.918
(Police 2) Hey, but

303
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:46.214
But you didn't tell me
Why is the conductor on the national highway...

304
00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.134
Regardless of whether it is a misdemeanor or not
It was very dangerous

312
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.915
(Jonghoon) I barely escaped from Jeong Jae-hwang.

313
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.626
(Dohan) Tell me later.

314
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:24.794
(Nayeon) Is it true?

315
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.299
Really Jeong Jae-Hwang
Did you kidnap Deputy Director Kang?

316
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.550
Why are you here?

317
00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.178
I came to find Jeong Jae-hwang.
Nayeon Cheon as well

318
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.096
So did you find it?

319

Already dead when found

(Jonghun) No, where did you find my car?

326
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.502
Have you been looking for me all this time?

327
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.796
No formal investigation has been filed.

328
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.724

You have the same thoughts as me right now, right?

332

What do you mean?

333
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:50.713
‘They say Jeong Jae-hwang was found dead.
'They don't ask how he died'

334
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.841
That's what you thought, right?

335
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.511
I didn't think so.

(Jonghoon) I barely escaped from Jeong Jae-hwang.

340
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.633
(Dohan) As a result,
What did Jeong Jae-hwang get?

341
00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.637
Personal revenge, retribution?

342
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.309
But why did you save the conductor?

343
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:52.483
(Detective Park) I went.

344
00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:56.404
(Detective Shin) How are you feeling, Deputy Chief?

345
00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:58.072
(Detective Park) You’re feeling better now.

346
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.575
Even in hospitals
They said there was nothing wrong.

347
00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.160
You're going to work tomorrow

348
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.829
A report on the results of the investigation
They asked me to wait until two days later.

349
00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.539
(Detective Shin) That quickly?

350
00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.917
(Detective Park) This case
You probably want to sort it out quickly.

351
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.043
Don't you think so?

352
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.253
Even kidnapped by a criminal
I almost died from it

353
00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.131
(Detective Shin) Oh, that
I have to write, tsk, stress.

354
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:19.093
But the criminal kidnapped the conductor.
I really don't understand.

355
00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.262
(Detective Shin) In charge of the case at that time
You used to be a detective, right?

356
00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.306
The complainant has a grudge against us.
What, once or twice?

357
00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.475
No, it's gritty.

358
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.143
(Detective Park) What is this, pooping?
I feel like I didn't clean it

359
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.227
I have a bad feeling

360
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.939
[dark music]
(Detective Shin) I-C, Drupguro.
Are you talking about poop? Tsk

361
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:34.275
All three cases were committed by Jeong Jae-hwang alone.
We can organize it, right?

362
00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:36.110
Let’s look at the autopsy results.

363
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:38.947
You contacted Jeong Jae-hwang’s mother, right?

364
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.282
(Detective Shin) Yes, you arrived a little while ago.

365
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.953
[heavy music]

366
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:57.340
[The Emperor’s mother sobs]

367
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:04.973
Jaehwang!

368
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.557
(Jae-hwang’s mother) Mom is here, Jae-hwang.

369
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.476
wake up

370
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.105
Mom is here, Jaehwang, mom is here...

371
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.237
[The emperor's mother cries]

372
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.495
[Sobbing]

373
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.503
[sniffles]

374
00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.349
[Continued sobbing]

375
00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.441
(Nayeon) When will this nightmare end?

376
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:02.822
(Nayeon) I’m sorry, mom, I’m sorry

377
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:08.619
My father died because of my mother's mistake.

378
00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.163
Our Nayeon too

379
00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:13.958
Dragging me into this nightmare

380
00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:17.628
I'm sorry

381
00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:23.593
Don't say that anymore, Mom.

382
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.812
[Bird chirping]

383
00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:38.816
(Anchor 2 in the news) Yangje-gun, Gangwon-do
In an abandoned house

384
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.360
The body of a man in his 30s was found.

385
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:45.239
[The door swings open]
According to the police, he committed suicide
This man, who is believed to have quit

386
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:48.868
[dark music]
City Councilor Park Kwang-shin, who recently took place
as a suspect in a murder case

387
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:51.329
It is reported that he was tracked

388
00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:55.374
Meanwhile, the police recently
Whether or not it is related to other murder cases

389
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.543
It is said to be under investigation.

390
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:01.964
(Byungjun) So

391
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:05.134
Where is Jaehwang’s funeral?

392
00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:08.554
(Yeon-gwang) [Sighing] The body is still there
I didn't get it, but

393
00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:14.644
The police need to complete the autopsy
They said they could hand over the body.

394
00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:16.562
(Reunion) Ah, you fool

395
00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:18.397
Why die?

396
00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:21.442
Are you dying because you did something wrong?

397
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:22.777
[Yeon-gwang and the sigh of reunion]

398
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:29.367
(Cheongju’s house) He’s truly a reigning emperor.
Was that what you were thinking about?

399
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:32.537
I shouldn't have told you in advance

400
00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:35.915
What if I said it? What changes?

401
00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:38.918
(Cheongju’s house) Ah, but
If we all acted together

402
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:40.711
It would have been a little less difficult...

403
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:41.879
That's it!

404
00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:45.967
Even if that idiot bastard dies, it's worth it.

405
00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:48.970
stop talking

406
00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:52.849
[Cheongju’s sigh]

407
00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:55.810
(Autopsy) Cause of death
Asphyxiation due to cervical compression

408
00:23:55.893 --> 00:23:59.689
And the line here causes
The scar marks end below your ears, right?

409
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.357
He died by hanging, right?

410
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.817
Is it suicide?

411
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.777
(Autopsy) No, on the cell phone
I heard there was a will too?

412
00:24:04.861 --> 00:24:06.195
There must also be forensic evidence.

413
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:07.363
[Autopsy doctor's faint smile]

414
00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:09.824
After all, I like things that are certain. What about our old version?

415
00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:12.410
It's been a long time since I became a police officer.

416
00:24:12.493 --> 00:24:14.745
(of autopsy) I know, I know
Our former team leader

417
00:24:14.829 --> 00:24:17.498
Look again at the scar marks here, isn’t it clean?

418
00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:21.085
Hanging on a rope until I lose my breath
It's proof that I waited patiently

419
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:23.462
In case of murder
Because the area around this scar is dirty.

420
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:26.007
Because I'm struggling to survive

421
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.135
And the fingerprints found on the string
Footprints found on a chair

422
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:30.761
Only suspects

423
00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:33.181
So it's suicide

424
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:34.807
But that's right

425
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.476
There are traces of bruises

426
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.520
That also happened right before I died.

427
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.609
Well, it's not a beating.
It was probably just a light fight.

428
00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:47.361
If it was a physical fight, then when the conductor was kidnapped...

429
00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:49.697
(Autopsy) Hmm? Kidnapping?

430
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.199
(Dohan) Oh, no.

431
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:57.580
I don't know what you're talking about
Because I have to judge based on the body alone.

432
00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:59.665
In my opinion as a forensic scientist,

433
00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:02.251
Asphyxiation certain, suicide certain.

434
00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:04.212
(Autopsy) Well, judging by the bruises

435
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.380
There was a slight struggle before death.

436
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:07.924
I'm here

437
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:09.884
Next is our old team leader.

438
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:15.139
(Jae Hwang) If you let me go, Deputy Director Kang.
[Dark sound effect]

439
00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:16.224
[Screaming scared]

440
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:18.351
(Jae Hwang) Are you telling the truth while reflecting?

441
00:25:24.065 --> 00:25:25.191
[Knocking sound]

442
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.568
[sigh]

443
00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:29.362
[Jonghoon slams the drawer shut]

444
00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:32.114
(Dohan) The autopsy results came out.

445
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.575
(Jonghun) Uh, what’s special about it?

446
00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:38.204
(Dohan) Before or after the kidnapping?
Was there a physical fight with Jeong Jae-hwang?

447
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:39.330
There was

448
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.833
(Dohan) Aside from the teacher’s mark on my neck,
They say there were bruises

449
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.879
I think there was a fight with the conductor.
Do you mind if I understand?

450
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.465
[dark music]

451
00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.803
(Sangdo) Don’t be too obsessed with Jeong Jae-hwang.

452
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:55.680
Committing murder now

453
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.140
It may not be Jeong Jae-hwang.

454
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.393
What's going on?

455
00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:01.519
I don't know either

456
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.521
me too

457
00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:04.814
(Dohan) Place of kidnapping

458
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:06.691
Are you still embarrassed to talk?

459
00:26:06.774 --> 00:26:08.901
Shouldn’t we at least check the CCTV?

460
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:11.529
I went there for personal business.

461
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:14.699
(Jong-Hoon) And a person as high as a deputy chief

462
00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:17.243
Kidnapped by a criminal
If it is known that you have been harmed

463
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:18.577
It looks so funny

464
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:21.497
(Dohan) I understand.

465
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.207
So these three murder cases

466
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:24.834
When the suspect dies

467
00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.545
With no right of prosecution
I'm trying to finish it

468
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:30.214
Good job, let's go

469
00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:37.847
(Jonghun) Why? Is there anything else you want to say?

470
00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:40.808
I gave my official opinion

471
00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:43.311
Now I will tell you my personal opinion.

472
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.648
(Dohan) This is also for the deputy director
I think you should know

473
00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:50.401
As a detective, I need to dig deeper.

474
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:54.280
As a lawyer, ‘This is enough.
'It's enough to just cover it up'

475
00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:57.408
That kind of judgment came out
It's about finishing it.

476
00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:00.161
What do you mean, that?

477
00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:05.041
(Dohan) The reason you put me in this case in the first place is

478
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.501
I wanted Goo Do-han, who was a lawyer.

479
00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:08.586
Isn't it?

480
00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:13.257
(Jonghun) We have to dig into it persistently.
You'll just have to roughly cover it up

481
00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:14.675
I'm good at distinguishing

482
00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.427
[Laughing] Don't you know?

483
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.305
The lawyer said that
They are specialized races

484
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:22.725
Well, you don't have to worry.

485
00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:24.852
(Dohan) Is it okay to do this?

486
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:32.151
If it ends like this
Is everyone happy?

487
00:27:38.449 --> 00:27:39.992
[siren sound]

488
00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:44.205
(Detective Park) This case also
It's organized like this

489
00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:45.498
It was tough, it was tough.

490
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:46.916
(Detective Shin) From the victims’ group

491
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:48.542
Even if he didn't appear at every murder scene.

492
00:27:48.626 --> 00:27:49.919
It would have been much easier

493
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.712
Mr. I, you properly caused confusion in the investigation.

494
00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:53.255
(Detective Park) So, Byungjun Lee is that person.

495
00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:55.091
For obstruction of investigation
It should have been thrown in.

496
00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:56.509
(Detective Shin) No more
Because there were no victims

497
00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:58.135
Fortunately, yes

498
00:27:58.219 --> 00:28:00.304
If Deputy Kang got hit too
Was it obvious?

499
00:28:00.388 --> 00:28:02.515
(Detective Park) Then the entire police
There's an uproar

500
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.060
Now only the investigation results report
Just write it and you're done.

501
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:07.186
have a hard time

502
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.396
(Detective Shin) [Sighing] Ah, yes.

503
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.398
(Dohan) Do you really think it’s the end?

504
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:12.441
(Detective Shin) Yes?

505
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:16.904
Be sure to write a report on the results of the investigation

506
00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:18.739
(Dohan) Senior, you are also doing the same.

507
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:20.408
These two people are different from me

508
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:22.284
Dig into any doubt until the end

509
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.495
have to prove

510
00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.497
Don't forget that you were born a detective.

511
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.290
(Detective Park) I understand.

512
00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:29.375
(Detective Shin) I understand.

513
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:35.923
[cell phone vibrating sound]

514
00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:47.768
yes

515
00:28:48.853 --> 00:28:50.813
You're not sorting out the case like this, are you?

516
00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:52.648
What more should I do?

517
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.817
We have to follow the traces of the suspect.

518
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.026
You're dead.

519
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.071
(Dohan) Due to the death of the suspect
It was processed as there was no right to prosecute.

520
00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:01.031
There's no reason to follow the trail

521
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:03.659
Kidnapped by Jeong Jae-hwang
There is also a statement from Deputy Director Kang.

522
00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:05.161
What about the evidence?

523
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:08.456
Proof that they were all done by Jeong Jae-hwang.
Is it enough?

524
00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.917
(Nayeon) Because I recognized it
Even if the suspect dies

525
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:14.795
There is clear evidence that he is the culprit.
It seemed like the principle was to secure it.

526
00:29:14.879 --> 00:29:16.505
Hey, are you a police officer?

527
00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:19.425
To cover up the incident like this
It was put in, right?

528
00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:22.970
(Nayeon) In the first place, Team Leader Koo’s role was
It was decided that way, right?

529
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:26.974
Don't pass it up.

530
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.476
(Nayeon) Well, it doesn’t matter anymore

531
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:31.562
If the police won't do it, I have to do it.

532
00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:32.938
Not once or twice

533
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:35.900
I'm going to follow Jaehwang's traces.

534
00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:38.736
What do you mean? What are you doing now?

535
00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:40.571
(Nayeon) Victim and fraudster

536
00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:43.908
Jaehwang's brother is released from prison
The person I went to meet

537
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.868
(Nayeon) Let’s figure it out from there.

538
00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.870
We were supposed to meet together

539
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.748
But the old team leader said the situation has changed.

540
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.625
I have to meet him alone.

541
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:55.169
Where are you now?

542
00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:57.963
[Call end sound]

543
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.090
[Dark sound effect]

544
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.391
(Employee) How did you come?

545
00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:11.435
(Nayeon) I came to meet the CEO.

546
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.811
(Employee) Did you promise?

547
00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:14.813
(Nayeon) My name is Nayeon Cheon
Just tell it to me.

548
00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:16.774
(Employee) Oh, yes, you are in a meeting right now.

549
00:30:16.857 --> 00:30:18.442
I'll guide you when it's finished.

550
00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:37.753
(Dohan) Don’t misunderstand.
came here

551
00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:40.172
not because of the evidence

552
00:30:40.256 --> 00:30:42.800
Na-yeon Cheon is useless.
I followed you because I was afraid you might get stirred up.

553
00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:45.678
(Nayeon) Um, did you come to keep an eye on me?

554
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:48.514
Then go back

555
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:50.349
Because it’s still not too late

556
00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.352
[The door clicks open]
[Dajeong’s happy exclamation]

557
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:55.145
(affectionately) Oh my!

558
00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:57.022
Oh my god, who is this?

559
00:30:57.106 --> 00:30:58.524
[affectionate laughter]

560
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:00.943
- It's been a while.
- (Sweet) Yes, Nayeon.

561
00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:04.947
(Sweet) Oh my, she’s such a baby
I see today that it’s time to get married?

562
00:31:06.532 --> 00:31:08.659
[Small] Who are you? Maybe a boyfriend?

563
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:09.785
(Dohan) I...

564
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:11.912
This is the team leader who rescued Kang Su-dae.

565
00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:16.875
(Dajeong) What are you? Why do you have police around?

566
00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:21.130
Jaehwang oppa was here, right?

567
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.048
Jaehwang? Jaehwang Jeong?

568
00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:26.927
-Why him?
- (Dohan) I will ask.

569
00:31:27.428 --> 00:31:29.096
(Do-han) You met Jeong Jae-hwang, right?

570
00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:30.889
I don't remember much

571
00:31:30.973 --> 00:31:32.850
You know it's our job

572
00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.352
(affectionately) the original person
Since we meet a lot,

573
00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:38.397
Before I came here, I had a prison visitation record.
I did some searching

574
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.066
(Do-han) Mr. Han Da-jeong
Jaehwang Jeong, one month before his release from prison

575
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.651
There is a record of the visit.

576
00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:44.069
According to Jaehwang’s mother,

577
00:31:44.153 --> 00:31:46.363
After being released from prison, I met Han Da-jeong.
We were supposed to meet

578
00:31:46.447 --> 00:31:48.699
(affectionately) Ah, I remember now

579
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.701
That Jeong Jae-hwang?

580
00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:52.161
[laughter]

581
00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:56.206
After Jaehwang is released from prison
I asked you to do some work together, I

582
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.666
As you know

583
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.586
This thing is
You need a lot of trustworthy people.

584
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.379
You said you wanted to do multi-step work together?

585
00:32:02.463 --> 00:32:05.466
[Interesting music]
(affectionately) Ah, boy, it’s a multi-level scheme.

586
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:07.968
It's definitely a coin business, this is

587
00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:09.470
Don't you know the coin?

588
00:32:09.553 --> 00:32:11.930
These days, if you don't know coins, you're a fool.
[laughter]

589
00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:14.433
You will do it in multiple steps using coins.

590
00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:16.477
(Nayeon) Jeon
You are in the solar energy investment business.

591
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.728
You're so fashionable

592
00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:19.188
You have to be fast these days

593
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:22.066
(Dajeong) This market is also trendy
It changes so quickly

594
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:26.737
Well, in a few days we
We are holding a large coin investment briefing session.

595
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.821
You should come too

596
00:32:27.905 --> 00:32:28.947
[affectionate laughter]

597
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:30.324
[Dajeong’s surprised exclamation]

598
00:32:30.407 --> 00:32:32.201
What are you, how much does it cost?

599
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:36.288
(Dohan) Coins and solar energy
You make it very trendy.

600
00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:38.332
This one is broken
Will it be a 1 degree hit?

601
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.250
[Dajeong’s surprised exclamation]

602
00:32:40.334 --> 00:32:42.378
During the wellness boom, you also did health food, right?

603
00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.380
(Dajeong) How do you know that?

604
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:46.715
(Nayeon) Team leader Koo
[Dajeong’s surprised exclamation]

605
00:32:47.508 --> 00:32:48.801
(Dajeong) What are you doing?

606
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:50.010
Is it all about being a police officer?

607
00:32:50.094 --> 00:32:52.471
To a good businessman
What are you doing?

608
00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:54.223
[Nayeon’s sigh]
(Dohan) Goodness?

609
00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:55.349
(affectionately) Yes

610
00:32:58.268 --> 00:33:00.020
(Dohan) Your eyes, those eyes
[Interesting music]

611
00:33:00.104 --> 00:33:02.981
What? Eye color?

612
00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:05.025
(Dohan) I’m on the verge of passing now.

613
00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:08.028
What do you mean my eye color is beyond this?

614
00:33:08.112 --> 00:33:10.155
You have the eyes to go from a fraudster to a murderer.

615
00:33:10.364 --> 00:33:12.408
What are you talking about? unluckily

616
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.535
If you keep going like this, you'll cross that line

617
00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:17.579
Hey, even if I cheat
No murder, Mr.

618
00:33:17.663 --> 00:33:18.789
(affectionately) Everyone get out!

619
00:33:18.872 --> 00:33:19.957
see you later

620
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.291
(Nayeon) Wait a minute

621
00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:23.210
What did Jaehwang oppa say, so?

622
00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:26.797
(affectionately) I refuse
You cut off contact with me, is that okay?

623
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.090
Everyone get out!

624
00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:30.634

[screaming indignantly]

627
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.896
Those are the seeds

628
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.482
Ah, ah, what should I do with this?

629
00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:46.900
[Nayeon’s exasperated breathing]

630
00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:48.944
(Nayeon) Why did you do that?

631
00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:52.573
I saw it for the first time
Team leader Koo is so excited

632
00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:59.037
There wasn't much success.

633
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.457
I'm sorry, I asked you to come here for no reason.

634
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.583
It's a waste of time

635
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:04.793
Do you still believe the scammers?
Even after being treated like that?

636
00:34:04.877 --> 00:34:06.253
(Dohan) Cheon Na-yeon, are you stupid?

637
00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:09.298
It's a lie just by looking at it
Talking about Jeong Jae-Hwang

638
00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:16.096
[Sighing] That human
I also know someone

639
00:34:17.598 --> 00:34:19.224
That person may not remember me, but

640
00:34:19.308 --> 00:34:20.392
How do you know?

641
00:34:20.476 --> 00:34:23.479
Rather, that woman is the victim.
The word fraudster

642
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:25.272
tell me what that means

643
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.986
Not all victims are good people.

644
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:33.489
Hey, bitch, just snap this!

645
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:34.615
[People stop]

646
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:35.741
[Da-jeong’s angry breathing]
(Jae Hwang) Please stop.

647
00:34:37.618 --> 00:34:40.287
[Meaningful music]
What Noh Sang-cheon caught, that was all wrong.

648
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.998
(Dajeong) I can’t trust the police, I can’t trust anyone.

649
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:47.878
Everyone takes care of the stolen money.
I have no choice but to make up for it.

650
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:51.799
(Nayeon) Because I was scammed
It's true that I was definitely harmed, but

651
00:34:51.882 --> 00:34:55.219
Even people
It doesn't mean I'm a good person.
[Dajeong persuades]

652
00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:56.553
And Han Da-jeong

653
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.097
I changed my name

654
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.183
Original name is Han Chun-ja

655
00:35:01.934 --> 00:35:03.268
(Nayeon) Do you know that?
[Dajeong explains]

656
00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:05.145
Among those who have suffered damage at multiple levels

657
00:35:05.229 --> 00:35:08.065
Someone who jumps into multi-level marketing again
The fact is that there are quite a few.

658
00:35:08.899 --> 00:35:10.943
I found out after being scammed.

659
00:35:11.819 --> 00:35:14.571
'If you start before others
'You can make money'
[affectionate laughter]

660

I'm that famous

661
00:35:16.824 --> 00:35:19.868
I am a victim of the Noh Sang-cheon fraud case.

662
00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:21.286
[People's surprised exclamations]

663
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.997
But this business is different

664
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:25.332
Network business...

665
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:27.334
[Dajeong continues explaining]
(Nayeon) That’s what a Ponzi scheme is like.

666
00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:32.256
People who started late get paid
Giving money to the person who started first

667
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.551
By creating a completely new multi-level

668
00:35:35.634 --> 00:35:38.303
faster than anyone else
I became a fraudster.

669
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:41.682
That way you can
Making up for the money that was scammed

670
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.809
Justifying yourself

671
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:48.814
Increasingly, in that black swamp
I fall deep

672
00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:52.651
Now on my face
A new stigma is created

673
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.238
(Nayeon) You’re a fraud

What kind of idiot

They say it's Gu Do-han.

678
00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:21.013
No, specifically to investigate.
It didn't seem like it came out.

679
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.059
But really to me
You're not going to be harmed, right?

680
00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:27.895
I did what I was told.

681
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:29.521
But

682
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.318
Why did Jaehwang commit suicide...

It's not like that

689

(Dajeong) You said you wanted to farm when you get out of prison.

690
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:05.057

i want to help you

[Sighing] Well, but

694
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:15.400
Even if I think about our old days
You can't do this.

695
00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:17.986
(Jae Hwang) This is Noh Sang-cheon’s scam.
What's different?

(Sweet) And is that the list?
I heard I'm in on something too

698
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:27.412

You shouldn't do that either.

Did you catch the culprit?

717
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:49.494
In the past, that person, Han Chun-ja,
He was a relevant person.

718

I think I got the answer

00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:58.670
(Dohan) Other than that, on the topic
Since I'm out of the way, I have no obligation to answer.

722
00:38:58.754 --> 00:39:01.923
Rather, do you remember the Song Young-jin incident?

723
00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:05.177
Ordered from a Chinese restaurant
They deliberately made the body be discovered.

724
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:07.137
It was like that

725
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.430
Isn't it similar?

726
00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:15.020
(Dohan) I sent a courier to Jeong Jae-hwang.
What I discovered on purpose

727
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.981
That's

728

to find myself dead

729
00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:23.570
(Nayeon) Isn’t that something you do yourself?

730
00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:26.281
Even if you die there, no one will know

731
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.951
He committed suicide by hanging his mother.
You want me to find your own body?

732
00:39:32.037 --> 00:39:34.206
Mr. Jeong Jae-hwang like that
Isn't that a bad thing?

733
00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:37.584
I thought a lot about mom

734
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:40.629
When I think of my mother who is left alone

735
00:39:41.254 --> 00:39:43.632
I'm not the kind of person who would commit suicide in the first place.

736
00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:45.592
Han Da-jeong, that woman

737
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.553
It was clear that he had a certain role.

738
00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:51.098
(Dohan) Ha, I’m hiding it.

739
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:52.682
What on earth is that?

740
00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:59.272
How did the case end?
Does that sound like a no?

742

I don't think we'll be able to talk for long

743

Yeah, well, it just takes a moment.

744
00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:14.538
By the way, do you know Jeong So-ram?

745
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.164
Jeong So-ram?

746
00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:20.085

(Jonghoon) Um...

749
00:40:23.088 --> 00:40:25.799
Then recently, separately, like this
You've never contacted me?

750
00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.551
Well, I don't remember

751

For what reason?

Do you know Noh Sang-cheon?

753
00:40:31.805 --> 00:40:35.517
It's Nosangcheon
Well, I think I've heard of it.

754
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.727
Well, it hasn't become much of an issue yet.

755
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:40.564
(Jonghoon) He, for fraud.
He's a wanted person right now.

756
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:42.983
But Jeong So-ram worked at Noh Sang-cheon’s company.

757
00:40:43.066 --> 00:40:44.943
He was working as a key executive.

(Jong Hoon) This is Jeong So-ram’s call log.

765

What are you doing now?

771
00:41:13.013 --> 00:41:14.055
yes?

772
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:15.307
(Vocal cords) It’s quite unpleasant.

773
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.768
What do Jeong So-ram and I do?
Are you saying it could be an affair?

774
00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:20.687
No, well, I don't mean that at all.

775
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.608
Ha, I even pulled up the call history.
It's obvious when you see it coming

776

779
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:33.617
Is it possible for Ms. Jeong So-ram?
I wonder if you know my whereabouts...

Don't think about getting involved.

That Noh Sang-cheon relationship is an internal affair.

853
00:46:40.256 --> 00:46:42.300
Secretary Jeong, you are not rusty.

854
00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:46.054
It's the same skill as hitting me in the back.

855
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.639
That's an old story.

00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:50.058

(Vocal cords) What's so important about that?

871
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:25.093
There must be something more important than that.

873

I'm an acquaintance
