(Jonghoon) So
Where did you come from?

38
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.733

And the former team leader did not cover up the incident.
So, that punishment!

Wasn’t that what Deputy Kang wanted too?

48

The old team leader is falling further behind anyway.
There's nothing to come out of.

49
00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:57.761
Because it all ended with Jeong Jae-hwang’s death.

From the beginning I
I told you clearly

It's a Korean language problem, huh?

96
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.659

The victims' claims

530
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.348
Doesn’t that mean No Sang-cheon is alive?

00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:02.070
- (Jonghoon) Where?
- (Detective Jeong) Jeong Jae-hwang

869
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:04.614
(Detective Jeong) Well, Noh Sang-cheon is the attendant.
You said you killed him and got caught.

870
00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.783
(Jonghoon) Deputy Director
They say don't go, never

871
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:09.035
If even a murder case gets involved with us,
It's a pain in the ass

872
00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:12.330
(Detective Jeong) [Sighing] Going
It's really weird, I don't understand

873
00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:15.416
When Jeong Jae-hwang looks at Geumma’s face,
Oh, he seems nice.

874
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:17.544
(Detective Jeong) Brother
Hey, talk nonsense and pile it up

875
00:47:17.794 --> 00:47:19.295
Have you seen that the murderers are good?

876
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:21.798
(Detective Jeong) Well, well, I see
Well, I thought it was accidental

877
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:23.716
It's unfair on Geumma's part, man.

878
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.801
You're still young, right?

879
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:26.135
(Detective 6) That’s right.
[Detective Jeong’s sigh]

880
00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:27.804
(Detective Cho) What’s right, you bastard?

881
00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:30.139
(Jonghun) Anyway, I told you not to go.
Eat rice, rice

882
00:47:30.223 --> 00:47:32.433
[cell phone ringing sound]
Just find out what we can do

883
00:47:33.226 --> 00:47:34.727
You should try it, just be quiet for a moment

884
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.938
Yes, this is Kang Jong-hoon.

885
00:47:37.272 --> 00:47:40.233
(Attorney) Hello.
I am the legal representative of VIXX Network.

886
00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:43.403
[Meaningful music]
Hello?

887
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:45.029
Talk to me, I'm listening

888
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:48.700
(Attorney) Hey, with Captain Kang.
I have something important to discuss with you.

889
00:47:49.117 --> 00:47:50.577
When do you have time?

890
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.412
Well, how did you get my number?

891
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.665
(Lawyer) Well, the important thing is
I don't think so

892
00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:57.834
Let’s have a quick meeting.

893
00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:00.587
Meeting with detectives from other branches
Because I finished it all

894
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.215
Captain Kang, at your convenience.
I will definitely match it

895
00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:05.592
It's good right now

896
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.851
[A siren rings in the distance]

897
00:48:22.025 --> 00:48:23.026
(Dohan) I’m here

898
00:48:28.448 --> 00:48:29.490
[Jonghun’s refreshing sound]

899
00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.492
Try it, this place is delicious

900
00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:35.747
Yes, wow, how did you know?
It was hard to find here.

901
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:40.710
This is where I often came when I was on set.

902
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.211
[Response]

903
00:48:42.295 --> 00:48:44.714
(Jonghun) In the past few days
It reminded me of this house a lot.

904
00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:48.092
You were in the storm
[Jonghoon’s laughter]

905
00:48:48.593 --> 00:48:51.763
Still, I have to go to work starting tomorrow.
I received a call from the office

906
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:55.933
Yes, reinstatement
I was thinking of trading my resignation.

907
00:48:56.476 --> 00:48:58.770
(Jonghoon) The biggest reason why I volunteered for the briefing

908
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:02.523
But if he resigns

909
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:06.277
'Cause I'm not a police officer
We can't investigate any further.

910
00:49:06.486 --> 00:49:08.112
So I couldn't resign.

911
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.781
Yes?

912
00:49:10.573 --> 00:49:11.949
[Jonghun’s refreshing sound]

913
00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:14.702
I'll try it again, again

914
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:16.829
To properly investigate

915
00:49:18.831 --> 00:49:21.959
This time I'm going to open it instead of covering it.

916
00:49:22.168 --> 00:49:23.878
Whatever sticks out inside it

917
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:26.297
(Jonghun) Let’s start by looking for the people who kidnapped me

918
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:28.091
I plan to work backwards from there.

919
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.968
Didn't you say it was Jeong Jae-hwang?
the kidnapper

920
00:49:31.052 --> 00:49:33.346
[Meaningful music]

921
00:49:34.764 --> 00:49:36.015
[Jonghoon’s scared voice]

922
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.645
(Jonghun) Into the mountains
It's true that I was taken away

923
00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:45.650
After walking for a while, I stopped and
Jaehwang said

924
00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:47.235
(Jae Hwang) I’m tired

925
00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:51.155
There's no hope anymore

926
00:49:52.782 --> 00:49:54.325
If you release me, Deputy Kang.

927
00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:57.662
Are you reflecting on the truth?

928
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.956
(Jonghun) [Crying] Yes, yes, yes

929
00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:01.624
[Sobbing]

930
00:50:02.709 --> 00:50:05.378
[in a scared voice] I'm sorry
I, I

931
00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:07.422
I'm sorry

932
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.590
(Jonghun) I’m trying to save you.

933
00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:12.176
Then let's do as we're told, as we're told.

934
00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:14.470
So no questions asked

935
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:17.890
I did what I was told, that's how I survived.

936
00:50:17.974 --> 00:50:18.975
No

937
00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:21.686
That's why I survived

938
00:50:23.146 --> 00:50:24.939
Because Jeong Jae-hwang wasn’t there.

939
00:50:25.022 --> 00:50:26.858
You said Jae-Hwang Jeong said it.

940
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:28.234
The voice is right

941
00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:30.778
But I couldn't hear any breathing.

942
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.489
[Jonghoon’s groans of difficulty]
(Jonghun) I had a hard time climbing the mountain.

943
00:50:34.157 --> 00:50:36.367
Of course while you're at it
I didn't say a word

944
00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:41.038
Is it the kidnappers or me?
My breathing became rough.

945
00:50:41.289 --> 00:50:44.125
But when I got to that place
Before I can catch my breath

946
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:46.627
[Jonghoon’s scared voice]
I heard Jaehwang’s voice.

947
00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:49.547
There is no sound of heavy breathing mixed in at all.

948
00:50:50.173 --> 00:50:52.216
- Calm voice
- (Dohan) Then...

949
00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:53.426
It's a recorded sound

950
00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:55.386
[dark music]

951
00:50:58.598 --> 00:51:00.183
(Jae-Hwang in the recording) [Crying]
I'm going to die

952
00:51:02.185 --> 00:51:03.770
If you release me, Deputy Kang.

953
00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:05.521
Are you reflecting on the truth?

954
00:51:05.605 --> 00:51:07.440
(Jonghun) [Crying] Yes, yes, yes

955
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:08.858
(Re-hwang in the recording) Up to 1,000
After counting out loud

956
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:10.526
go up there

957
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.111
will be watching

958
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:14.614
[Sobbing]
(Jonghun) ‘Wow, these bastards’

959
00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:16.532
‘You’re doing this on purpose.’

960
00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:21.496
'Jaehwang is not the culprit.
It doesn't matter if I know'

961
00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:23.498
(Jonghoon) ‘This is how we become Jeong Jae-hwang’

962
00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:26.626
‘Just like you kidnapped Kang Jong-hoon.
'I'm going to put on a show'

963
00:51:27.126 --> 00:51:30.797
'You shut up and tell Jeong Jae-hwang
'Like I was kidnapped and came back'

964
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.507
‘Just stay still’

965
00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:34.926
‘You’re threatening me like this.’

966
00:51:35.468 --> 00:51:36.886
I knew then

967
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:40.765
Jaehwang is responsible for all of this.
That I'm not the culprit

968
00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:43.768
They must have been forced to record it.

969
00:51:45.603 --> 00:51:48.356
[Sighing] But this is so embarrassing

970
00:51:49.148 --> 00:51:50.483
i was scared

971
00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:52.902
It was scary

972
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:57.406
I do that anytime too
That it can be handled easily

973
00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:01.536
So, you kidnapped the conductor.

974
00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:05.289
Give me fear and tell me to cover it up quietly

975
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:08.668
(Dohan) It was done by Jeong Jae-hwang.
Finish the murder case

976
00:52:08.876 --> 00:52:10.586
That's what you were trying to solve.

977
00:52:12.839 --> 00:52:15.383
And that's really how it worked out

978
00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:17.468

(Dohan) What are you going to do now?

987
00:52:37.697 --> 00:52:38.906
(Jonghoon) I have to look back.

988
00:52:39.949 --> 00:52:41.492
