00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.815
Jang Kang-chun, where is Jang Kang-chun?

34
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:47.900
- I don't know, that kind of person.
- (Sangcheon) I thought you would say you didn’t know.

35
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:50.778
But what, with someone I don’t know
Why are we taking pictures together, damn it!

36
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:51.946
What are you doing!

37
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.531
(Vocal cord) Do we have to keep seeing things like this?

38
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.032
(Gwangshin) Sorry
I'll sort it out right away.

39
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.368

[Sangcheon’s heavy breathing]

44
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.333
They're all part of the same group, huh?

45
00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:07.211
Give me the photo

(Vocal cords) Oh, hey, teacher.

53
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:23.185
My job is to be a member of the National Assembly.

54
00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.521
Ultimately, it is a place to meet people.

55
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.398
When I meet this person or that person

56
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.360
Everyone says it's a celebration or something.
I put one photo at a time.

I

58

What are you doing?

60
00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:38.033
Do you think you'll remember it all?

61
00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:40.870
Man, I remember
You'll take care of all the paperwork!

62
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:42.913
(Vocal cords) I am like that
You said you would do it?

63
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.040
Are you sure that was the case?

64
00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:46.458
tell me exactly

65
00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:49.670
A guy who doesn't even know who he is
Did I say I did it?

66
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.131
[Meaningful music]
(Youngjin) I am with this person.

67
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.716
Because we are friendly and friendly people

68
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.051
Geumma is me, exactly.

69
00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.178
What I pointed out and talked about was
No, but fuck it!

70
00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.722
Anyway, you took a picture!

71
00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.516
(Vocal cords) It's so fucking bad, you crazy bastard.

72
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:04.977
Oh, get me a glass of water.

73
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.396
Have you ever met?

74
00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.648
You know this man, right? uh?

75
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.279
(성대) 이봐요

76
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.781
당신이 이 사람한테
사기를 당했건 뭘 했건

77
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.075
난 모르는 일이고 알 바도 아닙니다

78
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.953
사기꾼한테 투자를 했다가
사기를 당했으면

79
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.372
경찰서로 가셔야지

80
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:28.375
내가 경찰서에 갈 시간이 없어서

81
00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.836
니가 제일 잘 아니까
니한테 왔지, 새끼야!

82
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.463
(Detective 1) This is the police.

83
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:34.840
Oh my

84
00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.301
Rep. Kim, what's going on?

85
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.719
(Vocal chords) You came at the right time.

86
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:42.723
[Interesting music]
This person is a member of the National Assembly
I came here to terrorize you

87
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.266
Terrorism?

88
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.607
[Siren sounds]
[The interrogation room is noisy]

89
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:55.027
Hey, listen carefully, yeah

90
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.987
I was scammed and the person...

91
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.073
(Detective 1) With National Assembly member Kim Seong-dae
We are close friends

92
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.449
We were working together?

93
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.117
That's right, that's right, yes, write

94
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.577
Ah, that's why I went looking for it.

95
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:04.828
Well, it's a terrorist thing...

96
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.038
(Detective 1) Mr. Noh Sang-cheon

97
00:04:06.622 --> 00:04:10.000
They say you were scammed
To someone who is Jang Kang-chun or something.

98
00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:13.253
But that person said
Do you still believe it that way?

99
00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.840
[Knocking] You’re a fraud.
Literally a fraudster

100
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.426
Is there any proof that these two people know each other?

101
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.096
You said it was evidence.
Yes, I'm telling you

102
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:25.265
Well, there are some strange parts.

103
00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.518
- Well, then Rep. Kim Seong-dae...
- (Detective 1) That’s it.

104
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.771
I keep being deceived like you
Because there are people

105
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.356
Fraudsters aren't going away

106
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.607
(Detective 1) [Laughing] Isn’t that right?

107
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:35.609
(Detective 2) The one who suffers is a life-saving rescue worker.

108
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:36.902
(Detective 1) So

109
00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:38.112
Nursing care device?

110
00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:40.322
fool?

111
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.782
No...
[Excited sound]

112
00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:44.785
Is that what you say to the victim?

113
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.870
You bastards

114
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.956
This guy is real
You're not crazy, man.

115
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.208
(Sangcheon) Yes, I’m crazy too
Jumping up and down, huh?

116
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.419
Hey, they are talking to me
It's called nursing care equipment.

117
00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.170
I told them
Why are you calling me Jjabari, huh?

118
00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:58.507
[Detective 1’s exasperated breathing]
What? Are you saying you were scammed because you were deceived?

119
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.134
So there's nothing wrong with the cheater, right?

120
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:01.760
I did everything wrong, I

121
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.095
If I go out and cheat now

122
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.139
Then there is nothing wrong with me, right? Not guilty, huh?

123
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.891
Hey, nigga

124
00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:09.852
Did you take money from Jang Kang-chun and stay there?

125
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.937
Or him, that bastard Kim Seong-dae

126
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:13.647
Um, did you get a few pennies for sucking it up?

127
00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:15.065
[Thumping the desk] Hey, No Sang-cheon!

128
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.153
(Detective 1) You bastard
Gangsters are subject to special management?

129
00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.947
Hey, that won't work.
Throw this bastard in a holding cell.

130
00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.323
Look for something to tie in with.
[Interesting music]

131
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:25.117
Something will come out, huh?

132
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.285
[Embarrassed sound]

133
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.369
[Sound of strength]

134
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.871
Huh? Look at this guy?

135
00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.582
Uh, really, what, what at home, what
I guess it's real, huh?

136
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.960
What is it, hemp? incarceration?

137
00:05:35.044 --> 00:05:36.128
Ah

138
00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.047
Private loan ledger?

139
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.882
What kind of private loan, hemp...

140
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.010
That's an illegal search.

141
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.345
(Detective 1) Yes, it is illegal if there is nothing.

142
00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:47.848
But if something comes out

143
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:49.808
It's legal, you bastard.

144
00:05:50.142 --> 00:05:51.143
Oh, I'm hungry

145
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.311
[groans with difficulty]

146
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.271
Let's eat and eat, um.

147
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.106
[breathes and then exhales]

148
00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.568
(Detective 1) Mr. Noh Sang-cheon

149
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:01.695
Mr. Noh Sang-cheon

150
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:03.739
Come out

151
00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:06.325
[Sangcheon’s strengthening sound]

152
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.371
(Gwangshin) Did you do some reflection?

153
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:12.873
[The door slams shut]

154
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.000
[clunking sound]
I'll stop by with the congressman sometime soon.

155
00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:16.543
Hey, you're welcome anytime

156
00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:18.212
Okay, let's go.

157
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.339
(Detective 1) Yes, then take a look.

158
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.551
What are you doing? Go quickly

159
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.847
(Sangcheon) Mr...

160
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.058
[Siren sounds]

161
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.189
[The refreshing sound of Gwangshin]

162
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.608
(Gwangshin) Are you curious? Why did you take it out?

163
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.402
I've been scammed too, before.

164
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:45.531
My friend said I could make a lot of money.
Stop rattling

165
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.366
Oh my, if I think about it now

166
00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.660
There were more than one or two things that were sloppy.

167
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.120
It's just my tail

168
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.204
[Gwangshin's faint laughter]

169
00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:56.291
Honestly, Mr.
I believe it has been criminally processed.

170
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:58.335
(Gwangshin) Oh, wait a minute.

171

344
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.531
As damage from the incident is reported nationwide,

345
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:29.160
We carefully consider the importance of this incident.
Investigation is underway

346
00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.039
Noh Sang-cheon, Chairman of VIXX Network

347
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:34.916
Currently in hiding

348
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.586
(Jonghoon) Legal departure procedures
Because everything is blocked

349
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.338
It was discovered that they were attempting to smuggle.

350
00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.342
Therefore, the police mobilize all their capabilities to

351
00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.720
We are tracking Noh Sang-cheon's whereabouts.

352
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.722
We will definitely arrest you

353
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.765
That's it.

354
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.602
(Reporter 3) I have a question.

355
00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.146
Did you not catch it or did you not catch it?

356
00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.107
I'll ask you again

357
00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:02.152
Did you not catch Noh Sang-cheon?
You didn't catch it?

358
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.278
(Dohan) Deputy Director

359
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.822
Deputy Chief, Deputy Chief

360
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.032
(Jonghoon) Yes, huh?

361
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.992
(Dohan) Why are you sleeping here?
Leave the sofa

362
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.661
[sigh]

363
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.413
Did you get some sleep?

364
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:14.581
(Dohan) Yes, roughly.

365
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:17.459
Well, the first incident.
Did you say Gyeongcheon?

366
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.502
Could you please give me the contact information for your investigation team?

367
00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.757
(Jonghoon) I will handle that matter.
you don't care

368
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.219
Song Young-jin and focus only on this case.

369
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.307
Moreover, this victim
You're a current city council member.

370
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.558
Have you seen the news?

371
00:15:33.642 --> 00:15:35.852
It only came out about the murder of a city council member.

372
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.938
(Dohan) What is serial murder?
There is nothing related to Noh Sang-cheon.

373
00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.733
Reporters are not there yet
You don't know

374
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.361
(Jonghun) I’m glad

375
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.368
The conductor is a serial murderer.
Do you want to stop it?

376
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.245
Noh Sang-cheon is the suspect.
Do you want to stop it?

377
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.247
[Meaningful music]
(Dohan) Or else

378
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.916
both

379
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.171
The only chain pattern of these events is
This is Noh Sang-cheon.

380
00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.548
The fact that Noh Sang-cheon is a keyword

381
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.467
Does the conductor also acknowledge that?

382
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.011
yes

383
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.514
I will only share it internally

384
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.475
Noh Sang-cheon was involved.
Because it is also a confidential investigation.

385
00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:16.643
[sigh]

386
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.020
(Jonghoon) Here

387
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.233
first homicide report

388
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.694
I received it after requesting it from their investigation team.

389
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:29.781
A note saying it was Noh Sang-cheon’s doing.
The only thing they have in common is that they were there.

390
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.574
There was no report to the center.

391
00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:33.827
I will review it

392
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.204
Why aren't the suspects interrogated yet?

393
00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.415
Yes, we are checking some evidence first.

394
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:42.168
The testimony is unreliable
Because the evidence is trustworthy.

395
00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.636
[Moon So-ri]
[light sigh]

396
00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.475
(Detective Park) Isn’t this really strange?

397
00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.353
As you said, just look at the time.
It doesn't match up

398
00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.607
[dark music]
[Dohan’s light sigh]

399
00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.820
The time when office workers leave work
Around 7pm

400
00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.741
(Dohan) Cheon Na-yeon arrived at 8 p.m.

401
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:17.162
Estimated time of death: 7 to 8 p.m.

402
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.542
The employee leaves work and goes to Park Kwang-shin's office.
The only person who entered

403
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.752
Byeongjun Lee

404
00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.086
[sigh]

405
00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.005
If Lee Byung-jun is the culprit

406
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.591
The reporting time should have been this time.

407
00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.888
Case filing time

408
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.600
Lee Byung-jun goes to the office
I mean before I go in.

409
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.020
[Sighing] The time is not right

410
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.733
Because there may be other suspects.

411
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.652
Check again the nearby CCTV
All the way to the parking lot

412
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.362
Cell phone forensic results of two people
What happened?

413
00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:52.530
(Detective Shin) We need more time.

414
00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.365
Please send it to me as soon as it is confirmed.

415
00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:57.243
First, bring Cheon Na-yeon to the interrogation room.

416
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.871
(Detective Park) [Sighing] Because of that,
I think it's gotten more complicated

417
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:03.416
Oh my, sir, I was arrested right on the spot.
Why do I feel so uncomfortable?

418
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.043
[Detective Park’s disapproving comments]

419
00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.022
[The door slams shut]

420
00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:36.658
[heavy music]
(Dohan) Last night, City Councilor Park Kwang-shin
Why did you go to the office?

421
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.745
I told you
I went there for reporting purposes.

422
00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.456
Recently, Rep. Park Kwang-shin
About municipal administration activities

423
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.999
Are you asking me to believe that now?

424
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.211
(Byungjun) Whether you believe it or not
Detective, you are free to do that.

425
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.589
I told you

426
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.884
I told Congressman Park that our organization
I went there to ask for support.

427
00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:56.594
When I left, he was dead.

428
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.389
What appears at every crime scene
How are you going to explain it?

429
00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:02.100
(Do-han) Is Lee Byeong-jun the envoy?
Are you the grim reaper?

430
00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.061
(Nayeon) Uncle Byeongjun
I don't know if it's a reaper or not

431
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.564
I went to the city councilman's office.

432
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.525
It just happened to come out from there.
I just ran into you

433
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.070
I was so surprised that my clothes were covered in blood.

434
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:17.448
So, when I arrived at the scene,

435
00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.617
You mean Mr. Park Gwang-shin was already dead?

436
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:20.827
(Byungjun) That’s right.

437
00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.204
blood on clothes

438
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.790
I buried it while trying to give first aid.

439
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.917
What exactly do victims' groups do?

440
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.711
(Nayeon) It has nothing to do with this incident.

441
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.337
(Byungjun) I’m looking for that bastard Noh Sangcheon.

442
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.214
And get the damage refunded.

443
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.633
[Nayeon’s sigh]
that's our job

444
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.176
now incident

445
00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:40.555
It has nothing to do with your group?
[dark music]

446
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.684
The case itself is a victim group.
What does it matter?

447
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.436
What do you want to say?

448
00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.854
It has nothing to do with it

449
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.480
Don't get involved for nothing.

450
00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.399
(Byungjun) These people are already having a hard time

451
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.445
It has nothing to do with the incident.

452
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.448
(Dohan) Yes, I understand.

453
00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.076
The interrogation of Na-yeon Cheon
Let's end it here.

454
00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.828
Are you going to issue an arrest warrant?

455
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.748
Otherwise, please send it to me

456
00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:09.000
I have to take care of my mom too

457
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.877
(Dohan) Hey, Nayeon Cheon.

458
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.880
Na-yeon Cheon’s 48 hours after her arrest were
It's police time

459

Regardless of restraint

[Dohan’s light sigh]

461
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.427
There are still thirty-one hours left.

[Notification sound]
(Investigator 1) [Sighing] It's over.

[Investigator 2 sighs]

464
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.896
(Investigator 2) Oh, stop for a second.

This...

From the text message from this number
Search and categorize them all.

[cell phone vibrating sound]

470
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.411
(Detective Park) Did something come out?

471
00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.206
(Investigator 2) Yes, right now.
I'll send it to Detective Park's phone.

472
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.332
check it out

[Microphone operation sound]
Team leader, please come out for a moment.

476
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:13.982
(Detective Park) Look here.

[Dohan’s light sigh]

480
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.647
(Dohan) What has been stated so far
Is it all true?

481
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.566
Nayeon Cheon’s statement
It's not much different

482
00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.192
Because they're both innocent.

483
00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:01.070
Without any suspicion
Nayeon Cheon will be kicked out.

484
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:02.238
Of course it is

485
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.908
And Lee Byung-jun
I'll let you go as soon as the interrogation is over.

486
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:08.661
(Byungjun) Yes?

487
00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.038
Why am I so fast...

488
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.707
You're not the criminal anyway.
They say I'm innocent

489
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.584
Still, you need to do your research properly.

490
00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.294
(Byungjun) From the beginning
Have you seen the criminal who admits it?

491
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:19.088
Whether I am a criminal or not
It's natural to deny it.

492
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:25.011
You're interfering with the investigation.

493
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:26.596
[heavy music]
[Dohan’s incredulous breathing]

494
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.600
Nothing is right
Except for being caught on the spot.

495
00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:32.518
(Dohan) The more attention is paid to you,

496
00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:35.438
Time to catch the real culprit
It's being wasted

497
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.482
So you should disappear first

498
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.692
The time is not right

499
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.486
and

500
00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:43.279
[clattering sound]

501
00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:45.948
Lee Byung-jun's text message has been restored.

502
00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:49.410
You know, right? text message you received

503
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:52.413
According to the instructions, at that time and place

504
00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.415
It went according to plan.

505
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.593
(Dohan) This text message
We'll start by looking for the sender.

506
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.180
That person must be the real culprit

507
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.142
Just wait and the detectives will guide you.

508
00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:15.728
(Byungjun) Oh, really...

509
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:17.230
Does it really end like this?

510
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:18.731
Just get out?

511
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:20.274
I was caught in the act?

512
00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:21.484
[Byungjun’s nervous breathing]

513
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:24.737
(Dohan) I just told you
So stop it

514
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.865
We will ask later whether you were an accomplice or not.

515
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:29.784
After the real culprit was arrested

516
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:32.161
i did it

517
00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:33.663
[nervous music]
(Byungjun) I

518
00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:43.131
Park Gwang-shin, I killed him.

519
00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:45.925
There's something wrong with the time in that photo.

520
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.427
Text doesn't matter either
Someone was just playing a joke

521
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:55.560
i murdered

522
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.480
This is a confession

523
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:14.203
(Nayeon) Why are you here?
Not the interrogation room again.

524
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.291
(Dohan) They said it had nothing to do with the incident.

525
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:21.919
The interrogation room is only for relevant people.
Aren’t you going?
[Vending machine operating sound]

526
00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:24.630
(Nayeon) If you don’t want to leave a record
Don't even ask questions in the first place.

527
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.594
After the interrogation of Lee Byeong-jun is over,

528
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:32.471
(Dohan) To Nayeon Cheon
I thought something curious would come up

529
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.893
(Nayeon) So you came out?

530
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.820
[Meaningful music]

531
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:53.910
Who sent it?

532
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.579
When it's revealed who it is
Please tell me too.

533
00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.164
the person who sent the text

534
00:24:58.247 --> 00:25:00.208
Because I want to know as much as the team leader.

535
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:02.668
Did you receive instructions via text? murder?

536
00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:04.629
[Laughing] What is murder?

537
00:25:04.712 --> 00:25:07.798
(Dohan) Then what is it?
Please be honest.

538
00:25:07.882 --> 00:25:10.259
With this, both of you
There may be an arrest warrant issued.

539
00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:13.054
Does that prove I'm a murderer?

540
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.181
Just spam texts like this?

541
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.769
How are my eyes?

542
00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:23.064
Now I feel like a murderer
Can you see it?

543
00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:29.528
(Dohan) No, you are not

544
00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.949
You don't look like someone who would kill

545
00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:35.243
(Nayeon) I’m glad
You're still seeing it right

546
00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:37.370
But I look like a jerk

547
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.373
Could be used by a murderer

548
00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:44.126
(Dohan) Why?

549
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:46.504
Why are you pretending like you did?

550
00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:48.631
who is this? who is behind you

551
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:50.049
I've never made it up

552
00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:54.720
(Do-han) Lee Byung-jun is not even a criminal.
Arrested on the spot.

553
00:25:54.804 --> 00:25:58.766
I wondered why that was so
I just can't figure out why

554
00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:00.851
But after seeing this text, I became convinced.

555
00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:03.312
You, especially Lee Byung-jun

556
00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:05.856
You're interfering with the investigation.

557
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.651
As if he was framed as a prime suspect.

558
00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:09.777
And another one

559
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.446
Byung-Jun Lee claimed innocence.

560
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.490
They said they would send me away right away, so I confessed.

561
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.075
He said he committed murder

562
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:19.745
You confessed?

563
00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:21.664
In my opinion, it's a false confession

564
00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:23.416
(Dohan) Why?

565
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.376
Why are you doing this?

566
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.423
Hey, Nayeon Cheon.

567
00:26:31.007 --> 00:26:33.592
A warrant for Lee Byung-jun's arrest will now be issued.

568
00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:34.719
When it goes to the prosecution

569
00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:36.929
How will things progress from then on?
no one knows

570
00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.848
You could be accused of being a real murderer.

571
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:40.141
Because of the confession

572
00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:44.061
Earlier, the victims' group
I asked what they were doing?

573
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:49.400
[heavy music]

574
00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:54.405
Conversely, I ask

575
00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:58.326
The police said before this incident
Were you even interested in us?

576
00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:00.536
(Nayeon) In our voices
Have you ever listened?

577
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:01.996
Why are you questioning me about that?

578
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:05.624
Because I'm an accomplice
Because even you police officers are accomplices!

579
00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:08.377
You saved Noh Sang-cheon's life.
Because we killed it!

580
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.921
Look, I don't know about that.

581
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:12.506
I just need to catch the murderer.

582
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.966
[Nayeon’s exasperated breathing]
(Dohan) That’s my job

583
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.469
Whether you get scammed or not
I'm not interested

584
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:19.305
What I'm curious about is
Why are you doing this play?

585
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:21.432
Who sent this text message?

586
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:22.558
That's it

587
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.060
I told you earlier

588
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.229
If you reveal who the sender is

589
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:29.023
Please tell me too

590
00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:31.108
(Nayeon) All I can say is
This is it

591
00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:33.402
(Dohan) Why are you doing this?
[Nayeon’s sigh]

592
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.490
A play like this in front of a murder case
What is the reason for doing this?

593
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:38.657
[Nayeon’s laughter]

594
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:46.749
Is it a play or is it truth?

595
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.170
Byeongjun confessed?

596
00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:54.173
Then maybe he really did it.

597
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.842
I don't know anymore

598
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.264
(Byungjun) I killed him.

599
00:28:03.808 --> 00:28:05.267
This is a confession

600
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:08.437
(Dohan) Because I’m trying to send you out
The statement has changed

601
00:28:08.813 --> 00:28:11.107
It's clear that they're trying to block the investigation.

602
00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:12.650
Why?

603
00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:14.777
[Sound of approaching footsteps]
(Detective Park) Team Leader

604
00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:17.738
I tracked the group text message.
It was also sent from Daepo Phone.

605
00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:19.156
Now the number itself has been discarded.

606
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:20.491
Where is it? base station

607
00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:21.951
That's it

608
00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.452
(Detective Park) Last message
The base station that sent

609
00:28:23.536 --> 00:28:24.995
Park Kwang-shin's office is nearby.

610
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:26.956
Go there in advance
Looks like I was stuck

611
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:30.960
At that time, Detective Shin
I was following you

612
00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:32.920
Of course it's not Lee Byung-jun.

613
00:28:33.003 --> 00:28:34.296
[cell phone vibrating sound]

614
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:41.512
(Jonghoon) Um...

615
00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:43.722
Because Lee Byung-jun confessed

616
00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:45.349
Apply for an arrest warrant

617
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:46.684
I don't think there's a warrant.

618
00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:49.770
What isn't it?
I saw all the confessions.

619
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:52.440
He's just pretending he did it, Byungjun Lee.

620
00:28:52.523 --> 00:28:53.732
Why do you call yourself the culprit?

621
00:28:53.816 --> 00:28:55.317
There must be some purpose.

622
00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:56.944
There are some things that are expected

623
00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.448
(Jonghun) So? Well, what are you going to do?

624
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:02.867
(Dohan) If there is no proper evidence,
I have to release it.

625
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:04.201
Just like last time, I'm following you

626
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.787
Hey, for letting me go last time.
I wish I had made that mistake

627
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.497
Why are you releasing the guy who confessed again?

628
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:12.126
It must be revealed that Lee Byung-jun is not the criminal.
You can go to the next step

629
00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:13.294
What do you mean?

630
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.046
I'm going to visit Gyeongcheon.

631
00:29:16.505 --> 00:29:18.966
[Sighing] Well, I gave you all the reports.

632
00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:20.509
That's enough, whatever

633
00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:21.635
Nothing special

634
00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:23.721
(Dohan) Even identifying the victim
I haven't been able to do it before

635
00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:25.639
I need to check the correlation.

636
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:28.684
Because the detectives over there are investigating.
Anything will come out

637
00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:31.645
Don't bother trespassing in other people's territory.

638
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:34.773
It's its own territory
Did you at least pee?

639
00:29:34.857 --> 00:29:37.151
It's important to catch the murderer now.
That area...

640
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.821
No, really, what's wrong with the police?

641
00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:42.698
You a cop now too, nigga

642
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.492
(Jong Hoon) And Song Young-jin and Park Kwang-shin

643
00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:46.827
These two things alone are too much.
Why go there?

644
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:48.829
Why are you opposing everything?

645
00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:50.539
Is it an indelible stigma?

646
00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:52.583
What about the Noh Sang-cheon case that you were in charge of?

647
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:54.627
[heavy music]

648
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.633
When did you find out?

649
00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:02.676
[Sighs] Does that matter now?

650
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.012
You knew Byungjun Lee to begin with, right?

651
00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:06.805
(Dohan) The victim of that incident
There's no way you don't know

652
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:07.932
[light sigh]

653
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:10.935
Like Byungjun Lee is a person who would commit murder.
Can you see it, conductor?

654
00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:13.103
The motive for the murder is numerous, well.

655
00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:15.648
I am a victim of the Noh Sang-cheon incident.

656
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.734
[cell phone vibrating sound]

657
00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:22.947
yes

658
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.698
(Detective Park) Lee Byung-jun
An arrest warrant was executed.

659
00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:25.908
The prosecution has now taken him away.

660
00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.117
(Dohan) Yes?

661
00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:29.036
[nervous music]
(Detective Park) The prosecutor is investigating and
I came here in person

662
00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:31.038
[Call end sound]

663
00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:32.665
What happened?

664
00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:34.917
(Dohan) I didn’t even apply.
There's an arrest warrant out.

665
00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:37.711
[Sighing] Last time
I guess they recycled it or something.

666
00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:39.547
Make sense.

667
00:30:40.089 --> 00:30:41.507
Did the conductor request this?

668
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:43.092
That's good

669
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.219
(Jonghoon) Now the prosecution
You can proceed on your own

670
00:30:56.105 --> 00:30:58.315
(Dohan) Now Lee Byungjun
Erase it from the list of suspects

671
00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.402
As I said earlier
Thoroughly investigate again from the scene.

672
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:04.738
Lee Byung-jun was arrested at the scene.

673
00:31:04.822 --> 00:31:06.490
They couldn't even search the building thoroughly.

674
00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:08.367
I missed the basic investigation manual.

675
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:12.162
Even inside the car in the underground parking lot
I should have just brushed it off, Mr.

676
00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:16.125
From now on, Lee Byung-jun
We have more evidence that this is not the case.

677
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:19.128
Then the real culprit will appear in the end.

678
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.088
What should I do with Nayeon Cheon? Are you sending it out?

679
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:23.549
Since I have time, I'll leave it at that for now.

680
00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:24.800
(Dohan) Me, more than that

681
00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.844
I need to go somewhere urgently
By the way

682
00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:28.095
Senior, please lead the way.

683
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:29.305
Where are you going?

684
00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.766
There is a place the conductor told me not to go.

685
00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:34.810
(Detective Park) Yes?

686
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.312
[siren sound]

687
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:40.941
[dark music]
[breathes and then exhales]

688
00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:48.407
[Call connection tone]

689
00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:52.578
[Guide voice] Customer is now
I don't answer the phone

690
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.001
(Jonghun) I went to someone else’s territory for no reason
Don't bother me

691
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.254
[heavy music]

692
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.884
(Dohan) This guy is the culprit.

693
00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:08.761
This bastard killed my sister!

694
00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:10.846
(Detective 3) Oh, you said you were a lawyer.

695
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:14.933
Ah, but why do the police keep
It's a mess, even meddling with what I'm doing.

696
00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:17.394
We'll take care of it
You mind your own business.

697
00:32:43.754 --> 00:32:45.381
(Jonghun) Why aren’t you answering the phone?

698
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:51.136
The reason I didn’t answer the phone first was
Wasn’t it Deputy Kang this morning?

699
00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.098
(Jonghun) So right away
Do you have an arrest warrant?

700
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.475
I told you to wait a moment

701
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:58.519
(Sangdo) Let’s sit down first.

702
00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:02.022
By the way

703
00:33:02.815 --> 00:33:04.817
It’s been a while since Deputy Kang looked so excited, huh?

704
00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:07.945
They came here a long time ago
What do you think of at times like that?

705
00:33:10.572 --> 00:33:13.450
After sitting in the conductor's seat,
I feel like I'm seeing this for the first time

706
00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:15.035
look excited

707
00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:18.288
At least in front of me

708
00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:21.083
[Sighing] I'm sorry.

709
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.057
(Dohan) I don’t have much to live for.

710
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.852
Who cleaned it up?

711
00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:42.271
(Detective 4) No
It is as it was at the time of the incident.

712
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.856
You lived without a washing machine?

713
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:45.941
(Dohan) Was it a temporary residence?

714
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.987
The body was found here?

715
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.197
(Detective 4) Yes, because I was tied to a chair.

716
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.867
At first I thought it was some pervert thing.

717
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.453
But there were no signs of sexual assault.

718
00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:59.413
There was just one strange thing

719
00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.206
[dark music]

720
00:34:02.416 --> 00:34:05.544
[camera shutter sound]
On the table where the woman died
There was a note

721
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:08.839
(Detective 4) ‘Please save me.
Noh Sang-cheon is trying to kill me’?

722
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:10.174
Noh Sangcheon?

723
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.800
(Detective 5) Noh Sang-cheon
I don't know what kind of kid he is

724
00:34:11.884 --> 00:34:13.302
That guy must be the culprit.

725
00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:14.762
It's simple, this case

726
00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:18.599
(Detective 4) But like that
It wasn't simple

727
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:21.477
No, there are no fingerprints on the body.
Does it make sense to have nothing?

728
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.811
Is it a ghost or what?

729
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:24.062
Oh, I need to know the identity of the body.

730
00:34:24.146 --> 00:34:26.732
Among those acquaintances
I will either find Noh Sang-cheon or not.

731
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.108
Tsk, IC.

732
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:30.569
(Detective 5) You found it.

733
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.237
People with the same name as Noh Sang-cheon

734
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:35.824
After researching
It's because they all have nothing to do with it.

735
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.330
Have you ever looked for other street streams?

736
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:43.499
(Detective 4) You mean another Noh Sang-cheon?

737
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:46.877
Oh no

738
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:49.922
Where is the victim's body now?

739
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:51.590
Have you checked the face of the corpse?

740
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:54.676
An unknown face, the first victim

741
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.638
It is not confirmed whether he is related to Noh Sang-cheon.

742
00:34:58.472 --> 00:34:59.973
Have you seen it yourself?

743
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:03.519
I only saw it in pictures

744
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:07.940
Obviously, in my investigation at the time,
This is a woman who never existed

745
00:35:10.484 --> 00:35:11.860
Let's see if there are any pictures

746
00:35:22.412 --> 00:35:23.956
I don't even know this person

747
00:35:34.842 --> 00:35:36.969
Anyone who knows this woman
No one?

748
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:39.555
(Detective 4) With your ID card
I found my family

749
00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.181
It was a woman reported missing.

750
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:43.225
The family directly confirmed that it was not the case.

751
00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:46.562
There was identity laundering.
As a missing woman

752
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:47.980
(Detective 4) That is highly likely.

753
00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:50.023
Since there are no fingerprints, identification is impossible.

754
00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:51.900
So is there no progress?

755
00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:53.443
It's been a month

756
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:56.280
[Excited laughter]
No, if you know anything
Please share

757
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:58.657
Surely without anything
You wouldn't have come down.

758
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.409
If I know anything, I'll contact you.

759
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:07.916
(Detective 4) You’ve come a long way.

760
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.836
What if there is no progress?

761
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:12.421
(Dohan) Hey...

762
00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:17.175
Please look at this picture.

763
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.514
(Detective 4) Oh, more than that.
What does the other nosangcheon mean?

764
00:36:22.598 --> 00:36:25.392
You said that earlier.
Have you looked for other road streams?

765
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:28.979
Boy, there needs to be some back and forth.
Isn’t that assumed?

766
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:33.108
Nosangcheondo with resident registration canceled
I asked if you had looked for it.

767
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.192
(Detective 4) Yes?

768
00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:36.528
(Detective 5) If resident registration is cancelled.

769
00:36:37.112 --> 00:36:38.614
Are you talking about a dead person?

770
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:40.449
Dead Noh Sang-cheon?

771
00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:44.536
No, the dead person
How do you become a suspect?

772
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.121
I'm curious about that too

773
00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.498
Please check.

774
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.377
(Detective 4) Oh, this is your first time seeing this face?

775
00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.046
Have you seen Detective Choi?

776
00:36:54.463 --> 00:36:56.214
Write, I don’t know.

777
00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:02.095
Oh, on the nearby CCTV
This person has never been filmed?

778
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:03.597
Yes, estimated time of killing back and forth.

779
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.849
People coming in and out of the officetel
I researched everything

780
00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:07.559
(Detective 4) I don’t remember that face.

781
00:37:09.269 --> 00:37:11.229
(Detective 5) Let’s take a look at this.

782
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:14.608
Among them, the identity is still
These are unidentified people

783
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:25.702
[Tense sound effect]

784
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:31.708
Noh Sang-cheon

785
00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:35.337
Are you sure he's dead?

786
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.922
[Meaningful music]

787
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:39.716
Is what I know true?

788
00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:43.178
[laughter]

789
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:46.223
Now, what does it matter?

790
00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:49.267
(Sangdo) For the sake of the deputy director’s peace of mind
think

791
00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:54.439
Well, I have my next schedule.
Let’s just wrap this up.

792
00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:06.201
When is this an enemy?

793
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:09.955
(Detective 5) That's...
This was taken a few days after the incident.

794
00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:13.083
(Detective 4) Who is it?
Who is so surprised?

795
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.585
This is Deputy Director, our office.

796
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:16.712
Yes?

797
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:20.799
Hey, when did you come to the scene?
Without any contact?

798
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.635
Didn’t you recognize the conductor’s face?

799
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:27.180
Oh, that, the report problem
I made a few phone calls

800
00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:28.974
(Detective 4) Because I couldn’t meet you in person...

801
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:31.309
(Detective 5) Ah, then I guess I should delete this.

802
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:33.645
[Mobile phone operation sound]
It makes no sense that the deputy chief is a suspect.

803
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.111
(Dohan) Don’t delete it yet.

804
00:38:46.616 --> 00:38:49.077
(Deputy Director Seo) Are you crazy?
But are you going to directly question the prosecutor?

805
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:52.914
That's the worst of all time
That's not what you did, you bastard.

806
00:38:52.998 --> 00:38:54.249
(Jonghun) Oh, I don’t know about that.

807
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:56.126
I came to the prosecutor's office first.

808
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:57.252
I'll hang up

809
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.675
(Sangdo) This is Director Park Sang-do of the Eastern Branch.

810
00:39:03.759 --> 00:39:05.927
Noh Sang-cheon We are investigating.

811
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:07.012
Yes?

812
00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:10.307
(Sangdo) Prosecutors are investigating now
You're in the way, so get out.

813
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.516
(Sangdo) You understand, right?

814
00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:13.894
[sigh]

815
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.646
(Jonghun) I missed everything I caught.

816
00:39:19.649 --> 00:39:20.692
(Prosecutor's Office Employee) Come in.

817
00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:27.532
(Sangdo) What's going on?

818
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.956
(Jonghoon) The person I spoke to is

819
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.542
Is this Prosecutor Park Sang-do?
I came to check

820
00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:40.045
Be sure to come and confirm that
You don't have to.

821
00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:42.005
Tell me the real reason you came here.

822
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:44.091
Why did you tell me to let Noh Sang-cheon go?

823
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:48.220
Yes, the prosecution is investigating, Noh Sang-cheon.

824
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.554
So why?

825
00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:52.516
A simple fraudster
Why are prosecutors investigating?

826
00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:56.978
Scale of road fraud
How much did you understand?

827
00:39:57.062 --> 00:39:58.105
About tens of billions

828
00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:59.898
All I know is that it's pretty big.

829
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:03.318
Oh, you figured out tens of billions?

830
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:04.444
(top coat) barely

831
00:40:05.195 --> 00:40:06.238
Yes?

832
00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:10.117
Yeah, well, that's a big deal.

833
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.870
(Sangdo) But Noh Sangcheon was the only one
I haven't finished it all

834
00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:17.415
We all have information
I threw the bait

835
00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:19.459
Yeah, well, it's good, it's all good.

836
00:40:19.543 --> 00:40:21.461
Shouldn't we catch it first?

837
00:40:21.545 --> 00:40:23.839
Do you think that if you just catch Noh Sang-man, it's over?

838
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:26.716
Do you think everything will be resolved?
[heavy music]

839
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.635
(Sangdo) So the police

840
00:40:28.718 --> 00:40:30.846
If Noh Sang-cheon is arrested,
What do you plan to do?

841
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:33.265
Well, because there are victims who have filed complaints.

842
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:36.810
Investigate and return the money
We must enforce the law appropriately.

843
00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:41.189
Ah, our detective is so naive.

844
00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:45.110
(Sangdo) Noh Sang-cheon
Are you admitting that you committed fraud?

845
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.695
It must have been an investment concept?

846
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.113
What about money?

847
00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:51.158
The fraudsters are in control
Did you see he had money?

848
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:54.452
I'm a fraud who kept it quiet
I don't think I've ever seen it before

849
00:40:54.536 --> 00:40:56.913
Well then, the victims
Keep waiting?

850
00:40:58.165 --> 00:40:59.875
Is this your first time investigating?

851
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:03.086
Some sacrifice is inevitable

852
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.046
When the case is solved

853
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.716
(top coat) to some extent
You will be compensated

854
00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:10.385
I have the next schedule.
Let’s just wrap this up.

855
00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:24.566
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, why are you doing this?

856
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.945
Oh, raise your heads

857
00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:31.406
[The door clicks open]
Oh, what, what, have we committed a mortal sin?

858
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.909
Oh, raise your head
[Cheongju’s sigh]

859
00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:35.035
I'm so happy

860
00:41:36.161 --> 00:41:37.204
Hey, bitch

861
00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:39.080
(Woman) Where are you coming from?
[Yeon-Gwang’s embarrassed sound]

862
00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.540
(Nayeon) Why are you doing that!

863
00:41:40.624 --> 00:41:42.083
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, let me say it in words.

864
00:41:42.167 --> 00:41:45.212
(Woman) What’s wrong?
Because of your mother, our whole family is ruined.

865
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:46.338
Just check this out!

866
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:47.422
[People stop]

867
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:48.715
(Man) Please stop.

868
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:49.841
We're all in the same situation here.

869
00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:51.676
Okay, stop.

870
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.553
(Byungjun) Do you think it would be easy for Nayeon to be her mother?

871
00:41:53.637 --> 00:41:55.096
You know, the situation in this house

872
00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:57.682
[Sobbing]

873
00:41:59.142 --> 00:42:00.727
(Woman) Baby, my money

874
00:42:01.478 --> 00:42:04.022
What should I do with my money?

875
00:42:04.105 --> 00:42:06.816
Oh my, it's money I've saved my whole life.

876
00:42:08.068 --> 00:42:11.947
If that bitch hadn't tried to convince me to invest

877
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.531
[heavy music]

878
00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:18.954
Because my husband died like that
I can't even say anything

879
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.538
[The woman sobs]

880
00:42:21.623 --> 00:42:22.624
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah-yu, a-yu, a-yu

881
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:25.502
Stop it, people here.
Everyone's situation is the same

882
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:28.088
Ah, calm down first, calm down.

883
00:42:34.052 --> 00:42:35.095
I...

884
00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:36.388
[The door slams shut]

885
00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:40.475
(Yeon-Gwang) Hey, Jae-Hwang.
Hey, tell the reporters to come in.

886
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.018
- (Jaehwang) Yes
- (Yeon-Gwang) Oh

887
00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:43.687
(Yeon-Gwang) Because of this incident,

888
00:42:44.104 --> 00:42:47.691
A pain that many people cannot forget

889
00:42:49.526 --> 00:42:53.238
Oh, the pain that can't be washed away
I'm going through it

890
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:56.157
It can happen to anyone

891
00:42:56.241 --> 00:43:00.161
This is an incident that can happen anywhere.

892
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.790
Ah, so our victims

893
00:43:04.124 --> 00:43:07.127
Through the rapid arrest of Noh Sang-cheon,

894
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.841
Please come to the rescue
I strongly request this.

895
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:17.304
Thank you for your help and interest.

896
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.309
All Vix Network victims

897
00:43:25.687 --> 00:43:26.896
thank you

898
00:43:29.149 --> 00:43:32.694
If you have any questions, I'd love to hear them

899
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.114
[Reporter 4’s light sigh]
(Reporter 4) Well, nothing much.

900
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.369
[Sigh of reunion]

901
00:43:43.038 --> 00:43:45.040
(Reporter 5) Only three people came...

902
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:48.918
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, me, me
Reporter, I, I...
[A woman's earnest voice]

903
00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:50.170
This, this, this, this

904
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.088
[It’s noisy outside]

905
00:43:52.172 --> 00:43:53.506
(Jae Hwang) You said Nayeon, right?

906
00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:55.967
(Reporter 4) Yes, don’t worry.
I'll write it for you

907
00:43:56.051 --> 00:43:58.386
- (Reporter 4) Hey, let’s go, let’s go
- (Reporter 5) Oh, yes, I will go.

908
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.554
- (Woman) Yes, yes, please...
- (Yeon-gwang) Now

909
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:00.972
(Reporter 6) Ah, ah
You can't do this, ah, yeah

910
00:44:01.056 --> 00:44:02.265
(Woman) Please take care of me

911
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:04.559
Oh my, my, thank you

912
00:44:05.018 --> 00:44:06.144
Oh my

913
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:07.604
I heard about it

914
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.983
I'm so sorry about what happened to you dad.

915
00:44:16.363 --> 00:44:17.697
(Jae Hwang) Mom must be having a hard time too.

916
00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:20.325
[Woman’s heavy moans]
Everyone here is like that

917
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:21.868
[heavy music]

918
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:24.162
I think it's hard because of the money I lost

919
00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:25.997
More than that, I feel sorry for my family.

920
00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:27.999
It hurts more

921
00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:32.629
Same goes for that lady.

922
00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:36.674
- (Woman) Eat some of that, okay?
- (Nayeon) Ah, yes

923
00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:38.009
(Jae Hwang) An article came out

924
00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:42.847
When people get interested
There will be some hope

925
00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:47.227
Let's cheer up a little more

926
00:44:48.937 --> 00:44:50.772
(Reunion) Wow, can this happen?

927
00:44:51.106 --> 00:44:52.899
Wow, really me!

928
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.359
[Angry breathing]

929
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:56.111
What is this, really!

930
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:58.696
Nothing came out! Mr.
[Cheongju’s surprised exclamation]

931
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:01.324
(Yeon-Gwang) No, really?

932
00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.869
(Woman) [surprised] Look, huh?

933
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.663
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, that can’t be possible.
[Cheongju’s embarrassed voice]

934
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:08.915
Oh, I'm Pozzi too
I stabbed him a little and did that.

935
00:45:08.998 --> 00:45:10.542
[Byungjun’s angry voice]
[People's surprised exclamations]

936
00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:11.626
(Byungjun) I knew it would be like this

937
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.962
I heard the reporters weren't that interested.

938
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.505
(Jae Hwang) They said it wouldn’t even be newsworthy.

939
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:18.007
(Reunion) What? Why isn’t this newsworthy?

940
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:20.552
(Yeon-Gwang) Hey, hey, Jaehwang
You should call the reporter.

941
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:22.470
(Cheongju’s house) Yes, yes, phone, phone
[Jae Hwang’s response]

942
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:27.976
[Call connection tone]

943
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.395
(Sangcheon) They are
What else is there to do?

944
00:45:30.478 --> 00:45:32.772
[Snoring] Just squirming.

945
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:37.152
Ah, you blocked the article this time.

946
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.403
thank you

947
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.407
Well, even though I can’t run ads for the time being.

948
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:46.494
Better things to come
Isn't there more?

949
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:50.248
Sure, that's right

950
00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:53.751
Please go in

951
00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:56.963
[Mobile phone operation sound]
Mr. Lee...

952
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:00.425
Oh, fuck you guys

953
00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.719
You're so condescending, Mr.

954
00:46:04.345 --> 00:46:05.346
Hey

955
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.891
I have a list here, so give it to me and throw it away.

956
00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:11.186
[Sangcheon’s Sigh]

957
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.938
[Sigh of Soram]

958
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:15.982
Hey, by the way

959
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:19.110
Why are our members so upset?

960
00:46:21.738 --> 00:46:24.782
No, the bastards who were as still as the body of a fool

961
00:46:25.492 --> 00:46:27.869
Why are you acting so hard?

962
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:31.748
When it becomes public opinion, they run away.
There's going to be trouble

963
00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.292
(Soram) The people who help us
I'm going to save myself

964
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.627
I know, I know

965
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:38.213
(Sangcheon) I, I
Don't you even know that much, shit

966
00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:41.257
Hey, by the way

967
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:45.595
Only these idiots
All you have to do is not run wild.

968
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.681
These bastards don’t even know fractions

969
00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:51.392
[dark music]

970
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:53.645
To stop running wild

971
00:46:54.521 --> 00:46:57.023
I have to take a picture from above and press it away.

972
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.527
Let's stay still

973
00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:18.169
I think I might come up with a better idea

974
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:31.891
yes

975
00:47:32.976 --> 00:47:34.102
(Yeon-Gwang) Ayu

976
00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:38.856
(Yeon-Gwang) I...
[Yeon-Gwang’s sound of strength]

977
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:42.277
(Jonghun) No, that’s not possible.

978
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.280
Investigation data cannot be shared
There are no more

979
00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:47.949
(Byungjun) What you’re having trouble with is
I know it well

980
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.868
We also have our own tracking team for Noh Sang-cheon.
I decided to organize...

981
00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:52.787
- (Jonghoon) Tracking team?
- (soft light) Yes

982
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:56.499
(Jonghun) No, some kind of western movie
It's not like taking pictures, it's about tracking people...

983
00:47:56.583 --> 00:47:57.834
So do we

984
00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:01.629
Because the prosecution is also moving.
There will be good results soon

985
00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:03.548
(Byungjun) Until now, you
What did you do?

986
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:08.219
Have you figured out how many victims there are?

987
00:48:09.387 --> 00:48:12.140
Or about this incident
Did you at least brief the press properly?

988
00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:14.350
- Please wait.
- Just wait!

989
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:18.521
(Byungjun) Meanwhile, the victims
It's getting more and more dry and dying.

990
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.941
police arrest

991
00:48:22.025 --> 00:48:23.735
Let's go in now.

992
00:48:24.944 --> 00:48:25.945
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, hey...

993
00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:28.781
(Byungjun) Just like you said
I'll watch to see if No Sang-cheon is caught.

994
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:32.118
I will watch till the end!

995
00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:39.584
[Byungjun’s sigh]

996
00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:43.296
(Reunion) No one helps us

997
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.923
Both the police and the media ignore us.

998
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.260
(Byungjun) I was scammed while trying to make some money.

999
00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:50.678
You guys are responsible.

1000
00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:52.096
(Yeon-Gwang) I, I, in other areas too

1001
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.766
Something like a victims’ group
It's being made

1002
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:56.601
This is how I connect with those people.

1003
00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:59.145
I think we need to be more proactive.

1004
00:48:59.228 --> 00:49:00.688
What can we do together?

1005
00:49:00.772 --> 00:49:02.440
Got information, got money?

1006
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:03.608
Who do you want to help you?

1007
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:06.986
[Woman's sigh]
What, are you talking so negatively?

1008
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.031
Ah, even just between us
If you work hard and actively

1009
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:12.492
Yes, there is sunlight in the mouse hole.

1010
00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:14.118
(Reunion) By the way, I...
[Yeon-kwang clicks his tongue]

1011

[dark music]

1012
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.627
(Yeon-Gwang) Isn’t that what it is?

1013
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.429
Why, who is here?

1014
00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:37.141
[Cheongju’s surprised exclamation]

1015
00:49:37.767 --> 00:49:39.352
- (Yeon-Gwang) No, I...
- (Cheongju’s house) I...

1016
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.187
(Cheongju’s house) That woman

1017
00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:47.735
I'm here to help

1018
00:49:49.112 --> 00:49:51.280
Nice to meet you, our members.

1019
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:04.419
[sigh]

1020
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:12.885
[Knocking sound]

1021
00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:17.640
[light sigh]

1022
00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.227
Why?

1023
00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:24.939
Maybe about a month ago
Have you ever been to Gyeongcheon?

1024
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:28.818
no

1025
00:50:29.402 --> 00:50:30.820
Is it really not there?

1026
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.072
Are you interrogating me now?

1027
00:50:33.781 --> 00:50:36.325
(Jonghun) If I have ever been there
What changes?

1028
00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:38.661
Depending on what answer you give

1029
00:50:40.413 --> 00:50:43.791
I'm so upset
I went down to Gyeongcheon and

1030
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.543
Is this what you mean by doing the best you can?

1031
00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:48.212
Well, you said you haven't figured out anything at all?

1032
00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:50.631
Byungjun Lee appears there.
I confirmed that it wasn't

1033
00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:53.301
Lee Byung-jun is now at the prosecution
It's a matter for you to take care of.

1034
00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:54.552
Criminal or not

1035
00:50:56.262 --> 00:50:58.431
no matter how much you say
There's no use arguing

1036
00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:01.559
If we remove Lee Byung-Jun from the list of suspects,

1037
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.353
(Dohan) A broader investigation is possible.

1038
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:07.857
without sanctuary

1039
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.776
[Meaningful music]

1040
00:51:13.196 --> 00:51:15.865
(Jonghoon) It’s me, Lee Byungjun or whoever it is.

1041
00:51:16.616 --> 00:51:20.286
You caught the criminal
If you stand in front of me, I will thank you.

1042
00:51:21.037 --> 00:51:22.288
Well, is there anything more to say?

1043
00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:24.165
I have to go out and see.

1044
00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:41.182
[sigh]

1045
00:51:58.074 --> 00:51:59.116
[unlock sound]

1046
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:28.062
It's been a while

1047
00:52:28.646 --> 00:52:31.190
I came here because I was being transported to the detention center.

1048
00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:34.986
At the police headquarters, I couldn't even see the nose removed.

1049
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.487
Actually

1050
00:52:37.446 --> 00:52:39.490
You must have been afraid of the gaze of your subordinates.

1051
00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:43.786
Why did you show up at every murder scene?

1052
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:46.539
I thought you told your subordinate everything.

1053
00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:48.332
Didn't you get the report?

1054
00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:49.417
Still

1055
00:52:49.959 --> 00:52:53.296
There's more I want to say between us
I wonder if there is

1056
00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:54.505
[Byungjun laughs]

1057
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:57.383
(Byungjun) What kind of relationship are you in? Between us

1058
00:52:57.884 --> 00:52:59.844
A nasty relationship from the past?

1059
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.097
[Byungjun sniffles]

1060
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:06.058
Hey, Deputy Director Kang Jong-hoon.

1061
00:53:06.142 --> 00:53:07.810
That's what I heard

1062
00:53:07.894 --> 00:53:10.563
You hope I'm the culprit
I know you want it, right?

1063
00:53:11.606 --> 00:53:13.691
Where are you pretending to be nice, you're out of luck

1064
00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:16.903
I don't think so, honestly.

1065
00:53:18.738 --> 00:53:20.990
I know you
I'm not that kind of person

1066
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.868
You're not that type of person?

1067
00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:26.746
Why do you think not?

1068
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:28.873
In the meantime, I realized what kind of person I had become.

1069
00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:33.628
People change as time goes by
Isn’t that more natural?

1070
00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:35.254
There are some things time cannot change.

1071
00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:36.672
[Thumping the desk] Why can't I change it?

1072
00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:37.798
[Sound of door rattling]

1073
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:40.676
[Rough breathing]
[heavy music]

1074
00:53:44.263 --> 00:53:47.099
you and me
Do you think we spent the same amount of time?

1075
00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:50.227
During that time you
He continued to get promoted and became assistant manager.

1076
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:52.772
Victims like me have bad credit.

1077
00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:54.815
The family is all scattered

1078
00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:56.651
(Byungjun) You can either live like a beggar and die of illness.

1079
00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:59.153
Some even committed suicide.

1080
00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:01.989
Then wouldn’t you think like that?

1081
00:54:02.073 --> 00:54:05.618
I should have killed them all then.

1082
00:54:15.795 --> 00:54:16.879
(Detective Park) Let’s go.

1083
00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:34.355
(Dohan) You worked hard

1084
00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:35.564
(Nayeon) Yes, yes

1085
00:54:36.148 --> 00:54:38.651
Our team leader is also being interrogated.
Thank you for your hard work

1086
00:54:38.734 --> 00:54:42.196
Because I didn’t complete 48 hours
I'm kind of thankful

1087
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:43.322
But

1088
00:54:44.323 --> 00:54:46.659
an innocent person
If you don't accuse me of being a criminal

1089
00:54:46.742 --> 00:54:48.285
I think I would be even more grateful.

1090
00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:50.538
I mean that innocent person.

1091
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:51.914
Byungjun Lee confessed

1092
00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:54.750
(Dohan) If he is really innocent

1093
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:56.877
An innocent person

1094
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:59.755
On behalf of the real murderer
I went to the detention center

1095
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.383
The murders will continue

1096
00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:07.096
If you are the real culprit

1097
00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:09.557
Who is the first victim?

1098
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:11.517
first

1099
00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:15.479
If it's the first one, Song Young-jin

1100
00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:19.400
(Dohan) What you want

1101
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.528
That's it, another murder

1102
00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.115
No, you

1103
00:55:26.198 --> 00:55:28.284
(Jonghoon) I hope you get out of the prosecution investigation well.

1104
00:55:34.623 --> 00:55:36.000
Let's borrow your ears

1105
00:55:41.297 --> 00:55:43.340
(Byungjun) It would be difficult if other people heard it

1106
00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:45.760
(Nayeon) But what is this scene now?

1107
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:48.637
Are you telling me to get out?
Or an extension of the interrogation?

1108
00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:51.515
You can go

1109
00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:52.600
(Nayeon) Then

1110
00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:56.937
What are you going to do now?

1111
00:55:57.438 --> 00:55:58.856
[Car starting sound]

1112
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:01.984
I should write an article about the murder of the city council member.

1113
00:56:02.068 --> 00:56:03.277
I'm one step late

1114
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.612
It has already been reported in the media

1115
00:56:04.695 --> 00:56:06.197
Is there something that hasn't been reported?

1116
00:56:07.323 --> 00:56:10.242
(Byungjun) Detective Kang in our memories
Because you came in person

1117
00:56:10.326 --> 00:56:12.036
I'm telling you specifically

1118
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.704
What do you mean?

1119
00:56:13.788 --> 00:56:14.997
first murder

1120

1122
00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:24.548
(Nayeon) It’s called serial murder

1123
00:56:24.632 --> 00:56:26.634
Noh Sang-cheon was mentioned.

1124
00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:28.969
Were those reported too?

1125
00:56:29.053 --> 00:56:30.971
[Interesting music]

1126
00:56:31.806 --> 00:56:33.390
(Dohan) Are you really going to write an article?

[Gear operation sound]

1128
00:56:35.226 --> 00:56:38.479
[Sighing] Noh Sang-cheon is a serial killer.

1129
00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.398
If you don't write an article using those sources,

1130
00:56:41.482 --> 00:56:43.317
Isn’t that a dereliction of duty?

1131
00:56:44.652 --> 00:56:45.694
(Nayeon) Isn’t that right?

1132
00:56:46.195 --> 00:56:48.906
