(fanaticism) Ah, yes, yes

17
00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:34.678
They said they would set up a net here.

18
00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:39.099
But are you going to kill Song Young-jin?

19

Ah, for the wealthy people here to make an annual salary of 100 million won

40
00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.854

Does that make sense?
[Sangcheon’s exhilarating sound]

(President Park) If you call, he will come right away.

61
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.397
If you call and say that a hogu has come over here,

62
00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:51.523
It's here before I hang up

63
00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:52.900
Is the method the same?

64
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.402
Well, in another branch
I sent you a magnet.

65
00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:57.821
Fuck, I'm moored in port
I need another investment.

66
00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.823
Fuck you, Boss Park, President Park.

67
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:01.825

(Sangcheon) Oh, to the head
Fuck you bastards full of shit

69
00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:07.873

Sorry for being late

75

Ah, the governor
He kept asking me to eat with him

76
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.152
My name is Michael Kim.

Who is the person next to you...

81

(President Park) Ah, here

82
00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.747
President Choi is an acquaintance from my hometown.

83
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.124
He said he wanted to invest together.

84
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.751
Oh, you're doing this again, again

85
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:55.587
(Youngjin) If you introduce it this way,
You know very well that it won't work.

86
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:56.714
[Embarrassed breathing]

87
00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.300
(Youngjin) [Laughing slightly] Oh, this is
With a small number of elites

88
00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:01.593
Because it's a private investment.

89
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:05.055
Okay, if you dip it in it,
How much will it cost?

90
00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.265
That's all I'll say

91
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.891
Yes?

92
00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:11.395
(President Park) Ah, here is President Choi.
You have a very impatient personality.

93
00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:12.896
[President Park’s laughter]

94
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.565
I explained it to you in advance.

95
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.899
Oh, how much did you explain?

96
00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:18.360
Tied to a container at Jangpo Port
Even magnets.

97
00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:20.070

98

(Youngjin) Hey, I hope you listened to the lecture.

102
00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.539
I guess you know the circumstances around here.

103
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.125
No problem with customs clearance documents?

104
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.377
[Laughing] Of course

105
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:37.880
I'm also on friendly terms with this person.

106
00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:39.798

Hey, where was the photo?

107
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.220
Oh, this picture.

108
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:48.515
No, but why is this there?

109
00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:52.102
Oh, anyway, in this picture
With Rep. Kim

110
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:54.146
I'm in a friendly relationship.

111
00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:58.609
(Sangcheon) I’m curious
You have to ask to use it.

112
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:02.821
Oh, by the way, Rep. Kim Seong-dae
We take care of all the documents

113
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.865
- (Sangcheon) Is that what you’re saying?
- (Youngjin) Oh, sure.

114
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.201
Yes?

115
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.994
No, that's exactly
Let's go over it.

116
00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.455
(Sangcheon) Oh, thank you
With our CEO Michael Kim

117
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:15.084
Rep. Kim Seong-dae here
Because we are friendly and friendly.

118
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.836
Oh, so our Representative Kim
It solves everything

119
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.046
Is that what you mean?

120
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:21.465
- No, sir.
- (President Park) Yes?

121
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.385
But is that Rep. Kim Seong-dae?
How do you know...

122
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:27.179
(Youngjin) This isn’t even a constituency.

123
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.680
[President Park’s embarrassed laughter]

124
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:31.767
(CEO Park) Ah, ah, that, that
Ah, that, that, write

125
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.103
Ah, that, that...

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.525
It's been a while

129
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.401
This is Noh Sang-cheon.

130
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:42.736
- Well, no...
- (Sangcheon) You were very surprised, right?

131
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.822
Hey, our boss again
It's been a while since I wanted to surprise you

132
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.615
I was a little nervous.

133
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.910
(Sangcheon) Boy, I don’t have any beard.
The weather is all cold, hey

134
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.830
Oh, and last time I invested 200 million

135
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:53.956
You called it 600 million

136
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.040
Sincerely
Uh, thank you.

137
00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:57.042
Ah, no, that was...

138
00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:59.211
Oh, and here's my friend

139
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:00.629
500 million?

140
00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:03.465
(Sang Cheon) So, 500 million is three times that.

141
00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:04.800
Ah, 1.5 billion

142
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:05.926
500 million?

143
00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:08.804
That's right, isn't it?

144
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:09.930
Ah, yes

145
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.226
That's three times the basic dividend, right?

146
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.769
Oh, that's...

147
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:16.895
Right?

148
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.564
[laughter]

149
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.107
(Sangcheon) My friend

150
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.859
Let's go check things out now.

151
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.402
[Jeongtae and Sangcheon’s laughter]

152
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.238
[President Park’s awkward laughter]

153
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:34.746
(Sangcheon) Listen carefully.

154
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.998
Trying to get my money that you stole from me

155
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.208
Because I brought the water bottle myself.
do well

156
00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:42.087
That bastard invested 500 million won, it’s only 500 million won

157
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.797
(Youngjin) No, he said he was a friend.

158
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.215
I like my friend, fuck.

159
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.842
(Sangcheon) Because of that bastard
I went to jail and came back

160
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.594
This is revenge, revenge

161
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:51.180
Pretending not to know and now
Oh, just peel it off and eat it.

162
00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:52.723
I'll give you a review

163
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:54.766
(Jeongtae) I’m also checking this.

164
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.934
No work?

165
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.229
(Youngjin) Ah, blah, blah, nothing
They're all the same magnets

166
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:00.439
[Youngjin’s surprised gasp]

167
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.484
(Sangcheon) Oh, fuck you guy
Did you know I would do that?

168
00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:06.987
I knew that would happen last night
Wow, you did some work in advance.

169
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.448
Oh, fuck you
That doesn't fit the scale.

170
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.574
I have a lot of doubts

171
00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.202
(Jeongtae) Wow, magnetic yoga is so herbal.

172
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.706
(Youngjin) You really came to catch me
Wasn't it?

173
00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.625
(Sangcheon) Fuck catching
I came to kill you

174
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.335
Oh, but it's like you
What would you do if you killed one?

175
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:23.128
- (Sangcheon) Do you want to go any further than the prison cell?
- (Youngjin) Right?

176
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.838
(Youngjin) It doesn’t mean anything.

177
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:26.673
I know because I experienced it myself.

178
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:29.134
It’s so easy to scam Korea, Mr.

179
00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:32.221
(Youngjin) Oh, so now?

180
00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:33.597
That's what the bastards did

181
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.058
The person who got hit is a nursing dog.
It's the fault of the person who was scammed

182
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.310
Baby, fuck
Then why can't I do it, huh?

183
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.895
This human being, Noh Sang-cheon,

184
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.396
[Youngjin’s heavy breathing]
[grabs it suddenly]

185
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.066
You made a great decision.
[Sangcheon’s disapproving voice]

186
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.192
Bravo!

187
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.487
(Youngjin) Ah, but this is a beard
It's dark and grows quickly.

188
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.448
(Sangcheon) Our hairy people
It will be restored to its original state in two days.

189
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.033
Oh, fuck, but it doesn't appear on my chest.

190
00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:57.120
Why are you procrastinating?

191
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.997
I'm going to soak it in a cool way and blow it.

192
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.082
[laughter]

193
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.875
[Interesting music]
[Laugh together]

194
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:04.336
(Youngjin) Oh, yeah

195
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.303
(Youngjin) Is this all cash?

196
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.013
(Jeongtae) Won’t Hyeonchal wake up?

197
00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:17.015
I also suck up the money from Zug Night...

198
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.476
No, I have to wash it.

199
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.812
(Youngjin) Yeah, but this

200
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.730
How do I get it all?
[Oncoming car engine sound]

201
00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:29.987
(Sangcheon) Now, this way too
Because it looks like a car has arrived

202
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.363
Let's move it
[light laughter]

203
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.952
[Car door slams shut]

204
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.954
(Jeongtae) Hey, move it.

205
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.080
- (Man 1) Yes
- (Man 2) Yes

206
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.047
(Jeongtae) President Song’s dick comes first

207
00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.176
IOU

208
00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.387
(Youngjin) Yes?

209
00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:59.016
Ah, no, if I write this down

210
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.059
I'm responsible for everything...

211
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:02.436
(Jeongtae) What’s wrong?

212
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.520
You’re saying you can’t do it?

213
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.605
It's a transaction where you put a lot of cash on the table.

214
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:06.773
Then what am I supposed to believe!

215
00:10:06.857 --> 00:10:08.150
(Sangcheon) Just write it down.

216
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.610
You're going to pay me three times anyway.

217
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.204
[Sound of running footsteps]

218
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.123
(Youngjin) Wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

219
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.458
(Gwangshin) Oh my, why, why!

220
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.251
(Youngjin) This money, this money
Where are you taking this?

221
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:27.336
(Gwangshin) Where are you talking about?

222
00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.046
Representative Song
Representative Kim's political funds
[Youngjin’s puzzled voice]

223
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.464
I heard you're donating?

224
00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.007
Me? No, when!

225
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.176
(Gwangshin) Ah, Rep. Kim
I heard you like it a lot.

226
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.553
Ah, let's eat sometime soon.

227
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.138
Rep. Kim lives there

228
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.389
[Youngjin sounds embarrassed]
[Laughter of fanaticism]

229
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.892
Ehe, indeed

230
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.149
(Sangcheon) Now, Choi Jeongtae received 500 million won in investment money.
[Interesting music]

231
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.651
The entire investment amount is from Rep. Kim.
donated political funds

232
00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:54.363
And on the IOU
Because our CEO Song signed it

233
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:55.781
It's all over now, huh?

234
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.991
Well, if there's a problem

235
00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.201
It’s all CEO Song’s fault

236
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:00.827
[laughter]

237
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.704
Ah, but what should I do with this?

238
00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:04.456
Do you know what Jeongtae Jumma’s nickname is?

239
00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.333
What is it?

240
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:07.459
human butcher

241
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.252
(Sangcheon) If you make a mistake
Just rip off the neck first.

242
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.629
[laughter]

243
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:12.798
Fucked.

244
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:14.257
I can't see, fuck

245
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.342
[Embarrassed sound]

246
00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.969
(Youngjin) Ah, ah, hey there
[Youngjin’s urgent breathing]

247
00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.763
What can I do, yes?

248
00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:22.682
Oh, please tell me!

249
00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.351
No, please save me, hey!

250
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.727
야, 인마, 이 새끼야!

251
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:27.312
Stand there, you bastard!

252
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.314
[dark music]
[Grass bug crying]

253
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.919
(Vocal cord) I have eyes for people

254
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.673
From the first time I saw our old boss,
I thought you would be someone who would do something big like this.

255
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.342
So I went to the police station
They took it out right away.

256
00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:59.719
People, the distribution needs to be this big.

257
00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.721
That bastard, Song Young-jin, is
That, little by little

258
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.807
I can't use that, I can't do anything big with that.

259
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.685
I'm trying to start a business in earnest.

260
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:07.936
please help

261
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.396
(Vocal cords) Oh, then, then

262
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.189
Of course I do everything, everything.

263
00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.817
Well, if something happens in the future

264
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.318
Ah, here is our secretary...

265
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.946
Oh, you saw it last time, right?

266
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.031
Well, contact Miss Jeong.
[Sangcheon’s awkward noise]

267
00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.951
Miss Jeong, officially.
Greetings to our old boss

268
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.035
[dark music]

269
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.329
Hello, this is Jeong So-ram.

270
00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.831
Please take care of me

271
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.838
[siren sound]

272
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.471
(Jonghoon) The first victim

273
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.389
I found out who it is

274
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.808
Jeong So-ram

275
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.977
This is the woman who ran away with Noh Sang-cheon.

276
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:51.146
How did you know? It's Jeong So-ram

277
00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.982
Byungjun Lee gave me a hint, in the detention center

278
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.616
(Byungjun) Only those who deserve to die
Aren't you dying?

279
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.452
Then that woman too
She must have been a woman who deserved to die

280
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.496
A face you don’t know?

281
00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.873
It may be a face I don't know, but

282
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.709
Our conductor
You must know someone very well.

283
00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.475
[Jonghoon takes a deep breath]

284
00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:42.948
[sigh]

285
00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.407
(Jonghoon) None.

286
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.035
There's no one that even resembles me

287
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.870
(Byungjun) I may not recognize your face, but

288
00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:51.623
Our conductor
You must know someone very well.

289
00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.041
(Jonghun) If you had plastic surgery

290
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:08.974
[surprised gasp]

291
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.145
[shaking breathing]

292
00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.364
Nayeon Cheon was sent away for now.

293
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.074
yes
[clears throat]

294
00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.954
Let's keep the reporter arrested without any evidence.
It's nothing good

295
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.915
So, Nayeon Cheon
Because I'm a reporter.

296
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:35.458
Related articles may appear

297
00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.836
It's already been revealed that Park Gwang-shin was murdered.

298
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.255
With the keyword Noh Sang-cheon and serial murder.

299
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.008
Cheon Na-yeon is too good to hide
I'm so deeply involved

300
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.593
It's hard to block, right?

301
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:45.885
This is what happened

302
00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.430
Please disclose and investigate the matter related to Noh Sang-cheon.

303
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.725
(Dohan) If the article appears even once
Everyone will find out anyway

304
00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:53.893
postpone it as much as possible

305
00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.896
(Jonghun) What was the first incident?

306
00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.441
We don't even know the woman's identity yet.

307
00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.987
Do you know anything?

308
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.199
I don't know

309
00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.077
(Jonghun) Now I have to go out and see somewhere.

310
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:13.496
Is there anything else you want to say?

311
00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.540
[Jonghoon’s encouraging sound]

312
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.008
[Meaningful music]

313
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.771
[Music plays from the earphones]

314
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.028
[sigh]

315
00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.286
[Meaningful music]

316
00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:14.349
(Nayeon) That’s right
Isn't the simile organic?

317
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.975
Isn't it?

318
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.354
Detective Guohan, a lawyer specializing in conglomerates

319
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.231
I heard it went pretty well.

320
00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:22.982
Why did you quit?

321
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.859
A lawyer who was a sucker for honey?

322
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.236
[camera shutter sound]

323
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.243
[Camera shutter sounds repeatedly]

324
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.960
(Nayeon) The police investigation
It could be directed at us.

325
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.630
(Yeon-Gwang) No, we are the victims.
Why the police?

326
00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.674
[Sighs] Do you really think that?

327
00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.428
(Nayeon) Now there is actually murder
This is what's happening

328
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.680
(Cheongju’s house) Hey, I
[Yeon-Gwang’s sigh]

329
00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.683
To the police right now
To be honest

330
00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.476
I think it would be good

331
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.271
Oh, I'm so anxious that I can't live.

332
00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.189
Not yet

333
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.651
(Nayeon) Everyone, take heart.

334
00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:08.278
(Cheongju’s house) What about Byeongjun?

335
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.280
What happened to Byeongjun?

336
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:14.242
He said he was transported to a detention center.
Are you really going to go to the prosecution?

337
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.202
Yes, that happened.

338
00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:17.871
(Cheongju’s house) [Crying] What should I do?
[Yeon-Gwang’s sigh]

339
00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.080
Because I confessed

340
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.791
(Cheongju’s house) What should I do, a man with a weak body?

341
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:24.461
How do I live in prison?

342
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:28.256
Nayeon, we really think
Are you going in the right direction?

343
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.091
Still in the media

344
00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:33.303
Regarding Noh Sang-cheon
Nothing was said

345
00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.096
(Reunion) Uh huh, stop it

00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.973
(Dohan) Are you really trying to confuse the investigation?

523
00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:42.435
(Cheongju’s house) So, Mr. Byeongjun will never

524
00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:44.186
He's not a murderer.

525
00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.855
Maybe not a murderer

526
00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.982
He aided and abetted murder.

527
00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:50.401
Why did you do that?
I don't understand

528
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:52.611
You won't understand

529
00:26:52.695 --> 00:26:55.114
Because only those who have experienced it know

530
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.033
We

531
00:26:58.034 --> 00:27:00.077
I want to catch Noh Sang-cheon.

532
00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:01.579
[nervous music]

533
00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:04.957
Noh Sang-cheon is clearly still alive.

534
00:27:05.583 --> 00:27:10.129
(Cheongju’s house) But the police aren’t interested.
The media doesn't even cover it

535
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:13.507
The problem is that people actually die.

536
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:15.509
The same goes for the bystanders.

537
00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:16.594
[snort]

538
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.515
They were all people who deserved to die.

539
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:25.519
They were people no different from Noh Sang-cheon.

540
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.792
[Call connection tone]

541
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.294
(Detective Park) Yes, team leader.

542
00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:52.546
victims' organization office

543
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.882
Apply for a search and seizure warrant right now

544
00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:55.966
(Detective Park) For what reason?

545
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.887
[Sighing] They all got the text.

546
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.263
murder notice text

547
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:04.183
They're all complicit, they're all crazy

548
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.810
[nervous music]

549
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:15.611
[cell phone vibrating sound]

550
00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:18.948
[A commotion is heard]

551
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:21.700
(Yeon-Gwang) Hey, we’re in big trouble.
The police came in

552
00:28:21.784 --> 00:28:22.785
I heard you were right

553
00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:24.078
What do you mean?

554
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:27.289
[hissing sound]
(Yeon-Gwang) I heard you brought a piece of paper.
Is that a search and seizure warrant?

555
00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.291
Please open it
There's nothing special in the office.

556
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.376
(Yeon-Gwang) No!

557
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.962
[Door rings loudly]
Sangbong was really angry.
If you open it now, everyone will die

558
00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:34.922
(Reunion) Yes! Come in

559
00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:36.966
[Cheongju House’s restraining sound]
Let's all die together!

560
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:38.926
Honey... Hey, block it, hello, uh

561
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.761
(Yeon-Gwang) Now, lie down, lie down, lie down

562
00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:41.846
(Yeon-Gwang) Hello?

563
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.097
Is the old team leader here?

564
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.723
- (Detective Park) Don’t you know the warrant?
- (Detective Shin) It’s obstruction of official duties.

565
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.183
(Detective Park) Open the door! Sir, open it!

566
00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:47.643
(Detective 1) Open when you have something nice to say!
[cell phone vibrating sound]

567
00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:49.311
(Detective Park) Hey, hey, hey
Push, push, push, Icy

568
00:28:49.395 --> 00:28:52.148
Hey kid, open the door
It's interference with official duties.

569
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:53.232
Hello

570
00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.276
(Nayeon) What are you doing?
Are you crazy, really?

571
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.736
Then after buying it
Will Team Leader Koo take responsibility?

572
00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.697
It doesn't matter, we'll go in.

573
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.323
Okay, let's make a deal.

574
00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:03.284
I'll tell you what I'm curious about
From what I know

575
00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:04.368
They said they had nothing to say

576
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.412
(Nayeon) Oh, that’s about the interrogation.

577
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:08.539
Oh, have you seen someone sing during interrogation?

578
00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:10.249
[The detectives keep yelling]
(Nayeon) You decide

579
00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.376
without any income
Do a search and seizure

580
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.919
Receive useful information

581
00:29:16.547 --> 00:29:17.590
tell me

582
00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:18.924
(Dohan) Listen and decide.

583
00:29:19.008 --> 00:29:20.801
Is there one more? murder case

584
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.386
(Nayeon) It happened first

585
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.598
It's still the same incident
The police didn't reveal it.

586
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:27.391
How about this?

587
00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:29.435
hang up

588
00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:31.270
(Nayeon) I know who it is
first dead woman

589
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.530
(Yeon-Gwang) It’s bitter, strange.

590
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:43.657
Uh, this, this, open this.

591
00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:44.742
ready, ready

592
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.372
(Yeon-Gwang) Huh?

593
00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:52.416
[People's puzzled sounds]

594
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.084
- (Yeon-Gwang) Where did you go?
- (Woman) Well

595
00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.295
[siren sound]

596
00:29:58.506 --> 00:29:59.632
[The investigation room is busy]

597
00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:05.638
(Nayeon) What is it?

598
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.766
No way, you want to catch me
This is not how we got together, right?

599
00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:10.726
(Dohan) Withdrew from the scene like that.

600
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.061
Everyone wants to understand

601
00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:13.145
Wow

602
00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:16.607
Pressure is cool.

603
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.692
very cool

604
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.240
(Dohan) Now, please explain.

605
00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:25.908
Why did you believe that text?

606
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:27.493
Because it's true

607
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:30.246
(Nayeon) A murder notice has arrived
It actually happened

608
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:32.623
all the dead people
Because they were related to Noh Sang-cheon.

609
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:35.251
(Dohan) That’s why I’m trying to interfere with the investigation.
Did you do that on purpose?

610
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:38.045
The so-called victims
Because you all planned it out

611
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:39.713
Who said they were plotting it?

612
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.011
(Nayeon) Our information
I don't know who gave it to me

613
00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:47.513
Don't you say things like this?

614
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.600
The text message went to each person.
Whether you go to the scene or not

615
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:53.185
That's a personal decision

616
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:55.479
(Dohan) But among them
Only Lee Byung-Jun actually went.

617
00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:57.773
So what is the benefit? you guys

618
00:30:58.482 --> 00:31:00.859
When the former team leader came to our office

619
00:31:00.943 --> 00:31:02.736
(Nayeon) Do you know why everyone applauded?

620
00:31:04.572 --> 00:31:07.950
The investigation into Noh Sang-cheon will begin again.
It's because of expectations.

621
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.244
That's all the victims want.

622
00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:13.122
(Dohan) Due to a murder case
When Nosangcheon rises to the surface

623
00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.416
Will the fraud investigation begin again?

624
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:16.875
[Dohan’s exasperated voice]

625
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.212
Can fraud be compared to murder?

626
00:31:20.296 --> 00:31:21.672
‘That’s a scam’?

627
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:23.299
[heavy music]
[Nayeon’s sigh]

628
00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:27.845
A person who commits suicide after being scammed

629
00:31:27.928 --> 00:31:30.139
Don't you know there are more people being murdered?

630
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:33.058
Fraud and murder should be viewed as equal
you will see something

631
00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:35.394
That kind of mindset, even if people die

632
00:31:35.978 --> 00:31:38.022
All you have to do is come up with Noh Sangman.

633
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:40.983
(Nayeon) But it doesn’t work out as I thought.

634
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:44.194
Even though three people died, there was not a single article.

635
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.822
There is no name like Noh Sang-cheon.

636
00:31:48.032 --> 00:31:50.534
They are being completely reduced and ignored.

637
00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:53.746
Who did this?

638
00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:58.375
It reminds us of No Sang-cheon.
If you are watching a murder

639
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.670
Someone is trying to hide Noh Sang-cheon
I'm working hard

640
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.841
So what's the difference between us and you?

641
00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:09.345
(Dohan) The first victim
tell me who

642
00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:13.182
Jeong So-ram

643
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:16.310
(Nayeon) This is the dead woman, Jeong So-ram.
[Meaningful music]

644
00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:18.228
What is that person’s relationship with Noh Sang-cheon?

645
00:32:18.979 --> 00:32:20.856
Executive Secretary and Conspirator

646
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.025
(Nayeon) We fled to China together

647
00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:29.281
If you ask your conductor

648
00:32:29.365 --> 00:32:31.825
You probably know Jeong So-ram very well.

649
00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:42.252
[Writes down]

650
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.646
[The door clicks open]
(Jonghoon) The first victim

651
00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:02.648
I found out who it is

652
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:04.775
Jeong So-ram

653
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.361
This is the woman who ran away with Noh Sang-cheon.

654
00:33:07.778 --> 00:33:09.738
But why didn't you recognize that face?

655
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.240
I had plastic surgery

656
00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:13.784
(Jonghun) So no one will recognize me
I fixed it all, Mr.

657
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:18.038
Anyway, Song Young-jin, Park Kwang-shin, Jeong So-ram

658
00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:21.291
They are all related to Noh Sang-cheon.

659
00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:22.668
(Nayeon) It’s been a long time

660
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:25.838
Nayeon Cheon

661
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:30.759
[Sighing] They sent me out in the morning.
Didn't you?

662
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:34.596
After being arrested
Because Deputy Director Kang didn’t come to see me

663
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.181
(Nayeon) Do you know that I was a little disappointed?

664
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.434
It's not a relationship we knew for a year or two.

665
00:33:40.853 --> 00:33:42.604
(Dohan) How did you know?
Is it Jeong So-ram?

666
00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:46.525
Byungjun Lee gave me a hint, at the detention center.

667
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:48.026
[dark music]

668
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.113
(Jonghoon) Come out of the detention center
I ran to Gyeongcheon City
[cell phone vibrating sound]

669
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.115
At that time, I got a call from my former team leader.

670
00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:54.324
(Jonghun) Why?

671
00:33:54.408 --> 00:33:56.160
Victim group seizure and search warrant?

672
00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:58.495
Take care of it

673
00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:03.709
(Jonghoon) Came in about a month ago
There is an unidentified body, right?

674
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:07.171
(Autopsy) Let’s just wait and see.
Implants are also visible on the nose and forehead.

675
00:34:07.254 --> 00:34:08.255
I had plastic surgery

676
00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:10.549
Considering that kidneys are reduced at death

677
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:13.218
Approximately 161 to 164 cm tall.

678
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:16.346
The most accurate thing is dental records.

679
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.692
Yes, it matches my medical records.

680
00:34:28.776 --> 00:34:29.985
(Doctor 2) It’s the same person.

681
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.783
(Jonghun) The result of that confirmation was

682
00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:37.451
It's Jeong So-ram

683
00:34:37.534 --> 00:34:40.496
The first victim's identity is Jeong So-ram.

684
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:43.916
(Dohan) I think it’s clear now.

685
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:46.376
That's right, Jeong So-ram

686
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:55.803
(Detective Shin) Team leader, we have secured the video.

687
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:03.852
(Dohan) Deputy Director

688
00:35:04.478 --> 00:35:05.521
Let's take a look

689
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.408
(Jonghun) Now it’s clear

690
00:35:19.368 --> 00:35:22.287
They are all people related to Noh Sang-cheon.

691
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:24.122
Your position has completely changed.

692
00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:26.875
You were adamantly opposed to it.
Something related to Noh Sang-cheon

693
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:28.502
Yes, I did.

694
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:31.046
But now we have to properly investigate.

695
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.091
(Jong-hoon) Is the culprit Noh Sang-cheon?
Whether it's an impersonator

696
00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:36.009
I need to catch the real culprit

697
00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:38.554
(Dohan) Let’s watch this first.

698
00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:51.358
(Jonghoon) It’s my car

699
00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:54.236
When was this?

700
00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.780
This morning I met with the conductor
Right after we met

701
00:35:56.864 --> 00:35:58.240
(Dohan) He left right away.

702
00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.867
[Meaningful music]

703
00:36:00.576 --> 00:36:02.536
I received my call on time.

704
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.997
The conductor is not on his way to Gyeongcheon.

705
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.665
It was in front of a victims' group.

706
00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:10.377
[cell phone vibrating sound]

707
00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:16.341
(Jong Hoon) A search warrant for the seizure of a victim group?

708
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:19.052
Take care of it

709
00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:22.097
Are you following me?

710
00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:24.766
- What's the reason?
- (Dohan) Keep watching.

711
00:36:39.323 --> 00:36:41.617
What are you doing with me now?

712
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:47.080
(Dohan) That’s the conductor today.
This is really what I did

713
00:36:47.164 --> 00:36:48.624
You didn’t even go to Gyeongcheon.

714
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:51.585
What the conductor said he did today
It's all lies

715
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.962
What is the reason?
To this extent?

716
00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:55.797
Whatever the reason!

717
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:57.633
Now we just have to catch the real culprit.

718
00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:59.968
how can i become a victim
Did you know it was Jeong So-ram?

719
00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:01.511
Isn’t it okay if you knew?

720
00:37:01.595 --> 00:37:04.222
I found it out myself
I gave you information.

721
00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:05.599
Help with the investigation

722
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:08.185
Immediately after the first incident
Was it when you went to Gyeongcheon Officetel?

723
00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:09.311
what?

724
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:23.408
(Dohan) Jeong So-ram

725
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:25.911
Did the conductor kill him?

726
00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:27.746
what?

727
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:29.831
So Byungjun Lee
Are you trying to make me a criminal?

728
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:32.918
(Dohan) The second and third culprits
So that I can be accused of being the first culprit as well

729
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:34.962
So you were following me?

730
00:37:35.045 --> 00:37:37.130
(Jonghun) Do you think that makes sense?

731
00:37:37.214 --> 00:37:38.548
you

732
00:37:39.132 --> 00:37:41.176
Is that really what you think of me?

733
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:43.303
Is there a reason I can understand?
Please tell me

734
00:37:43.387 --> 00:37:44.388
There's nothing like that

735
00:37:45.013 --> 00:37:47.265
If you leave now
An official investigation is underway.

736
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:48.433
About the conductor’s actions!

737
00:37:48.642 --> 00:37:50.185
You crazy bastard!

738
00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:53.063
(Dohan) I’ll ask you again.

739
00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:55.148
Jeong So-ram

740
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:57.651
Did the conductor kill him?

741
00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:00.278
I didn't kill you

742
00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:01.697
Why me, why me!

743
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.948
(Jonghun) Why did I kill that woman?

744
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:06.034
A note with Noh Sang-cheon’s name written on it
That's the only reason I went there

745
00:38:06.118 --> 00:38:07.285
[Jonghun’s trembling breathing]

746
00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:17.879
Sorry, conductor.

747
00:38:23.135 --> 00:38:24.970
(Dohan) You already knew from the beginning, right?

748
00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:27.222
It will go like this

749
00:38:27.723 --> 00:38:29.766
So why bother punishing me?

750
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.643
I was put in this case.

751
00:38:32.853 --> 00:38:36.273
If there is a problem with the conductor
Because I need someone to cover for me

752
00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:40.861
[heavy music]

753
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:44.489
That's still valid
If you trust me

754
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:49.745
Unless the deputy chief is a murderer.

755
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.455
We'll cover it for you, of course.

756
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:02.382
[sigh]

757
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:08.138
Now tell me
Why did you make a fake move?

758
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:11.600
In the past connected to Noh Sang-cheon
What on earth happened?

759
00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:17.230
[disturbed breathing]

760
00:39:34.081 --> 00:39:35.207

[dark music]
(Byungjun) Only those who deserve to die
Aren't you dying?

764
00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:18.625
Then that woman too
She must have been a woman who deserved to die

765
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.335
A face you don’t know?

766
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.963
It may be a face I don't know, but

767
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:26.174
Our conductor
You must know someone very well.

768
00:40:26.258 --> 00:40:29.010
It sounds like you know who it is?

769
00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:30.220
you guys

770
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:33.098
(Byungjun) Now we’re in big trouble

771
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:34.516
[Byungjun’s laughter]

772
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.541
(Yeon-Gwang) Why, who came?

[Cheongju’s surprised exclamation]

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.172
- (Yeon-Gwang) No, I...
- (Cheongju’s house) I...

775
00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:07.048
(Cheongju’s house) That woman

776
00:41:12.262 --> 00:41:13.763
I'm here to help

777
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.142
Nice to meet you, our members.

778
00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:18.393

779

(Cheongju’s house) Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on

780

- You can't fight! catch it quickly

(Woman) Hey, bitch, you're here
Show up somewhere, bitch

784
00:41:27.444 --> 00:41:28.987
(Reunion) This year, you’re part of Noh Sang-cheon’s gang, right?

785
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.113
(Byungjun) Report it quickly!

786
00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:32.449
(Soram) Report it
If you want to report

787
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.826
But, if you guys report me,

788
00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:36.661
I don't get any money

789

- (Cheongju’s house) What are you talking about?

(Yeon-Gwang) Let’s listen to the story first, okay?
[Soram’s labored breathing]

791
00:41:40.582 --> 00:41:42.000
(Byungjun) What kind of bullshit is that?

792
00:41:42.918 --> 00:41:44.294
(Soram) Think about it

793
00:41:44.628 --> 00:41:46.296
Why would I come here?

794
00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:48.048
Do you want to be welcomed by everyone?

795
00:41:48.131 --> 00:41:49.257
Or is that right?

796
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:50.717
(Woman) Then why did you come?

797
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.136
Don't quiz me, tell me, bitch!

798
00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:56.890
I heard this is a victims' group?

799
00:41:57.641 --> 00:41:58.683
(Yeon-Gwang) Yes

800
00:42:02.646 --> 00:42:03.772
I'm a victim too

[Exciting sounds of reunion]

803
00:42:06.733 --> 00:42:08.151
I was betrayed

805
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.614

[Byungjun’s absurd breathing sound]

807
00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:17.285
(Yeon-Gwang) Is it true?

808
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:21.665
Or did I come here because I was crazy?

809
00:42:21.748 --> 00:42:22.832
(Soram) Me too

810
00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:24.626
I came here because I wanted to catch Noh Sang-cheon.

811
00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:26.670
(Byungjun) How much money did you make through fraud?

812
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.964
With that money, I could live on for the rest of my life.

813
00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:30.090
[Excited breathing]

814
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.092
(Soram) Who said that?

815
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:34.928
Noh Sang-cheon to me
Do you think he gave me even a penny?

816
00:42:42.644 --> 00:42:44.354
Can I tell you a scary story?

817
00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:45.480
[Cheongju’s snort]

818
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.400
Do you know Song Young-jin?

819
00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:49.651
(Cheongju’s house) Song Young-jin?

820
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.031
dead

821
00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:56.783
(Yeon-Gwang) Song...

822
00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:57.909
To Noh Sang-cheon

823
00:42:57.993 --> 00:43:00.120
(Cheongju House) Noh Sang-cheon killed Song Young-jin...

824
00:43:00.203 --> 00:43:02.747
[Cheongju’s surprised gasp]
It must have been food for the fish by now.

00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:07.168
[Yeon-Gwang’s surprised gasp]

827

Whether you believe me or not
It doesn't matter

828
00:43:12.882 --> 00:43:16.219
I have money to receive from Noh Sang-cheon.

829
00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:17.971
(Reunion) That’s the money you’ll receive

830
00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:19.514
After all, they didn’t rip it off from us!

831
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:20.807
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah, kinda...

832
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:22.392
[Cheongju’s angry voice]

833
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:23.977
(Soram) That’s right, yes

834
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.104
From a mathematical standpoint
Maybe so.

835
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:27.272
'Mathematically'?

836
00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:30.483

look for money first

840

Whether it's picking my stomach or tearing my snout
Shouldn’t you do it?

841
00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:46.958
So let me suggest

842
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.838
I'll help you find Noh Sang-cheon.

843

[Meaningful music]

844
00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:57.093
(Soram) Instead, I just look for my money

845
00:43:57.761 --> 00:43:58.928
I will disappear

846
00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:05.935
(Cheongju’s house) Of course, you have to report it to the police.

847

(Yeon-Gwang) Write, ah, but I’m really confused.

851
00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:17.405
Oh, I'm really right next to you
Because I saw your eyes

[Angry breathing]

854
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:23.119
[People sound surprised]
(Reunion) I have to kill that thing right away.

(Yeon-gwang) No

859

Oh, not No Sang-cheon either.

860
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.630
That woman really
I might have been taken advantage of.

861
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.049
(Jae Hwang) I think

862
00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:38.093
If you use that woman well,

863
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.345
Maybe I can catch Noh Sang-cheon.

864
00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:41.763
(Cheongju’s house) What?
[Interesting music]

865
00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:45.100
(Jae Hwang) It’s for us anyway
The police don't share anything

866
00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:46.851
There is no way to get information

867
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.311
Just one chance

868
00:44:48.395 --> 00:44:51.314
That woman is trying to scam me again
Even if you approach now

869
00:44:52.399 --> 00:44:53.817
We don't have any money to rob.

870
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:57.153
[Cheongju’s sigh]
(Woman) That’s right, they’re all beggars.

871
00:44:57.237 --> 00:44:58.988
(Jae Hwang) I can’t even trust the police investigation.

872
00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:00.949
We don't have much of a choice.

873
00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.244
Even if I don't trust that woman

874
00:45:12.085 --> 00:45:13.086
300 million?

875
00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:15.380
(Cheongju’s house) It’s all the money I’ve saved in my life.

876
00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:17.006
(Soram) Oh, there are a lot.

877
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.342
(Cheongju’s house) I have to find that.

00:45:20.593 --> 00:45:24.639
Oh my, it's ugly and dirty
He looks like a piece of shit, really.

879
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.307
(Yeon-Gwang) Because you say that

880
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:27.892
I feel refreshed inside

[Each person speaks]

883
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.570
(Nayeon) What are you doing?

884
00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.036
(Byungjun) You too, the money your mother invested

885
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:48.455
Write it down

886
00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:51.499
(Nayeon) Can you find the money for me?

887
00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:54.502
Who is that person?

888
00:45:55.545 --> 00:45:57.088
(Byungjun) Well, not right away.

889
00:45:58.214 --> 00:45:59.799
If I find it, I'll give it to you right away.

890
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.218
Let's write it down in advance.

891
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.138
(Soram) I’m a high school student and I have to study.

892
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.598
How did you get scammed?

893
00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:10.226
It wasn't me, it was my mom.

894
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.146
(Nayeon) You’re not feeling well right now.

895
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:15.607
I come here often.

896
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.944
How much did your mother lose?

897
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:21.654
Where is Noh Sang-cheon?

898
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.910
It's not about money for me

899
00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:28.620
I have to catch Noh Sang-cheon.

900
00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:32.707
I caught him and made him die
I need revenge

901

[Meaningful music]

902
00:46:38.505 --> 00:46:40.215
It's a person who set himself on fire.

903
00:46:55.939 --> 00:46:57.106
But

904
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:02.237
My father set himself on fire and died
There wasn't a single article published.

905
00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:05.031

(Yeon-Gwang) Who, who found it?

915
00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:41.317
(Soram) He’s a friend who was betrayed like me.

916
00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:42.610

(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, but

925
00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:12.432
Is it really okay not to report it to the police?

926

I have no intention of catching Noh Sang-cheon.

929
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:26.237
If you report it, you won't be caught.
Are you going to make me run away beforehand?

930
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:29.157
(Jae Hwang) First, let’s take a look at the situation on site and make a decision.

931

I don't trust her

1031
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:23.516
You did a good job reporting it.

1032
00:52:30.439 --> 00:52:32.316
Still not wanted?

1033
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:36.028
(Attendant) Yes, just a little more
I ask you to wait

1034
00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:39.156
I can get a boat
It seems difficult to find a captain.

1035
00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:41.826
If you get caught, the punishment is severe.

1036
00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:45.329
No, what about Seongdae Kim? What about Gojiman?

1037
00:52:46.372 --> 00:52:48.249
What, no one can even use their strength?

1038
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.668
(Sangcheon) These bastards just take money and eat it.

1039
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.587
You're not doing your job right, sir, tsk.

1040
00:52:53.004 --> 00:52:54.005
(Attendant) I’m sorry.

1041
00:52:54.463 --> 00:52:55.506
By the way

1042
00:52:56.424 --> 00:52:58.050
What happened to Jeong So-ram?

1043
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.261
[Sangcheon snorts]

1044
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.640
She's the bitch in this game, whatever happens
It doesn't really matter

1045
00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:10.980
(Sangcheon) Oh, and our Soram too
If you look closely

1046
00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:13.691
[Dark sound effect]
I have a very naive side.

1047
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:14.984
[Soram’s urgent breathing]

1048
00:53:22.742 --> 00:53:25.286
(Sangcheon) Go and take some time.

1049
00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:27.496
Don't let them do anything wrong

1050
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:30.666
(Soram) Report it to the police or
What if you try to kill me?

1051
00:53:31.167 --> 00:53:32.209
[Sangcheon’s voice of denial]

1052
00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:33.711
I can't do that

1053
00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:38.966
(Sangcheon) The police are already on their side
'Cause I know it's not

1054
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.092
[Sangcheon laughs]

1055
00:53:40.176 --> 00:53:42.261
If there's a guy with a bit of a head over there

1056
00:53:42.345 --> 00:53:46.057
They'll pretend to trust you and use you to find me.

1057
00:53:48.017 --> 00:53:51.479
But that's probably the limit.

1058
00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:53.105
[Soram sobs]

1059
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.860
(Detective 2) Come down now.
[Soram’s surprised gasp]

1060
00:53:57.944 --> 00:53:59.445
I'm going to get lost like this

1061
00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:01.906
(Detective Jeong) Let’s go up a little further.

1062
00:54:02.782 --> 00:54:04.033
IC

1063
00:54:08.454 --> 00:54:09.497
[surprised gasp]

1064
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.000
Hey, where have you gone? This

1065
00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.502
[Detectives' heavy breathing]

1066
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:15.711
[Soram’s heavy breathing]

1067
00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:17.672
[Nervous breathing]

1068
00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:21.258
[shaking breathing]

1069
00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:24.387
(Detective Jeong) [Sighing] Bye, let’s go down.

1070
00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:30.226
Are you here to help me?

1071
00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:32.687
My sister came to help us too.

1072
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.439
(Jae Hwang) So we have to take responsibility for our sister too.

1073
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:41.529
I think you're a college student. What's your name?

1074
00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:43.656
Jae-Hwang Jeong, Jae-Hwang Jeong

1075
00:54:44.407 --> 00:54:45.866
I dropped out of school

1076
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:48.452
I lost all my tuition.

1077
00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:51.372
[Soram and Jaehwang’s heavy breathing]

1078
00:54:58.045 --> 00:54:59.088
[Knocking sound]

1079
00:55:01.007 --> 00:55:02.008
(Jonghoon) Come in

1080
00:55:11.017 --> 00:55:13.060
The police department’s discipline is nonsense.

1081
00:55:13.269 --> 00:55:15.312
(Jonghoon) The suspects
I wander around as I please

1082
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.898
(Nayeon) I’m not a suspect anymore, am I?

1083
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.738
Wow, this office is really nice.

1084
00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:28.743
Hey, the outlook isn't great.

1085
00:55:29.577 --> 00:55:31.245
I can't see anything

1086
00:55:32.038 --> 00:55:35.082
Like in the old days when Detective Kang lied

1087
00:55:37.043 --> 00:55:39.086
[Jonghun’s sigh]
(Nayeon) Are you holding me tightly?

1088
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.755
Are you making a promise?

1089
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:43.257
I promise
[Calm music]

1090
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.928
(Nayeon) Jeonyo
I didn’t blame Detective Kang.

1091
00:55:48.012 --> 00:55:52.600
At that time, Detective Kang really believed in us.
I thought it was for you

1092
00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:54.018
Sincerely

1093
00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:57.938
Even when I can't contact you later

1094
00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:02.151
I just thought there must be something going on.

1095
00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:06.072
But, as time goes by

1096
00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:10.242
We're getting more and more neglected and cornered

1097
00:56:10.326 --> 00:56:11.994
I can't see anything

1098
00:56:12.453 --> 00:56:15.206
Detective Kang has been promoted repeatedly.

1099
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:19.085
Were you happy?

1100
00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:23.047
Just go, Nayeon.

1101
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.299
Just listen to this, Director Kang.

1102
00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:31.847
Sincerity also depends on the situation
That it can change at any time

1103
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:36.060
Now that I'm an adult, I understand.

1104
00:56:37.186 --> 00:56:39.730
So even now, I blame the conductor.
I don't want to do it

1105
00:56:39.814 --> 00:56:41.357
(Nayeon) That’s probably the situation.

1106
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:43.901
But

1107
00:56:45.694 --> 00:56:48.948
In the past, Detective Kang
People I trusted and relied on

1108
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.534
Shouldn't you take responsibility for your taunts?

1109
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:54.787
The current Deputy Director Kang

1110
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.725
[Sighing] How is this?
I feel a sense of déjà vu

1111
00:57:17.685 --> 00:57:18.769
Please follow me

1112
00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:22.064
Where are you going?

1113
00:57:22.148 --> 00:57:24.275
(Nayeon) I have something to ask you
You waited.

1114
00:57:24.358 --> 00:57:26.902
Because I'm starving to death
Let’s go eat something first.

1115
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:38.205
[sigh]

1116
00:57:41.333 --> 00:57:43.335
[Call connection tone]
[cell phone vibrating sound]

1117
00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:49.592
(Sangdo) Deputy Director Kang

1118
00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:51.510
What time is it now?

1119
00:57:51.594 --> 00:57:52.636
(Jonghoon) I

1120
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.473
Do you know what you did all day today?

1121
00:57:56.557 --> 00:57:57.766
[Sangdo’s sigh]

1122
00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:59.476
(Sangdo) Do I need to know that?

1123
00:58:00.227 --> 00:58:01.353
[sigh]

1124
00:58:03.022 --> 00:58:05.774
We found out who the first victim was

1125
00:58:08.903 --> 00:58:09.945
Who are you?

1126
00:58:13.324 --> 00:58:15.075
[refreshing sound]
I guess I can live now

1127
00:58:16.035 --> 00:58:17.661
(Dohan) How did you know?
Is it Jeong So-ram?

1128
00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:19.246
It wasn't difficult

1129
00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:37.848
(Dohan) Where did you get this?

1130
00:58:37.932 --> 00:58:41.101
Tracker a few years ago
This photo was taken in China.

1131
00:58:41.185 --> 00:58:42.353
Tracking team?

1132
00:58:42.436 --> 00:58:45.814
Run by the Victims Association
There was a tracking team for Noh Sang-cheon.

1133
00:58:45.898 --> 00:58:48.609
(Nayeon) At that time, I had plastic surgery.
Face completely destroyed
[camera shutter sound]

1134
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:50.819
I even checked with Jeong So-ram.

1135
00:58:50.903 --> 00:58:52.404
I couldn't find Noh Sang-cheon.

1136
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:53.948
[Excited sound]

1137
00:58:54.031 --> 00:58:56.033
You guys are so good too

1138
00:58:56.408 --> 00:58:58.244
No, a lot of time has passed.

1139
00:58:58.452 --> 00:58:59.453
Look

1140
00:59:00.287 --> 00:59:01.997
What Noh Sang-cheon took

1141
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:04.458
It's not just our money, it's life itself.

1142
00:59:05.668 --> 00:59:06.877
I'm ruining my life

1143
00:59:06.961 --> 00:59:09.213
Team leader, like us,
Do you think I won't do it?

1144
00:59:10.422 --> 00:59:11.423
(Nayeon) That’s right

1145
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:14.718
For someone who has only walked the flower path like the team leader

1146
00:59:14.802 --> 00:59:16.512
It's a different world, right?

1147
00:59:16.971 --> 00:59:18.889
Ruining your life like a fool

1148
00:59:19.807 --> 00:59:23.352
It only happened to you
Don't think it's anything special.

1149
00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:28.190
Do you have any more pictures of this?

1150
00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:29.733
take it

1151
00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:33.612
Because Jeong So-ram is dead anyway.
I don't need it anymore

1152
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.491
(Nayeon) But, what I’m really curious about is

1153
00:59:39.118 --> 00:59:42.997
Jeong So-ram in China
Why did he die in Korea?

1154
00:59:43.497 --> 00:59:45.249
[dark music]
Still wanted by Interpol

1155
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.209
How could I return to Korea?

1156
00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:50.671
You had a fake ID?
That would be possible too

1157
00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:54.091
Yes, the immigration to our country is
Would it be that shabby?

1158
00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:58.470
(Nayeon) Moreover, this time, Jung So-ram
The woman who disguised her identity

1159
00:59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.598
There is no record of going abroad.
I heard you're a person?

1160
01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:06.437
That means after entering the country.
It means your ID is forged.

1161
01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:10.649
Then who put in the effort
Didn't they let you in?

1162
01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.652
(Jonghun) How did they enter the country?
Jeong So-ram

1163
01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.237
(Sangdo) Oh, I don’t know.

1164
01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:17.281
Oh, why are you coming in?

1165
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:20.409
I'll bury my bones there
Why are you making a fuss here?

1166
01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:26.040
Earlier, I spent all day today
I asked you if you knew what you were doing?

1167
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.583
(Sangdo) Oh, hey, Deputy Director Kang

1168
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.293
Why do you keep doing this?

1169
01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:30.669
Do I even need to know that?

1170
01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:33.505
Ah, Deputy Kang
Do you know what I did today?

1171
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:35.758
I also spoke with the Commissioner of the National Tax Service...

1172
01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.260
Hey, anyway, I was busy too.

1173
01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:40.054
(Jonghoon) Noh Sangcheon is mentioned

1174
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.640
No need to try to cover it up anymore

1175
01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:47.227
From now on, this serial murder
We will investigate properly

1176
01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.271
What nonsense is that again?

1177
01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:50.981
Now we too are in danger

1178
01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:52.816
(Sangdo) No, that’s...

1179
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.818
Hey, maybe

1180
01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:56.945
He was released from prison a few months ago.

1181
01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.156
(Jonghun) At first, I thought it was a long time ago.

1182
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.742
With the death of Jeong So-ram, it is now clear.

1183
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:03.660
list

1184
01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.330
I'm dying according to that list.

1185
01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.374
So all day today

1186
01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.167
I went looking for him.

1187
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.251
What are the results?

1188
01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.128
Did you have some?

1189
01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:16.173
Disappeared without a trace

1190
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.093
(Jonghun) After release from prison
where is he and what is he doing

1191
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.844
No one knows

1192
01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:23.680
[sigh]

1193
01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.057
[Embarrassed breathing]

1194
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.976
I'll ask again

1195
01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.479
Are you sure he's dead?

1196
01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.399
Noh Sang-cheon

1197
01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.657
No matter how much I think about it
There's one thing that's holding me back

1198
01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:44.618
(Dohan) Lee Byung-jun and Cheon Na-yeon

1199
01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.287
Just to hinder the police investigation.
I don't believe that was the case.

1200
01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:49.248
Okay, there's one more thing.

1201
01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:51.959
(Nayeon) The incident grew bigger and appeared in the media.

1202
01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.086
Because it is widely known
To have Noh Sang-cheon reinvestigated...

1203
01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.629
(Dohan) Hey, Nayeon Cheon.

1204
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.509
Is there another reason?

1205
01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:02.261
a bigger reason

1206
01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.180
For example

1207
01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:09.476
you are murderers
Do you know who it is

1208
01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:15.441
Are you someone who needs to be hidden?

1209
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.114
(Employee) If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take the bowl.

1210
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.282
[rattling sound]

1211
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.178
[laughter]

1212
01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.888
(Nayeon) Aren’t we so funny?

1213
01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:49.725
Baby, in the world of kimbap
Being interrogated like this?

1214
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.480
It's called small talk.

1215
01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:56.523
[light laughter]

1216
01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.700
He also really liked tteokbokki.
[heavy music]

1217
01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:10.621
(Nayeon) To me who was a high school student
I bought it for you often.

1218
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.748
Dad passed away

1219
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:18.086
whom I relied on like my own brother
I was the only one

1220
01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.089
maybe more than my mom

1221
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.883
[Inmates talk]

1222
01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:26.136
(Nayeon) To that person
There was a list

1223
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.848
All in the eyes of the victims
They were people who made me shed tears of blood.

1224
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.519
(Nayeon) When the first murder occurred

1225
01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:37.064
I searched my memory in that list.

1226
01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:46.240
That's right

1227
01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:50.827
So-Ram Jeong, Young-Jin Song, Kwang-Sin Park

1228
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.039
all that list
That's the name at the top

1229
01:04:00.963 --> 01:04:03.507
Who is that person?
Where are you now?

1230
01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.012
12 years ago, when Noh Sang-cheon was about to run away

1231
01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.431
I killed one of the attendants.

1232
01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:16.979
I'm still in prison for that crime.
I was released from prison not long ago.

1233
01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.356
That person is a murderer
Are you thinking about it?

1234
01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.775
He's the one sending the text message

1235
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.194
(Dohan) That’s why I want to protect you.

1236
01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:27.072
You, Byungjun Lee, and all the victims

1237
01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:29.783
[sigh]

1238
01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:34.580
Now I don't know what it is

1239
01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:37.916
What's in it for him?
I really don't know

1240
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.043
Should I avoid getting caught?

1241
01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:42.170
Should I get caught?

1242
01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.387
[trembling sigh]

1243
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:55.267
I feel sorry for you, so much.

1244
01:04:57.311 --> 01:04:58.937
[Grass bug crying]
[Man 3’s heavy breathing]

1245
01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.713
[dark music]

1246
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.410
