00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.300
[Theme song]

2
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.671
[dark music]
(Sangcheon) Because my purpose is different

3
00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.341
Let’s make a deal, Team Leader Koo.

4
00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:53.679
You need to help me

5
00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:54.847
The murderer

6
00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:58.017
I'll let you catch it

7
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.732
Who are you going to take revenge on?

8
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:06.567
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

9
00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.698
(Sangcheon) Jeong So-ram was excited.

10
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.160
I thought I could go to Korea again

11
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.622
[Soram is chortling]

12
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.960
(Sangcheon) And then
When I go to Korea this time

13
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:28.047
Find Seongdae Kim
Because we have to plan it properly

14
00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:30.800
I don’t want to meet Rep. Kim Seong-dae.

15
00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:32.218
(Soram) I look like this
I don't even want to show it

16
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.137
Does that matter now?
Aren’t you feeling unfair?

17
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.557
(Sangcheon) We just run away
I can't live comfortably even for a single day.

18
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.019
Those bastards who took my money and ate it up
You're living with your head held high

19
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.063
So what are you going to do?

20
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.026
revenge

21
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.279
How?

22
00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:55.491
(Sangcheon) But it works
I came to Korea and died

23
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:59.036
Let's not take revenge on those bastards.
I was ignored by Kim Seong-dae

24
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:05.084
(Dohan) Are you going to take revenge?
To those who protected you?

25
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.713
protect? Who who?

26
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:11.090
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

27
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.134
Team leader Koo is so naive.

28
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:17.972
(Sangcheon) Actually, I am that murderer.
It doesn't matter who I catch and kill.

29
00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.183
Rather, I should show you my lesson now.

30
00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.143
That's why I came to the police headquarters on purpose.

31
00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:25.312
[Sangcheon’s response]
(Dohan) To surprise them

32
00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:28.983
To get my revenge too
I need someone to help me

33
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.609
(Sangcheon) I have to secure my safety too.

34
00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:33.779
So, is that me?

35
00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.990
Hey, team leader Koo, listen to me carefully.

36
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.078
This game is all about faith

37
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.830
(Sangcheon) After catching that murderer

38
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:45.457
Proof that those people are my followers
I'll give you everything

39
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.501
The old team leader takes responsibility and exposes everything.

40
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.461
Because I believe he has that much courage.

41
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:53.173
I take revenge
The former team leader becomes a star police officer.

42
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:54.633
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

43
00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:58.679
Kill it?

44
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.225
You only talk about murder cases with me.

45
00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.145
People are when the opportunity comes.
You have to catch it all.

46
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.771
(Sangcheon) If we finish this game well,

47
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.524
Do you think you could enter the political arena?

48
00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:14.653
[Laughing] A former lawyer.
There are some good titles too.

49
00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:17.156
People in the legal profession
Enter the political arena

50
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.199
It's doing well to show off.

51
00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:20.492
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

52
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:24.538
(Nayeon) I need to tell Team Leader Koo too.

53
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:25.623
(Reunion) What?

54
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.416
(Nayeon) The police should know too

55
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.377
There is a possibility that Noh Sang-cheon really entered the country.

56
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.254
(Reunion) Oh, what does that mean?

57
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.672
The police anyway

58
00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:36.842
Even the premise that Noh Sang-cheon is alive
I don't believe it at all

59
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.052
Former team leader

60
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.181
Noh Sang-cheon is alive.
I said something with certainty.

61
00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:46.101
(Reunion) Ah, that’s enough
Whatever it is, I don't trust the police.

62
00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:48.312
Have you forgotten what happened to Deputy Director Kang?

63
00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.315
When the former team leader is also decisive
will betray us

64
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.650
Fraud victims

65
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.027
Compared to a murder case
Because I think it's nothing

66
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.529
(Yeon-Gwang) That’s right, Sang-Bong.

67
00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:01.408
No, on the contrary, Noh Sang-cheon
That you are in the country

68
00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:03.160
Let’s say the police found out first.

69
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.579
Do you think you'll let us know? The former team leader?

70
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:09.166
(Reunion) [Snoring] Investigation
They'll tell you to leave because it's disturbing.

71
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.542
And information blocking

72
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.256
(Dohan) I’m sorry, you guys were hurt.

73
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.050
I thought it was no big deal

74
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.304
Fraud is better than murder
It could be a worse crime

75
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.056
Now I understand

76
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.016
no

77
00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.477
The old team leader will be different.

78
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.771
Can you trust Team Leader Koo?

79
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.524
(Sangdo) Xuanchang is Noh Sangcheon
Now it's an official fact

80
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.775
Shouldn't we inform the media?

81
00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:38.946
The person that Team Leader Gu is after is a murderer.
Not No Sang-cheon

82
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.656
(Voice) If you inform the media

83
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.410
Than past murder cases
I'm going to focus on Noh Sang-cheon's life and death.

84
00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.412
The former team leader will know that well.

85
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.833
Ah, this... I'm so anxious, I can't live.

86
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.376
I've reached Nosangcheon Stream.

87
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.460
[Sangdo’s sigh]

88
00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:54.962
Noh Sang-cheon, that

89
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:58.007
When the case is over
I have to deal with that bastard too.

90
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.092
I ended up getting involved with the police like this.

91
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.511
Processing it?

92
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.430
Ah, why are you surprised? Once again

93
00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:06.306
(vocal cord) No, then
Leave that person walking around

94
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.517
Do you think we can sleep with our feet stretched out?

95
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.102
I know everything, but what about that bastard?

96
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.895
[성대의 한숨]

97
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.731
[휴대전화 진동음]

98
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:16.567
(상천) 그, 아까부터 울리던데

99
00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:18.736
받아 보라고

100
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.242
(도한) 그놈들이 준
전화기나 꺼내 두시죠

101
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.704
[상천의 당황한 숨소리]

102
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.416
(남자1) 일어나, 이 개새끼야

103
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.543
금지금, 금지금 어디 있어!

104
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:35.627
(Man 2) Let’s go! Mr. Lee

105
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.379
(Man 1) You bastard
Get in touch with us through this

106
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:39.506
Oh my, that's right

107
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.343
That's because I'm getting older

108
00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:45.429
(Sangcheon) [Laughing sheepishly] Have you become senile?

109
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.389
Hey, where was that, I...

110
00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:49.349
You know who the culprit is, right?

111
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.780
I have no idea who the culprit is.

112
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.615
(Dohan) Are you coming to catch them?

113
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.450
'Cause that doesn't make sense

114
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.376
That's right, those bastards who threatened me

115
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.922
(Sangcheon) But that doesn’t work
He did this terrible thing

116
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:24.051
But because I came here

117
00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:27.429
They succeeded, those bastards

118
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:29.890
Who is it?

119
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.812
A
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

120
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:37.773
(Sangcheon) I did that
Can you talk about it easily?

121
00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.775
It's the only card I have

122
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:43.195
Hey, if it's the old team leader
Can you tell me so easily?

123
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:45.614
Put me in a cell alone

124
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.200
You're going to catch Team Leader Koo by yourself.

125
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.494
Should I expose one of you?

126
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.621
Those bastards

127
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:57.209
I'm from special forces.
Those bastards who ruined their lives while gambling.

128
00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.129
Why, you know
I'm really good at fighting

129
00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:03.340
These bastards have empty heads

130
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.842
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

131
00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.387
[sigh]

132
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.930
That's all for today

133
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.433
As long as the old team leader helps me get my revenge,

134
00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.771
I plan to open them one by one like today.

135
00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.232
[Dohan’s harsh sounds]

136
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.817
(Dohan) You now
Do you know what's wrong?

137
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.153
You from earlier
All I'm saying is that I'll get revenge

138
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:25.445
So what about the victims?

139
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.907
I ruined my life because of you
Even dead victims!

140
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.870
Even once, even once
Have you ever thought about those victims?

141
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.080
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

142
00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:37.833
[Meaningful music]

143
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:38.959
Why me?

144
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.045
(Dohan) I plan to apologize to them
Have you ever tried it!

145
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.130
(Sangcheon) Hey!

146
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.339
[Dohan’s heavy breathing]

147
00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:46.258
I am the biggest victim

148
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.886
Hiding and running away for such a long time!

149
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.012
He even pretended to be dead!

150
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.098
Do you know how miserable that feels?

151
00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:57.686
[Tapping] This is where I am
I couldn't sleep because I couldn't breathe.

152
00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.229
For life!

153
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:02.399
M You only did good things, Noh Sang-cheon!

154
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.818
[Dohan’s trembling breathing]

155
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.697
[Rough breathing]

156
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.208
[People are murmuring]

157
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:21.919
[People are noisy]

158
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.755
(Woman 1) Why isn’t my money coming in?

159
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.964
How did this happen...

160
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.592
(Cheongju’s house) Nayeon’s mom
[Nayeon’s mother responds]

161
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.761
Well, the deposit didn’t arrive today, right?

162
00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:33.263
It's been this way for a few weeks now

163
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:35.599
Is something wrong?

164
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:37.309
I'm not sure

165
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.560
[Cheongju’s embarrassed voice]

166
00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:41.605
(Byungjun) After the customer appreciation festival,
I lost all my money

167
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.274
Other branches one by one
I heard they're closing the door.

168
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.735
[Cheongju’s surprised voice]
(Byungjun) Then, take this to the police first.
Shouldn’t you report it?

169
00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.570
- Are you a police officer?
- (Byungjun) Of course.

170
00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.781
These guys close the door
I'm not trying to run away

171
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.532
(Cheongju’s house) No, no way.

172
00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:54.660
The employee here said this earlier.

173
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:59.706
If you report it to the police
They say we don't get any money

174
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.501
If you just wait quietly
I can get it

175
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:03.752
That's what I said...

176
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.587
(Reunion) What are you waiting for, what are you waiting for!

177
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.880
Where is the manager here?

178
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:08.215
- (Cheongju’s house) No, over there...
- (Byungjun) Oh, Mr.

179
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.842
[People protest harshly]

180
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.222
(Police 1) VIXX Network?

181
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.808
The money that was supposed to come in didn't come in?

182
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.102
[Sighing] Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay...

183
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.478
Yes, I understand.

184
00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:24.898
Ana, what are you really saying?
I don't know anything

185
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:25.983
(Police 2) What are they saying?

186
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.278
Oh, even if this is a scam
It's hard to conclude that it's a scam

187
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.113
[People complain]
(Woman 2) No, that one
What do you mean?

188
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.572
It's crazy!

189
00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.867
Have a similar receiving company
Depositor protection law should not apply

190
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.287
(Woman 2) No, until tomorrow.
How can I wait!

191
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.831
(Vocal cords) Hey, what happened to you?

192
00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.750
They say complaints keep coming to the police station!

193
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.502
All over the country!

194
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.379
It's a minor thing, don't worry about it.

195
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:48.630
(Vocal cords) Minor problem?

196
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:49.965
Is this trivial?

197
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.176
If this goes on and appears in the media,
What should I do!

198
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.262
(Sangcheon) No, with something that’s not a big problem

199
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.389
No, I tell you to handle things like this normally.

200
00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.599
Haven't I given you a lot of good things?

201
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.101
Please pay for what you ate.

202
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.937
(Vocal cords) Hey, you bastard, Noh Sang-cheon!

203
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:08.150
This shameless bastard
To a member of the National Assembly, Mr. Lee

204
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.401
Do you find me funny?

205
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.194
Oh my, can't that be

206
00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:15.032
Kingmaker ruined all construction work
Rep. Kim, how dare I?

207
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:19.244
Ah, but the prosecution or the police

208
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.455
Please crack down on it properly.

209
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.165
(Sangcheon) No, if I get into an accident

210
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.625
I'm not the only one in trouble

211
00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:26.960
Are you threatening me now?

212
00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:28.253
You mean a threat?

213
00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:30.839
In the end, we are a community of destiny.

214
00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:31.923
(Sangcheon) Well, anyway

215
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.426
Please just finish it well.

216
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.594
(Vocal cord) Hey, Noh Sang-cheon

217
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.512
[Call end sound]
My... hey!

218
00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:38.764
hey! Noh Sangcheon!

219
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.141
Where is this bastard?

220
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.476
Ah, Mr.

221
00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:44.686
[sigh]

222
00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.229
[light sigh]

223
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.815
[Sound of strength]

224
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.819
[whistle]

225
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.740
[heavy music]

226
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.118
[Sequential notification sound]

227
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.287
[Voice guidance] Customer, number 2...

228
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.414
Yes, hello, what brings you here?

229
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.624
To get money

230
00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:06.708
Money?

231
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.669
Uh, what kind of money...

232
00:11:10.212 --> 00:11:13.298
(Nayeon Boo) Ah, work incentives.
If it's a tax refund

233
00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:14.674
You have to go to the National Tax Service.

234
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.636
Because this is the community center.
I think you came to the wrong place.

235
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:21.264
(Creditor 1) No, I got it right.
You're here, we're all here

236
00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.517
(Creditor 2) Your wife
Take our money

237
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.268
Where did you invest?

238
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.021
People here have 300 million won, 300 million won!

239
00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:29.106
yes?

240
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.191
(Creditor 1) With the salary of a civil servant
Can you pay it all back? uh?

241
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.692
[Nayeon’s voice sounds embarrassed]
(Creditor 3) Hey, give me the money, Mr.

242
00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.777
- (Creditor 1) Pay it back
- (Creditor 4) Hey

243
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.861
(Creditor 1) Give it to me!

244
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.571
[Creditors each shout]

245
00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:40.200
(Jonghun) Even so, in the past few days
There have been many similar reports

246
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.910
It's currently under investigation.

247
00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:44.996
Sue, the investigation is ongoing, right?

248
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.957
(Nayeon’s wife) The investigation was rejected.
There are people too

249
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.208
through internal sources

250
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.419
VIXX Network executive level
In contact

251
00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:51.878
Of course, it will take some time, but

252
00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:55.132
If you catch a scammer
You can get your money back, right?

253
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.342
That's the most important thing

254
00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:59.136
(Detective Cho) I can’t take that.

255
00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.720
(Jonghun) Hey, what’s wrong, man?

256
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.598
It's all blackmail, such a fraud case.
It's not something I've experienced once or twice.

257
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.518
(Detective Cho) Even if I catch that swindler
‘I was trying to invest’

258
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.813
Or, uh, 'I was trying to pay the money back.'
That's enough.

259
00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.649
Even if you catch them
I don't have all the money right away.

260
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.026
(Nayeon Boo) Oh, what should I do?

261
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.321
I don’t think I can live as a civil servant like this.

262
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.032
Even if money is stolen, it can be traced.

263
00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.160
(Jonghun) Generally speaking,
Something like default on debt

264
00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.371
file a civil suit
There are cases where it is accepted.

265
00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:28.540
Of course, there will be some litigation costs.

266
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:32.752
Uh, hopefully for now.
Let's wait a moment

267
00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:38.467
My daughter is now a high school student.
I'm at the age where I need money.

268
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:43.722
[siren sound]

269
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.352
(Sweet) Ah, there it is, over there!

270
00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:53.148
They say you can get it, if you catch him?

271
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:54.441
How did you get here...

272
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.026
(affectionately) Oh, I’m talking!

273
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.154
Nayeon only believed what her mother said.
funds for my son's wedding

274
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.032
No, I spent all my money on it!

275
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.743
Oh my, how did this happen?

276
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.703
If you catch No Sang-cheon, you won't find anything.

277
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.080
sorry
[Sweet sigh]

278
00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:12.542
[Creditor 2 sighs]
Ah, this is an apology.
Is it going to happen?

279
00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:15.420
Nayeon’s mom, where is Nayeon’s mom? uh?

280
00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:16.671
I really like this girl...

281
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.842
(Creditor 2) Boy, am I that fraudster?
Because I can't wait until I catch something.

282
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:22.010
Give me the money you have

283
00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:25.180
I will take out the jeonse and reimburse you part of it.

284
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.724
(Creditor 2) What are you talking about? Don't you know that?

285
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.684
Did you already take out a loan using your jeonse as collateral?

286
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.353
Well, is that real?

287
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.230
- So are we lying?
- (Creditor 2) This person?

288
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.066
(Creditor 1) To the community center tomorrow as well
I know that because I'm going to work.

289
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.485
I'm going to go every day until I pay it back, okay?

290
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.986
(Creditor 2) Say something!

291
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.071
(Sweet) No, please speak up.

292
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.574
Nayeon's mother
Why can’t I contact you? Why!
[Creditor 1 scolds]

293
00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:45.659
sorry

294
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.953
(Sangcheon) Mr.
[TV sound plays]

295
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:49.538
Wow

296
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.669
(Youngjin) I received information on the smuggling route.
It’s dry cupping.

297
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.965
Personnel to help in case of emergency
They say they will dispatch it to the port.

298
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.550
I have to do that much.

299
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.635
(Youngjin) No, but

300
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:09.099
Do you really mind if I don’t take everything?

301
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.019
(Sangcheon) Yeah, that?

302
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.651
[dark music]
I took this guy with me

303
00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.487
I'm checking everything.

304
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:23.947
If you don't take it all

305
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.116
Did you ask me to take care of it?

306
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.538
kid, no

307
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:35.834
(Youngjin) I just
I'm really worried...

308
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.502
[Laugh together]

309
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.759
(Sangcheon) Don’t worry

310
00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:47.512
After a while, it will become quiet again.

311
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.432
Then you can come back and take care of it.

312
00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:55.103
A place to store it safely in the meantime.
I took good care of it

313
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.439
[Sangcheon laughs]

314
00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.072
Where are you hiding?

315
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.055
[telephone ringing sound]

316
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.559
Yes, this is Gu Do-han.

317
00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:36.936
(Secretary) If you come, please go to the commissioner’s office.
Please come up.

318
00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.438
[Knocking sound]

319
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:50.408
(Dohan) Did you all stay here all night?

320
00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:55.789
(Kookhyeon) Former team leader
You didn’t hear from me all night.

321
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.332
Well, where is Noh Sang-cheon?

322
00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.918
I heard there is no Noh Sang-cheon?

323
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.462
Well, there was one Chinese person.
Was it Xuanchang?

324
00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.797
(Sangdo) Don’t play with words!

325
00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.384
I remember the pun
People here did it

326
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.469
(Dohan) As a group.

327
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.731
Don't worry
We are taking good care of you

328
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.775
[heavy music]

329
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:31.866
(Gukhyeon) Former team leader
Let's talk about it all now

330
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.910
Is the Commissioner also involved? Noh Sang-cheon and

331
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.747
Oh no, I'm not, I don't care

332
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.332
[Vocal cords and upper respiratory tract clear cough]

333
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.167
(Dohan) Then just let me do what I do.

334
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.253
This thing is over
If you want me to take my clothes off, I will.

335
00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.588
What?

336
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.633
(Kookhyeon) I can discipline you right away.

337
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:52.095
Then naturally, the former team leader
Don't you know that you have to get out of the case?

338
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.849
Yes, I understand, please do so.

339
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.814
(Dohan) But the people here also
Would you really agree?

340
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.734
At this point, a police officer other than me

341
00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.235
Being involved in this case

342
00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.411
I'll catch the murderer

343
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:19.456
To catch the person who killed someone
We have to join hands even with the devil

344
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.750
But there is one problem

345
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.794
Noh Sang-cheon can’t believe you guys.

346
00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.172
What do you say you can't believe?

347
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.593
(Dohan) It’s a guarantee of safety.
About Noh Sang-cheon himself

348
00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:34.179
After this case is resolved

349
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.890
You can organize yourself too

350
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:37.974
From you all

351
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.685
(Vocal cord) Ah, what kind of world is it these days?

352
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.563
Ah, what about us, even a red compact car?
Do you know how to burn it?

353
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.857
Oh, we're not those people.

354
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.192
yes, i understand

355
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.277
So can I go now?

356
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.654
(Vocal cords) You know it shouldn’t be made public, right?

357
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.282
Noh Sang-cheon is alive, in Korea.

358
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.287
It would be difficult if it became known to the world
The same goes for the former team leader.

359
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.792
to the media and now
Especially for the victims

360
00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.210
Why shouldn't I know?

361
00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.879
Victims have the right to know

362
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:08.963
(Gukhyeon) Former team leader

363
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.674
Don’t you know the basics of investigation?

364
00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:14.511
Moreover, the victims are civilians.

365
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:18.056
(Dohan) Isn’t this a special situation?
dead person comes back to life

366
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.809
(Vocal cords) It’s absolutely not possible!

367
00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:23.686
That level of discernment
I think I will

368
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.023
I'll take care of it

369
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.693
Are police forces available at any time?

370
00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.323
Considering the situation

371
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.158
yes

372
00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:42.997
(Dohan) But

373
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.503
Everyone is so confident...

374
00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:49.712
What can I say

375
00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:51.840
I feel strange

376
00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.564
[Sound of surprise]

377
00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.441
[shaking breathing]

378
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:15.321
What, team leader Gu hasn’t come back yet?

379
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.907
(Sangcheon) Those humans
I still can't understand the mood

380
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:21.327
A person who works in the field
Just call me

381
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.454
This is the problem with bureaucratic society

382
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.165
(Detective Park) Let’s be quiet.

383
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.042
[Sound of strength]

384
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.589
If you refer to this, you will be treated well.

385
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:35.592
(Sangcheon) Troublesome serial murders
They say they will solve it

386
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.302
Well, isn’t that something to be thankful for?

387
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.681
Witness protection program, something like that.
Shouldn’t it be operational?

388
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.850
(Detective Park) I’m shocked, Mr.

389
00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:47.645
Wow

390
00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:54.152
Our detective, working as a police officer
Is it worth making a living?

391
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.403
It must be Park Bong?

392
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.866
(Sangcheon) One detective I know is
Grab a jug of water and take it with you

393
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:03.536
Quit your job and become the owner of the building
I was living without making a fuss.

394
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.915
To our detective
I guess I haven't had a chance yet

395
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.210
Sleep a little harder, just a little bit.

396
00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:12.378
[laughter]

397
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.257
I'm hungry

398
00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:19.052
(Detective Park) Oh, really, really.

399
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.178
[Sangcheon’s strengthening sound]

400
00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.351
[Interesting music]

401
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.853
(Dohan) Nayeon is involved in this matter.
The reason why I have no choice but to hang on too much

402
00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.188
Now you know

403
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.942
Let’s dig together, Noh Sang-cheon’s whereabouts.

404
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.163
(Vocal cords) You know it shouldn’t be made public, right?

405
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.748
Noh Sang-cheon is alive

406
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:51.584
And now I'm showing off
Especially for the victims

407
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.003
[sigh]

408
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.303
[The door clicks open]

409
00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.476
(Dohan) Haven’t you heard from me?

410
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.269
(Detective Park) No, what are you thinking?

411
00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.696
(Dohan) Let’s eat.
[rustling sound]

412
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.322
Situations where you go to a restaurant to eat
I don't think so

413
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.282
Well, there may be people who recognize me.

414
00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:28.204
(Sangcheon) No, even alone
I had a good time eating outside.

415
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.164
Surprisingly, no one recognized me?

416
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.542
Eat and go to a safe place
move the place

417
00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:36.045
They once said this was the safest place

418
00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:38.798
(Dohan) Although it is safe
Not a place to stay for long

419
00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.678
(Sangcheon) Get out of the way

420
00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.141
Is there anything to eat like this?

421
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.434
[Dohan’s exasperated breathing]

422
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.530
(Sangcheon) Only 10 years have passed

423
00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:05.158
Korea has changed so much

424
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.993
Buildings are also coming into existence.

425
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:10.663
[Laughing] People also have money
It seems like a lot.

426
00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:14.417
There are plenty of opportunities

427
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.462
much more than then

428
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.133
I should have just stayed here

429
00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:24.177
I shouldn't have stowed away

430
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.304
How many times have I regretted

431
00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:31.559
Soon anyway
I could have come out

432
00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:35.855
[absurd gasping sound]

433
00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.569
Let's smoke a cigarette and go.

434
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.946
Hey, I was just thinking of this.

435
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.031
[light laughter]

436
00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:46.949
(Sangcheon) You even have sense

437
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:20.316
(Detective Park) I don’t know if I’m good at it.

438
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.110
Deviating from investigative principles

439
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:24.612
If I saw that face, I would beat you to death.

440
00:23:25.488 --> 00:23:27.323
(Dohan) That’s why the location was chosen here.

441
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.409
Even if such an impulse arises
I can't do anything

442
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.372
But that won't happen

443
00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:54.475
[laughter]

444
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.901
(Nayeon) Hello?

445
00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:05.111
This is Gudohan

446
00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:06.946
What's going on this morning?

447
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.823
I think Nayeon Cheon needs to know.

448
00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:10.867
[Meaningful music]

449
00:24:41.564 --> 00:24:42.857
[shaking breathing]

450
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.181
[Rough breathing]

451
00:25:24.607 --> 00:25:25.858
[Sangcheon’s strong breathing]

452
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:29.654
[Sangcheon’s light sigh]

453
00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:31.322
(Sangcheon) Let’s go

454
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:34.700
[Car starting sound]

455
00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:46.587
(Dohan) You guys were right.
Noh Sang-cheon was alive.

456
00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:50.591
To Nayeon Cheon and the victims
I think it's the duty to let people know.

457
00:25:51.384 --> 00:25:52.593
But Noh Sang-cheon

458
00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:55.012
Currently involved in a serial murder investigation.
You are a necessary helper.

459
00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:58.641
After solving the murder case
I just won't send it.

460
00:25:58.724 --> 00:25:59.767
I promise

461
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.811
(Nayeon) But
I have a favor to ask you.

462
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.980
I want to see it in person

463
00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:07.108
At least once that person with my eyes

464
00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:10.695
(Nayeon) What we were chasing
That it wasn't an illusion

465
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:12.363
I'll just check that

466
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:27.753
That's amazing, team leader Koo.

467
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.716
That woman under the bridge earlier

468
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:37.388
Who was there?

469
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:39.557
(Dohan) Because I can’t see

470
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.863
[mumbling sound]

471
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.823
[Reunion’s heavy breathing]

472
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:01.287
- (Yeon-Gwang) Did you see that person?
- (Reunion) What is ‘that person’?

473
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.705
Have you seen those two bastards?

474
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:09.337
Where are you now?
I need to kill that bastard! Mr.

475
00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.005
(Yeon-Gwang) I’m excited again, again, again

476
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:13.591
If only it were right in front of me
I wouldn't have been able to bear it either.

477
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:15.843
Twist that bastard right away
You have to bring it in front of us!

478
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:18.929
But they say it's needed to solve a murder case.

479
00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:20.056
- (Cheongju’s house) Huh?
- 노상천

480
00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.140
(상봉) 다 필요 없고

481
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:23.476
난 그 개새끼 모가지
당장 비틀어야겠어

482
00:27:24.894 --> 00:27:26.604
약속 지켰어요, 구 팀장

483
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:28.898
우리도 지켜야죠

484
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:31.192
지금 구 팀장
This is not the time to save face!

485
00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:33.611
I trust you, team leader Koo.

486
00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:35.446
(Sangbong) I told the police that
You still believe even after what happened?

487
00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:36.530
I believe it

488
00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:41.494
Someone we want to trust too
There has to be at least one

489
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:45.873
So that I can somehow hold on
I think I can survive

490
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.292
[People sigh]

491
00:27:48.376 --> 00:27:49.502
(Nayeon) More than that

492
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:52.671
Now what we can do
I have to worry about what is there.

493
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:53.964
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, that’s right

494
00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:56.384
Noh Sang-cheon, we can't send him away again.

495
00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:58.636
I can never let go

496
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.096
(Sangbong) How much did you suffer in China, Mr.

497
00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:04.725
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah, but that guy Noh Sang-cheon
Aside from being alive

498
00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:07.728
Ah, how come to our country?
Did it crawl in? uh?

499
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:17.113
(Sangdo) In Gyeongcheon
There was a murder

500
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:19.782
A note related to Noh Sang-cheon
They say he left the scene.

501
00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:22.326
(Jonghun) What? Is that the conman Noh Sang-cheon?

502
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.370
(Sangdo) Okay, I wonder what this is...

503
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:29.041
(Jonghun) Do you know the identity of the dead person?

504
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.126
(I don’t know)

505
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:33.504
Issues related to Noh Sang-cheon in the murder case
The only thing that came out was that

506
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:36.424
I will receive the information from Gyeongcheonseo.

507
00:28:36.507 --> 00:28:38.926
(Jonghun) But that information
Where did you hear that?

508
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.719
Does it matter?

509
00:28:40.803 --> 00:28:42.888
(Sangdo) Directly on site
Shouldn’t you go and see it?

510
00:28:43.097 --> 00:28:44.890
Please come back without causing rumors.
[Meaningful music]

511
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.018
[Jonghun’s sigh]

512
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:15.296
(Vocal voice) Me, deacon
Why did Jeong So-ram become like this?

513
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:18.174
(Deacon) Jeong So-ram is dead
I'll definitely keep it a secret

514
00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:19.717
To other people absolutely

515
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.637
Ah, no, it’s Jeong So-ram.
Why are you so dead?

516
00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:25.723
I went here a few days ago too.

517
00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:28.225
(Deacon) No matter who died
That's not important now

518
00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:30.686
These guys are showing off their skills
The problem is where I started

519
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.481
No, from simple threats.
You're taking it one step further

520
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:35.065
So that threat

521
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:38.194
Do Sangcheon Noh gold bars really exist?

522
00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:42.031
Wow, Rep. Kim really doesn’t know.
Are you pretending not to know?

523
00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.366
Or are you looking at me now?

524
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.035
yes sorry

525
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.412
Well, Noh Sang-cheon can't come in.

526
00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:50.414
That person now
Come to Korea

527
00:29:50.498 --> 00:29:51.749
(Vocal cords) There will be an uproar.

528
00:29:51.832 --> 00:29:53.292
I know, I know

529
00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:56.086
That bastard keeps coming in
I wanted to but I was the one who stopped it

530
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.630
(Deacon) You must never come in.

531
00:29:57.713 --> 00:29:59.381
Many people besides us will bleed

532
00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:01.634
Moreover, I know that everyone has lost it.

533
00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:06.305
(Vocal cords) Well, so much
Because he’s unpredictable.

534
00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:08.641
When you come in, you may act unexpectedly.

535
00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:11.602
It's not just us that's dangerous
Isn't it true?

536
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:14.396
To Noh Sang-cheon too
I need to tell you that Jeong So-ram is dead.

537
00:30:15.689 --> 00:30:17.358
Even that bastard's communication was cut off.

538
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:19.568
What is email contact?
It's not even the Joseon Dynasty.

539
00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:23.948
Does a similar incident occur in the police department?
I'll tell you to check it out.

540
00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:25.699
[Call end sound]

541
00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:27.243
[sigh]

542
00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:30.162
[nervous music]
[Youngjin’s scared voice]

543
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:35.417
[Man 1 laughs]
[Youngjin’s painful moans]

544
00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:39.713
[groans with difficulty]

545
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:45.219
(Man 1) Where is the gold bar?
You were talking here and there?

546
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.762
(Youngjin) I don’t know, really.

547
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:52.518
Go to China and find Noh Sang-cheon
I was going to ask

548
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:55.271
(Man 1) Noh Sang-cheon
Do you know where it is in China?

549
00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:59.066
[Sobbing] I really don’t know.

550
00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:03.821
(Youngjin) With a needle
No matter how hard I try, I can't figure it out

551
00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:07.700
(Man 2) I know that the ban exists.

552
00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:09.660
You don’t know where Noh Sang-cheon is?

553
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.413
Okay, that's it.

554
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:13.497
[Call end sound]

555
00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:17.042
[Screaming scared]

556
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:22.006
[Sound of stabbing with a knife]
[groans with difficulty]

557
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.601
[dark music]

558
00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:39.231
[Each cell phone rings]

559
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:41.525
[cell phone vibrating sound]

560
00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:46.322
(Yeon-gwang) 'Gyeongsu-ro 75 again...'

561
00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:48.157
Is this a strange text message again?

562
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.075
Is it similar to the one that came a month ago?

563
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:53.370
No, but why is this
Do you keep sending it? who?

564
00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:58.334
(Reunion) He died in Gyeongcheon City.
Did you say Jeong So-ram?

565
00:31:58.542 --> 00:31:59.710
I checked your face

566
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.712
Jeong So-ram is right.

567
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:04.173
(Yeon-Gwang) What is this too?
Doesn’t that mean someone died?

568
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:09.178
This text has nothing to do with us.

569
00:32:18.771 --> 00:32:19.772
[The door slams shut]

570
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:20.856
[Call connection tone]

571
00:32:23.067 --> 00:32:26.236
Because I feel unwell
Because it's hard to go out to open the door

572
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.238
(Man 2) Please come in directly.

573
00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:37.373
(Sangdo) If this incident continues
Place them as the most capable detectives.

574
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.458
Above all, a flexible person

575
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:43.879
Cover it up well when something goes wrong
As a detective who can protect you

576
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:45.214
[Call connection tone]

577
00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:48.300
(Dohan) [in a drowsy voice]
Yes, I got a call.

578
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:50.594
You need to go to the scene.

579
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.722
(Man 2) There is no reaction.
These damn bastards

580
00:32:53.806 --> 00:32:54.848
Two people died

581
00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:57.393
(Man 1) At this point
Kill a human on that side too.

582
00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:01.605
Noh Sang-cheon and him
If you kill someone with whom you are closely connected,

583
00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:02.940
There will be a reaction

584
00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:08.445
Okay needs to go away quickly
That bastard doesn't give a damn

585
00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:11.615
(Man 2) As expected, it was Jeong Jae-hwang’s doing.
Because I think I'm sure

586
00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:16.829
This time, almost at the same time as work time.
Send text message to victims

587
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.330
to appear on the scene

588
00:33:24.128 --> 00:33:25.129
[surprised gasp]

589
00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:31.552
(Byungjun) Hey, Park, Mr. Park Gwang-shin.
Mr. Park Gwang-shin!

590
00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:34.513
Hey

591
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.390
[Byungjun’s urgent breathing]

592
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:40.644
[siren sound]
[panicked breathing]

593
00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:44.273
[camera shutter sound]

594
00:33:51.989 --> 00:33:53.866
[nervous music]

595
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:57.619
[tire rubbing sound]

596
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.387
(Vocal cords) These bastards
It's getting bolder

597
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:17.014
Even killing a fanatic?

598
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:19.475
The pattern is also changing

599
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:21.685
After Jeong So-ram was killed,

600
00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.605
After a while, I sent a text message to the victims.

601
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:27.858
It was around the time when Song Young-jin’s body was discovered.

602
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:29.485
But this time, Park Kwang-shin

603
00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:33.322
Almost in real time with the time of the crime
I sent you a text

604
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:36.784
The victim group now takes care of it.
I was confident it would move.

605
00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:38.535
(Sangdo) The first victim

606
00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:42.164
Was it Jeong So-ram?

607
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.875
Don't tell Deputy Director Kang yet.

608
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:46.502
Because that friend is also on the notebook list.

609
00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:48.295
(Sangdo) It was exactly as listed.

610
00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:50.589
Hey, then
Can't I die too?

611
00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:53.842
Don't make a fuss
Because we are taking measures

612
00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:56.386
(Sangdo) Boy, what they want is
I heard it's Noh Sang-cheon.

613
00:34:57.596 --> 00:35:00.224
Is Noh Sang-cheon really alive?

614
00:35:02.184 --> 00:35:03.268
Are you alive?

615
00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:06.063
Like this for me too
Are you blocking information?

616
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:10.692
I, no, we
You said you would take care of it, right?

617
00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:13.278
I'm in danger too
Park’s sword is not the only dangerous thing!

618
00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:17.074
[Angrily breathing]

619
00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:19.827
(Man 2) To our river conductor
I didn't plan on killing you

620
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.411
It's a bit complicated

621
00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:22.871
[In a strained voice] Why are you...

622
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.998
[Rattling] Honorably
Let's commit suicide.

Where, fuck, let’s go till the end

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.268
[Man 2 laughs]

628
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:50.774
(Deacon) Accept negotiation
Noh Sang-cheon’s entry is being processed.

629
00:35:50.858 --> 00:35:53.402
The case needs to be concluded neatly.

630
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:55.320

(Man 2) Confirmed.

634
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:04.079
Yes, now I will do whatever you want.

635
00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:06.373
(Man 1) Let’s go tomorrow

636
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.457
[Call end sound]

637
00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:10.252
that you wanted to go to
To that country house

638
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:13.088
[Man 2 laughs]
Let's go and farm together.

[Man 1 laughs]

640
00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.391
(Man 2) Let’s stay here for a few days.

641
00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:28.312
I'll do some recording before that.

642
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:31.940
(Jae Hwang) I’m not recording.

643
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.943
Something like that

644
00:36:35.027 --> 00:36:36.862
[heavy music]

645
00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:37.988
Are you trying to kill me?

(Man 1) This guy
[Man 1’s sound of strength]

647
00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:44.328
AC, the blood...

648

[Jaehwang’s groans of difficulty]

649
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.713
What is it?

650
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:59.301
[Jaehwang’s surprised gasp]
(Jae Hwang) These bastards
Don't touch my mom

652
00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:05.766
No, I'm you guys.
I'll kill them all!

[Jaehwang cries]

654
00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:12.064
(Jaehwang) I'm tired, there's no hope anymore

655
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:13.982
[Crying] I'm going to die

656
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.909
I must have written a good will too.

657
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.870
(Man 2) Mom never
I promise I won't touch you

658
00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:29.498
(Man 1) Just this life

659
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.960
Unluckily, I got involved with Noh Sang-cheon.
I think it's ruined

660
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.229
[groans with difficulty]

661
00:37:59.194 --> 00:38:01.363
It was all sorted out by Jeong Jae-hwang.

662
00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:03.573
Now keep your promise.

663
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.326

What, why are you going in the opposite direction?

669

(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, where are you going?

670
00:39:11.058 --> 00:39:12.601
Oh, wait.

(Man 1) That bastard

673
00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:27.532
Are you sure there are gold bars left behind?

674
00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:30.660
(Man 2) Without saying anything
If you look at entering Korea

675
00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:32.788
There is no money left in China anymore.

676
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.749
Then there will be gold bars, money, or whatever.

677
00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:39.086
But don't trust that guy

678
00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:43.423
No matter how hard you fly or crawl
It's a scammer.

679
00:39:44.216 --> 00:39:46.843

Isn’t it funny that the police didn’t confiscate it?

683
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.684
[Laughing slightly] It’s a trap.

684
00:39:54.768 --> 00:39:56.520
(Man 2) They’ll just wait for our phone call.

685
00:39:56.603 --> 00:39:59.064
[Beep sound]
Let's see

686
00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.816
I crossed the Magang Bridge

687
00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:04.027
Where is Noh Sangcheon now?
Are you taking me away?

688
00:40:05.529 --> 00:40:07.447
Should I make a call at this point?

689
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:09.866
[cell phone vibrating sound]

690
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:15.914
[nervous music]
[Sangcheon’s trembling breathing]

691
00:40:16.373 --> 00:40:17.374
to speaker

692
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:22.087
Hello?

693
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.630
(Man 2) Are they next to the detectives?

694
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.217
-If there is?
- (Man 2) Change it.

695
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:30.971
(Dohan) Tell me

696
00:40:31.054 --> 00:40:33.390
(Male 2) Noh Sang-cheon
Get me out of the car right now

697
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:34.933
I heard that phone

698
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:37.310
No, Noh Sang-cheon is accused of fraud.
We'll reinvestigate

699
00:40:37.394 --> 00:40:40.021
Murder, no, not with you

700
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.940
[laughter]

701
00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:44.192
Don't be a dick
Get me out of the car right now

702
00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:46.069
(Man 2) Don’t even think about following me.

703
00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:49.197
If you don't do what you're told
It will start again

704
00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.282
murder

705
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:54.286
Someone will die again
it's all your responsibility

706
00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:55.996
rescued

707
00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:00.458
[Sangcheon’s Sigh]

708
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.171
(Sangcheon) No, I, I won’t get off.

709
00:41:04.254 --> 00:41:05.297
If I go, I'll die

710
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.673
Why kill the person who asked you to come?

711
00:41:06.756 --> 00:41:08.175
You don't have any gold bars

712
00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:11.178
They tortured me to give me gold bars
Those bastards are going to kill me

713
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:13.597
Even if I get off here
Just don't get caught by those guys.

714
00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:16.892
Isn’t running away your specialty?

715
00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:20.020
Hey, former team leader
Were you this kind of person?

716
00:41:20.854 --> 00:41:24.191
Look at me, look at this old man

717
00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:26.026
(Sangcheon) You have to protect me

718
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.613
Help me get revenge too!
[Sangcheon’s heavy breathing]

719
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:33.074
We're one team, don't you know how to cooperate?

720
00:41:33.783 --> 00:41:36.620
You just unilaterally suggested it.
I didn't agree

721
00:41:36.703 --> 00:41:37.704
(Sangcheon) So...

722
00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:41.541
Are you saying I should just get off here now?

723
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.084
Without any solution?

724
00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:46.213
[Dohan sighs]
[rattling sound]

725
00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:50.300
(Dohan) Location tracking is also possible
It's a GPS, keep it hidden.

726
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:51.718
[Sangcheon’s embarrassed breathing]

727
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.261
Stop the car in front of me

728
00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:55.430
(Sangcheon) Former team leader

729
00:42:14.074 --> 00:42:16.076
[Sangcheon’s heavy breathing]

730
00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:18.119
(Sangcheon) Is it right to do this?

731
00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:19.329
Are you really confident?

732
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:20.413
(Dohan) Let’s stop the murder first.

733
00:42:20.497 --> 00:42:22.958
(Sangcheon) Still, the police
How could this...

734
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:24.876
Former team leader!

735
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:26.670
Saved!

736
00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.050
[Embarrassed sound]

737
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:36.137
(Detective Park) Who follows you?

738
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.056
[dark music]
I don't

739
00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:39.933
They say don't follow them.

740
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:44.020
(Detective Park) Oh, then what about Noh Sang-cheon?
What if I get caught by those guys?

741
00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:47.649
(Dohan) I don’t care if I get caught.
[Sangcheon’s disapproving breath]

742
00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:50.902
Because that bastard’s words are all lies anyway.

743
00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:02.330
[cell phone vibrating sound]

744
00:43:07.544 --> 00:43:08.837
(Detective Park) Ah, Noh Sang-cheon.
Whether you get caught or die

745
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.213
Are you saying it doesn't matter?

746
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:13.883
No, you should apologize to the victim.

747
00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:15.343
I also have to compensate

748
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:19.556
Until then, Noh Sang-cheon must not die.

749
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.266
I won't die either

750
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:23.560
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, what kind of plan are you planning?

751
00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.229
(Reunion) There it is

752
00:43:26.313 --> 00:43:28.440
(Yeon-Gwang) What is that?
Isn’t this the former team leader’s car?

753
00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:30.191
Are you really following Team Leader Gu?

754
00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:31.943
[The encouraging sound of reunion]

755
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.571
Ah, why...

756
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.367
A murder case is a murder case
Our case is our case.

757
00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:40.910
What do you mean, that?

758
00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:47.584
[tire rubbing sound]
[Sangcheon’s urgent breathing]

759
00:43:51.087 --> 00:43:52.464
(Sangcheon) Let go! Let go!

760
00:43:52.922 --> 00:43:54.090
[Sangcheon’s strengthening sound]

761
00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:56.009

[cell phone vibrating sound]

764
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:06.102
(Gukhyeon) Gudohan

765
00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:10.565
tell me

766
00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.484
What are you going to do?

767
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:14.194
Are you going to save Noh Sang-cheon?

768
00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:16.112
(Dohan) Are you going to let me die?

769
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:18.698
[상천의 힘겨운 신음]

770
00:44:20.784 --> 00:44:22.035
(상봉) 잡아 올 거야, 내가

771
00:44:22.118 --> 00:44:23.745
노상천 개새끼
[연광의 한숨]

[상봉의 힘주는 소리]
[연광의 놀란 탄성]

773
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.706
[긴장되는 음악]
(연광) 미쳤어? brother!

774
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:28.416
[car horn]

775
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.295
Huh? Bro, bro, bro, bro, are you crazy? brother!

776
00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:33.421
[Yeon-Gwang’s surprised exclamation]

777
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:38.426
(Kookhyun) We have to rescue them, where should we dispatch them?

778
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:39.719
[tire rubbing sound]
[Yeon-Gwang’s scream]

779
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:41.346
(Detective Park) Oh, fuck, what?

780
00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:43.640
[Detective Park’s surprised exclamation]

781

[A crashing sound is heard]

784
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:53.733
(Sangdo) What’s going on?

785
00:44:55.902 --> 00:44:57.028
[hissing sound]

786
00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:00.490

[The urgent breathing of reunion]

788
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:11.793
Where is this bastard Noh Sang-cheon? uh?

789
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:13.962
Mr. Sangbong Kim, what are you doing now?

790
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.922
Where is Noh Sang-cheon? uh?
[Detective Park chuckles]

791
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:17.006
[Dohan groans with difficulty]

792

[Yeon-Gwang’s labored groans]

794
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:22.303
Where is Noh Sang-cheon...
[Reunion’s difficult groans]

795
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.597
- (Detective Shin) Wow, is this it?
- (Reunion) Hey! Hey, let it go, let it go!

796
00:45:24.681 --> 00:45:26.224
- (Yeon-Gwang) Oh, hey, wait a minute.
- (Reunion) Let go! Mr.

797
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:28.017
(Yeon-gwang) No, that, Noh Sang-cheon
I thought it was there
[Sangbong is bitter]

798
00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:30.228
I didn't do that on purpose, okay?

799
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:31.896
Where did Noh Sang-cheon take it?

800
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.065
(Reunion) Huh? That bastard is ours
Where are you?

801
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:36.484
Noh Sang-cheon would have been captured by now.

802
00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:37.569
To the suspects

803
00:45:37.652 --> 00:45:38.653
[Yeon-Gwang’s surprised gasp]
(Reunion) What?

804
00:45:42.866 --> 00:45:44.868
(Dohan) Let’s go, No Sang-cheon’s location has been checked.

805
00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:46.953
Two people handle the accident

806
00:45:47.454 --> 00:45:48.455
(Yeon-Gwang) No...

807
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:50.123
But why did you let them get caught?

808
00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:52.333
I'm working with detectives.
Why was Noh Sang-cheon arrested?

809
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:55.462
For you, no, for you

810
00:45:55.545 --> 00:45:56.546
What do you mean?

811
00:45:56.629 --> 00:45:58.548
We have to catch the murderer and catch Noh Sang-cheon as well.

812
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.341
(Dohan) And the juniors too

813
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.177
So don't do this again

814
00:46:05.972 --> 00:46:07.348
[Reunion’s heavy breathing]

815
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:26.201

Noh Sang-cheon and the criminal, their relationship

816
00:46:29.454 --> 00:46:30.997
[Bird chirping]

817
00:46:35.418 --> 00:46:37.086
[Sangcheon’s frightened breathing]

818
00:46:50.183 --> 00:46:51.351
[Man 2’s sound of strength]

819
00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:53.019
(Man 1) Where is the gold bar?
[surprised gasp]

820
00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:55.438
(Sangcheon) I’ll give it to you

821
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:57.899
I will give it to you

822
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:02.111
Well, if I tell you where it is

823
00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:05.698
You're going to kill me
So, let’s go find it together.

824
00:47:05.782 --> 00:47:06.824
Where is it?

825
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.497
(Man 2) Where is it?

826
00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:21.589
(Man 1) That’s right, which one is it?

827
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.301
Baby, fuck

828
00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:28.805
How did you know?

829
00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:40.817

[Meaningful music]

831
00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:06.593
You had a lot of trouble

832
00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:15.810
Do you trust me? This Noh Sang-cheon

833
00:48:16.019 --> 00:48:17.353
Anyway, those bastards are part of the same group.

834
00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:19.314
(Detective Park) So, everything is planned and beaten.
What does GoStop mean?

835
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.107
(Detective Shin) Is there really Noh Sang-cheon?

836
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:25.320
GPS is still working
That means there wasn't even a body search.

837
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:27.196
(Sangcheon) Do you believe me?

838
00:48:31.284 --> 00:48:32.952
[siren sound]
