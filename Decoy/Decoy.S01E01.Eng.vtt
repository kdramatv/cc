Over 200,000 cases

179
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.704
I don’t think Detective Jang should be fired.

180
00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:22.122
Me?

181
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.915
I think I'll just be honest for a few months.

182

Still, this is a good save.

(Detective Park) It’s a murder case.

248

249
00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:27.487

Recently, only murder cases
Receive direct reports

263

264
00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.125
Why bother?

265
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.085

But why is Team Leader Koo?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:57.952
Oh, no.

271
00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.537
The former team leader will never do it.

272

No, have you been disciplined?
It's been less than a week

273
00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.041

281
00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.887
(Jonghoon) You need to go to the scene.

282
00:18:58.888 --> 00:18:59.931
Me?

283
00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:02.976
Oh, did you forget? I'm being disciplined

284
00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.813
(Jonghun) I will take responsibility and release you.
Go quickly

285
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.109
[Sighing] No, that's not what I meant.

286
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.112
(Dohan) I am now
I'm having a good time

287
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.906
But I have to give up on this
Is there a reason?

288
00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.659
(Jonghoon) It’s a murder case.

289

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.982
(Detective Park) You came earlier than I thought.
Were you at home?

293
00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:52.108
(Dohan) Why do you think that’s the case?

294
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.443
(Detective Park) Is there a grudge?
Well, looking at how I live

295
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.153
Well, isn't it a money issue or something?

296
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.113
(Dohan) Why do you think my disciplinary action was lifted?

297
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.197
In the eyes of seniors

298
00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.991
(Detective Park) I’m also a police officer.
It's been 10 years and this is my first time seeing it.

299
00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.409
This is how the disciplinary action is lifted

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:26.059
(Detective Park) Now the body
It's time to adapt

No matter how many times I look at it, I can't get used to it...

305
00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:32.023
(Detective Shin) Well, in detail.
I don't think there's any need to look.

306
00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:36.361
After subduing the victim and tying him up
Killed instantly with a single knife through the heart

307
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.364
I didn't kill him right after tying him up.

308
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:40.949
(Detective Park) Yes?

309
00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.116
There was torture

310
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.618
- (Detective Shin) Yes?
- (Detective Park) You mean torture?

311
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:44.744
(Detective Park) Where?

312
00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.038
Hey there

313
00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:53.294
(Dohan) Torture
I said I did it because I had something to figure out.

314
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.173
Then, robbery or accidental murder
That's not true

315

316
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.302

317

(Detective Shin) Yes, the phone has been secured.

318
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.681
Who first discovered it?

319
00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.140
(Detective Park) I asked you to come back.

320

322
00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.232
I'm so behind on my delivery, now, Mr.

323
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.776
(Detective Park) Boy, give me some professional spirit.
That's brilliant, it only takes a moment!

324
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.027
I told you everything earlier.

325
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.487
(Deliveryman) That’s it?

326
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:20.947
Ah, Mr.

327
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.366
When delivery came
I said the door was open

328
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.326
- (Dohan) It was open, right?
- [Sighing] That's right.

329
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.537
Remember it well

330
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.289
Was it open?

331
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.958
Or did you open it yourself?

332
00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:36.170
[sigh]

333
00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:38.881
Oh, that's actually it

[telephone ringing sound]

335
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.092
(Deliveryman) Yes

336
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.429
(Man 3) Because I feel unwell
Because it's hard to go out to open the door

337
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.222
Could you please come in directly?

338
00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:47.432
(Deliveryman) Yes? What...

339
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.933
(Man 3) The door will be open.

340
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.310
(Deliveryman) Ah, ah, yes
Well, okay, yeah

341
00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.604
[People are murmuring]

342
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.233
(Detective Park) The guy who called the Chinese restaurant
He must be the culprit.

343
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.360
Did the criminal call on purpose?

344
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:02.697
I hope you discover it as late as possible
That's their mentality

345
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.700
(Dohan) The later it is, the later it is
Because the evidence disappears that much

346
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.910
(Detective Shin) Then someone
I came to this house by chance

347
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:10.371
found the body
Did you call a Chinese restaurant?

348
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:13.458
When Detective Shin discovers the body,
Are you going to call the Chinese restaurant first?

349
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:16.419
(Dohan) Well, like a corpse.
Do you want to order some Jjajangmyeon?

350
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:18.171
(Detective Shin) Wow, you called a Chinese restaurant, right?

351
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:19.547
112 Not at the center

352
00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:26.304
Instead of calling the center, I called a Chinese restaurant.
If it's the real culprit

353
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.847
There must be some purpose

354
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.600
(Detective Park) The phone number for the order at that time
Since I'm picking, something will come out.

355
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:31.934
[camera shutter sound]

356
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.644
(Woman 1) Do you know someone?

357
00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:34.812
(Man 4) No.

358
00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.777
Hey, let's borrow the phone.

359
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.111
(Man 5) There is no battery.

360
00:22:45.156 --> 00:22:46.157
[People are murmuring]

361
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.241
No...

362
00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:48.743
[Man 5 groans in pain]
(Detective Park) What is it?

363
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.079
What, what, what? What is it, what is it?

364
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.624
(Dohan) Solve it

365
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:55.958
Do you want to go to the library and solve it here?

366
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.376
[Man 5’s heavy breathing]

367
00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:06.385
(Detective Park) What is it?

368
00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:11.933
(Dohan) What is this?

369
00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:13.559
[dark music]
You know this is a violation of portrait rights, right?

370
00:23:14.143 --> 00:23:16.479
(Man 5) I will erase it, just erase it.

371
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.028
[Man 5's sound of encouragement]
[Detective Park’s groans of difficulty]

372
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:25.988
(Dohan) Hey, what are you doing, catch it!
[nervous music]

373
00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:27.115
Hey, sir!

374
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.158
(Detective Park) Come here!
[Woman 2’s surprised voice]

375
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:32.870
(Dohan) What is this guy?

376
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:33.996
(Detective Park) Hey!

377
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.123
[Man 5’s urgent voice]

378
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:38.668
(Detective Shin) Aren’t you standing there? Mr.

379
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:40.628
[Detectives' bewildered sounds]

380
00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:42.171
(Detective Park) Hey, you fucking bastard.

381
00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.464
(Detective Shin) Hey, aren’t you standing there?

382
00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:46.175
[Dohan’s heavy breathing]
- (Detective Park) You go to the temple, there!
- (Detective Shin) Yes

383
00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:48.052
[tire rubbing sound]

384
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:49.470
[car horn]
[Detectives’ urgent sounds]

385
00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:51.764
[tire rubbing sound]
[Man 5’s surprised voice]

386
00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:55.852
[Man 5’s urgent voice]

387
00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:57.311
[Roaring]

388
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.564
[Detective Park’s encouraging voice]

389
00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.649
[Man 5’s groans of difficulty]

390
00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:03.192
(Detective Shin) Stay still, man!

391
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:04.735
- (Detective Park) Take it easy
- (Detective Shin) You’re hurt, man!

392
00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:07.029
(Detective Park) Hey, why did you jump out? Mr.
[Detective Shin’s encouraging voice]

393
00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:09.198
Hold on
[Dohan’s heavy breathing]

394
00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:10.324
What is this?

395
00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:13.661
This guy took the picture first

396
00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:15.663
This bastard comes first before the police come!

397
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.374
(Detective Park) Yes?

398
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.341
I can explain everything

399
00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:29.010
You said you didn't ask for a lawyer, right?

400
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:31.596
Yeah, it's just a misunderstanding.
You don't even need a lawyer

401
00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:33.347
(Dohan) Then let’s be honest.

402
00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:36.350
[Sighing] Why did you kill him?

403
00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:37.643
(Man 5) It’s not really me.

404
00:24:37.727 --> 00:24:39.729
I went to meet that person
Because he was dead.

405
00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:41.647
That's it, really.

406
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.610
But why didn't you report it to the police?

407
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.112
[shaking breathing]
(Man 5) I was scared.

408
00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:51.032
But I called a Chinese restaurant and
Do you encourage reporting?

409
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:52.116
You mean a Chinese restaurant?

410
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.327
You called a Chinese restaurant.
For the delivery man to find it

411
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.411
No, no
[dark music]

412
00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:57.413
(Man 5) I’ve never done that before.
I just took a picture

413
00:24:58.164 --> 00:24:59.832
[camera shutter sound]
[Man 5’s trembling breathing]

414
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.834
[camera shutter sound]

415
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.172
[Knocking sound]
(Deliveryman) Delivery!

416
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.341
I'll go in

417
00:25:10.218 --> 00:25:11.677
[Sound of pouring water]

418
00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:19.101
[Man 5’s nervous breathing]

419
00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:25.608
(Dohan) So

420
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.320
Coincidentally, the day I went to that house
the victim was dead

421
00:25:29.403 --> 00:25:31.239
Did you take a photo as a souvenir?

422
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:34.575
No, well, collecting pictures of corpses.
Do you have any perverted hobbies?

423
00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:36.160
[sigh]

424
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.415
I don't know why I'm here

425
00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:43.751
I'm a victim too, a victim.

426
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:46.462
(Man 5) So Song Young-jin is that person.
Because I went to meet you.

427
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.256
Are you an acquaintance of the deceased Song Young-jin?

428
00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:50.007
Not even an acquaintance.

429
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.509
I'm a victim too

430
00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:53.552
Byungjun Lee is currently a suspect.

431
00:25:53.803 --> 00:25:55.513
(Dohan) Stop criticizing the victims.

432
00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:57.765
[sigh]

433
00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:03.145
I'm a victim
[heavy music]

434
00:26:03.688 --> 00:26:04.730
(Byungjun) Me too

435
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:07.483
why are you ignoring what i say

436
00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:11.737
I was told that I was a victim of the conman Song Young-jin.

437
00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:13.781
you guys

438
00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:16.575
You don’t know the identity of the dead Song Young-jin, right?

439
00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:18.202
We are looking into your personal information.

440
00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:19.287
[Byungjun snorts]

441
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:24.333
Let’s find out who that person is first.

442
00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:27.670
(Byungjun) And who am I?

443
00:26:28.379 --> 00:26:32.508
I'm here sometimes
I'm not the type of person to be interrogated

444
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.011
Because of you fucking police officers.

445
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:37.638
This is a person whose life is ruined!

446
00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:38.723
however!

447
00:26:38.973 --> 00:26:41.559
You guys are keeping me here?

448
00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.561
[Grunting]

449
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.902
When you're done, sit there.

450
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:53.612
[sigh]

451
00:26:56.907 --> 00:26:58.617
(Byungjun) Noh Sangcheon killed him.

452
00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:03.205
The dead Song Young-jin was killed by Noh Sang-cheon.

453
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:06.459
That bastard is with Noh Sang-cheon.

454
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:08.961
He's a cheap guy even if he dies anyway.

455
00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:10.129
Who is Noh Sang-cheon?

456
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:12.506
I'm a victim of those bastards

457
00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:17.094
Noh Sang-cheon, Song Young-jin

458
00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:23.184
But you police
What did you do for me when I was having a hard time?

459
00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:26.312
You haven't caught Noh Sang-cheon yet.

460
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:28.481
No, you didn't even try to catch it, right?

461
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:31.859
And now you're accusing me of being a murderer?

462
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:33.527
[Knocking sound]

463
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:35.863
(Detective Park) There’s something you need to see.

464
00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:46.707
[The door slams shut]

465
00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:48.793
[Angry breathing]

466
00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:57.968
[Byungjun mutters]

467
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.347
(Detective Park) Victim Song Young-jin
New product has arrived

468
00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:03.265
The record is very flashy.

469
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:05.226
It hasn't been long since the bread came out.

470
00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:07.478
(Dohan) What was it? The crime

471
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.604
(Detective Park) You know Noh Sang-cheon, right?

472
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:10.940
(Dohan) Noh Sangcheon?

473
00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:13.776
Oh, they also say that Noh Sangcheon is a target.

474
00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:16.654
Wait, if it’s Nosangcheon

475
00:28:17.488 --> 00:28:19.782
Could this be Noh Sang-cheon of the Ponzi scheme?

476
00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:20.908
(Detective Park) Yes

477
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:23.661
The dead Song Young-jin
It was one of Noh Sang-cheon's gang.

478
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.705
It's also one of my closest associates.
It was the perfect right arm.

479
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.457
- Are you sure?
- (Detective Park) Yes

480
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:30.876
Together since the beginning
He was a guy who was running a scam.

481
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.010
[The door clicks open]

482
00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:42.346
(Detective Shin) Team leader, before Song Young-jin dies.

483
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.765
reported to the 112 center
I received the transcript

484
00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:45.891
Turn it on

485
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.977
(Police officer 1 in the recording) Yes
This is the 112 reporting center.

486
00:28:48.602 --> 00:28:50.521
(Youngjin in the recording) [Sobbing]
Please save me

487
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:51.647
(Police officer 1 in the recording) Yes?

488
00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:54.733
Please tell me in detail

489
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.528
(Youngjin in the recording) Noh Sangcheon

490
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.906
They're trying to kill me

491
00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:02.491
(Police officer 1 in the recording) Yes?

492
00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:04.577
Who is that?

493
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.661
[Youngjin’s scared sound in the recording]

494
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:06.829
Where are you now?

495
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:08.414
[Youngjin’s labored moans in the recording]

496
00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:09.957
(Detective Shin) That’s it.

497
00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:12.793
(Detective Park) It’s Noh Sang-cheon again?

498
00:29:14.128 --> 00:29:16.380
Ah, but Noh Sang-cheon died a long time ago.

499
00:29:18.007 --> 00:29:19.717
(Dohan) Are you a ghost or what?

500
00:29:23.012 --> 00:29:24.013
[Elevator arrival sound]

501
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.516
- (Dohan) Ah, Deputy Director
- (Jonghoon) Oh

502
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.560
(Jong-hoon) There was a rumor going around that Noh Sang-cheon killed him.

503
00:29:29.643 --> 00:29:30.978
What happened?

504
00:29:31.312 --> 00:29:32.771
(Dohan) Boy, do you believe that?

505
00:29:32.855 --> 00:29:34.565
Why are you doing this to the conductor?

506
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:37.234
(Jonghoon) Because it can’t be like that.
I'm not asking now

507
00:29:37.318 --> 00:29:40.279
Noh Sang-cheon is killing the center.
A report came in too.

508
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:43.741
(Dohan) The center case was caused by coercion.
It is likely to be a report

509
00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:45.117
Why do you think that?

510
00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:46.702
There are signs of torture on the body.

511
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.496
(Dohan) I even had time to torture him.

512
00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:49.914
Should they have just let me report it?

513
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.249
Noh Sang-cheon was probably just ordered to do it.

514
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.877
Maybe the reason for the torture
Maybe that was it.

515
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.713
Hmm, they tortured me into reporting it?

516
00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.466
(Dohan) Yes, well, that’s a possibility too.
I mean, there is

517
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.011
[Sighing] Suspect caught at the scene

518
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.888
(Jonghun) What is the possibility that he is the culprit?

519
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:07.598
(Dohan) Yes, we should investigate further.

520
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:10.768
Just a photo taken at the scene of the crime
the evidence is too weak

521
00:30:11.227 --> 00:30:12.770
CCTV footage from the day of the crime

522
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:15.064
When the DNA results obtained from the weapon are released,

523
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:16.857
I'm trying to compile and judge.

524
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:19.944
[Sighing] That guy has to be the culprit.

525
00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:24.448
It doesn’t make sense to call it Noh Sang-cheon.

526
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:26.784
Yes, but

527
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:30.788
The suspect is also said to be Noh Sang-cheon.
I am claiming

528
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:33.832
Crazy guy, dead person
how do you kill

529
00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:36.252
That's right

530
00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:38.462
That guy is the culprit

531
00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:42.550
(Jonghoon) To manipulate the scene after killing him
I went and got caught.

532
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:45.511
And Amon Noh Sang-cheon
They're dragging me in.

533
00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:46.679
Isn't it?

534
00:30:47.972 --> 00:30:49.807
Oh, are you possessed by a suspect?

535
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.517
(Dohan) Why do you know so well?

536
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:54.562
Well, that's the situation.

537
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:56.105
(Jonghoon) Time to investigate the suspect
You need more, right?

538
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.357
I will request an arrest warrant from the prosecutors.

539
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:00.484
(Dohan) Photo taken at the murder scene
Just one thing

540
00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:01.902
It must be hard to get a warrant.

541
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.571
It will come out if I talk about it.

542
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:06.865
Oh, and
If you say the ridiculous command of Nosangcheon,

543
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:08.409
Because it hurts so much

544
00:31:08.492 --> 00:31:10.494
(Jonghun) Exposure to the media is prohibited for the time being.

545
00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:14.331
Let's deal with this case quickly.

546
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:22.381
[sigh]

547
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.507
(Police 2) Stop it.

548
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:25.342
(Police 3) No, I can’t go in.

549
00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:27.928
(Nayeon) I’m a lawyer.
Attorney for the suspect, Lee Byeong-jun!

550
00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:29.888
(Police 2) Apply for an interview in advance
You didn't do it.

551
00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:31.599
(Nayeon) [Sighing] Ah
You didn't have time

552
00:31:31.682 --> 00:31:33.267
Time to apply!

553
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.102
(Do-han) Are you a lawyer, Byeong-jun Lee?

554
00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:45.070
(Nayeon) This is lawyer Nayeon Jeong.
I came to meet Mr. Byungjun Lee.

555
00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:48.365
Mr. Lee Byeong-jun
I said you don't need a lawyer?

556
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:50.826
A family member requested it.

557
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.786
Mr. Byungjun Lee probably doesn’t know.

558
00:31:58.709 --> 00:31:59.752
Come this way.

559
00:32:04.882 --> 00:32:06.091
[The door clicks open]

560
00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:21.523
This is Jeong Na-yeon

561
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:25.110
I'm a lawyer
A family member requested it.

562
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:26.695
Ah...

563
00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:28.697
(Byungjun) Yes

564
00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:46.048
(Nayeon) The voice reception of the meeting lawyer is
You know it's illegal, right?

565
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.466
(Detective Park) What should we do?

566
00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:50.469
(Dohan) Off
[Interesting music]

567
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.054
[device operating sound]

568
00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:10.781
no

569
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.909
- (Detective Shin) Yes?
- That woman is not a lawyer.

570
00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:15.619
Did you check the business card?

571
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:17.871
See you

572
00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:21.750
(Dohan) All bags, clothes, shoes

573
00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:24.211
No lawyer walks around dressed like that.

574
00:33:24.294 --> 00:33:25.295
As far as I know

575
00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:27.464
Then did you allow me to meet you?

576
00:33:31.427 --> 00:33:32.720
to see something

577
00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:39.226
(Nayeon) What happened?

578
00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:41.061
(Byungjun) What?

579
00:33:42.104 --> 00:33:45.524
(Nayeon) You know what I’m talking about

580
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:51.947
really dead

581
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:55.951
(Byungjun) I saw that bastard’s body
Do you know how surprised I was?

582
00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:59.163
don't look at me like that

583
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:03.083
I'm not guilty, you know

584
00:34:04.001 --> 00:34:05.461
[Sighing] I know.

585
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:10.799
But what are you going to do now?

586
00:34:13.677 --> 00:34:17.639
Can't you see that I'm here?
What do you think?

587
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:20.559
Just like you said there
It's actually happening

588
00:34:20.809 --> 00:34:21.852
(Byungjun) Don’t you know?

589
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.854
Now the hope we have left is

590
00:34:24.855 --> 00:34:25.981
That's just one thing

591
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.149
He's a murderer

592
00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:30.569
No, at least murder and
I'm a connected person

593
00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:32.529
You need to notify the police right now...

594
00:34:32.613 --> 00:34:33.614
No way

595
00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:35.282
(Byungjun) Absolutely not

596
00:34:38.786 --> 00:34:40.996
Do you think it would put your mind at ease if I told you?

597
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:46.001
So you just stay still

598
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:50.589
I'll take care of it

[camera shutter sound]

601
00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:10.275
(Dohan) Why did you turn on the flash?

602
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:11.944
In broad daylight

603
00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:20.869

[Byungjun’s urgent voice]
[Roaring]

605
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:31.672
What is it

606
00:35:32.506 --> 00:35:34.049
Were you caught on purpose?

607
00:35:50.691 --> 00:35:51.900
(Dohan) Is the visit over?

608
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:54.653
Yes, then

609
00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:56.321
(Dohan) Hey, lawyer.

610
00:35:56.905 --> 00:35:57.948
Yes?

611
00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.242
[Nayeon’s moans of pain]

612
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:02.828
(Nayeon) What are you doing?
This is assault!

613
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:04.288
[Nayeon’s moans of pain]

614
00:36:07.124 --> 00:36:08.166
Oh, are you crazy?

615
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:09.793
I'm going to sue you, really.

616
00:36:14.006 --> 00:36:15.048
[sigh]

617
00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:18.010
[Dohan’s exasperated breathing]

618
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:22.180
What are you? Are you a scammer?

619
00:36:22.264 --> 00:36:23.557
Ah, who are you accusing me of being a fraud?

620
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.683
(Dohan) Then?

621
00:36:30.272 --> 00:36:31.315
(Nayeon) I’m a reporter.

622
00:36:32.274 --> 00:36:33.984
(Dohan) Reporter? Where is the reporter?

623
00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:37.571
(Nayeon) It’s there, it’s called ‘H& News’
online newspaper

624
00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:38.739
(Dohan) How did you find out?

625
00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:40.324
I guess this incident isn't known yet?

626
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:41.575
[Nayeon’s sigh]

627
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.704
From the beginning with Lee Byung-jun
We used to know each other, right?

628
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:48.582
Yes, we know each other
We know each other...

629
00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:50.125
Are you an accomplice? So you came here knowing?

630
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.377
Are you an accomplice? What are you saying now...

631
00:36:58.216 --> 00:36:59.718
[Sighing] No.

632
00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:03.305
(Dohan) Oh, let’s be honest.

633
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.057
[Nayeon’s exasperated laughter]
How did you find out?

634
00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:08.226
(Nayeon) [Sighing] A report has come in.

635
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:12.105
Noh Sang-cheon, who is said to be dead, is the suspect, but!

636
00:37:12.189 --> 00:37:15.984
The person I know, Lee Byung-jun, is
He's being held as a suspect.

637
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:18.236
(Dohan) Who are you, informant?

638
00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:22.324
(Nayeon) The detectives here are reporting informants.
I'm just saying this, but let's see, right?

639
00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:24.159
There's nothing to know

640
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.996
Is it true that Noh Sang-cheon is the suspect?

641
00:37:28.956 --> 00:37:31.541
(Dohan) Oh, why is everyone talking about Noh Sangcheon?

642
00:37:31.625 --> 00:37:33.377
[heavy music]
Does that make sense?

643
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.921
(Nayeon) No, then, huh?

644
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:38.799
There are rumors that Noh Sang-cheon is a suspect.
Why is it coming out?

645
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:41.051
(Dohan) Hey, isn’t the angle just right?

646
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:42.135
(Nayeon) [Snoring] Gak?

647
00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:44.805
(Dohan) So, that kind of report
It didn't make sense from the beginning

648
00:37:44.888 --> 00:37:46.139
No, I said I was a reporter...

649
00:37:46.223 --> 00:37:47.933
(Nayeon) Yes, I’m a reporter.

650
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:50.352
When a report comes in, we dig into it.
Reporting is my job.

651
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:51.645
But

652
00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:54.982
There are rumors that Noh Sang-cheon is a suspect.
Isn’t there a reason to come out?

653
00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:59.236
(Dohan) Listen carefully.
This is a murder case

654
00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:02.155
the police keep it secret
We need to investigate.

655
00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:04.449
[Nayeon stamps her foot]

656
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:05.701
(Nayeon) What about the media?

657
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.037
What needs to be known needs to be known
I have an obligation

658
00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:12.374
(Dohan) Nothing is certain
What do you want to know?

659
00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:14.543
The dead Noh Sang-cheon has nothing to do with it.

660
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:17.212
Byungjun Lee is just a suspect.
That's it!

661

[Nayeon’s exasperated voice]

662
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.132
Oh, let's go now, now

663
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:24.970
Are you going to post an article?

664
00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:32.102
(Nayeon) What did you say no to?

665
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.645
yes?

666
00:38:33.729 --> 00:38:36.106
(Nayeon) You said ‘no’ a little while ago.

667
00:38:36.189 --> 00:38:37.399
looking at my face

668
00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:40.193
I don't have eyes for murder, that's it.

669
00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.279
I don't know about fraud

670
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:47.075
Of course, with those deer-like eyes

671
00:38:48.452 --> 00:38:50.037
Then what about Byeongjun Lee?

672
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:53.832
Did that person have killer eyes?

673
00:38:58.003 --> 00:39:00.088
Don't worry, I won't post an article.

674
00:39:00.756 --> 00:39:02.549
Noh Sang-cheon has nothing to do with it.

675
00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:05.177
I heard Byeongjun Lee is just a suspect?

676
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.388
(Nayeon) If you posted an article like that,
I'm the only one who hears the chirping noise

Is this going to take a while?

It is not clear when the incident occurred

I have too many

682
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:31.119

[Dohan sighs]
[Detective Park’s embarrassing voice]

684
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:37.417
(Dohan) First of all, there is a suspect.
Let's just look for solid evidence.

685
00:39:38.418 --> 00:39:40.170
What about National Forensic Service? Any contact yet?

686
00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:41.379
(Detective Shin) Please wait a little longer.

00:40:09.116 --> 00:40:10.575
In China, where I was fleeing

691
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:13.870
News that he died in a car accident
It was delivered

692
00:40:13.954 --> 00:40:15.455
As the suspect dies

693
00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:19.709
There is no right to prosecute in the Noh Sang-cheon fraud case.
It is scheduled to be completed

694
00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:22.337
Therefore, the way for victims to receive compensation is...

695
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:29.427
[light sigh]

696
00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.809
(Dohan) Detective Park

697
00:40:38.103 --> 00:40:39.729
- Later.
- (Detective Park) Yes

698
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:42.566
[Dohan whispers]

699
00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:07.340
[Tap the switch]

700
00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:36.786
[Meaningful music]

701
00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:44.669
[The door squeaks open]

702
00:41:57.057 --> 00:41:58.099
[camera shutter sound]

703
00:41:58.725 --> 00:42:02.270
[Camera shutter sounds repeatedly]

704
00:42:15.033 --> 00:42:16.701
[Knocking sound]
(Deliveryman) Delivery!

705
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:19.037
I'll go in

706
00:42:24.084 --> 00:42:25.168
[The door slams shut]

707
00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:40.183
[shaking breathing]

708
00:42:41.518 --> 00:42:45.063
(Dohan) Why was he caught on purpose? Why?

709
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.292
[breathes and then exhales]

710
00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:19.514
Why did you bring me here?

711
00:43:21.224 --> 00:43:23.268
(Byungjun) Perhaps there is already an on-site verification...

712
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.479
If you want to do on-site verification
At least confess

713
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.648
The interrogation room is stuffy

714
00:43:28.732 --> 00:43:31.151
fresh from
I'm just trying to have a conversation.

715
00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:34.362
(Byungjun) Put pressure on me here
I think they're trying to strangle me.

716
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:36.573
It's no use

717
00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:38.366
I really didn't do it

718
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.619
Yes, whatever you think about it.

719
00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:44.622
Song Young-jin, who died here

720
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:48.335
He was an employee of Noh Sang-cheon's company.
You mean you knew it?

721
00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:51.296
What about the employees, they are a bunch of scammers

722
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:52.672
Mr. Lee Byeong-jun

723
00:43:52.756 --> 00:43:56.551
Noh Sang-cheon Ponzi fraud case
You're the victim, right?

724
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:58.470
이 개새끼들

725
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.975
[병준의 떨리는 숨소리]
그럼 그 송영진
개새끼에 대한 원한도

726
00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:05.352
당연히 있겠죠?

727
00:44:07.771 --> 00:44:10.648
Yes, but

728
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:15.612
I have a motive to kill Song Young-jin
I think they're trying to pretend that it exists.

729
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.114
Drink it in vain

730
00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:23.495
[Byungjun’s sigh]

731
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:26.206
Then why did you come here that day?

732
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:28.124
How many times do you say it?

733
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.961
I was supposed to meet Song Young-jin.
without even showing up

734
00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:33.671
I came here because I couldn't contact you.

735
00:44:33.755 --> 00:44:36.549
To look like a suspect on purpose
You didn’t come to visit me?

736
00:44:42.806 --> 00:44:44.682
Why did you want to meet Song Young-jin?

737
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:49.771
[dark music]

738
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:52.440
(Byungjun) Not long ago
I came to a victims' organization.

739
00:44:52.524 --> 00:44:53.566
Song Youngjin

740
00:44:53.775 --> 00:44:55.318
(Dohan) If you are a victim group...

741
00:44:55.944 --> 00:44:58.780
Noh Sang-cheon Ponzi fraud victim group

742
00:44:58.863 --> 00:44:59.864
[Excited laughter]

743
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:02.450
(Dohan) No, still
Does such an organization exist?

744
00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:04.327
It was over a long time ago, the Noh Sang-cheon case.

745
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:07.455
I don't know if this is over for you.

746
00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:10.583
To the victims
Still in progress

747
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:12.669
What did Song Young-jin say when he came to see me?

748
00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:14.212
[sigh]

749
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.297
- Give me the money, you bastard! uh?
- (Byungjun) Of course, the victims

750
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:18.425
(Byungjun) Everyone got angry when they saw Song Youngjin.

751
00:45:18.842 --> 00:45:22.137
But Song Young-jin made us
The reason I came was unexpected.

752
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.889
[Man 6's angry breathing]
(Youngjin) Noh Sangcheon

753
00:45:24.973 --> 00:45:27.308
It's definitely alive

754
00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:30.437
I caught that bastard

755
00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:36.192
Your Damage Amount
I'll give it all back to you!

756
00:45:36.276 --> 00:45:37.819
(Youngjin) Please trust me!

757
00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:39.737
(Dohan) No, did you believe that?

758
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.368
[shaking breathing]
I felt like I was grasping at straws.

759
00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:47.787
A lot of time has passed anyway

760
00:45:48.621 --> 00:45:50.498
Because everyone is so tired

761
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:52.834
no

762
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:54.669
The saying that Noh Sang-cheon is alive

763
00:45:55.253 --> 00:45:57.714
(Dohan) No, Noh Sangcheon
It was concluded that he was already dead.

764
00:45:57.797 --> 00:45:58.923
There was also evidence

765
00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:00.467
I see you don't know

766
00:46:01.676 --> 00:46:05.221
Noh Sang-cheon is really dead
no one thinks

767
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:07.348
At least among the victims

768
00:46:07.432 --> 00:46:10.852
Yes, the victims would like to believe that.

769
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:13.938
Only victims think that way?

770
00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:15.482
[Byungjun snorts]

771
00:46:17.484 --> 00:46:19.694
Then ask your conductor.

772
00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:24.449
Is Noh Sang-cheon really dead?

773
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.576
Does the conductor think so too?

774
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.911
Why did the conductor...

775
00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:30.622
You were the detective in charge of the Noh Sang-cheon case.

776
00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:33.416
That handsome Deputy Director Kang Jong-hoon of yours!

777
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:01.694
Okay

(Employee 1) Soon the Chairman will
They say they will come directly to our branch.

779

So stop dying
Please wait to hear from us

780

(Woman 3) No, what?
They told me to wait for a call!
[People protest]

781

(Employee 2) Wait a minute, wait a minute.

782
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:14.749
Do you really think we will take our money?

783
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:17.835
Oh, if you could just be patient.
Dividends will also be deposited normally.

784

Oh, of course, for those who want to cancel the contract

785
00:47:19.754 --> 00:47:20.797
I will also withdraw the principal invested...

(Employee 1) No, they don’t know.
They say they don’t know where the chairman is.

We have to be here to get information too.

819

no matter what happens
I have to survive until the end

846

No, by the way, our members
If you keep searching like this

848

It's going to be difficult for us to stand quietly.

Did you think you would take it all?

885
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.246
(Youngjin) I was wrong.

- (Reunion) How did it go?

988
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.815
I think an arrest warrant will be issued.

989
01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:54.943
[People's surprised exclamations]
I guess the picture
Because it remains as evidence

990
01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:56.153
(Cheongju’s house) [Crying] What should I do?

991
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.489
[Yeon-Gwang’s sigh]
(Nayeon) Footprints in the room

992
01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.074
They say the only one is Uncle Byeongjun’s.

993
01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.534
Ah, why didn’t you say anything?
He goes home and it's a mess.

994
01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.119
It's not that I didn't say anything.

995
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.829
told me

996
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.540
Song Young-jin is dead

997
01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:10.667

(Jonghoon) Yes

1004
01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:34.817
Did something come out?

1005
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.360
[Dohan’s light sigh]

1006
01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.404
Did he confess?

1007
01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:39.905
[Sighing] Not yet.

1008
01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:42.533
(Do-han) Well, I’m talking about Noh Sang-cheon.

1009
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:43.784
I guess I'll have to do some digging.

1010
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.868
Why?

1011
01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.204
Oh, the fingers
They all point to Noh Sang-cheon.

1012
01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:48.705
I guess it has something to do with Noh Sang-cheon...

1013
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:49.832
(Jonghoon) Stop

1014
01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:54.545
Told me to solve a murder case

1015
01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:57.798
Investigate the dead
I wasn't released from disciplinary action.

1016
01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:58.924
Do you understand?

1017
01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:02.094
(Byungjun) You were the detective in charge of the Noh Sangcheon case.
[dark music]

1018
01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.513
That handsome Deputy Director Kang Jong-hoon of yours!

1019
01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.476
(Dohan) So
I mean, the disciplinary action was lifted.

1020
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.770
It's not like I wanted to release it.
That discipline.

1021
01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.314
Why did you release it?

1022
01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.858
Even the audit community would have opposed it.

1023
01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.652
That's Dohan, you're crazy about it.
It's a murder case

1024
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.363
(Jonghoon) So to the other team
I didn't pass it up and took care of it.

1025
01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.824
That's the conductor
It was a piece of cake thrown at me.

1026
01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.784
(Dohan) Well, I was bitten too.

1027
01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:28.162
Ah, but no matter how much I think about it
I don't think this is the right answer.

1028
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.705
- I have a sense of humor too.
- (Jonghoon) Dohana

1029
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.251
(Jonghoon) The habit of digging too deep
There are times when it's not good.

1030
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:35.377
It's too much now

1031
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:37.671
(Dohan) Yes

1032
01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.801
But if there's something I need to cover

1033
01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.720
Please let me know in advance.
