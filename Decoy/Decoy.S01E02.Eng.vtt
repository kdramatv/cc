Are you selling that magnetic blanket yourself?

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:12.956
What changes if you sell?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.625
You're not even a whole bone, Mr.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.002
Now listen

140
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.837
(CEO Park) Those people
To sell a magnetic mattress

141
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.506
Don't you have to buy that first?
[Sangcheon’s response]

142
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.091
- (President Park) Come on, right?
- (Sangcheon) Yes, even so.

143
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:24.134
(President Park) Now, now, as you can see
Everyone is greedy to make money

144
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.886
First of all, do you start by pulling the magnet?

145
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.179
So to meet that demand

146
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.556
All at once from a Chinese factory
I have to mass produce it and bring it to you.

147
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.850
That's a lot, isn't it?

148
00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.435
(Sangcheon) Just keep going, don’t ask anything.

149
00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.980
(President Park) Now, to do that,
Advance deposit must be made to the Chinese factory

150
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.857
I will be able to receive the item

151
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:41.735
I'm investing in it
Those are not just one or two magnets.

152
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.780
And depending on the investment ratio
You get dividends

153
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.615
Ah, because there is such a clear demand.

154
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.118
Profit from supply will not be certain

155
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.037
Here, the company CEO directly invests.

156
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.165
I decided to go in too.

157
00:06:58.544 --> 00:06:59.586
(Sangcheon) So

158
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.754
[Sangcheon licks his appetite]

159

00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:05.134
That's right

161
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.845
President Noh is very smart.
I see you understand right away

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.972
- Ah, this guy...
- (President Park) Anyway

163
00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.932
Wouldn't this be safe and secure?

164
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.767
(President Park) Lee Ja-do
I'll beat you up so you don't feel bad

165

Please wait a moment

166
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.778
(Sangcheon) Who did you talk to?

167
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.616
(President Park) No, lower your leg.

168
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.034
(Sangcheon) Magnetism is magnetism.

169

Put your leg down, please

172
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.832
- (President Park) Without courtesy...
- Why don't you come, you bastard?

173
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.375
No, when our boss comes
What are you trying to do?

174
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.668
(Sangcheon) What should I do, bastard...

175
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.336
[The door slams shut]

176
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.462
(Youngjin) What is it?

177
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.425
Our invest business is

178
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.969
If anyone introduces
You know very well that it won't work.

179
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.930
(Sangcheon) Ah, wife, nice to meet you.

180
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:53.473
No...

181
00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:00.022
(President Park) Is that right? I know it all

182
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.525
[Laughing] But our old boss
I've been begging you so much...

183
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:04.651
[President Park clears his throat]

184
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.531
You work in finance?

185
00:08:09.615 --> 00:08:11.575
-Your name?
- (Sangcheon) Yes, this is Noh Sangcheon.

186
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:15.162
Focused on urgent customers
I'm running it poorly.

187
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.413
This is Jang Kang-chun

(Youngjin) President Noh’s business card
Leave some behind

189
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.129
Among our customers
There are many people who urgently need money.

190
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.297
It might be of some help.

191
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.133
(Sangcheon) Ah, well, more than that, I also

192
00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:31.678
This, invest? That
I want to do that

193
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.514
There is currently no TIO for investment cases.

194
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.683
(Youngjin) I met Professor Choi of KAIST.

195
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.101
I have an important meeting

196
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.563
These days, I'm developing a wireless massager.

197
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:44.107

198
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.275
[Small] Yes, thank you for your hard work.

199

(Sangcheon) Sit, sit, sit

201
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.779
(President Park) Oh

202
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.407
(Sangcheon) Oh, then

203
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:53.492
This...

204
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.579
Write, President Park T.O.
How about handing it over to me?

205
00:08:57.663 --> 00:09:00.082
Because I will only receive my principal
Pass it to me, okay?

206
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.917
아니, 그건 경우가 아니지

207
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.503
(상천) 그럼 경우 있게
내 돈 당장 갚든가, 이 새끼야

208
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.256
당신 날강도야? uh?

209
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.132
(Sangcheon) Yes, you are a day robber, you bastard.
I am 'you'...

210
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:11.051
[Get angry at each other]
(Youngjin) Oh, stop, stop, stop!

211
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.386
Two minutes stop!

212
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:16.139
Write, what is this doing?
in the sacred office

213
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:18.892
[Youngjin’s laughter]

214
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.395
Well, okay

215
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.398
Well, if you have this level of passion, you will pass.

216
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.235
Oh, then are you giving me a seat?

217
00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:31.154
[thinking sound]

218
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:33.448
[Youngjin takes a deep breath]

219
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:38.287
(Youngjin) That, currently remaining
There is one investment thing though.

220
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.665
[Meaningful music]
Because that's a special case

221
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.752
(Sangcheon) [Laughing] Oh, what?
Like a man, you say it with a sharp tone.

222
00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:50.632
(Youngjin) From our company’s branch office,

223
00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.384
imported magnetic yoga

224
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.470
Currently moored at Yeojin Port
Due to lack of documentation

225
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:59.016
In short, hundreds of millions of won
It's tied up in Yeojin Port.

[High Heaven's Whistle]

227
00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:04.354
From Governor Moon Sang’s side
to another branch where you can take it right away.

228
00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:06.398
I decided to hand it over at a low price.

229
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.234
[Snaps fingers] That
I'm buying it.

230
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.694
You can even save on import and export costs.

231
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.529
(President Park) Oh, Seo, what are you going to do with the documents?

232
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.239
[Youngjin’s laughter]

233
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.200
(Youngjin) IC, tsk
I can pass, I

234
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.368
I

235
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:21.455
Because I am on friendly terms with this person.

236
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:30.297
But there's just one problem
I'm a little short on funds

237
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.675
It's small, but just enough

238
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.344
How are you investing?

239
00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.349
[Clears throat] ‘How Much’?

240
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:43.393
It's not much, about 200 million

241
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.730
(Youngjin) Tsk, kid
[Youngjin’s light smile]

242
00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:48.273
Well, that's it.

243
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:51.234
Well, if I tell existing investors,

244
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.819
Probably will make additional investments

245
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.530
[Laughing] Ah, about 200 million...

246
00:10:55.614 --> 00:10:56.656
It's gum

247
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.408
(Youngjin) Gum?

248
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.621
Would you mind?

249
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.289
- Yes
- (Youngjin) For your information,

250
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:08.377
The rate of return we can provide is
It's about 300%

251
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.629
(Youngjin) If you invest a thousand
It's probably around 3,000.

252
00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:16.218
(Sangcheon) If 3,000 per 1,000

[Laugh slightly together]

255

(Youngjin) That’s about it.
[Sangcheon’s response]

256
00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.142
We too, Mr.

257
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.229
Well, it goes to labor costs and operating expenses.

258
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.856
[Laughing] Well, after listening to this and that,

259
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:34.111
Oh, it's a little smaller than I thought.
It's worth a small investment.

260
00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.947
(Sangcheon) Ah, then now
The thing in Yeojin Port

261
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.615

(Youngjin) Ah...

This...

264
00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.665
You shouldn't show it to just anyone.

265

Oh well, if only I could check it right now.
You can invest right now

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.706
[urgent sound]

342
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.751
You know,

343
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:08.760
(Sangcheon) Where did you go?

344
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.691
[Sangcheon sobs]

345
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.859
[screaming]

346
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.946
[sobbing]

347
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:32.742
fuck

348
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.829
Fuck you bastard

349
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:36.955
I'm your...

350
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.083
I'm the only one, you fucking bastard.

351
00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:41.960
You bastard

352
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:47.048
(Youngjin) The Noh Sangcheon I know is
It was like that then

353
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.801
Should I say it's nonsense?

354
00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.469
[Youngjin sobs]

355
00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:52.846
But

356
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.765
I really don't know that

357
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.352
No matter how much I prick it with a needle,

358
00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.563
I don't know

359
00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.031
[Screaming scared]

360
00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.039
[Sound of difficulty]

361
00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:25.211
(Detective Park) Fuck, it’s bloody, it’s bloody

362
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.172
There will still be an arrest warrant, right? Byeongjun Lee

363
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.798
Will it come out?

364
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:32.594
(Dohan) What we secured is
There are only pictures taken by Lee Byung-jun.

365
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.554
And it's past the point of murder

366
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.638
(Detective Park) Ah, Kabi.

367
00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.892
Just one photo taken before the murder.
If you have it, it's completely missing, Mr.

368
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.268
(Do-han) Lee Byeong-jun

369
00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.146
The only criminal record I have is illegal assembly.

370
00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.733
That kind of person
Is it possible to kill like that?

371
00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:48.526
And so cruelly

372
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.694
(Detective Shin) Isn’t it strange?

373
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.654
It was a professional move to send it all in one go.

374
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.491
(Detective Park) But Deputy Chief
I heard you said you would do your best to get a warrant.

375
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.784
Get on the prosecutor's line

376
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.786
(Dohan) That’s strange too

377
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.455
Why does the conductor use his strength?

378
00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.333
They also lifted my punishment.

379
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.214
(Jonghun) Dohana

380
00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:13.009
The habit of digging too deep
There are times when it's not good.

381
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.093
It's too much now

382
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.804
(Dohan) Yes

383
00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.222
[Meaningful music]

384
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.306
But

385
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.183
If there's anything I need to cover

386
00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.227
Please let me know in advance.

387
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.357
Is it related to Noh Sang-cheon?

388
00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:31.277
What does that mean?
If you're going to say something like that, get down!

389
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.113
(Dohan) You know me, right?
I'm only interested in murder cases

390
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.157
[light sigh]

391
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.827
No matter what Noh Sang-cheon did in the past,
I don't care

392
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.162
Noh Sang-cheon committed murder.
I don't even think about it

393
00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.832
Of course not, because he's dead.

394
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.167
But why does Noh Sang-cheon keep appearing?
I need to know

395
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.460
It's crazy, just

396
00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.296
(Jonghoon) Byungjun Lee
Because I decided to issue a warrant.

397
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.173
Let’s dig into that thoroughly.

398
00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:53.675
It's all over, right?

399
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.635
Go see

400
00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.101
(Dohan) But you haven’t answered yet.

401
00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.854
If there's anything you need to cover
Please let me know in advance

402
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.731
No, nothing like that.

403
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.693
Lee Byung-jun brought me

404
00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:56.779
Now let's see what you do

405
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.074
(Nayeon) I was surprised when I received the call.

406
00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.993
What is it? The charges were dropped?

407
00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:03.995
I don't know

408
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:06.080
Suddenly, they told me the investigation was over and I was leaving.

409
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.875
I thought there would be more

410
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.251
Are you sad?

411
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.295
(Nayeon) What is it? He looks really sad, doesn't he?

412
00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.756
I thought there would be an arrest warrant.

413
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.841
No matter how much I deny it
[Nayeon’s absurd sounds]

414
00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.217
(Nayeon) This guy really has a big liver.

415
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.054
Then you really go to jail, come to your senses.

416
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.847
Will my life change?

417
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.349
Are you in jail or are you here?

418
00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.643
I don't have any family to worry about

419
00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.269
Why don't you have a family?

420
00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.605
They said they would come visit me once everything was resolved.

421
00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.607
That's a thing of the past now

422
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.651
(Byungjun) It’s all over

423
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.445
After news came out that Noh Sang-cheon had died,

424
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.870
What about food? Did you give it to me on time?

425
00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.914
(Byungjun) You could even choose the menu.

426
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.082
Although it is delivery

427
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.834
Don't be fooled by the fact that they give you good food.

428
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.546
Do you really think that I will feed you well?

429
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.216
(Nayeon) Yes, I think it’s exactly like that.

430
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:03.596
But don't do that, really.

431
00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.395
There are people who worry about me

432
00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.149
Good

433
00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.039
[Car door slams shut]

434
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.049
[heavy music]

435
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.979
[Cheongju’s excited breathing]
[applause]

436
00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.986
(Byungjun) No, no.
This is not it

437
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:01.696
I didn't go to jail

438
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.781
Eat it while it's warm

439
00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:06.492
(Cheongju’s house) Just in case
I wonder what happened

440
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.370
How worried were you all night?

441
00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:10.496
[Cheongju’s light smile]

442
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.915
There is someone else here who cares about me

443
00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:15.835
[Cheongju’s response]
(Nayeon) Ah, of course

444
00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:18.755
Our Cheongju house lady
You like Mr. Byeongjun, right?

445
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:20.339
[Cheongju’s surprised gasp]
[People laughing]

446
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:22.884
Wow, it's beautiful

447
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.218
middle aged love

448
00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.095
[People cheering]
(Cheongju’s house) No, no.

449
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:29.432
No, what's wrong with you, no
[People laughing]

450
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.808
[Byungjun clears his throat]

451
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:32.101
yes, i will eat it

452
00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.103
[Cheongju’s happy voice]
After seeing the castle of our Cheongju family,

453
00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:35.396
(Yeon-Gwang) Yes, yes

454
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.733
[People cheering]

455
00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:52.538
(Yeon-Gwang) But did you really go there?

456
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.874
Was there really a body?

457
00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:55.958
(Byungjun) Of course

458
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.502
I heard there's a picture here too

459
00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:59.003
(Yeon-Gwang) Look, okay?

460
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.466
- (Yeon-Gwang) Where?
- (Cheongju’s house) Oh, isn’t it?

461
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:07.303
(Nayeon) The police must have erased it.
Move it somewhere

462
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:10.848
(Yeon-Gwang) Well, would you have just left that alone?

463
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:12.767
[Byungjun’s sigh]
(Nayeon) What about text messages?

464
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.352
Didn't the police check it?

465
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.438
(Byungjun) Take a picture before you get caught
I deleted all the texts

466
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:18.815
Oh, thank goodness.

467
00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:21.859
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah, but Byeong-Jun
You did something big.

468
00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:24.028
No, it's just between us.

469
00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:26.155
Who knew it was real, right?

470
00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:30.118
Tsk, I wish I knew it was real
I'm going, it's the pair's.

471
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:31.285
Stop it

472
00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.122
It's a matter for each person to take care of themselves.

473
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:36.999
(Nayeon) So, Mr. Byeongjun too
I did it on my own.

474
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.459
(Cheongju’s house) Ayu

475
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:41.254
(Nayeon) Now we
The moment it is officially taken out

476
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:42.964
Everyone becomes an accomplice.

477
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:44.757
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh, still

478
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.885
Ooh, between us
Shouldn’t we discuss it?

479
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:49.053
What are you going to do next?
[Cheongju’s response]

480
00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:50.388
Each person plays

481
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:52.932
(Nayeon) What do you think?

482
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:57.937
Well, I did it because I wanted to.

483
00:23:58.396 --> 00:23:59.772
(Reunion) I’m glad he died

484
00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.023
(Yeon-Gwang) Huh?

485
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.567
I'm glad that bastard died.

486
00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:04.485
(Reunion) I should have died a long time ago!

487
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:07.029
Hey, I feel refreshed inside.

488
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:10.741
Ah, yes

489
00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:13.452
Good luck, Song Young-jin
He died well, tsk

490
00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:15.079
(Cheongju’s house) No, no, no.

491
00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:17.373
Our Byeongjun did the best job.

492
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.500
- You did really well, you did well.
- (Yeon-Gwang) Well done

493
00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:21.878
- (Yeon-Gwang) Well done, good job.
- (Cheongju’s house) Well done, very well done.
[People praise]

494
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:23.838
(Cheongju’s house) Thank you so much
Well done, Mr. Byeongjun.

495
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:25.006
(Byungjun) No.

496
00:24:25.423 --> 00:24:27.049
[cell phone game sound]

497
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:42.273
(Youngjin’s son) It doesn’t matter who the culprit is.

498
00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:44.442
I killed it because it was worth killing.

499
00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:46.402
The person who didn't want to kill that person
I wonder if there is

500
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:49.030
(Dohan) But especially
Isn’t there anyone who gets upset?

501
00:24:49.447 --> 00:24:50.531
Oh, hey, detective.

502
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:52.617
Oh, I don't know that person either.

503
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.660
I'm just a biological son

504
00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:57.038
(Youngjin’s son) Right here now
Even having to be is annoying.

505
00:24:57.121 --> 00:24:59.415
(Dohan) After coming out of prison
Have you never met?

506
00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:00.708
[sigh]

507
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:03.502
I only got a phone call once.

508
00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:05.129
(Youngjin’s son) Soon, a lot of money will come
He said he would come in

509
00:25:05.213 --> 00:25:06.631
I was talking nonsense and hung up.

510
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.758
Money coming in?

511
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:10.551
(Dohan) By any chance, where
Did you say you were coming in?

512
00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:12.803
I heard you were going to get money from Noh Sang-cheon?

513
00:25:13.054 --> 00:25:15.181
(Youngjin’s son) Ah, that’s why it’s crazy.
I just hung up and told him not to do it.

514
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:16.390
Oh, it's funny.

515
00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:18.643
Do do now
Even bringing in dead people

516
00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.687
He tried to crawl into the house using that excuse.
Who knows?

517
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:24.148
Could it be No Sang-cheon?
Did you say it's alive?

518
00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:25.483
no

519
00:25:26.984 --> 00:25:28.277
Are you alive?

520
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:29.403
Noh Sang-cheon?

521
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:32.657
(Dohan) Officially, he is dead.

522
00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:34.700
[light sigh]

523
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.954
That person is such a fool too.

524
00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.206
(Youngjin’s son) Oh, the other scammers
They say he makes a good living even though he cheats.

525
00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:41.874
What is this?

526
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.376
[Youngjin’s son sighs]

527
00:25:45.628 --> 00:25:47.338
[heavy music]
[cell phone vibrating sound]

528
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:51.384
yes

529
00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:53.094
Why did you release Lee Byung-jun?

530
00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:55.221
(Dohan) No matter how you look at it
I don't think there's a requirement to get a warrant?

531
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:57.348
Why do you make your own decisions about that!

532
00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.350
[sigh]

533
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.353
What are your plans?

534
00:26:02.687 --> 00:26:05.314
suspect too easily
It was a mistake to specify

535
00:26:05.398 --> 00:26:08.317
(Do-han) Because Lee Byung-jun was worried
I missed the timing for another investigation.

536
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:10.778
Are you really sure it's not the culprit?

537
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.822
For now, I've followed you, Byungjun Lee.

538
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:15.741
And from the people around Song Young-jin,
I'm moving now to dig.

539
00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:17.493
Who are the people around Song Young-jin?

540
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:20.538
- You...
- (Dohan) Hey, Deputy Director.

541
00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:23.499
We only care about the murder case.

542
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:25.293
(Dohan) Don’t worry

543
00:26:26.043 --> 00:26:27.878
If you don't have anything more to say, I'll hang up.

544
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:30.006
[Call end sound]

545
00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:38.139
[Call connection tone]

546
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:45.104
(Dohan) Do you know Song Youngjin?

547
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.565
(Inmate 1) It's bread, but why?

548
00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:48.691
What, did you get into an accident?

549
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.776
-He's dead.
- (Inmate 1) Yes?

550
00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:54.739
(Dohan) Regarding Mr. Song Youngjin
I have a few questions

551
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.240
I don't know much

552
00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.784
I don't know
We were just in the same room.

553
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:00.661
Just answer whatever comes to mind.

554
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:02.038
How was things between you two?

555
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:03.581
I've been doing well.

556
00:27:03.664 --> 00:27:05.291
That guy was a bit braggadocious.

557
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:07.668
Well, ‘who are you close to?’
‘I know because I tried it’

558
00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:09.086
(Inmate 2) Well, it was all like that.

559
00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:11.130
(Inmate 1) He said he would take revenge.

560
00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:12.381
(Inmate 2) I’m going to China.

561
00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:14.467
I said I was going to meet Noh Sang-cheon.

562
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.469
Well, I got abandoned and I didn’t get any money.

563
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:18.429
(Inmate 3) In the end, in the cell
There were many complaints that it was just rotting away.

564
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.056
[Inmate 2 laughs]

565
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:22.141
[Takes a deep breath]

566
00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:24.894
Noh Sang-cheon, the person who will die like that
They say no?

567
00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:26.270
(Inmate 2) He’s alive.

568
00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:28.064
[clunking sound]
[unlock sound]

569
00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.358
[heavy music]

570
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:32.735
(Byungjun) I guess you don’t know

571
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:36.322
Noh Sang-cheon is really dead
no one thinks

572
00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.907
At least among the victims

573
00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:45.498
[sigh]

574
00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:54.090
(Editor-in-Chief) What are you doing?

575
00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:55.841
(Nayeon) Ah...

576
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.301
(Editor-in-Chief) Is it Noh Sang-cheon again?

577
00:27:57.593 --> 00:27:59.178
You have really good eyesight.

578
00:27:59.387 --> 00:28:01.764
Yes, write, write

579
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:05.726
I used that
Reporter Cheon: When I feel better, I keep writing.

580
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.686
It's not like I'm going to publish it as an article anyway.

581
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.649
I might really let it go this time.

582
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:13.150
(Nayeon) Phil is coming

583
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:15.236
Do you write articles in writing?

584
00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:19.073
(Editor-in-Chief) Noh Sang-cheon or whatever
Shouldn't it be a hot topic?

585
00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:22.326
It's out of people's interest right now.
The number of views is bad

586
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:24.995
[Editor-in-chief sighs]

587
00:28:27.832 --> 00:28:29.166
Baby, look at my mind

588
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.960
(Nayeon) I’m going to the hospital.

589
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.921
Why come back, get off work there

590
00:28:35.423 --> 00:28:36.424
(Nayeon) Ah!

591
00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:40.386
Hey, I need some information on a detective.
Can you find out?

592
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:41.804
Well, it's not difficult.

593
00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:43.431
Who is it?

594
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:45.850
Kang Soo-dae saved

595
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:48.686
[Heavy breathing]

596
00:28:49.812 --> 00:28:51.397
(Nayeon) Sorry, I’m a little late.

597
00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:53.858
What are you doing?

598
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.609
I can do it alone

599
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.028
(Nayeon) It’s hard to go home

600
00:28:58.112 --> 00:28:59.738
Even then, we should go together

601
00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:17.089
[The door opens]

602
00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:19.758
(Detective Park) Team leader, these testimonies are
How do they match?

603
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.179
So did Lee Byung-jun.
The bakers were like that too.

604
00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:25.556
Song Young-jin goes to China
He said he did it to meet Noh Sang-cheon.

605
00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.642
Looking at this, I'm really in China
I guess you meant to go?

606
00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:32.646
Isn’t it because they put ground rice on it? To scam

607
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:34.857
(Detective Park) Of course

608
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:36.817
But

609
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:38.569
Is Noh Sang-cheon alive?

610
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.947
You announced it.
‘Death due to traffic accident’

611
00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:43.657
There was no survival response yet.

612
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:46.619
(Detective Park) Well, the body was confirmed.
It's just Chinese kids.

613
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.329
There's that one thing at the autopsy, whatever.

614
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.748
manipulating that
Would it work in that neighborhood?

615
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:53.417
It's going to be crazy, if you're alive

616
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:56.253
(Detective Park) Once again
The country will be shaken

617
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:01.258
They announced that he was dead
The police are a mess

618
00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:04.803
Even if No Sang-cheon lived,
You shouldn't be alive

619
00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:07.389
Even if I nail Noh Sang-cheon’s coffin
I have to do it

620
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:08.724
People involved

621
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.268
This bastard can never crawl out

622
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.688
[Meaningful music]

623
00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:19.985
(Dohan) Just go

624
00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:23.113
Let's think about it the other way, what you said now.

625
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:25.157
Huh? What do you mean?

626
00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:29.203
What if, what if

627
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.541
If Noh Sang-cheon is alive
Who are the people you would welcome the most?

628
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:34.833
[Detective Park’s exasperated laughter]

629
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:36.919
(Detective Park) Ah, that bastard
Who welcomes you?

630
00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:45.636
(Anchor in the news) Meanwhile, the suspect
As death occurs

631
00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:47.429
Noh Sang-cheon fraud case

632
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:49.932
It will be concluded with no prosecution rights.

633
00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:52.434
Therefore, the way for victims to receive compensation is

634
00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:54.770
It is expected to be even more difficult

635
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.409
[laughter]

636
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:09.868
victims

637
00:31:09.952 --> 00:31:11.036
(Detective Park) Yes?

638
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.039
If Noh Sang-cheon is alive

639
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:16.500
The people we welcome the most are the victims.

640
00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:17.918
Oh, does that make sense?

641
00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:19.420
Victims like Lee Byung-jun

642
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:21.714
The motive for the murder of Song Young-jin
They are the highest people

643
00:31:21.922 --> 00:31:23.966
(Detective Park) Noh Sang-cheon more than anyone else
You probably wanted to die

644
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:26.969
That's compensation for fraud damage
I'm talking about when I get it right.

645
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:31.098
(Dohan) Ironically, in China
When Noh Sang-cheon said he was dead

646
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.975
The group that most vehemently opposed

647
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.435
[People resist violently]
It was a victims' group.

648
00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:39.815
If Noh Sang-cheon is alive

649
00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:43.027
Reinvestigation possible, damage compensation possible

650
00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:45.029
That's right

651
00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:48.365
But what about a murder case?
Who cares?

652
00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:50.492
(Detective Park) Whether Noh Sang-cheon is alive or dead?
We're not looking for it, we're

653
00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:53.037
Why does Noh Sang-cheon’s name keep popping up?

654
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.456
Victims' groups
maybe you know

655
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.668
Please tell Detective Shin the address there.
ask me to take a picture

656
00:31:59.877 --> 00:32:00.919
yes

657
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.820
[heavy music]

658
00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:46.131
[Knocking sound]

659
00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:51.637
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah, this is my first time seeing your face.

660
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:54.056
What brought you here...

661
00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.058
This is the team leader who rescued Kang Su-dae.

662
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.935
(Light) A river basin? Why is Gangsudae...

663
00:32:58.227 --> 00:32:59.353
(Reunion) Why?

664
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.980
Are you here to catch Lee Byung-jun again?

665
00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:03.732
But what should I do?

666
00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:05.984
Are you gone?

667
00:33:06.944 --> 00:33:08.028
(Dohan) No

668
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:10.322
just passing by
I stopped by to say hello.

669
00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:12.908
[Exciting sounds of reunion]
(Reunion) What is the greeting?

670
00:33:13.117 --> 00:33:14.702
It's a good thing if there's no surveillance.

671
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:15.786
(Yeon-Gwang) I-Charm
[Exciting sounds of reunion]

672
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.287
(Yeon-Gwang) Ah, ah, no, no.

673
00:33:17.371 --> 00:33:18.414
Welcome to

674
00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:19.665
yes, you are welcome

675
00:33:19.748 --> 00:33:21.041
Oh, what are you doing, clap, clap?

676
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:22.251
[People's response]
applause, applause

677
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:23.544
[People laughing]

678
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:29.091
Well, there's nothing to be surprised about.

679
00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:32.845
We are newly investigating Noh Sang-cheon.
To detectives

680
00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:36.515
This means cheer up
We give you a round of applause of encouragement.

681
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:37.808
This is a tradition, a tradition

682
00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:38.892
Ah, what are you doing, one more time

683
00:33:38.976 --> 00:33:40.728
- (Woman 4) Oh, yes.
- (Yeon-Gwang) One more time
[Yeon-Gwang’s laughter]

684
00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:43.522
(Dohan) Noh Sang-cheon’s case
It's not my responsibility

685
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:47.109
(Yeon-Gwang) Hey, then what did you come to do?

686
00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:48.902
We only deal with Noh Sang-man.

687
00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:50.863
(Detective Park) Noh Sang-cheon
Aren't you already dead?

688
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.448
Why can't you let go of your regrets...

689
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:53.532
- (Reunion) What!
- (Yeon-Gwang) I...

690
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.078
(Reunion) What kind of guy is like that?

691
00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:02.416
Among our victims
People who think Noh Sang-cheon is dead

692
00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:03.876
There isn't even one person

693
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.129
dead in our eyes
Check his body

694
00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:10.549
We made that face with our own hands.
Unless you open it

695
00:34:10.632 --> 00:34:13.469
The bullshit that Noh Sang-cheon is dead
I can never believe it!

696
00:34:15.596 --> 00:34:17.139
[Each cell phone rings]

697
00:34:25.022 --> 00:34:26.190

[dark music]

699
00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:35.741
(Yeon-Gwang) Stop for today
I think you'd better go back.

700
00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:38.202
Oh, I can't talk when that brother is there.

701
00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:41.038
Because I’m so hot-tempered
You can do big things

702
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:42.122
Right?

703
00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:43.999
Ah, yes, come next time.

704
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.876
Yes? Now...
[Yeon-Gwang’s light smile]

705
00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:49.213

707
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.530
[People are noisy]

708
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:15.948
[People cheer and applaud]

709
00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:21.995
(5 women and 3 men)
- Can you make 10 million won a month?
- Okay, I can do it!

710
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.455
(People) You can do it!

711
00:35:23.539 --> 00:35:24.540
Go for it!

712
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:26.291
[People cheering]
- (Man 4) Fighting!
- (Woman 6) Thank you!

713
00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:28.168
It's a pyramid scheme.
[People shout loudly]

714
00:35:28.252 --> 00:35:31.171
(Nayeon) This guy’s scam is
It won't disappear even with time

715
00:35:32.381 --> 00:35:35.759
Continuing to evolve like a cockroach
Survive until the end

716
00:35:35.843 --> 00:35:37.052
I'm sick of it

717
00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:41.849
If only Noh Sang-cheon's case had been properly handled at that time,

718
00:35:41.932 --> 00:35:43.183
Could that have happened?

719
00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:45.686
to someone

720
00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:49.147
Fraud is better than murder
It could be a more brutal crime

721
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:51.692
Even if people knew

722
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.195
(Nayeon) I should tell you now

723
00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.449
(Nayeon) There is only now

724
00:36:00.284 --> 00:36:02.536
Maybe it's your last chance

(Congressman's Office Staff) Mr.
Aren't you coming home from work?

730
00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:31.773
(Gwangshin) Yes, go first

731
00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:34.359
Today, the CEO of Changshin Corporation
I asked to see you for a moment

732
00:36:34.443 --> 00:36:37.070
Meet in moderation
Go back to your family

733
00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:38.989
Don't drink alcohol just because you're being entertained.

734
00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.324
I'll take care of it

735

It's confirmed

773

What about standing nearby?

774
00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:37.793

(Jonghun) Oh, that’s honestly
It was a bit of a pain.

830
00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:21.808
The main culprit went into hiding

831
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.227
After meeting the victims and listening to their stories,

832
00:43:24.311 --> 00:43:26.730
Fraudulent intent is clear
I think there was

833
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:31.234
And so far, it’s not really a scam.
It was a bit difficult to hold it in.

834
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:35.113
(Deputy Director Seo) That’s what I’m saying.

835
00:43:36.156 --> 00:43:38.616
Push back on that investigation and start with something else.

836
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.743
(Jonghun) Why?

837
00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:42.871
(Deputy Director Seo) You just said that.
It's not really a scam

What do you and I have to do with promotion?
It's not even helpful.

841
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.505
No, but the victim
Are you saying it’s increasing?

842
00:43:53.256 --> 00:43:55.592
I'm thinking of running away abroad soon.
We also received a report

843
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.302
Is that report true?

Well, who is taking care of them?

848
00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:16.112
(Deputy Director Seo) [Sighing] Honestly
It must be a bit of a headache, right?

849
00:44:16.738 --> 00:44:18.239
It's just a fraud case

850

No crime has been revealed yet

851
00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:25.372

It's not even a criminal case.

Yeah, well, I'll just keep that in mind for now.

853
00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:33.129
[Deputy Director Seo sighs]

854
00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:37.217
Then I will go

855
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.343
yes

856
00:44:39.135 --> 00:44:40.178
Moderately

857
00:44:40.512 --> 00:44:41.763
We're cutting it off.

858
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.903
[cell phone ringing sound]

859
00:45:01.324 --> 00:45:02.409
Uh, why?

860
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.373
what?

861
00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:10.708
[sigh]

862
00:45:11.334 --> 00:45:13.169
[Siren sounds]

863
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:22.053
(Nayeon) Mom

864
00:45:22.137 --> 00:45:23.179
[Nayeon’s urgent breathing]

865
00:45:23.596 --> 00:45:25.390
What happened, Dad? Why?

866
00:45:25.473 --> 00:45:26.558
[Nayeon’s trembling breathing]

867
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:28.017
(Nayeon) It’s all because of me

868
00:45:28.768 --> 00:45:30.311
Because I was wrong

869
00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:33.648
Oh, why, what's going on, huh?

870
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:35.692
(Nayeon) Why is my dad here?

871
00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:37.444
(Nayeon) [Sobbing]
Dad, dad...

872
00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:39.154
[Nayeon’s mother sobs]

873
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:40.363
Dad...

874
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:43.616
[The door swings open]
[Nayeon’s urgent breathing]

875
00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:44.826
(Nayeon) How did it go?

876
00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:46.995
You can buy it, right? You're alive, okay?

877
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.163
sorry

878
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:49.873
(Doctor) I did my best, but

879
00:45:49.956 --> 00:45:52.041
It's late
[Nayeon’s pain sounds]

880
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:54.878
[heavy music]
[Nayeon’s mother sobs]

881
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.904
[Sobbing]

882
00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:24.199
- Dad
- (Police 4) You must not enter.

883
00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:25.783
(Nayeon) He’s my dad, why can’t I see him?

884
00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:28.995
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

885
00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:36.377
dad, dad

886
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:38.087
[Shouting] Dad!

887
00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:47.096
[dark music]

888
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:56.022
[laughter]

889
00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:00.777
(Nayeon) It’s all because of me

890
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:03.530
everything

891
00:47:05.073 --> 00:47:06.699
It's all because of me

892
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:13.456
(Jonghun) What happened?

893
00:47:14.624 --> 00:47:15.875
(Police Officer 5) It is suicide.

894
00:47:15.959 --> 00:47:17.919
He set himself on fire at the VIXX Network office.

895
00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:22.715
[Nayeon’s mother moans with difficulty]
(Jonghun) No, until yesterday
The person who came to the office and gave a statement

896
00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:24.342
Why commit suicide...
[Nayeon’s voice is urgent]

897
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:26.052
No

898
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:28.012
[Sobbing] No, no, no.

899
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:30.848
It's not suicide, it's not suicide

900
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:34.686
(Nayeon) That guy killed it, that guy

901
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:38.815
[heavy music]
Noh Sang-cheon, it’s all because of him.

902
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:41.609
You said you would catch Noh Sang-cheon.

903
00:47:41.901 --> 00:47:44.696
- (Jonghoon) Yes, we...
- (Nayeon) I said I would catch you.

904
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:47.198
(Jonghoon) We are tracking it.
I told you

905
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:49.784
(Nayeon) I ran away

906
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.704
Just like my husband said, she ran away!

907
00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:54.706
(Jonghoon) I’m still in Korea.

908
00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:56.749
Now we have banned him from leaving the country.

909
00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:00.253
So please wait a moment
I told you

910
00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.547
(Nayeon) People

911
00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:05.425
To my husband

912
00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:08.678
Give me the money you invested

913
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.388
[Sobbing] I...

914
00:48:14.058 --> 00:48:16.769
Oh, I, I, I

915
00:48:16.853 --> 00:48:18.688
I'm a crazy bitch, I'm

916
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:20.064
(Jonghoon) Don’t blame yourself too much

917
00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:22.275
All you have to do is catch Noh Sang-cheon, okay?
[Nayeon’s mother continues to cry]

918
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.152
(Nayeon) Yes, it’s because of mom

919
00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:31.784
I told you that was weird

920
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:36.247
It's just mom
Why are you dragging other people in too?

921
00:48:36.623 --> 00:48:37.665
Dad...

922
00:48:37.749 --> 00:48:40.043
(Nayeon) I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Nayeon

923
00:48:40.793 --> 00:48:42.837
Mom was fooled too

924
00:48:44.047 --> 00:48:45.048
(Nayeon) Yes!

925
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.342
Mom should be dead

926
00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:49.677
Why did you live, why!

927
00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:52.722
Dad

928
00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:54.849
[Sobbing] Dad...

929
00:48:58.478 --> 00:49:01.356
how hot was it

930
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:09.322
(Nayeon) Hey there

931
00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:14.786
Can you catch him?

932
00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:17.789
A person who scammed mom and dad

933
00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:20.875
[Jonghun’s sigh]
I'm trying

934
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:25.755
Even people with different mothers
It's because I dragged you in.

935
00:49:26.756 --> 00:49:28.216
Aside from our money

936
00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:34.138
[Sniffling] Dad
You had a really hard time because of that.

937
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:37.725
But

938
00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:41.479
The police don't seem to be investigating either.

939
00:49:43.648 --> 00:49:47.610
The fraud has not yet been established
I can't catch it

940
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:51.989
(Jonghoon) Hold on for now
Let’s consider it one by one after that.

941
00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:54.742
I heard there are more people who died than my father.

942
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:59.247
Then they committed murder
Isn't it the same?

943
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.501
[Jonghun’s sigh]

944
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:05.628
[rustling sound]

945
00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:08.881
Uh, well, if Mom gets better.

946
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:12.844
Let’s take her there and buy some food, okay?

947
00:50:14.303 --> 00:50:16.514
(Jonghun) You should at least come to your senses

948
00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:18.307
That's how I catch him, huh?

949
00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:20.143
I'm not going to spit in your face.

950
00:50:20.893 --> 00:50:22.186
But I

951
00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:26.649
I won't just spit.

952
00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:29.694
[Takes in a shaky breath]

953
00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:33.990
I'll do the same thing to my dad.

954
00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.077
Are you holding on to me?

955
00:50:38.161 --> 00:50:39.579
Are you making a promise?

956
00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:41.330
I promise

957
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:47.879
(Detective Cho) Tsk, I was just trying to take the empty money.
On the subject of fraud

958
00:50:47.962 --> 00:50:49.005
(Jonghun) What?

959
00:50:50.673 --> 00:50:52.008
(Detective Cho) No, it’s just writing.

960
00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:55.261
They all want to make more money
I guess it happened because I was greedy.

961
00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:57.013
Does that make sense in the first place?

962
00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:59.307
If you invest some money
What do you mean by multiplying the amount?

963
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:02.185
Is there such a thing as committing suicide just because I did something well?

964
00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:04.479
(Jonghun) Oh, you bastard
[Detective Cho's painful breathing]

965
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:06.063
It hurts

966
00:51:06.147 --> 00:51:07.565
Are you driving...

967
00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.650
(Jonghun) Is that what a detective would say? uh?

968
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:12.236
People died because of the scammer.

969
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.696
(Detective Cho) Actually, yes, I

970
00:51:13.905 --> 00:51:16.282
Yes, in this case
I don't really want to investigate.

971
00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:17.784
(Jonghoon) Just cut this snout

972
00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:18.910
[Jonghoon’s encouraging sound]
[Painful breathing]

973
00:51:18.993 --> 00:51:21.037
Tsk, if you’re going to be like this.
Just get out of this, nigga

974
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.622
(Detective Cho) How can I get away again?

975
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:23.956
That's what it means

976
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.543
Oh, so, that kid from earlier.

977
00:51:27.877 --> 00:51:31.005
Give him this exactly
Don’t you need to talk about it?

978
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:33.508
Even if I catch that bastard
The punishment will be vague

979
00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:35.802
Because it was an investment concept.

980
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.513
Well, still exactly
I can't say it's a scam

981
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:40.973
Please give me my money back. If you give it away, it will be a crime of fraud.
It can't even be established.

982
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:44.060
Boy, still
Well, I have to catch it first, Noh Sang-cheon.

983
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:47.063
That's how it should be
Get money or get punished

984
00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:48.231
I won't do anything

985
00:51:49.774 --> 00:51:51.067
Hey, has he not contacted you?

986
00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:53.528
(Detective Cho) Ah, that, tomorrow
They said they would contact me in the morning.

987
00:51:55.154 --> 00:51:56.322
(Jonghun) Tomorrow...

988
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:03.704
- (Detective Jeong) Captain
- (Jonghoon) Yes

989
00:52:04.247 --> 00:52:06.207
- (Detective Jeong) Hey, Captain.
- (Jonghoon) Yes, yes

990
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.042
(Detective Jeong) The scale of this damage is
Isn't this a joke?

991
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:10.378
This is better than we thought
Wouldn't it be much bigger?

992
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:12.505
why? What is the situation?

993
00:52:12.588 --> 00:52:13.756
(Detective Jeong) Overnight

994
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.008
Victim and amount of damage
It grew like a snowball

995
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:18.219
What, Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Yeosu, what?

996
00:52:18.302 --> 00:52:20.137
Ha, it's not like there's a nationwide uproar.

997
00:52:20.555 --> 00:52:22.557
Just what I've summarized so far
It's in the tens of billions

998
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.850
Oh my, Mr.

999
00:52:23.933 --> 00:52:25.726
(Detective Cho) Everyone is crazy.

1000
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.354
Giving money to a scammer
There are that many people?

1001
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.356
Ah, even among the victims.

1002
00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:32.275
Man, this and that, Korea is on the rise.
I think there are rumors going around.

1003
00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:35.236
Ai, that, reported area
What is the police station doing now?

1004
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:36.612
I'm not really interested, whatever.

1005
00:52:37.196 --> 00:52:38.364
Well, all fraud cases are like that.

1006
00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:40.408
[Jonghun’s strong breathing]
(Detective Jeong) It’s not really helpful for the exam.

1007
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:42.368
Well, they just received a report and didn't dispatch the dispatcher.
It seemed like a lot.

1008
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.578
(Detective Cho) What do you mean?

1009
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:47.164
Even if we catch this, nationwide
If you think about gathering victims,

1010
00:52:48.124 --> 00:52:49.417
Oh my head hurts

1011
00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:51.836
Captain

1012
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:56.132
Let’s quit this in moderation too.

1013
00:52:57.592 --> 00:52:58.718
(Deputy Director Seo) Moderately

1014
00:52:58.968 --> 00:53:00.052
We're cutting it off.

1015
00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.307
(Detective Jeong) This guy is so...
[cell phone vibrating sound]

1016
00:53:08.311 --> 00:53:09.979
Hey, get ready to go.

1017
00:53:10.062 --> 00:53:11.147
A place where Nosangcheon is floating has appeared.

1018
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.231
- (Detective Joe) Yes?
- (Detective Jeong) Oh, yes.

1019
00:53:12.315 --> 00:53:13.399
(Detective Jeong) Come out, man.

1020
00:53:13.482 --> 00:53:15.318
- (Jonghoon) Ah, Yoon Tae, you...
- (Detective Joe) Yes

1021
00:53:15.735 --> 00:53:18.029
(Jonghun) [Strengthening] You
This mentality is shit

1022
00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:20.781
How dare you give it up in moderation, huh?

1023
00:53:20.865 --> 00:53:22.283
[Detective Cho's painful breathing]

1024
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.327
I decide whether to hang up or not.

1025
00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:26.704
[dark music]
[Detective Jeong scolds]

1026
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:29.457
- (Detective Jeong) Go quickly.
- (Detective Joe) Oh, yes.

1027
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.755
[Detective Joe yawns]

1028
00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:41.469
[The detectives are each tired]

1029
00:53:42.094 --> 00:53:44.639
(Detective Cho) It was past 3 o’clock.
What do you think is wrong?

1030
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:47.099
Either not here or in a different time.

1031
00:53:49.143 --> 00:53:50.686
(Jonghoon) Wait a minute

1032
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.356
They sent detectives to other ports as well.

1033
00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:55.733
[Detective Jeong’s encouraging voice]
[cell phone vibrating sound]

1034
00:53:57.735 --> 00:53:58.778
uh

1035
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.282
[Angry breathing]

1036
00:54:03.616 --> 00:54:05.576
Okay, let's go.

1037
00:54:06.035 --> 00:54:07.328
[Car starting sound]

1038
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.455
[nervous music]

1039
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:26.889
(Detective Jeong) That, that
Is that the car? Is that it?

1040
00:54:28.057 --> 00:54:29.100
(Jonghoon) Block it, block it

1041
00:54:29.517 --> 00:54:31.435
[Car horn sounds repeatedly]

1042
00:54:37.692 --> 00:54:39.235
- What?
- (Jonghoon) Catch it!

1043
00:54:39.318 --> 00:54:40.361
(Jonghun) Hey, get down

1044
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.071
- (Jonghoon) Get off, quickly.
- (Detective Jeong) Hey, get down.

1045
00:54:42.154 --> 00:54:43.364
(Detective Jeong) Hey, open the door.

1046
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:45.783
[disapproving sound]
(Detective Jeong) [Thumping] Put it all down

1047
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:46.867
Ah, you bastard

1048
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:48.452
Hey, open this, huh?

1049
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.413
(Jonghoon) Open the door

1050
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.248
(Detective Jeong) Just breaking the window, huh?

1051
00:54:52.331 --> 00:54:54.083
- (Detective Jeong) Open it, quickly.
- (Jonghoon) Come out

1052
00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:57.336
[Oncoming car engine sound]

1053
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.546
(Detective Jeong) What is that?

1054
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:02.883
Brother

1055
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:10.224
What is it?

1056
00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:35.166
This is Kang Jong-hoon.

1057
00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:37.251
(Sangdo) This is Director Park Sang-do of the Eastern Branch.

1058
00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.628
Noh Sang-cheon We are investigating.

1059
00:55:39.712 --> 00:55:40.755
Yes?

1060
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:43.841
(Sangdo) Prosecutors are investigating now
You're in the way, so get out.

1061
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.551
No, but now...

1062
00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:46.844
(Sangdo) You understand, right?

1063
00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:55.186
[Jonghun’s trembling breathing]

1064
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.395
Okay

1065
00:56:05.738 --> 00:56:06.947
[sigh]

1066
00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:11.160
(Jonghoon) Mr...

1067
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:17.583
(Detective Jeong) Wow?

1068
00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:19.710
The information is wrong

1069
00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:22.004
(Detective Jeong) Yes? The information is wrong...

1070
00:56:22.338 --> 00:56:25.132
Then what, what, that, that, that thing on there
Are you saying that Noh Sang-cheon is a child now?

1071
00:56:25.466 --> 00:56:26.592
That's right!

1072
00:56:26.675 --> 00:56:28.636
Let's just open the door and check the face.

1073
00:56:28.844 --> 00:56:29.845
(Jonghun) Hey, hey!

1074
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:32.139
Take it

1075
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.434
(Detective Jeong) After saying this shit
Should we just go? yes? why?

1076
00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:37.061
Jeommas, who is that?

1077
00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:39.480
Just don't go

1078
00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:07.007
[Nervous breathing]

1079
00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:10.803
Is it okay for us to be like this?

1080
00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:14.056
(Jonghoon) Let’s catch it first.
Think about the rest later

1081
00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:15.641
(Detective Jeong) That’s how it should be, right?

1082
00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:17.184
What do we have to be afraid of?

1083
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:18.811
Are you scared, youngest?

1084
00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:19.895
(Detective) I wasn’t scared at all.

1085
00:57:19.979 --> 00:57:20.980
(Detective Jeong) You bastard...

1086
00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:22.398
(Jonghoon) That’s it
[Car starting sound]

1087
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:23.816
- (Jonghoon) Fasten your belt
- (Detective Jeong) Hey, did you wear it?

1088
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:26.068
[Detective Joe's nervous voice]
- (Detective) Yes, I did.
- (Detective Jeong) Wait a minute, me too, me too

(Detective Jeong) Noh Sang-cheon, Noh Sang-cheon

1094

Noh Sangcheon! seed...
[Jonghoon’s struggling voice]

00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:47.923
[Jonghoon’s encouraging sound]

1096
00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.718
[Attendant’s groans of difficulty]
(Detective Jeong) What is it?

(Jonghoon) [Kicking the car] Ah, Mr.!

1101
00:57:56.265 --> 00:57:57.641
Ah, Mr.!

1102
00:58:03.022 --> 00:58:04.106
What is this?

1103
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:05.357
Okay, let's talk later.

1104
00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:07.484
Why are prosecutors intervening?

1105
00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:08.652
(Deputy Director Seo) What are you talking about?

1106
00:58:08.736 --> 00:58:10.487
At the scene of Noh Sang-cheon’s escape

1107
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:11.906
Why are you from the prosecution side?

1108
00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:13.032
But this bastard

1109
00:58:13.115 --> 00:58:16.202
Why are you a passionate detective in a fraud case?
Imitate it and damn it!

1110
00:58:16.452 --> 00:58:17.536
Did I make it clear?

1111
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.621
Stop it in moderation!

1112
00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:21.165
So, are you really telling me to cover this?

1113
00:58:21.248 --> 00:58:23.000
The police shouldn't do that.

1114
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:24.752
[heavy music]

1115
00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:53.530
What happened to the arrest warrant?

1116
00:58:53.906 --> 00:58:56.492
(Sangdo) To the prosecutor in charge
I told you to pay attention

1117
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.285
They suddenly canceled it

1118
00:58:58.786 --> 00:59:01.205
Yeah, I'm having some trouble.

1119
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:02.831
I canceled it

1120
00:59:02.915 --> 00:59:04.041
(Sangdo) Maybe

1121
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.168
Is it a rescued team leader issue?

1122
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:09.922
that friend

1123
00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:13.509
Because I'm not a pureblood squire from the police department.

1124
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:15.094
It takes a while

1125
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:16.595
I've been watching for several years

1126
00:59:17.388 --> 00:59:19.848
more rationally than anyone else
I'm a working friend

1127
00:59:19.932 --> 00:59:21.141
It's reasonable...

1128
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.395
It sounds like it has many meanings.

1129
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:28.649
It's something we have to dig into persistently.
You'll just have to roughly cover it up

1130
00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:29.984
I'm good at distinguishing

1131
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:31.402
(Jonghun) [Laughing] Don’t you know?

1132
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.446
The lawyer said that
They are specialized races

1133
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:38.534
Tsk, well, you don't have to worry.

1134
00:59:38.826 --> 00:59:40.119
The best thing is

1135
00:59:41.412 --> 00:59:42.913
Complete the investigation quickly

1136
00:59:43.122 --> 00:59:45.624
As if nothing had happened
I'm going back

1137
00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:48.961
(Sangdo) In that respect,
That suspect is perfect.

1138
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.172
The evidence is too weak

1139
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:54.925
It is true that I have a grudge against Song Young-jin, but

1140
00:59:55.384 --> 00:59:59.138
The only evidence I can show is
All I did was take a picture

1141
01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:01.724
Find out more

1142
01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:04.685
(Sangdo) The beginning of crime
It's mostly grudges

1143
01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:05.978
You know very well.

1144
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.355
I am that suspect

1145
01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:09.815
I really doubt it

1146
01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:12.151
That's right, no, why did you go there?

1147
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:13.819
[laughter]

1148
01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.279
[laughter]
[cell phone vibrating sound]

1149
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.242
(Jonghoon) Oh, wait a minute.

1150
01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:23.746
Uh, why?

1151
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.372
(Dohan) City council member was murdered

1152
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.459
Is that something to report at this time?

1153
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:29.793
(Dohan) Yes, before I was murdered.

1154
01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:32.087
Noh Sang-cheon is going to kill him.
A report call came in.

1155
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.172
What?

1156
01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:35.924
(Dohan) The likely suspect was identified at the scene.
Arrested and protected
[dark music]

1157
01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.092
Me, but...

1158
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:39.720
This is Byeongjun Lee.

1159
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.847
You said Byungjun Lee was following you.

1160
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.223
(Dohan) Yes, I missed it, in the meantime.

1161
01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:44.350
(Jonghoon) Mr. Lee

1162
01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.438
What is the name of the dead city council member?

1163
01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:51.231
This is Park Gwang-shin.

1164
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:56.695
Does anyone know?

1165
01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:58.739
I'll call you again later

1166
01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:01.575
[Call end sound]

1167
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.371
Who is the dead person?

1168
01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:07.247
This is Park Gwang-shin.

1169
01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.458
He was an aide to Rep. Kim Seong-dae.

1170
01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:17.549
Shouldn’t you go to the site and see it?

1171
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.138
[Camera shutter sounds repeatedly]

1172
01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.604
(Detective Park) You’re sure it’s Lee Byung-jun, right?

1173
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.398
That woman is an accomplice

1174
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.650
(Dohan) Think carefully.

1175
01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:39.321
Those two people

1176
01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.323
more than we think
I think there are a lot more secrets.

1177
01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:42.533
(Detective Park) Oh, you were caught at the scene.

1178
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.368
The blood hasn't dried on those clothes, but it's 100%.

1179
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:47.246
Even in the Song Young-jin incident,
I was caught loitering at the scene.

1180
01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:50.165
No evidence of involvement has yet been found.

1181
01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.210
(Detective Park) Oh, for real this time
I think it's clear, but I

1182
01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:56.797
Going over it and being sure
This is a very bad habit for a detective.

1183
01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:59.967
beyond reasonable doubt
There must be solid evidence

1184
01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:01.760
To take it to court

1185
01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.770
(Nayeon) What do you plan on doing?
[Byungjun’s sigh]

1186
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.234
(Byungjun) Don’t worry, you will be released.

1187
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.029
(Nayeon) Don’t worry about me

1188
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.159
Then don't worry about me

1189
01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.413
(Police 6) Loyalty, it’s over there.

1190
01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.665
- (Police 7) Loyalty
- (Police 8) Loyalty, are you here?

1191
01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.083
(Detective Shin) Are you here?

1192
01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:36.753
[Jonghun’s sigh]

1193
01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:39.131
Did you get something?

1194
01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:40.841
(Dohan) We are investigating.

1195
01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.509
(Jonghoon) The investigation into that guy is...

1196
01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.512
Won't you miss the guy who was following you?

1197
01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:46.847
What on earth are they doing?

1198
01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:49.933
(Dohan) Have you had a drink?

1199
01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:52.019
(Jonghoon) It’s not even business hours.
Why are you so intellectual?

1200
01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:53.979
I don't think you can smell it because of the alcohol.

1201
01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:56.440
What?

1202
01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.567
It’s been a while since you smelled the scene.
How do you feel?

1203
01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.779
Isn’t your heart racing?

1204
01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:30.807
Byeongjun Lee

1205
01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:33.852
Do you think you're sure this time?

1206
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.021
Yes, well, without asking above

1207
01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:38.148
Official arrest warrant
I think it will come out

1208
01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.400
[breathes and then exhales]

1209
01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.152
Hey, conductor.

1210
01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:44.029
(Jonghoon) Yes

1211
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.572
Is there anything I should know?

1212
01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:49.618
Now it's serial murder

1213
01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:53.288
I already know that

1214
01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:54.623
This is my second time

1215
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:57.834
third

1216
01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:01.547
[dark music]

1217
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:03.006
This is the third time

1218
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:07.302
Noh Sang-cheon kills me
Reported and murdered

1219
01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:03.228
