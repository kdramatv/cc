(Soram) Rep. Kim Seong-dae
Because it was specially introduced

10
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:23.542
You'll have to do well.

11
00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:26.086
(Sangcheon) Uh huh
Well, I told you not to worry, tsk

12
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.589
What is that?

16
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.348
(Soram) It’s a special communication business.

17
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.641
Do you know what it is?

18
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.601
[Interesting music]
[Sangcheon’s exasperated laughter]

19
00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.019
(Sangcheon) Of course you know, Mr.

20
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.147
Our Congressman Kim told me
Please introduce me to all of this.

21
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:46.899
Thanks, yeah

22
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.947
- (Sangcheon) Let me see.
- (Youngjin) Yes?

23
00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.118
(Sangcheon) What is the special communication business?

24
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.453
(Youngjin) Ah

25
00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.872
Well, to put it simply, it is the second telecommunication company.

26
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.833
(Sangcheon) Oh, like second finance?

27
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.252
(Youngjin) Well, it’s similar.
You can think about it.

28
00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:07.586
(Sangcheon) Sheesh, it’s no big deal.

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.963
No, but Rep. Kim

30
00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:11.549
Why do you do that to me?
Are you trying to connect me?

31
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.009
If it is a telecommunication business
Are you talking about starting a telecommunications company?

32
00:02:14.093 --> 00:02:15.135
This is going to cost a lot of money.

33
00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.345
(Soram) If it were like that

34
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.722
You probably didn't leave it to Boss Noh.

35
00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:19.807
(Sangcheon) That’s right

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.892
(Soram) Byeongjeong communication business
It's done by companies.

37
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:22.977
Mr. Noh

38
00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.020
don't even dream

39
00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:26.313
(Sangcheon) No, Secretary Jeong

40
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:28.524
Well, you speak very rudely, huh?

41
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.484
Oh, it's just me and that one company.
Is there anything you can't make! Mr.

42
00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:31.735
Then make it

43
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:33.112
(Soram) I...

44
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.032
I will be loyal to President Noh.

45
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.369
Okay, just stick to that, okay?

46
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.414
(Youngjin) IC
By connecting telecommunication businesses

47
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.832
Don't do telecommunication business

48
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.709
What's so complicated? Tsk

49
00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:49.211
So business is difficult.

50
00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:51.964
(Sangcheon) The more complicated it is, the more complicated it is.
Because people are less hot

51
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.591
There are more ways to make money.

52
00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.384
(Youngjin) Just doing what we were good at
Can't I do this?

53
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.261
Well, let’s do it in a multi-level way.

54
00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.305
I specialize in that too, I, huh?

55
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.140
(Sangcheon) Ah...

56
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:04.685
It's multi-level...

57
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.855
[Emphasized sound effect]

58
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.815
(President) When this technology becomes popular

59
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:13.402
All citizens have access to a variety of free calling services.
You will be able to receive it

60
00:03:13.903 --> 00:03:15.154
It's amazing

61
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.699
(Sangcheon) Oh, you mean this is that terminal?

62
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.409
It looks like a cell phone, but it's a little different.

63
00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.994
This is a TRS terminal model.

64
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.537
(President) For testing our technology
I bought it

65
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:24.914
(Sangcheon) Oh, so

66
00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:28.083
You can make calls like a cell phone
Is that what you mean?

67
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.420
Yes, but if I were to ask,
It's more similar to a walkie-talkie.

68
00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.047
(President) A radio with a very wide range?

69
00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:34.840
Well, you can think of it that way.

70
00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:37.009
You don't pay to use a walkie-talkie.

71
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.470
So you can make calls for free.

72
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.096
Write, that's what you're saying

73
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.141
Now you are explaining
To make that free call possible

74
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.310
This is absolutely necessary
Is that what you mean?

75
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.480
What I have now
This is the technology applied to this device.

76
00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:50.814
Then I should sell this too.

77
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.358
That's right

78
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.364
(Sangcheon) Oh my, you are doing a great business.

79
00:03:58.614 --> 00:03:59.698
[Laughing] You’re amazing.

80
00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:01.617
(President) Oh my, thank you, ah

81
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.160
(Sangcheon) Now

82
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.163
we sell this

83
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.581
[Emphasized sound effect]

84
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:11.001
(Soram) Into the telecommunication business
Let’s do multi-step?

85
00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.545
what? Sign up with a telecommunication company

86
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.923
If I bring more
Reduce communication costs and things like that?

87
00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:17.883
I have to say something that makes sense.

88
00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.135
(Sangcheon) Mr. Jeong So-ram

89
00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.304
You have to listen to what people say until the end.

90
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:23.764

91
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.140

Are you ignoring me?

93
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.354
(Soram) Please keep talking.

94
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.273
(Sangcheon) Be careful

95
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.444
Now, Nowfree is just bait.

96
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.530

97

Terminal?

98
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.324
(Sangcheon) This terminal
The second magnetic factor is beggar

99
00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:44.618
He's still carrying around magnets.
There are some scammers out there, right?

100
00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:46.829
Oh, that kind of magnet?
It only works in the 20th century

101
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.832
Now in the 21st century, this kind of venture business

102
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.834
[Youngjin’s surprised exclamation]
This digital thing works.

103
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.211

Wow, really

106

[Youngjin’s surprised exclamation]

109
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.565
(Youngjin) So many things
Where did you get it all?

110
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.735
(Sangcheon) From GT Communications
It was made as a replacement for cell phones.

111
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:18.902
I lost out on the competition

112
00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.238
Saying goodbye
I got it all for cheap

113

114
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.785

116
00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:29.997
Just one bowl

117
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.165
That's right
[Youngjin’s laughter]

118
00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:33.459
Ah, I heard you would drink lye if it was free.
The people of our country

119
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.918
If it's free, I'll be thrilled.

120
00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.003
(Sangcheon) So what is it?

121
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.964
We'll be selling free stuff from now on

122
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:40.507
(Youngjin) Hey, are you selling something for free?

123
00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:43.260
(Sangcheon) How much does the cell phone bill cost?

124
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.805
(Youngjin) Well, this person, that person
Well, because I talk on the phone a lot.

125
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.140
It comes out to over 100,000 won per month.

126
00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.266
What about Secretary Jeong?

127
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.144
(Soram) As I was working as a member of the National Assembly,
Hundreds of thousands of won is basic.

128
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.687
Yeah, but

129
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.774
If you buy this, calls are free

130
00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.818
(Sangcheon) How do you feel?

131
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.653
(Gwangshin) But is that possible?

132
00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:02.946
What about free calls?

133
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.032

135
00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:08.702
It uses technology used in walkie-talkies.

136
00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:11.830
Radio is free anyway

137
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:14.583
(Gwangshin) No, it explodes easily anywhere.

138
00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.376
That's the most important thing about cell phones.

139
00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.504
(Sangcheon) Oh, well, to us.
Is it important to pop well, huh?

140
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.547
What they sell to us
What's important is selling

141
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.258
We're going to sell people free stuff now

142
00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:25.594
'It's free of charge
'If you just buy this cell phone'

143
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:26.845
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

144
00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:28.889
There is only one magnet per person, but

145
00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.225
There is only one cell phone per person.
[light laughter]

146
00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:33.435
It's a scam

147
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.437
fraud

148
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:36.563
[Makes mouth sound]

149
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.651
(Sang Cheon) Is this person a fraud?

150
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:43.529
It's business, business, huh?

151
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.114
Hey

152
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:47.825

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.140
[Youngjin’s surprised exclamation]

176
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.894
What kind of 20,000 won machine
They say you can buy it for 1 million won?

177
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.979
[Interesting music]
It's worse than a magnet.

178
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.564
So that's your problem

179
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.566
(Sangcheon) So, magnet business.
Even though I did it for so long, I didn't get a share.

180
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.443
[Sangcheon clicks his tongue]
Still, it was worth making a living.

181
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.945
For taking my investment money, Mr.
You must have eaten well and lived well, all your life, Mr.

182
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.947
You earned more

183
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:11.825
From now on, always from the customer's perspective
to think

184
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:13.035
From the customer’s perspective?

185
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:14.912
Those people over there

186
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.496
(Sangcheon) Our beloved Hogu

187
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.916
No, I mean the customers.

188
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.417
(Employee) You can go.
Yeah, this is a great opportunity.

189
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.878
Speaking of this cell phone
They say it's a free phone.

190
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.463
The practicality is really great.

191
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.924
Take this one, just...

192
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.050
(Guest) Hey, I’m excited.

193
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.384
(Employee) Who didn’t take it? yes

194
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:31.762
(Sangcheon) How does it look?

195
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.889
(Youngjin) Ah, you look so bright and happy.

196
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.308
Already in those people's minds
I more than made up for it.

197
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.769
If the price is 1 million won
Calls are free for life

198
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.979
(Sangcheon) From monthly communication expenses
If you calculate it

199
00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:43.232
After a certain period of time
We'll reach the break-even point

200
00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.234
Children, and even other people
If you introduce me

201
00:08:45.317 --> 00:08:47.903
The price he paid for
30% payback

202
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.989
[Laughing] It’s a mess.
It's just a benefit

203
00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:53.784
And then he went out of his pocket.
I can't even think about 1 million won.

204
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.619
‘I’m smart’, huh?
‘He’s a great person.’

205
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:56.828
‘Oh my, I’m economical’

206
00:08:56.912 --> 00:08:58.455
I'm just living in this illusion

207
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.667
Paying back
Doesn't it seem like such a waste?

208
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.834
(Youngjin) That’s 30% too

209
00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:03.961
Are you stupid?

210
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.088
In the beginning of business
I only did it for a few people

211
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.422
It's okay if you just drag on time.

212
00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:08.840
[Youngjin’s exclamation]

213
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.342
(Youngjin) Write, then

214
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.552
How about targeting housewives?

215
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.389
If it helps you make a living
Wouldn’t it be difficult?

216
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:18.684
Switching your entire family to a device
It's a huge benefit

217
00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:21.645
(Sangcheon) Door-to-door employees are already there
I'm working hard to go door to door.

218
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.606
Write, you are always better than me
Your head is a little slow, huh?

219
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.401
Still, it wasn't bad
Try to roll a little faster from now on

220
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.153
Oh my

221
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.783
100 subscribers: 100 million won
1,000 people is 1 billion

222
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.159
10,000 people is 10 billion

223
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.370
100,000 people is 100 billion

224
00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.914
We're printing money now

225
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.625
Those people over there
They are machines that print money.

226
00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:48.547
Everyone just trust me and follow me

227
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.674
I'll literally let you sit on a money cushion.

228
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.719
(Soram) A few dealerships like this
Is that possible?

229
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.512
Well...

230
00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.349
I guess business isn't bad.

231
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.269
We need to make it big in earnest.
Because I saw the possibility

232
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.355
[heavy music]
mass production of terminals
I also need funds

233
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.483
I'm going to find an angel entrepreneur to invest in.

234
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.110
From now on

235
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.029
[Sangcheon’s laughter]

236
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.575
[Call connection tone]

237
00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.702
(Detective Kang) Yes, Gyeongcheon Seo.
This is team leader Kang Seok-gu.

238
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.704
(Dohan) Please check with someone.
Please

239
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.248
[Call end sound]

240
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.919
(Dohan) I’ll ask you again.

241
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.922
[dark music]
Jeong So-ram, did the deputy chief kill you?

242
00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.674
I didn't kill you
[shaking breathing]

243
00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.051
Why me, why me!

244
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.510
(Jonghun) Why did I kill that woman?

245
00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:38.221
A note with Noh Sang-cheon’s name written on it
That's the only reason I went there

246
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.360
Now tell me

247
00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.153
Why did you make a fake move?

248
00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:56.782
In the past connected to Noh Sang-cheon
What on earth happened?

249
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.329
[shaking breathing]

250
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.499
[sigh]

251
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.878
What am I doing?

252
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:11.880
[Jonghun’s sigh]

253
00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.385
I'm sorry, Dohan.

254
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.390
The conductor deserves it
All you need is a reason

255
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.017
(Dohan) What I want to hear
That's it

256
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:25.143
[Jonghun’s sigh]

257
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.649
Have you received a murder notice?

258
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.734
I've received numerous death threats.

259
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.028
Well, all police officers are like that.

260
00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:37.364
The deputy chief must have been like that when he was on active duty.

261
00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.907
I also got a lot

262
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:44.496
I just heard it with my ears and passed it on
Threats that don't make much sense

263
00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:49.876
[shaking breathing]
But this time it's scary

264
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.004
(Jonghun) I am like Jeong So-ram
Isn’t it possible?

265
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.340
I'm really scared

266
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.301
I feel like death is just around the corner

267
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.680
So you revealed that it was Jeong So-ram?

268
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.432
To ensure that the investigation proceeds properly?

269
00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:06.685
Know who the victim is
We will conduct a proper investigation.

270
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.729
So before I die
Because I have to catch the criminal

271
00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.690
You tried so hard to cover it up

272
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.693
You have changed actively now.

273
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.820
To change that position without justification

274
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.488
You must have been embarrassed.

275
00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:21.533
[Jonghun’s sigh]
(Dohan) So I investigated it myself and

276
00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.785
The victim is Jeong So-ram.
To pretend like I knew

277
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:24.995
You made a plan

278
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.455
Is that correct?

279
00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.416
That's all evident

280
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.171
Where did I come from and what did I do?
Don't you know?

281
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.547
(Dohan) All kinds of excuses

282
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.383
Self-justification was rampant.
I came from the battlefield, I

283
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.719
Detectives.

284
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:45.098
The criminal threatens to kill
Do you know why you're not afraid?

285
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.601
Because I’m proud

286
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.063
No matter how much criminals threaten
Because they have no cause

287
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:57.110
But
There's something the conductor said just now.

288
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:58.778
This time it's scary

289
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:02.699
The conductor is proud of that.
That's because I can't do it.

290
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.702
The culprit that the conductor thinks is

291
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.621
There is a reason.

292
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.166
Who are you?

293
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.877
The guy the conductor thinks of

294
00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:23.386
(Dohan) Who is that person?
Where are you now?

295
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.348
12 years ago, when Noh Sang-cheon was about to run away

296
00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.892
I killed one of the attendants.

297
00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.436
(Nayeon) I stayed in prison for that crime.

298
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.230
I was released from prison not long ago.

299
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.565
That person is a murderer
Are you thinking about it?

300
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.109
He's the one sending the text message

301
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.654
(Dohan) That’s why I want to protect you.

302
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.323
You, Byungjun Lee, and all the victims

303
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.158
[cell phone vibrating sound]

304
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.119
(Dohan) Yes

305
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.871
(Detective Kang) The photo you sent
It was confirmed right away

306
00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:52.791
But this is so ridiculous
It was confirmed right away?

307
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.168
Do you remember? When you came to Gyeongcheon at that time

308
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.421
People coming in and out of the officetel
I said I would ask you to confirm.

309
00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.756
yes, i remember

310
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.050
Yes, he was there, that guy.

311
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.677
(Detective) Let’s take a look at this.
[Meaningful music]

312
00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.972
Among them, the identity is still
These are unidentified people

313
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.433
(Detective Kang) Who is he?

314
00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.018
Am I even a culprit?

315
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.729
Suspect, not yet.

316
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.049
[Mouse operation sound]

317
00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.554
(Dohan) Due to a murder case
When Nosangcheon rises to the surface

318
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.848
Will the fraud investigation begin again?

319
00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.182
[Dohan’s exasperated voice]

320
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.394
Can fraud be compared to murder?

321
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.937
‘That’s a scam’?

322
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.522
[Nayeon’s sigh]

323
00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:02.027
A person who commits suicide after being scammed

324
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.195
Don't you know there are more people being murdered?

325
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.448
Fraud and murder should be viewed as equal

326
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.574
you will see something

327
00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.118
That kind of mindset, even if people die

328
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.746
All you have to do is come up with Noh Sangman.

329
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.040
[sigh]

330
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.261
(Nayeon) Oppa

331
00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.056
Is this what you want?

332
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.935
(Jae Hwang) No
This is not what I wanted

333
00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.979
[Calm music]

334
00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.523
(Jae Hwang) What I want is

335
00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.027
Because you studied hard
Becoming a great person

336
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.363
I couldn't do it

337
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.697
[Jaehwang is crying]

338
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.576
I couldn't even finish college

339
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.704
You're here after all

340
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.415
What's this about scammers

341
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.043
Dad and brother too

342
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.795
Nayeon, listen carefully.

343
00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.713
(Jae Hwang) I’m really okay

344
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.092
Just finish your sentence here and get out.

345
00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:11.054
Then you can start fresh, don't worry

346
00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.390
Before my brother came out

347
00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.643
Noh Sang-cheon, I will catch that fraudster and wait for you.

348
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.658
(Dohan) As of now, the best
The prime suspect is Jeong Jae-hwang.

349
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:35.078
Victims Jeong So-ram, Song Young-jin, and Park Kwang-shin
He is a connected person.
[Remote control operation sound]

350
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.955
(Inspector Han) What is it?
What do you mean by serial murder?

351
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.165
Yes, although it's still private
[Remote control operation sound]

352
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.459
(Dohan) With the keyword ‘Noh Sangcheon’
These are the events that took place

353
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.169
(Inspector Han) If the media finds out, there will be an uproar.

354
00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.713
to the media
It won't be easy to get out

355
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.005
(Inspector Han) What does that mean?

356
00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.799
(Jonghoon) Well, I have some questions for you.

357
00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.968
(Inspector Han) Oh, yes, sorry, Deputy Chief.

358
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:52.595
(Do-han) Yes, the suspect Jeong Jae-hwang was 12 years ago.

359
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.639
He was wanted for a Ponzi scheme at the time.

360
00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:57.058
Noh Sang-cheon's entourage
Served in prison for murder

361
00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.476
I was recently released from prison

362
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.147
After being released from prison, I had a grudge.
Looking for people

363
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.190
By committing murder
I'm figuring it out

364
00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.817
(Inspector Han) Then there will be a next target?

365
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.488
[dark music]
Is that the end for people with grudges?

366
00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:11.614
There won't be another one

367
00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.784
Then, if you find that target in advance,
Can't we catch the criminal too?

368
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.747
(Dohan) Is there a next target?
If so, who is it?

369
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.998
Currently unknown

370
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.666
(Inspector Han) Lee Byeong-jun, who was caught before,
What happens?

371
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.626
He confessed
They sent it to the prosecution.

372
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.170
(Jonghoon) Not Byungjun Lee

373
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.672
Jeong Jae-hwang is right, he is the culprit.

374
00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.507
(Inspector Han) Then, Byungjun Lee
Why did you confess?

375
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:31.926
(Dohan) Jeong Jae-hwang also

376
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.095
There is no evidence other than circumstantial evidence.

377
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.723
The first incident occurred
Except for Gyeongcheon Officetel

378
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.892
At another incident scene
It's never been seen

379
00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.352
If this continues, even if Jeong Jae-hwang is arrested,

380
00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:42.771
There is too little evidence

381
00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.647
While efforts are being made to arrest Jeong Jae-hwang,

382
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.858
There is also evidence that he did it
You also have to find it

383
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.568
(Inspector Han) I guess
I think it was Lee Byung-Jun who did it.

384
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.736
I even confessed

385
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.238
And to the prosecution
This is a case where the prime suspect passed away.

386
00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:54.115
we have another suspect
Can I track you?

387
00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:55.325
(Dohan) Yes, that’s right

388
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.411
The prosecution is interrogating Lee Byeong-jun.
I know there is

389
00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.205
There will be results one way or another.

390
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.499
But we too
Shouldn’t we be prepared?

391
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.797
Can we proceed with the investigation?

392
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.883
(Inspector Han) This

393
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:15.178
Later at the prosecution
I think I'll raise the issue formally.

394
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.763
Who is responsible for this?

395
00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.223
I am responsible

396
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.352
(Jong Hoon) We are conducting an investigation into Jeong Jae-hwang.

397
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:23.436
(Inspector Han) Yes?

398
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.979
Then a suspect in a serial murder case.

399
00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.607
We will proceed with the investigation into Jeong Jae-hwang.

400
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.151
As everyone knows, this is a private investigation.

401
00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.825
[rustling sound]
[Prosecutor sighs]

402
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.995
(Prosecutor) Well, there’s nothing to see about this.
Are you the culprit?

403
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.498
Looking at what you said, it seems like a big deal, right?

404
00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.333
It's not

405
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.293
No, he confessed.

406
00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:49.254
This is a forced confession.

407
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.841
The police forced
[The prosecutor's exasperated voice]

408
00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.676
Confess and get stamped

409
00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.719
(Prosecutor) Does that make sense? In this day and age?

410
00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.097
no, no

411
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.558
Since you confessed, you are the criminal.

412
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.310
yes, that's right

413
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.563
Why are you driving me?

414
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.067
Where did you get the call from?
I must be the culprit

415
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.820
What are you talking about? What are you looking at the prosecutor for? Mr. Lee

416
00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.530
(Prosecutor) We are different from the police.

417
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.157
Do whatever you want.

418
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.617
[Meaningful music]

419
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:23.121
Anyway, I'm not the criminal
the results will come out

420
00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.956
The more time passes until then

421
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.043
Because I like it

422
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.255
[sigh]

423
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:33.798
[Excited laughter]

424
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:34.966
(Prosecutor) Yes

425
00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.136
Suspect coming now?

426
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.262
yes

427
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.349
Oh, if it's a confession, then it's a sure thing.

428
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.144
Yes, yes, okay, yes

429
00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.229
[Call end sound]

430
00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.447
Oh, I can't do this.

431
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.578
Are you really going to recant your confession?

432
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:04.746
Hey

433
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.749
I am a shadow

434
00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:14.172
If you hold onto the shadow and insist it’s real

435
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.467
Well, do you get a prize?

436
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.801
[Excited sound]

437
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:21.971
[Prosecutor sighs]

438
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.020
(Yeon-gwang) Na-yeon, I...

439
00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.315
(Cheongju’s house) What about Byeongjun?

440
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.860
Did you come out from the prosecution?

441
00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:39.238
[People are murmuring]

442
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.784
I'm a crazy bitch

443
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:48.164
Mr. Byeongjun can’t even come out.
I told the police everything.

444
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.417
I'm sorry, I did something useless.

445
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:52.961
It's okay

446
00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:56.839
It was just a matter of time anyway.
What the police know

447
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.300
(Cheongju’s house) Well, but

448
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:03.972
Why can’t Byeongjun come out?

449
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.559
It's not coming out.

450
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.645
(Cheongju’s house) Huh?
[heavy music]

451
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.815
It's because I want to protect you.

452
00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.150
Who?

453
00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:19.779
(Cheongju’s house) Because I want to protect someone
Are you saying that?

454
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:23.700
No way

455
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.620
Is what people say true?

456
00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:31.332
Everyone is really Jaehwang

457
00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.960
That's why I think it was like that.
Everyone now?

458
00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:38.715
[surprised gasp]

459
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.844
So that's it

460
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.597
That’s why Byeongjun did it.

461
00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.402
(Prosecutor) Confession evidence, we can’t ignore this.

462
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:01.112
Even if I withdraw now

463
00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.031
If there's just one piece of evidence, it's out of the question.

464
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.950
I will never be able to smell the outside air for the rest of my life.
[Tap on the desk]

465
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:09.037
(Prosecutor) Lee Byung-jun, do you understand?

466
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.747
Is it still okay?

467
00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:13.249
[sigh]

468
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:19.797
[light sigh]

469
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.758
How have you been?

470
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.052
Is it time for you to worry about me?

471
00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.928
[heavy music]
[Byungjun’s sigh]

472
00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.182
Are you feeling okay?

473
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.808
yes

474
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:34.479
I'm young, I eat well.

475
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:35.938
I also read a lot of books

476
00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:37.565
i am sorry

477
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.735
Young guy, what is this?

478
00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:41.986
[shaking breathing]

479
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.196
Because of me

480
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.406
don't be sorry
This is what I did

481
00:22:46.491 --> 00:22:48.701
[nervous music]
I have to pay for my sins

482
00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:50.953
Even if I wasn't angry...

483
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:53.998
Everything would have been like that in that situation.

484
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:55.583
(Jae Hwang) But

485
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.128
What happened to that sister?

486
00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.089
Jeong So-ram?

487
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:03.758
(Byungjun) Ah, that bad bitch.

488
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.053
Even if I didn't trick you into coming in and getting into trouble.

489
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.971
There's no reason for you to be here

490
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.517
Just wait and see

491
00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:15.353
I'm going to catch that bitch and kill her.

492
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:17.396
No, mister.

493
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:19.732
(Jae Hwang) You just stay there.

494
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.401
I'll take care of it.

495
00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:25.446
What do you do?
I need to be here

496
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.615
You're not here forever!

497
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.619
I have an idea

498
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.707
I can't do it

499
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:39.502
Jae Hwang

500
00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:42.046
Hide

501
00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:47.468
I'll be buying time

502
00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:51.264
Hiding and hiding again

503
00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:55.643
Don't get caught this time
[Meaningful music]

504
00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:02.441
[sigh]

505
00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:35.016
(Dohan) Where are you going?

506
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.059
why? Without any contact

507
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:39.187
(Dohan) Ah, in the current situation
Please contact me in advance...

508
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.523
(Jonghun) Hey, you earlier
Did you intentionally brief it like that?

509
00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:46.152
The investigation into Jeong Jae-hwang is officially underway.
To blame it on me

510
00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:48.988
Ah, so the investigation can be done
Please understand because we can proceed.

511
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.698
In this case, I
You can't go to hell, can you?

512
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.284
[Excited sound]
You're thorough, you bastard.

513
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.204
I understand why the win rate was so high.

514
00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:58.456
(Dohan) Where have you been?

515
00:24:58.539 --> 00:24:59.790
What do you mean, that again?

516
00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.752
You were following Jeong Jae-hwang's whereabouts just the other day.

517
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:05.296
You were lying when you said you went to Gyeongcheon.

518
00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:07.590
In reality, you were looking for Jeong Jae-Hwang.

519
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:10.051
yes

520
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.762
(Dohan) What happened after being released from prison?
Did you find it?

521
00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:14.180
Have you had any results?

522
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:18.184
(Jonghun) I don’t know where he’s hiding.

523
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:22.772
I searched everywhere I could find a guess.

524
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:25.441
Just...

525
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:28.778
This bastard is like Jeong So-ram
Didn’t they get plastic surgery?

526
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.696
[Meaningful music]

527
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.698
Then I can't find it

528
00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:38.996
[Dohan’s light sigh]

529
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.164
(Dohan) Are you afraid?

530
00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:44.961
If Jeong Jae-hwang is really a murderer

531
00:25:45.044 --> 00:25:47.797
And people like revenge
If you go around killing for trivial reasons

532
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.340
I will definitely catch it

533
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:51.425
Because murder is absolutely unacceptable.

534
00:25:52.093 --> 00:25:53.469
Those who were murdered

535
00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:56.472
Because the rest of my life is completely taken away from me.

536
00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:00.393
So let’s go find Jaehwang Jeong
Please tell me the route you took.

537
00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.301
[Dark sound effect]

538
00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:36.971
[dark music]

539
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:45.771
[rattling sound]

540
00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:50.776
[Increasing sound effect]

541
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:59.910
[shaking breathing]

542
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:03.039
[dark music]
(Dohan) Are you afraid?

543
00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:05.833
The conductor is proud of that.
That's because I can't do it.

544
00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:07.710
The culprit that the conductor thinks is

545
00:27:08.336 --> 00:27:09.462
There is a reason.

546
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:22.975
[angry sound]

547
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:26.896
Don't keep repeating the same thing.

548
00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:29.148
All you have to do is answer accurately.

549
00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:32.401
Noh Sang-cheon

550
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:34.820
Are you sure he's dead?

551
00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:36.405
I kept telling you

552
00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:38.282
Does it matter?

553
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.121
Going on a murder spree now?
I heard it's Jeong Jae-hwang.

554
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:47.500
Until yesterday, only Lee Byung-jun
They said all you have to do is pull it in, tsk.

555
00:27:48.084 --> 00:27:50.711
[Tap] No, Noh Sang-cheon is alive and dead.
What's so important?

556
00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:53.214
What do you think Jeong Jae-hwang wants?

557
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:54.340
[snort]

558
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:57.176
- Revenge?
- (Jonghoon) That’s right.

559
00:27:58.803 --> 00:28:03.182
The murder I'm doing now
If it's because of revenge

560
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:06.811
The prey you want to kill the most
Why not bring it to me?

561
00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:08.396
As the biggest one

562
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.272
Is that Noh Sang-cheon?

563
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.026
If he kills Noh Sang-man,

564
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.319
What about Deputy Director Kang?

565
00:28:16.445 --> 00:28:17.905
Well, do you think you'll be okay?

566
00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:19.240
I'm sure the chief prosecutor will be safe too.

567
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:22.618
(Sangdo) Hello, keep looking at me
Don't put it in there

568
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:25.371
My name is on that rotten bastard's list
It wasn't there at all!

569
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.957
Yes, ‘prosecutor’s name unknown’

570
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.917
(Jonghun) I didn’t know your name back then
You probably didn't write it down.

571
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.421
But who is it by now?
Surely you didn't know?

572
00:28:33.504 --> 00:28:34.588
[snort]

573
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.258
No, even so

574
00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:40.177
Do you think I'll be treated so foolishly?

575
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.972
Chief Prosecutor, the important thing right now is
[slams the table]

576
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:46.851
It means we are in the same boat.

577
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:50.020
(Jonghun) There’s a hole in that boat
There are holes everywhere

578
00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:53.607
Then we need to close that hole
somehow

579
00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:56.152
Let's close that hole together
I can buy it

580
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.196
Please tell me

581
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:02.491
Noh Sang-cheon

582
00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:04.952
Dead or alive?

583
00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:07.746
[sigh]

584
00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:15.880
[Sound of strong breathing]
[siren sound]

585
00:29:25.598 --> 00:29:26.599
(Dohan) What is it?

586
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.142
(Nayeon) Let’s go

587
00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:30.728
Jeong Jae-hwang's parents
Aren't you going to meet me?

588
00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:33.981
[Dohan’s exasperated voice]
(Dohan) No...

589
00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:35.483
No, what, are you eavesdropping?

590
00:29:35.566 --> 00:29:37.485
[Sighing] You’re going too far.

591
00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:40.321
I got a call from my parents.

592
00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:42.948
The police contacted me saying they would come see me.

593
00:29:43.032 --> 00:29:44.366
So is there more to it than that?

594
00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:49.663
[Dohan sighs]

595
00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.130
This car is nice

596
00:29:58.214 --> 00:29:59.840
After all, expensive cars are different.

597
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:03.177
Let's go quietly

598
00:30:04.887 --> 00:30:06.847
Has he been elevated to the top of the list of suspects?

599
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:08.849
Jaehwang Jeong

600
00:30:09.058 --> 00:30:11.227
There in front of the station
I'll stop you, so get down.

601
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.645
Oh, why?

602
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:15.397
and my car
I parked it at the police headquarters.

603
00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:18.150
No, police investigation
Does it make sense for civilians to get involved?

604
00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:19.818
Are you a civilian?

605
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:21.779
I received an official request, right?

606
00:30:22.238 --> 00:30:23.614
(Nayeon) To Jaehwang oppa’s mother

607
00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:26.742
Ask me to stay with you because the police are coming.

608
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.494
It's driving me crazy, really.

609
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:30.955
(Nayeon) Okay, so my role today is

610
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:32.623
This is it

611
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:39.672
[Dohan’s exasperated breathing]

612
00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:43.968
I guess I'll have to catch him as an impersonator or something.

613
00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:50.724
(Jaehwang Mo) A few days ago too
The police came to visit me

614
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:54.853
(Dohan) Yes, our deputy director is probably here.

615
00:30:54.937 --> 00:30:56.355
[Jae-hwang mock snort]

616
00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:59.149
(Jae Hwang’s mother) That nobleman was very spiritual.

617
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:00.776
Even though so much time has passed

618
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.653
(Dohan) Did you know, him?

619
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:06.782
In the past, there was a disaster
I came and saw it a few times.

620
00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:11.161
Because he was the police officer in charge of the fraudster at the time.

621
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:15.457
It's a crime that we weren't there

622
00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:19.086
[Calm music]
That good guy killed people too.

623
00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:25.009
If it weren't for those scammers
I'm not the type of kid that will do that.

624
00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:28.429
Jaehwang oppa, just like the old days
I'll be back again

625
00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:30.598
You have a gentle nature.

626
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:32.516
I don't know
[Sigh mixed with tears]

627
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.892
This guy is released from prison

628
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:37.313
Show your face for just a few days
Because there is no news of where he went.

629
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.898
(Dohan) Deputy Director came and
That's what you asked, right?

630
00:31:39.982 --> 00:31:41.358
Mr. Jeong Jae-hwang’s whereabouts

631
00:31:41.442 --> 00:31:45.321
That's right, but we really don't know.

632
00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.364
I haven't had any contact

633
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.992
Did they contact you?

634
00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:53.579
No, I said I had work to do.

635
00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:56.707
(Nayeon) I’ll contact you after everything is finished.

636
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.544
I only had one phone call after I was released from prison.

637
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:04.923
(Dohan) I am Mr. Jeong Jae-hwang.
I looked up some case records.

638
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:06.634
I saw some regrets.

639
00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.346
Meet the right lawyer
If it was a case of manslaughter

640
00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:12.723
Sentence can be greatly reduced
I think there was

641
00:32:12.806 --> 00:32:15.601
[Emperor’s mock sigh]
(Jae Hwang’s name) I don’t have money to buy a lawyer.

642
00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:18.771
I did what the public defender told me to do.

643
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.982
Anyway, this guy
Because killing people is wrong

644
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:25.736
Still, I got out of prison
While I was at home for a few days

645
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:27.154
My face was bright

646
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.906
Who are you going to meet, then

647
00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:31.909
The money that was stolen so far
I think I can make it up to you
[Meaningful music]

648
00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:34.453
Something good will happen

649
00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:37.581
That's why I met Nayeon
I'm holding on

650
00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:39.541
What does that mean?

651
00:32:40.084 --> 00:32:41.877
Please tell me in detail

652
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.796
Who did you say you were meeting with?

653
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:45.631
Maybe you know someone too?

654
00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:48.884
I heard he was someone who was at the victims' meeting.

655
00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:50.803
(Jaehwang Mo) What was your name?

656
00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:53.806
‘Han’, what did you say?

657
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.265
Handajeong?

658
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.935
(Nayeon) Are you by any chance Han Da-jeong?

659
00:32:58.018 --> 00:32:59.520
(Jae Hwang Mo) That’s right, that person.

660
00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:01.188
Han Da-jeong

661
00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:02.690
I heard it right.

662
00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:06.568
When I meet that person
I said I could solve everything

663
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:12.991
[Sound of moon]
[Sound of strength]

664
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.005
(Sangdo) Deputy Kang is really persistent today.

665
00:33:27.089 --> 00:33:29.508
[dark music]
I followed you all the way here
What do you want to do?

666
00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.177
Time for the person to meet to arrive
It's all said and done

667
00:33:32.261 --> 00:33:33.345
(Jonghoon) Today

668
00:33:34.722 --> 00:33:36.598
I really need to hear the answer

669
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:40.144
[light sigh]

670
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:42.604
If you give me the answer

671
00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:45.190
Would you believe me?

672
00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:46.900
(Sangdo) Even if it’s not the answer you want?

673
00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:50.446
Let’s listen and then judge.

674
00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:53.365
[sigh]

675
00:33:56.577 --> 00:33:57.870
Actually I don't know

676
00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.955
(Sangdo) Noh Sang-cheon Life and Death

677
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:04.168
Noh Sangcheon is up there
After rising like a rocket

678
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.670
I was blocked at some point too

679
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:12.634
At that time, I was playing with those superiors.
You don't even care about me?

680
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.928
All information is blocked

681
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:16.388
Really?

682
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:20.142
No, I came this far
Why would I lie?

683
00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:23.771
(Sangdo) And I have one more piece of advice.

684
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.316
Don't be too obsessed with Jeong Jae-hwang.

685
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.692
What is that...

686
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:31.195
[Emphasized sound effect]

687
00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:33.405
Committing murder now

688
00:34:34.198 --> 00:34:35.991
It may not be Jeong Jae-hwang.

689
00:34:40.788 --> 00:34:42.414
Why is it him?

690
00:34:42.498 --> 00:34:43.540
(Dohan) Who?

691
00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:46.502
Handajeong? What does this person do?

692
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:49.421
At the victims' meeting
was one of the victims

693
00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:52.132
And he is also a fraudster

694
00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:53.634
(Dohan) What do you mean?

695
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:55.469
A victim and a fraudster?

696
00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:56.887
I'll know when I meet you

697
00:34:57.179 --> 00:34:58.639
(Nayeon) Shall I make an appointment?

698
00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:02.392
(Do-han) Yes, well, Jeong Jae-hwang
If you met someone, you should meet them.

699
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:05.813
But if you are a victim,

700
00:35:05.896 --> 00:35:08.398
two people together
The chances of this happening...

701
00:35:17.783 --> 00:35:21.411
(Sangdo) Committing murder now
It may not be Jeong Jae-hwang.

702
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:23.747
Unless it's Jeong Jae-hwang

703
00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:26.792
What's going on?

704
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:28.335
I don't know either

705
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:30.254
me too

706
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.464
Ah, Mr.

707
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:34.675
[Car starting sound]

[Embarrassed sound]

712
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.214
(Jonghun) Well, no contact?

713
00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:16.133
(Detective Jeong) [Sighing] It’s quiet.

714
00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:18.343
Where is this guy hiding, ugh

715
00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:19.845
Have you searched your home and all your acquaintances?

716
00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:21.847
(Detective Jeong) Oh, the detectives
I'm monitoring it

717
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.307
Well, there's nothing special.

718
00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:26.393
They were also hidden at the expected smuggling point.

719
00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:27.519
Well, nothing special

720
00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:31.440
Ah, Song Young-jin, this bastard
Where have you disappeared, huh?

721
00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:33.442
(Detective Jeong) So, that’s right.

722
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:35.611
Hey, please go to Song Young-jin’s house.

723
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.238
(Detective Cho) I understand.

724
00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:40.866
(Jonghun) And the victims

725
00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:43.869
keep going among themselves
I think they're chasing Noh Sang-cheon.

726
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.329
Warn me again

727
00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:46.997
Don't let the police do what they should do

728
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.874
(Detective Jeong) Yes, I understand.
[Detective Jeong’s encouraging voice]

729
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:50.751
- (Detective Jeong) Let’s go.
- (Detective Joe) Yes.

730

[Youngjin huffs]

732
00:36:56.632 --> 00:36:58.216
These idiots

733
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.428
If you risk your life and give me information
Should have caught it, missed it?
[Moon So-ri]

[Angrily breathing]
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

735
00:37:14.942 --> 00:37:16.568
(Youngjin) Well, let’s borrow the phone.

736
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:18.403
Yes?

737
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:20.072
Let's borrow my phone

[laughter]

740
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.547
It's a private call, so please take a seat...

741
00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:38.674
[sigh]

742
00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:40.550

745
00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:55.649
(Jonghoon) This is Kang Jonghoon.

746
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.317
(Youngjin) No, fuck

747
00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:59.194
Even if I tell you properly, you can’t catch me?

748
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.362
Where are you!

749
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:01.446
It's hell

750
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.656
Are you crazy?

751
00:38:03.198 --> 00:38:04.199
Do you want to die?

752
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:07.077
(Youngjin) What, because of the stupid police?

753
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.787
I already died once?

754
00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:10.706
I barely survived

755
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:14.167
Hey, my legs are sore! fuck

756
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:15.752
Yeah, sorry about that.

757
00:38:15.836 --> 00:38:17.796
Huh? That's what we do
There was a bit

758
00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:20.173
You, right now, Noh Sang-cheon
Do you know where it is?

759
00:38:20.257 --> 00:38:21.299
[Excited sound]

760
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:25.887
How do you know that I am about to die?

761
00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:28.640
(Jonghun) No, if you pass on Noh Sang-cheon’s material,

762
00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:30.684
I will take you out unconditionally

763
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:31.810
You know that, right?

764
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:32.978

잡혀서 죽는 게 더 빠르겠네

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.069
더 이상 나 찾지 마쇼

768
00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.237
그거 말하려고 전화한 거요

769

아니야, 아니야, 그러지 말고...
[뚝 끊긴다]

아주 야물딱지게 쓰네

아주 지랄하고 자빠졌네, 씨

779
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.811
(재황) 그래서 그나마
정신 차린 거 아닐까요?

780
00:39:16.813 --> 00:39:19.524
It's intelligent, at least now
You've come to your senses.

781
00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:21.693
(Reunion) Where did you go? Jeong So-ram

782
00:39:21.777 --> 00:39:22.903
(Yeon-Gwang) Oh

783
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:24.654
They say they can't come here anymore because they're anxious.

784
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:26.948
- (Reunion) What?
- (Woman) Nimi, I feel anxious.

785
00:39:27.032 --> 00:39:28.658
Where did you run away?

786
00:39:28.742 --> 00:39:32.079
After discussing with Mr. Byeongjun,
I prepared a hideout nearby.

787
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.706
(Jae Hwang) As we continue to receive information
We decided to communicate

788
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:39.002
Me and Mr. Byeongjun, I will take good care of you.

[Clears throat] Why?

794
00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:32.472
How long do I have to stay here?

795
00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:35.350
(Sangcheon) Just a little bit
Buy a little more time

796
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.853
Confusing here and there

797
00:40:38.562 --> 00:40:41.773
Oh, the ship is wanted again.
Well, it won't take long.

798
00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:44.359
I told Rep. Kim Seong-dae
Shall I ask you a favor?

799
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:46.444
If it's my request, you can do it

800
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:49.281
Do you think Rep. Kim will help you?
You, who was just a secretary?

[Sangcheon’s sneer]

802
00:40:51.408 --> 00:40:53.034
(Sangcheon) Oh, besides
What is that person doing these days?

803
00:40:53.118 --> 00:40:55.245
He was working as an opposition kingmaker.

804
00:40:55.328 --> 00:40:57.038
You called me a while ago
Do you know what they're saying?

805
00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:59.583
'I'm also careful about falling leaves'

806
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:03.253
[Laughing] Fuck, kid, that bastard.
A crazy kid?

807
00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:05.964
(Sangcheon) No, to put it bluntly,
Aren’t the things you’ve received so far just fallen leaves?

808
00:41:06.173 --> 00:41:08.008
King or kingmaker

809
00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:13.013
The day my eyes rolled over
I'm going to expose it all, fuck, tsk.

810
00:41:13.597 --> 00:41:14.681
Okay

811
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.854

[Sangcheon’s Sigh]

813
00:41:22.189 --> 00:41:24.399
You will feel embarrassed when you are next to someone.

[Disgruntled sound of vocal cords]

815
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:28.236
(Sangcheon) This is how I understand
Our Soram

816
00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:29.905
Didn’t I tell you to listen?

817
00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:32.073
(Sangcheon) Hey, what are you saying?
Do you make me feel bad like that?

818
00:41:32.157 --> 00:41:33.325
Boy, that stupid language

819
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.827
If you come to the congressman and whine about it,

820
00:41:35.911 --> 00:41:37.704
How annoying can this be?

821
00:41:39.039 --> 00:41:42.459
(Seongdae) Chairman Roh and Secretary Jeong
We've been together for a long time

822

It seems like you're being good to me
Meg at a critical time?

823
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:49.799
Well, kind of a love-hate relationship.
You can look at it like that.

824
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:52.177
(Sangcheon) Even though we are doing well

825
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.180
In the old days
When you think of me ignoring you, shit, shit

826
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.184
Oh, well, even things like that.
You don't need to worry.

827
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.435
Um, so

828
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.854
How are you going to help me?

829
00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:07.359

no!

835
00:42:53.613 --> 00:42:55.323
(Fanatical) No, how did you get here...

836
00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:56.491
It's difficult if you do this here.

837
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.784
(Youngjin) Where is Seongdae Kim?

838
00:42:57.993 --> 00:42:59.119
Seongdae Kim, come out!

839
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.954

어, 불러

00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:06.167
(영진) 부르라고, 이 새끼야
[광신의 당황한 소리]

842

나도 할 말 많으니까

843

너도 다 알잖아, 이 새끼야

844
00:43:11.381 --> 00:43:13.049
그 이름 말해 줄까?

845
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.509
no

(Gwangshin) Oh my, why are you doing this again?
[Youngjin continues speaking with difficulty]

848
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:19.306
I'm so happy

849
00:43:19.389 --> 00:43:20.598
(Vocal cords) What's so loud?

850
00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:21.766
(Gwangshin) Ah, Senator.

It's been a while

854
00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:35.363
Why?

855
00:43:35.447 --> 00:43:37.574
Are you surprised that I'm alive?

856
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.409
[Youngjin’s laughter]

857
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:43.747
That I should be dead
How did they know?

858
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:46.374
Oh my, did you hurt your leg?

859
00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:48.126
Well, that's how it happened.

860
00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:51.963
Because I traded my life for a leg.

861
00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:54.674
(Youngjin) It wasn’t a loss-making business.

862
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.384
(Vocal cords) I'm glad

863
00:43:57.594 --> 00:43:58.970
But

864
00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:00.305
[Youngjin moans in pain]

865
00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:05.268
(Vocal cords) Where did this bastard come from to me?
That's rude, you bastard
[Youngjin’s scream]

866
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.020
Are you a gangster or something, Mr. Lee?

867
00:44:07.103 --> 00:44:08.480
You bastard!

868
00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.732
Issi, this bastard, really, sir.
[Youngjin’s groans with difficulty]

869
00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:13.735
[Heavy breathing]

870
00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.070
[vocal laughter]

871
00:44:15.445 --> 00:44:17.572
If you keep acting like this

872
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:22.535
Four heads to consider whether there is damage or not
What if it gets cut off and disappears?

873
00:44:23.453 --> 00:44:25.246
Hey, what are you doing? Show me it

874
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.957
(fanatic) Yes, Senator.
Seunghwan, pull this person out.
[Disapproving sound of vocal cords]

875
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.292
wake up
[Youngjin’s groans with difficulty]

876
00:44:29.376 --> 00:44:30.794
(Youngjin) Representative!

877
00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.337
[Gwangshin’s encouraging sound]
Senator!

878
00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:35.173
You know the ban, right? Ban money!
[dark music]

879
00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:36.758
[Youngjin’s heavy breathing]

880
00:44:42.889 --> 00:44:44.224
ban

881
00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:46.476
That's it

882
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.317
Where did you hear about the ban?

883
00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:56.778
(Youngjin) That’s it, sir.

884
00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.530
Can you contact Noh Sang-cheon?

885
00:45:00.407 --> 00:45:03.201
Ah, what should I answer?

886
00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:05.120
'Cause you know I'm dead

887
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.955
I will still contact you now

888
00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:09.999
(Youngjin) Honestly, it’s annoying, right?
Because I keep whining

889
00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:17.841
If you know that the connection is tied
Kingmaker and Nabal

890
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:20.051
Your career as a congressman is over.

891
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.262
I cover up my words

892
00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:24.264
[Exhales]

893
00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:25.849
Yeah, well, shit, shit.

894
00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:28.685
Someone like me should spread the truth

895
00:45:28.768 --> 00:45:30.895
(Youngjin) Well, it won’t work.

896
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.565
IC

897
00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.568
Still, don’t I have to live too?

898
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:37.986
I also have a wife and children.

899
00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:40.738
I have a meeting in 5 minutes

900
00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:42.073
You have a very impatient personality.

901
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:43.783
Do you want to get beaten up again?

902
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:49.831
That bastard is planning to smuggle
You know everything, right?

903
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.877
Of course you know
Assuming that

904
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.256
That bastard took all that money
Can you stowaway?

905
00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:00.258
That huge amount of money?

906
00:46:00.467 --> 00:46:02.385
Don’t keep making question marks.

907
00:46:02.469 --> 00:46:04.637
If you just say it all at once
Where does it last?

908
00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:05.889
So

909
00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:09.893
Are you saying that it has been steadily changed to a ban?

910
00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:11.728
That's a ban

911
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:14.939
Do you know how it is made?

912
00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:16.941
[nervous music]

913
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:33.416
But?

914
00:46:36.169 --> 00:46:37.212
[Knocking sound]

915
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:38.880
[The door clicks open]

916
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:40.840
[Jonghun clears his throat]

917
00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:43.343
(Jonghoon) Ah...

918
00:46:44.928 --> 00:46:46.638
Is Rep. Kim Seong-dae there?

919
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.932
Hey, why are the police...

920
00:46:51.017 --> 00:46:52.018
[Knocking sound]
[The door clicks open]

921
00:46:52.227 --> 00:46:53.895
(Secretary) Senator, the police are here.

922
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:56.189
[nervous music]
[urgent breathing]

923
00:46:57.774 --> 00:46:58.983
(Youngjin) IC, tsk

924
00:46:59.067 --> 00:47:00.151
Did you report it?

925
00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:01.694
What bullshit! Mr.

926
00:47:02.278 --> 00:47:03.696
- (Vocal cords) Hiding over there
- (Youngjin)...

927
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:07.158
(Youngjin) Really, shit, tsk

928
00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:19.462
[Knocking sound]
[The door clicks open]

929
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.704
(Detective Park) What does it say above?

930
00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:54.956
(Dohan) I don’t think it’s a big deal.

931
00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:58.585
One day due to work stress
Wouldn’t it be possible to deviate?

932
00:47:58.793 --> 00:48:01.129
(Detective Park) Deputy Director Kang, until now.
I understand that you have perfect attendance.

933
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.299
But this time it's scary

934
00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:07.093
I'm really scared

935
00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:10.471
I feel like death is just around the corner

936
00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:11.723
(Detective Shin) Shall we trace his movements?

937
00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:13.600
Focusing on places where Deputy Director Kang visited

938
00:48:14.058 --> 00:48:16.436
Before that, the conductor’s cell phone
Let’s start with location tracking.

939
00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:17.812
(Detective Shin) Yes, I understand.

940
00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:21.357
[cell phone vibrating sound]

941
00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:26.154
(Nayeon) Can you promise?

942
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:28.197
What do you mean?

943
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:29.282
(Nayeon) Jeong Jae-hwang

944
00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:33.703
(Nayeon) If I catch Jaehwang oppa
We will conduct a thorough investigation without prejudice.

945
00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:36.164
[nervous music]

946
00:48:50.136 --> 00:48:51.304
[Sound of car door closing]

947
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:53.014
I told you to keep the invoice carefully, right?

948
00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:54.140
yes

949
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:04.359
(Jaehwang Mo) This is it.

950
00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.921
This is a talisman I gave you when I visited you before.

951
00:49:25.004 --> 00:49:28.257
Keep it on your body
I know you are going

952
00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:29.884
Why did you send this...

953
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:32.512
(Nayeon) What’s in the amulet?
Did it have any special meaning?

954
00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:36.432
I guess this guy did something.

955
00:49:38.267 --> 00:49:40.895
From now on, live a good life

956
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:42.897
(Jae-Hwang Mo) It’s like a talisman for prayers.

957
00:49:43.398 --> 00:49:46.818
As if you really wanted to see such a talisman
Sending it back...

958
00:49:59.247 --> 00:50:00.623
You promised earlier, right?

959
00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:04.127
If you catch Jaehwang oppa, there will be no prejudice.
Please investigate.

960
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.546
Because I was a lawyer
There is no such thing as prejudice

961
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.632
(Dohan) So many different perspectives
An event that never existed

962
00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:11.300
I mean, there isn't a single one.

963
00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:16.264
Rather, Jeong Jae-hwang
Why did you send it to that address?

964
00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:19.934
Just because you don't write an address
Delivery would not have been impossible.

965
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.561
(Nayeon) You’ve never sent a package, right?

966
00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:25.857
It could be a fake address

967
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.693
Write something in ‘Sender’
It's accepted.

968
00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:30.361
[cell phone vibrating sound]

969
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.613
[Bluetooth operating sound]
yes

970
00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:35.533
(Detective Shin) Team leader, Deputy Director Kang
I tried tracking the cell phone location.

971
00:50:35.616 --> 00:50:37.827
Because the phone is turned off
I can't figure out my current location.

972
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.413
Instead, the place where the phone was last turned off is
I got it

973
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:41.873
This is Yangje Stream.

974
00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:43.124
(Dohan) Yangje Riverside?

975
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.959
(Detective Shin) Yes, going to Gangwon-do
On Yeongdong Expressway

976
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:46.210
That's right

977
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:48.045
[Call end sound]
(Nayeon) Why, Deputy Director Kang?

978
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:49.464
Why did you go to Gangwon-do?

979
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:51.799
I've been out of contact since yesterday.

980
00:50:52.008 --> 00:50:53.885
[nervous music]

981
00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:56.637
No way...

982
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:10.151
[Birdsong]

983
00:51:58.699 --> 00:51:59.784
[Sound of moon]

984
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:01.619
(Nayeon) If possible, please do not use it.

985
00:52:08.251 --> 00:52:09.293
[Flashlight operation sound]

986
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.864
Have you really lived here?

987
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.167
[Dark sound effect]

988
00:53:06.434 --> 00:53:08.394
