81

Allow me to summarize.

82
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.100
A year ago, except for polar regions and some areas in Russia,

83
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.480
spheres appeared out of nowhere and covered our sky.

84
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.309
Do you remember the day we first saw them?

85
00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.439
The whole world had a meltdown over Earth coming to an end.

86
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.689
This is terrifying.

87
00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.280
We'll all die at this rate!

88
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.819
Rumours flooded our minds,

89
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.410
and roads across the world were a mess.

90
00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.790
We couldn't sit idly by though.

91
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.999
We must launch a pre-emptive attack!

92
00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.619
Attack!

93
00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.590
Hold on a second. Why are they doubling in numbers?

94
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.170
If we keep on attacking them,

95
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.090
they might take up all the space and we'll be doomed by...

96
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.970
I mean, it could lead to a dangerous situation...

97
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.559
which is why the mission was aborted.

98
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.520
While many worried without a plan in motion,

99
00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.350
a new announcement was made.

100
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.020
Detailed X-ray images taken by satellites...

101
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.780
and samples collected by dozens of drones...

102
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.739
were thoroughly analysed,

103
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.449
but there was nothing to indicate...

104
00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.869
that the spheres were a danger to mankind.

105
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.999
So they weren't a risk unless provoked.

106

The world won't end,

107
00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:09.369
so we were to live our lives normally.

108
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.079
Why couldn't they simply put it like that?

109
00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:13.340
The only major change in our lives...

110
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.420
was that we travelled by ship now rather than plane.

111
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.420
Travelling via hot air balloons became a new trend,

112
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.220
but we learned to live with the spheres...

113
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.759
without suffering any specific changes.

114
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.929
But don't you think that the spheres...

115
00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:28.480
look like eyes that are hunting their prey?

116
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.520
They could attack us at any second.

117
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.400
Or maybe thinking that...

118
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.900
is just a side effect of watching all those SF movies.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.319
Does that fact please you?

184
00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:29.689
I'm sorry, sir.

185
00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:32.490
Shouldn't we cover it with a camouflage tent...

186
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.569
Seriously?

187
00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:36.280
Are you going to replace it if it ruins the tent?

188
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.579
No, sir.

189
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.040
Let's just wait for the divisional commander's orders.

190

- Darn it.

192

199
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:06.979
How is everything normal out here?

200
00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:08.069
I'll say that again.

201
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.650
All is not well, right?

202
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.030
- What have we found out?
- Nothing, sir.

203
00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:17.030
- Has it moved?
- No, sir.

204
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.699
We only saw it fall from the sky.

205
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.160
- What are the damages?
- The impact...

206
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:26.209
ruined the bean field that it landed on.

207
00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:28.170
Darn it. Why did it have to fall on the bean field?

208
00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:31.089
So what have you done?

209
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.300
Well, we haven't gotten any protocol to handle such cases like this.

210

You're so frustrating.

211
00:12:38.469 --> 00:12:39.469
Give me that.

212
00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:43.729
Look at this punk.

213
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.939
You handed over your rifle just because I asked?

214

I'm sorry, sir!

215
00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.229
You must be out of your mind. He's poorly trained.

216
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.490
Hey! Move back!

217
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.280
- Move back.
- Get out of there!

218
00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.660
- Clear out!
- Let's go.

219
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.990
I told you to get out of there!

220

- Gosh.

222

223

Move!

You want the protocol? This is the protocol.

225
00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:29.150
- What?
- Nothing is happening.

226

- Nothing is happening.
- What is this?

227
00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:32.189
- Nothing happened.
- Gosh.

228
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:35.689
Look at that. It's awakening my fighting spirit.

229
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:39.280
Hey! Get me the cannon.

230
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280
Hey, bring the cannon.

231
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.740
- Did you ask for the cannon?
- Hey. You punk.

232

- Hey. Lower that.
- Lower that.

233

- Lower it.
- Hey, you jerk.

234
00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.120
- Hurry.
- I'm sorry!

235

236
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.300
Shoot.

238
00:13:56.589 --> 00:13:57.589
Shoot that thing!

239
00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:00.219
Go ahead. Do it now.

240
00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:01.849
- Shoot it now.
- Okay. I'll do it now.

241

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.210
- Gosh.
- By the way,

363
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.210
does your battery run out this fast?

364
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.460
How should I know? I didn't use it a lot, though.

365
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.050
They're here again.

366
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.550
Did you see how I got rid of the dean?

367
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.550
- His wig came off.
- Hey, they might have it.

368
00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:57.139
- Hi.
- Hi.

369
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.220
Why do you always come to our turf?

370
00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:03.059
What are you doing?

371
00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:06.899
Il Ha. You see,

372
00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:09.940
I haven't gotten my nicotine fix. So I'm really sensitive right now.

373
00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:11.359
Stay still.

374
00:21:12.649 --> 00:21:14.819
Bo Ra. I'm the toughest guy in our class.

375
00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:16.740
- Sure. So where is it?
- Hey.

376
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.819
- Come on. Where is it?
- Why are you touching me?

377
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.280
Wait.

378
00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.579
Hold on.

379
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.040
Right. I smoked all of them yesterday.

380
00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:27.750
Come on.

381
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960
Sorry.

382
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.050
Him. Bo Ra.

383
00:21:32.919 --> 00:21:34.629
Hey, don't touch me.

384
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.879
Okay. I'll look for it.

385
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.480
Two cigarettes still remain with me.

386
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.020
I thank you for your generosity.

387
00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:54.440
All right. Thank you.

388
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.950
Come on.

389
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.369
- Jerks.
- Do you want to die?

390
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.290
Gosh. What's taking her so long?

391
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.119
You know that she's slow.

392
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.869
Seriously. The bell is going to ring soon.

393
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.829
Hey, Bo Ra.

394
00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:13.960
Bo Ra. Here's the portable battery.

395
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.010
Hey.

396
00:22:23.139 --> 00:22:24.639
I told you not to call me by my name.

397
00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:26.099
I'm not your friend.

398
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.940
Sorry.

399
00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:32.609
Beat it.

400
00:22:33.399 --> 00:22:35.230
- What?
- Come on.

401
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.069
Ae Seol, you should go.

402
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
Go.

403
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.569
Calm down. You scared her.

404
00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:42.909
- Ae Seol. Bye.
- Ae Seol. Bye.

405
00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:45.869
You guys are so mean.

406
00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:47.290
- Hey, be nice to her.
- What?

407
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.079
Hey.

408
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.960
Let's go inside.

409
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.629
Ma'am.

410
00:22:56.629 --> 00:22:58.720
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.010
Hello.

412
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.629
Go in already.

413
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220
It smells.

414
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.139
- I told you that!
- No!

415
00:23:07.139 --> 00:23:09.020
- You should be in your seats!
- Hurry.

416
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.980
- Come on.
- I'm late.

417
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.440
- Is that good?
- Goodness.

418
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.730
That's your problem.

419
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.730
Stop it!

420
00:23:16.069 --> 00:23:17.899
- Attention.
- Gosh.

421
00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:19.030
- Come on.
- Be quiet!

422
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.450
Attention!

423
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.319
I have a present for you.

424
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.159
The report cards for the mock test from September.

425
00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.669
And there is one more thing.

426
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:34.540
I'll distribute them in the order of your scores.

427
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.000
- What?
- Come on.

428
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.710
- That's not right.
- No!

429
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.879
- You can't do that.
- Ma'am.

430
00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:41.300
- Be quiet!
- I don't want that!

431
00:23:41.589 --> 00:23:43.510
When I call your name, come up here.

432
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.349
Let me begin.

433
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:48.559
First place in our class as well as the entire senior class.

434
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.970
Young Hoon.

435
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.440
Give a round of applause.

436
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.740
Young Soo, second place.

437
00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:05.280
- Young Soo.
- Young Soo.

438
00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:06.740
Yu Jung, third place.

439
00:24:06.819 --> 00:24:08.030
- Class President!
- Nice.

440
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.450
- Young Sin.
- Gosh.

441
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:12.500
- Thank you.
- Yeon Ju.

442
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

443
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.129
- Jang Soo, good job.
- You did so well, Yeon Ju.

444
00:24:16.129 --> 00:24:17.129
- So jealous.
- Na Ra.

445
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:18.540
(Report Card for September Mock Test)

446
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.760
All right. Two students came in last with the same mark.

447
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.300
- Let's not humiliate them!
- Right!

448
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.760
There are only two of you. What's the point?

449
00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:27.349
Il Ha. Hee Rak. Come on up.

450
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.470
- A round of applause, everyone!
- They came in last.

451
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.980
Gosh. Unbelievable.

452
00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:35.309
Seriously.

453
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.690
Thank you.

454
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.190
Thank you.

455
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:41.899
Let's study harder next time.

456
00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:43.609
- Okay.
- Okay.

457
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.490
Hey, you two!

458
00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:59.000
Can every single teacher please come...

459
00:24:59.169 --> 00:25:01.169
to the teachers' office immediately?

460
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.839
I will repeat.

461
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.760
Can every single teacher please come...

462
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.639
- to the teachers' office?
- That's all.

463
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.389
Prepare for class.

464
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.020
Hand in your phones!

465
00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:15.690
- Okay.
- Oh, darn it.

466
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.690
Hand in your phones!

467
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.359
- Hand in your phones.
- Do as you're told.

468
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.359
Come on.

469
00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:26.950
- Give me a few minutes.
- No.

470
00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:33.790
Hey. Better luck next time.

471
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.500
- Kimchi.
- What?

472
00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:37.210
See what's going on.

473
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:38.790
In the teachers' office?

474
00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:41.960
Me?

475
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.210
Excuse me.

476
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.129
Go, now.

477
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.720
Okay. I'll go.

478
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.059
Why? Do you have a hunch?

479
00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.230
I have this real bad feeling.

480
00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.809
I don't like it.

481
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:11.700
What?

482
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.790
This is too sudden.

483
00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:16.450
And the seniors...

484
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.790
Ms. Park.

485
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.919
My goodness. Ms. Park.

486
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.250
Let's go back upstairs.

487
00:26:25.879 --> 00:26:27.010
Chi Yeol.

488
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.970
It doesn't work.

489
00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:36.270
It looks like...

490
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.349
Hey. Wait, isn't it time for class?

491
00:26:39.559 --> 00:26:40.980
What a loser.

492
00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:47.690
Guys.

493
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.369
- The rolling admission's cancelled.
- What?

494
00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:57.369
- What...
- What do you mean?

495
00:26:57.369 --> 00:26:58.579
Is something wrong?

496
00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:00.000
- What?
- Why cancel that?

497
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.290
- That's weird.
- Ms. Park. Are you serious?

498
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.500
What's the matter?

499
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.750
Are you sure?

500
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.800
Does that go for all high schools?

501
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.220
What happens to people who applied?

502
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.639
Wait a minute.

503
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.720
This is nonsense.

504
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.349
Yes, we scored.

505
00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:23.940
No, cancelling rolling admissions isn't enough.

506
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:25.690
Don't we need the CSAT to be cancelled?

507
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.230
That's what we want.

508
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.319
Will you hear me out?

509
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.859
Only the rolling admissions got cancelled.

510
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.990
The CSAT will happen as scheduled.

511
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.490
The CSAT's on?

512
00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.909
And...

513
00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:55.970
I'll explain slowly if you all concentrate.

514
00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:00.059
The Minister of National Defence will release...

515
00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:02.849
a statement regarding the Student Reserve Forces.

516
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.149
We'll head over to a reporter who's on site.

517
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.690
Oh Eun Ji will report.

518
00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:11.780
I'm outside the briefing room at the Ministry of National Defence.

519
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.530
An emergency announcement will soon be made.

520
00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:18.990
Minister Park Sang Man just stepped onto the podium.

521
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.950
Let's hear what he has to say.

522
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.460
(Ministry of National Defence)

523
00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:28.750
I'm Minister Park Sang Man.

524
00:28:29.629 --> 00:28:33.339
It has been a year since the unidentified spheres...

525
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.050
appeared in our skies.

526
00:28:35.639 --> 00:28:38.510
As of now, we cannot determine the level of threat,

527
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.139
- but at any moment...
- Isn't a minister high up?

528
00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:43.349
- Super high up.
- To be prepared,

529
00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:48.559
please understand we must issue a nationwide mobilization order.

530
00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.730
- A what?
- A nationwide...

531
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.490
Other than military personnel who are currently serving,

532
00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:54.399
those who will soon be drafted,

533
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.409
military reservists,

534
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.619
male and female adults up to the age of 24,

535
00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:01.740
and...

536
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.619
those who are currently high-school seniors...

537
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.540
will all be mobilized.

538
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.750
High-school seniors?

539
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.000
- Us?
- Us?

540
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.460
- Why us?
- What about the CSAT?

541
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.970
- Why us?
- What does that mean?

542
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.260
What happens to us seniors?

543
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.589
Be quiet so I can listen.

544
00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:20.260
Students will be contacted through their schools.

545
00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:22.770
We have no choice...

546
00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:25.730
but to cancel the rolling admissions...

547
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.730
to all universities and colleges...

548
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.480
for the year 2023.

549
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.649
They're cancelled?

550
00:29:31.649 --> 00:29:34.190
It must be for real. It's all over the internet.

551
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.899
We hope to keep regular admissions open as scheduled.

552
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.200
High-school seniors will receive military training...

553
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.409
besides their regular classes.

554
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:46.369
The government has decided to grant extra points...

555
00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:50.750
to students who agree to receive military training.

556
00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:53.089
- What does that mean?
- We'll discuss the extra points...

557
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.629
with the Ministry of Education...

558
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.680
We have classes and military training?

559
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.839
What's this about military training and extra points?

560
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.889
- We still have to take the CSAT?
- What a stupid question.

561
00:30:04.139 --> 00:30:05.309
It doesn't make sense.

562
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.149
Silence!

563
00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:10.480
Silence.

564
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.690
As you just heard, there will be military training...

565
00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:16.280
apart from your regular classes.

566
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.700
The government says you're categorized as reservists.

567
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.619
You're reserve forces,

568
00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:26.450
so don't worry too much.

569

(Performance assessment, 12th Grade, Sungjin High School)

570
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.419
Yu Jung, hand these out.

571
00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:35.500
Okay.

572
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:38.510
What's that?

573
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.550
- It must be for real.
- What about the CSAT?

574
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.849
- Hey, move it!
- Move faster.

575
00:30:46.849 --> 00:30:47.849
(Military Training Consent Form)

576
00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.020
What the heck?

577
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.399
- Be quick.
- Sorry.

578
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:55.109
That's a military training consent form.

579
00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:57.149
Show it to your parents.

580
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:58.690
- For real?
- No way.

581
00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:01.450
Ms. Park. We must camp together?

582
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.619
What happens to people who don't sign this?

583
00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:06.159
I'm not sure,

584
00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:08.329
but it'll be replaced with a remote learning class.

585
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.669
How many extra points do we get?

586
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.960
Is there a differential system?

587
00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:16.960
The details will come out later.

588
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.720
I'll share as soon as I hear from the Ministry of Education.

589
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.050
What I am sure about is that only those...

590
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.680
who apply for military training get extra points.

591
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.430
Get the form signed if you want them.

592
00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.980
Ms. Park. What about people who'll major in performing arts?

593
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.399
Are we going to war?

594
00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.069
What if we're skipping college?

595
00:31:36.069 --> 00:31:37.399
How long will the training last?

596
00:31:37.399 --> 00:31:38.569
What if we quit halfway through?

597
00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:40.899
Where will the training take place?

598
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.490
I know you're flustered and in shock.

599
00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:49.450
I am too.

600
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.619
But...

601
00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:55.129
let's not worry.

602
00:31:55.879 --> 00:31:59.260
Keep studying hard and stick with the military training too.

603
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.339
Just keep doing what you always did.

604
00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.720
Don't forget the years of work...

605
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.349
you put in to go to a good university.

606
00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:10.470
Okay?

607
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.980
What the heck...

608
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.399
- Study hard!
- What?

609
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:24.240
- Ms. Park, we're not...
- Ms. Park!

610
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.159
- Ms. Park.
- Explain what's going on!

611
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.829
- What's happening?
- Ms. Park!

612
00:32:51.349 --> 00:32:52.680
Hey, look at this.

613
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.889
"Worst national defence crisis since the constitution."

614
00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:57.649
- This means there will be war.
- No way.

615
00:32:57.649 --> 00:33:00.270
Why does it have to be high-school seniors?

616
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.399
What about the others?

617
00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:04.069
I know. Shouldn't we be exempt so we can study?

618
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:05.530
That's more fair.

619
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.069
To us, college is everything.

620
00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:10.990
How hard would we train if they offered up extra points?

621
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.869
That's why it's us.

622
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.790
For the first time in your life, you sounded convincing.

623
00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.290
They won't suddenly start a war, will they?

624
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.419
- Against what?
- Them.

625
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.089
- Against them?
- Yes.

626
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.089
It would look pathetic to go to war...

627
00:33:26.089 --> 00:33:28.260
- against balloons.
- Would it?

628
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.680
It's true!

629
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.720
What? You got it too?

630
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680
For real?

631
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.190
I don't know. Maybe we'll fight the balloons.

632
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.649
Bye.

633
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.190
Shut your mouth. Bye.

634
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.990
Take care. See you.

635
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.619
It must be for real.

636
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.290
Hey. If you're done, skip off to your own seat.

637
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.829
I don't want to.

638
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.250
There's a penalty for not handing in your phone.

639
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.720
If I beat you to a pulp,

640
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.849
how many penalty points do I get?

641
00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:18.850
What? Are you scared?

642
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.649
- Darn you.
- Oh, no!

643
00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:36.330
You scumbag.

644
00:34:37.499 --> 00:34:39.999
- Stop them.
- You stop them!

645
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:48.470
Darn you.

646
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:50.430
- You scumbag.
- You scumbag.

647
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.589
What?

648
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.260
Stop them! Do something!

649
00:35:04.649 --> 00:35:06.149
You're all so annoying!

650
00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:07.990
- Come at me!
- Darn you.

651
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:09.399
Screw you.

652
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:11.490
- Stop it!
- Let go!

653
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.830
What, dirtbag? What?

654
00:35:21.459 --> 00:35:22.580
My gosh...

655
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:34.350
Hey. Soldiers.

656
00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:39.100
Guys.

657
00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:43.810
What?

658
00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:52.859
What are they doing here?

659
00:35:53.859 --> 00:35:55.450
- I don't know.
- It must be that.

660
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.550
All personnel and firearms accounted for.

661
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:15.970
Unpack the firearms first.

662
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.850
The rest, head indoors.

663
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.560
We're screwed.

664
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.939
I should call Mom.

665
00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:33.359
It looks serious.

666
00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:34.359
What's going on?

667
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.240
- Unbelievable.
- We just found out about it.

668
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.700
They can't be here for us.

669
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.300
(Band-aids)

670
00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.229
(Band-aids)

671
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:10.019
Are you all right?

672
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.780
About what?

673
00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:16.740
You fought earlier.

674
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.530
So,

675
00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:24.580
the kids in our class are nice if you get to know them.

676
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.499
You could become friends or...

677
00:37:26.499 --> 00:37:27.789
I don't want to make friends.

678
00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.669
We're just passing acquaintances.

679
00:37:31.879 --> 00:37:34.470
You meet and befriend people like you after school.

680
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.470
That's easier.

681
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.140
You don't have to be so considerate or cautious.

682
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.720
People who will benefit me.

683
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760
Those are my friends.

684
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.229
Oh, I see.

685
00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:50.479
Is that it?

686
00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:57.200
Will you sign the military training consent form?

687
00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.740
I can't sign it.

688
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.620
My parents have to.

689
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:13.589
See you.

690
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.470
Mom.

691
00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:21.600
Who will care for your siblings if you go to training camp?

692
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600
Mom and Dad leave for work at dawn.

693
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.600
Can't you just study at home?

694
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.019
The other kids will get extra points.

695
00:38:30.439 --> 00:38:32.689
One point could mean an Ivy League school.

696
00:38:33.149 --> 00:38:35.939
No rolling admissions means I have a much better chance.

697
00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:38.649
I'm worried about the younger kids.

698
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:41.160
Why should I always sacrifice for them?

699
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.330
Sign it.

700
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.700
Okay, fine.

701
00:38:53.459 --> 00:38:54.589
You said you'd be late.

702
00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:56.879
Yes, but I left early.

703
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:00.589
You said...

704
00:39:01.129 --> 00:39:02.589
you'd draw cartoons or something.

705
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.640
You don't need a college degree.

706
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.680
Staying alone at home will be so boring.

707
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.850
I'd rather be with the others.

708
00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:10.600
Okay, then.

709
00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:16.729
Don't sleep out because I'm not home.

710
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:17.899
And don't go clubbing as much.

711
00:39:17.899 --> 00:39:22.109
My gosh. Listen, I'm your mom and it's my life to live.

712
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:25.370
Cheers.

(Military Training Consent Form)

714
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.660
I don't want to go.

715
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.580
Why bother when I can't go to college anyway?

716
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.289
Whether you go to college or not,

717
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:37.709
I can't stand the sight of you doing nothing at home.

718
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.459
Can we have another soju?

719
00:39:39.839 --> 00:39:41.260
Yes, of course.

720
00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:43.720
There will be this online class.

721
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.430
You don't even study at school.

722
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.100
I'll be darned if I believe you'd study at home.

723
00:39:50.729 --> 00:39:51.729
Go to training.

724
00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:58.030
But I don't want to.

725
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.410
Do your best.

726
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.660
Do all you can to get extra points.

727
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.209
Raise your hand and volunteer for training, okay?

728
00:40:16.379 --> 00:40:18.089
Now you must compete with...

729
00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:20.260
all the gifted kids from the special high schools.

730
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.470
Don't you fail to get into Seoul National University...

731
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.800
over a few points.

732
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.600
Okay, so stop it.

733
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.479
This is such an important time...

734
00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:34.979
and you got into a fight?

735
00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:39.939
I said I fell.

736
00:40:41.819 --> 00:40:43.109
- I'll take it.
- But...

737
00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:45.450
Okay, good.

738
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.580
Don't take too long a break, okay?

739
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.910
Okay, Private Ryan.

740
00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:01.379
He's packing excitedly, of course.

741
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:02.709
Here.

742
00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:05.720
Why are you taking this?

743
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.100
Mom, this is the most precious one.

744
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.600
You fool.

745
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.180
You're my son, but you're such an embarrassment.

746
00:41:14.689 --> 00:41:16.479
Oh. No, not at all.

747
00:41:16.729 --> 00:41:18.149
I'm worried, of course.

748
00:41:18.649 --> 00:41:19.769
But what can I do?

749
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.689
They have to do it.

750
00:41:21.689 --> 00:41:22.819
- Yes.
- Okay.

751
00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.189
Yes.

752
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.450
We must trust them when they say school's safer.

753
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.660
Okay, bye.

754
00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:35.080
You need things like this when you train.

755
00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.620
The more, the better.

756
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.419
It's just four weeks. I'll never use all this up.

757
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.550
Dad.

758
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760
What will we do?

759
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:47.089
You'll do things like run,

760
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.510
learn how to pack your bags, and shoot.

761
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.640
Don't you worry.

762
00:41:55.229 --> 00:41:56.640
You're like me, so you'll do fine.

763
00:41:57.689 --> 00:41:59.149
When I was in the army,

764
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.069
I was a top marksman and model squad leader.

765
00:42:03.399 --> 00:42:05.939
Mom said you didn't go to the actual army.

766
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.870
Go on, help him pack.

767
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.539
You'll be with your friends,

768
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.749
so do as the soldiers say,

769
00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:22.419
and eat well.

770
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:25.169
Don't get hurt.

771
00:42:26.629 --> 00:42:29.470
Are you crying? Why would you cry?

772
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.430
Chi Yeol, look after yourself.

773
00:42:37.729 --> 00:42:40.350
Just come back healthy and safely, okay?

774
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.899
Don't worry.

775
00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:47.689
Will you just sign this for me?

776
00:42:48.569 --> 00:42:49.569
Darn it.

777
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.120
Why are you crying when he's not going off to his death?

778
00:43:01.249 --> 00:43:02.999
What if he does?

779
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:08.220
Whatever.

780
00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.640
I'm not going off to die.

781
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.220
Why make a fuss?

782
00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:27.939
(Let's go to university!)

783
00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.209
Move it.

784
00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:46.749
Hey.

785
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:47.919
Hello.

786
00:43:47.919 --> 00:43:49.839
- Just a quick photo.
- Leave it.

787
00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:50.839
Salute!

788
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720
(Sungjin High School)

789
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.760
Hello, there.

790
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.720
- You filled it in?
- Yes.

791
00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720
Awesome.

792
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.560
Do Yoon, did you fill it in?

793
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.310
That's insane.

794
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.569
I'll come for kimchi stew afterwards.

795
00:44:06.569 --> 00:44:07.569
Hey.

796
00:44:07.569 --> 00:44:08.819
Good morning!

797
00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:12.399
Go away, will you?

798
00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:14.200
- One, two, three.
- One...

799
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.620
Gosh, you brought a lot of stuff.

800
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.740
Most of them filled in the form.

801
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.209
My mom hates the idea of me...

802
00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:26.209
not going to college more than going to training.

803
00:44:26.209 --> 00:44:29.300
Mine too. I was so shocked.

804
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.669
Ha Na, are you emigrating? Why did you bring two suitcases?

805
00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:34.970
I had a hard time cutting them down to two.

806
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.760
I only brought half my makeup.

807
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.180
Did you set up a chewing gum store?

808
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600
Yes.

809
00:44:41.769 --> 00:44:42.979
My post-meal dessert.

810
00:44:43.689 --> 00:44:44.899
To freshen my palate.

811
00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:49.439
Do you want one?

812
00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:52.399
- Hey! Just brush your teeth!
- Hey! Just brush your teeth!

813
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.069
You're disgusting.

814
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.280
- Go away.
- How gross.

815
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.910
Why are you acting like you need to pee?

816
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.539
It's nothing.

817
00:45:10.129 --> 00:45:11.129
Hi, Na Ra.

818
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:21.930
You!

819
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:23.979
You...

820
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.939
- What about me?
- Your face turned red.

821
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.810
What?

822
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:31.479
- Na Ra!
- Don't.

823
00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:32.859
Don't you dare.

824
00:45:34.689 --> 00:45:36.030
Go to your seats.

825
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160
Kwon Il Ha.

826
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.450
Did you sleep well?

827
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:48.830
Listen up.

828
00:45:48.959 --> 00:45:51.339
There's someone you need to meet.

829
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.550
Salute.

830
00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.680
Nice to meet you.

831
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.720
I'm Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho, your platoon commander,

832
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220
in charge of Class 3-2.

833
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.430
Lieutenant Lee...

834
00:46:06.519 --> 00:46:08.729
will explain your training regime.

835
00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:11.269
There's a diamond on his forehead.

836
00:46:15.399 --> 00:46:18.609
You are Sungjin High Battalion Combat Platoon Two.

837
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.870
I'm your commander.

838
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.370
Most of the training will happen...

839
00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.039
in the evening, after your regular classes.

840
00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:29.289
- What? After school?
- No way.

841
00:46:29.289 --> 00:46:30.879
- After school?
- I need to play games.

842
00:46:31.129 --> 00:46:32.919
If there's a special agenda,

843
00:46:33.209 --> 00:46:35.089
training will take priority.

844
00:46:35.629 --> 00:46:37.169
Keep that in mind.

845
00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760
Class president.

846
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.510
Yes?

847
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.640
You're the Senior Private.

848
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.060
- What?
- What does that mean?

849
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:47.850
I don't know.

850
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.060
- Do you know?
- What's a Senior Private?

851
00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:53.729
Next, I'll select a clerk who'll record your training...

852
00:46:54.149 --> 00:46:57.530
as well as your videos to send home.

853
00:46:58.819 --> 00:46:59.819
Any volunteers?

854
00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:01.780
Hey, look away. Don't look at him.

855
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.910
- You do it.
- Are you crazy? Why me?

856
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200
Don't volunteer.

857
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200
No one?

858
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.580
Broadcasting Club, anyone?

859
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.839
Then I'll randomly select...

860
00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:15.459
Mr. Commander?

861
00:47:16.499 --> 00:47:18.129
Can I recommend someone?

862
00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:21.629
Young Hoon.

863
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.339
Will you have a go?

864
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.140
Me?

865
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.060
Yes. I think you'd learn a lot...

866
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.019
from the experience.

867
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.019
What should I learn?

868
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:38.399
Jang Young Hoon. Just do it. It's not a big deal.

869
00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:41.319
Then you do it.

870
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.450
Give it a go and if you don't like it,

871
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.370
I'll let you swap.

872
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.620
I have to study.

873
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.459
I don't want to waste my time.

874
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.669
Gosh, what a punk.

875
00:47:53.419 --> 00:47:54.539
That's fine.

876
00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:58.169
I told you he's weird.

877
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:59.550
What a piece of work.

878
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.800
You there, Private.

879
00:48:14.399 --> 00:48:15.899
He means you, idiot.

880
00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:20.490
Who... Me?

881
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:21.859
You're the clerk.

882
00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:23.399
Any objections?

883
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.030
Well...

884
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:27.580
No.

885
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.660
You get three bonus points.

886
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.620
- What?
- What?

887
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.459
So does the Senior Private.

888
00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:34.669
What?

889
00:48:34.669 --> 00:48:36.879
- Just like that?
- So many points?

890
00:48:37.339 --> 00:48:39.839
There's a bonus point system separate to the extra CSAT points.

891
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:42.760
You'll be scored for your attitude and aptitude,

892
00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:46.680
and ten bonus points equals one extra CSAT point.

893
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.180
Accumulate 30 penalty points and you'll be discharged.

894
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.100
All the extra CSAT points you earned will be scrubbed.

895
00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.479
- What?
- What the heck?

896
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:59.569
- Darn it.
- Then...

897
00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:01.319
we'll head to the dormitory.

898
00:49:01.399 --> 00:49:02.399
The dormitory?

899
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.069
- Where's that?
- What?

900
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:05.359
A dormitory?

901
00:49:05.819 --> 00:49:06.819
We have one?

902
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.789
Go away!

903
00:49:15.669 --> 00:49:17.669
- I told you.
- Get moving, you jerk.

904
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:19.589
- Hey!
- Ouch. Get lost.

905
00:49:19.669 --> 00:49:21.709
- Darn you.
- Go!

906
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.379
Hurry up, will you?

907
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.970
Each locker has a name on it. Find your name.

908
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.510
That's your spot.

909
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.720
Get moving quickly.

910
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.930
- Hello.
- Hey. He said "quickly."

911
00:49:34.519 --> 00:49:36.060
- Look at my bowl.
- Here's mine.

912
00:49:36.479 --> 00:49:38.729
- Hey!
- Look, that's us!

913
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:40.899
- Hey!
- Nice!

914
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:46.200
Darn it. I can't sleep on a bad mattress.

915
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.120
As if. You always sleep at your desk and drool all over it.

916
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.120
Hey, don't you feel like we're here to shoot "Real Men?"

917
00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:56.080
Oh, you're right.

918
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.870
Private Woo Hee Rak!

919
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.249
- Private First Class Wang Tae Man!
- Kim Duk Joong!

920
00:50:00.249 --> 00:50:01.339
Let's go!

921
00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:05.169
Attention.

922
00:50:07.339 --> 00:50:09.470
Oh, no!

923
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.600
Unpack and get settled in quickly.

924
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.109
We will distribute firearms in the field.

925
00:50:22.899 --> 00:50:25.530
Assemble in the field in exactly 30 minutes from now.

926
00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.240
Do you understand?

927
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.870
Yes. We got it, sir!

928
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.080
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

929
00:50:39.709 --> 00:50:40.709
That's all for now.

930
00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:47.510
You little...

931
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.720
Bye.

932
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:51.640
"Assemble in exactly 30 minutes from now. Go!"

933
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:52.890
Yes!

934
00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.720
- Hey, did you see that jerk's name?
- What is it?

935
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.220
- His name is Won Bin!
- Won Bin?

936
00:50:57.229 --> 00:50:58.769
Why is he so tanned?

937
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.649
Was it always this big?

938
00:51:00.729 --> 00:51:02.439
Hey, I brought this.

939
00:51:02.439 --> 00:51:03.649
I brought this too.

940
00:51:03.649 --> 00:51:06.189
- Great minds think alike!
- Yes!

941
00:51:06.189 --> 00:51:07.899
- How many did you bring?
- I brought tons.

942
00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:09.780
Me too. We should eat it while we're here.

943
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.200
- Totally.
- My mom won't let me eat it.

944
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:12.740
Girls, what did you bring?

945
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.160
I brought my perfume.

946
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.539
- Oh! Can I smell it?
- It smells really good.

947
00:51:16.539 --> 00:51:17.700
- I want to smell it too.
- What do you think?

948
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.709
- Hey, it smells so good!
- It smells really good.

949
00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:20.789
- Hey.
- I want some too.

950
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:23.580
- Can I have some too?
- Girls, I brought my camera.

951
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.169
- Nice!
- Let's take pictures.

952
00:51:26.169 --> 00:51:27.379
Gather around.

953
00:51:27.379 --> 00:51:30.430
All right, 1, 2, 3. Make a V!

954
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.930
- No!
- Don't let anyone see them.

955
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.560
- Don't reveal your cards.
- Only you can see them.

956
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.060
But what is this?

957
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.189
It's the November card. Double Junks.

958
00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:43.979
It's my grandma's favourite card.

959
00:51:44.189 --> 00:51:46.359
Put it here. It's the same month.

960
00:51:59.289 --> 00:52:00.370
You're a liar.

961
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.959
You've done this before.

962
00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:04.830
Go on and play.

963
00:52:07.129 --> 00:52:10.089
Hey, girls. What does "personal firearms" mean?

964
00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:12.800
- I don't know.
- No idea.

965
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.680
Personal guns, you idiot.

966
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.600
- I see. They're guns.
- Oh, look!

967
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.269
- Oh, my.
- That looks awesome.

968
00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:20.350
Hey, let's take lots of pictures.

969
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:22.019
- Attention.
- Hey, of course!

970
00:52:22.189 --> 00:52:24.269
- I told you.
- I told you too.

971
00:52:24.269 --> 00:52:26.229
- Attention!
- Goodness.

972
00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:28.399
Do you think this is a camping trip?

973
00:52:30.569 --> 00:52:32.450
Listen carefully.

974
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.990
Any items that you won't need here...

975
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:38.530
must be submitted at once.

976
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:39.910
- What is this?
- No!

977
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.539
- Curling irons, toys, lipsticks!
- Oh, no.

978
00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:48.169
Foundation, perfume... What? A scented candle?

979
00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.959
Your foundation, lipstick...

980
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:52.970
You little...

981
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.180
Hey, quick.

982
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.339
- Don't move.
- Hide this, quick!

983
00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.550
What? Cigarettes?

984
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.930
Girls, get moving at once!

985
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:04.479
Go!

986
00:53:04.479 --> 00:53:05.479
Hey, hurry!

987
00:53:05.479 --> 00:53:08.189
Submit them all. Why you little...

988
00:53:08.899 --> 00:53:10.479
That moment, I just knew.

989
00:53:10.479 --> 00:53:12.819
(Hong Jun Hee, Park So Yoon)

990
00:53:12.819 --> 00:53:15.740
This is so wrong.

991
00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:19.740
Hey, can we take back our agreement?

992
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.499
What? No one's doing that?

993
00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:25.289
Gosh.

994
00:53:26.539 --> 00:53:28.169
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

995
00:53:30.289 --> 00:53:31.879
The seniors in the classrooms...

996
00:53:31.879 --> 00:53:34.010
Make sure you check the number of students.

997
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.300
- Assemble at once.
- Yes, sir.

998
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.680
- Once you check in...
- Move it!

999
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.850
- Hurry!
- Class Two!

1000
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.769
- Fall into one line.
- Form a line.

1001
00:53:43.769 --> 00:53:45.229
Fall into one line.

1002
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.689
Hurry up!

1003
00:53:46.689 --> 00:53:48.810
- Go, quick. This way.
- Class Two!

1004
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:51.229
- Hurry up.
- Fall into one line.

1005
00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:53.689
- Which class?
- Class Two!

1006
00:53:53.689 --> 00:53:55.399
- Hurry!
- Stand over here.

1007
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.160
Attention.

1008
00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.990
We'll distribute firearms now, so focus!

1009
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.370
Stay still, will you?

1010
00:54:04.039 --> 00:54:07.289
Hey, Young Hoon. Do you want to be a clerk?

1011
00:54:09.039 --> 00:54:12.499
Well, I don't really need the bonus points.

1012
00:54:13.419 --> 00:54:15.669
But you could really use some extra points.

1013
00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:18.430
My gosh.

1014
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.350
- But...
- Hey, Kimchi.

1015
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.140
The platoon leader told you to do it.

1016
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.100
Stop bugging him. You should just do it.

1017
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.189
Oh, okay.

1018
00:54:33.569 --> 00:54:36.359
When you receive your firearm, shout the serial number.

1019
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.530
Do you understand?

1020
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.530
I can barely hear you. Do you understand?

1021
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.819
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1022
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:50.879
Private Kim Yu Jung.

1023
00:54:51.249 --> 00:54:54.209
It's 701404.

1024
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:55.629
Thank you.

1025
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.720
Private Kim Duk Joong. Serial number 701403!

1026
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.720
Next.

1027
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.260
- Next.
- Next.

1028
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.720
The weight's not bad.

1029
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:10.560
Who said you could goof around with a firearm in your hand?

1030
00:55:11.229 --> 00:55:12.399
Oh, I'm sorry.

1031
00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:20.240
What makes them think they could give us guns?

1032
00:55:20.609 --> 00:55:21.740
- I wonder too.
- Next.

1033
00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:25.410
Private Kim Chi Yeol.

1034
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:28.700
Serial number 701406. That's it.

1035
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:29.959
Next.

1036
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:44.720
- Look at this.
- My gosh.

1037
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.519
Gosh, it's so heavy. We have to carry it around all the time?

1038
00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:49.979
Right? It's nuts.

1039
00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:52.310
If we lose it, we get kicked out. We'll have to pay a fine too.

1040
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:55.019
Hey, doesn't it look just like the ones you see in the game?

1041
00:55:55.479 --> 00:55:57.609
But they don't use the M16 rifle in the game.

1042
00:55:57.819 --> 00:56:00.359
There's too much rebound, and it's too loud.

1043
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.160
Where does the M16 appear? 5 or 7?

1044
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.330
Are you that dumb? You've played the game thousands of times.

1045
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.910
It was Five.

1046
00:56:09.039 --> 00:56:10.580
Of course, you know everything about the game.

1047
00:56:10.749 --> 00:56:13.789
Darn, I wish I got the Kar98k. That's my specialty.

1048
00:56:13.919 --> 00:56:14.999
Hey.

1049
00:56:16.919 --> 00:56:17.959
Shut it and run.

1050
00:56:18.499 --> 00:56:19.510
No.

1051
00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:21.919
- Run.
- Go!

1052
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:23.430
Hold on, guys. Give me just two seconds.

1053
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:24.510
- Two seconds?
- Go!

1054
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:27.010
- Go. Run!
- Just two seconds.

1055
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.760
Go. Get him!

1056
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.269
- What are you doing?
- Help me.

1057
00:56:30.269 --> 00:56:32.979
Hey, guys. Goodness. What are you doing?

1058
00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:34.689
- Oh, my.
- You little brats.

1059
00:56:34.689 --> 00:56:35.859
Hey, wait. Hey!

1060
00:56:36.149 --> 00:56:38.019
Hey, get back here. Goodness.

1061
00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:39.319
Sit back down!

1062
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.819
- Move over.
- Hey!

1063
00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:43.030
Your break is over. Assemble.

1064
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.780
You guys too. Assemble!

1065
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.580
Come on down!

1066
00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.700
You guys, stop that and assemble!

1067
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.959
Hey, old man!

1068
00:56:55.629 --> 00:56:56.709
"Old man?"

1069
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:57.879
I'm not old!

1070
00:57:02.129 --> 00:57:04.839
I'm 21.

1071
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.050
I'm only two years older than you guys.

1072
00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:13.519
I see. He's 21.

1073
00:57:14.479 --> 00:57:17.359
What's his deal? Anyone can tell he's 21.

1074
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:20.569
- Hey, old man.
- Yes?

1075
00:57:22.399 --> 00:57:24.780
Can I get a clean one?

1076
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:26.450
This one looks used.

1077
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.160
They're all used.

1078
00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.200
Come on down at once!

1079
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.330
You guys, stop fooling around and assemble!

1080
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120
Come down at once.

1081
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.539
- Gosh, that scared me.
- Assemble!

1082
00:57:36.919 --> 00:57:39.289
Assemble, everyone! Did you not hear me?

1083
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:42.760
Assemble!

1084
00:57:42.919 --> 00:57:44.339
- Quick.
- Can you not hear me?

1085
00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:45.589
What are you all doing?

1086
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.180
Assemble!

1087
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:51.890
Did you not hear that? Assemble!

1088
00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.769
- Hurry up and come down.
- Hurry.

1089
00:58:06.359 --> 00:58:08.490
The firearms that you just received...

1090
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.950
could save...

1091
00:58:15.749 --> 00:58:16.870
or kill you.

1092
00:58:23.419 --> 00:58:25.339
In times of emergency, the only thing you can trust...

1093
00:58:25.339 --> 00:58:27.629
isn't your friend or colleague next to you,

1094
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.970
but your firearm in your hand.

1095
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:35.519
So is it okay for you...

1096
00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.189
to handle it carelessly?

1097
00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:47.609
I am asking you guys.

1098
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.660
- No, it's not okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1099
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.660
See that goalpost over there?

1100
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:58.959
The first three people.

1101
00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.709
- What?
- What's he talking about?

1102
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080
Hey.

1103
00:59:04.249 --> 00:59:05.339
Go.

1104
00:59:06.459 --> 00:59:08.970
- Don't. You'd better not run.
- No.

1105
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.089
- Hey.
- Don't do it. Don't run.

1106
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.140
- Hey.
- Hey, what's he doing?

1107
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.970
- Gosh.
- Hey!

1108
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.269
Go!

1109
00:59:17.269 --> 00:59:18.560
- Hey!
- Don't run!

1110
00:59:19.439 --> 00:59:20.479
Run!

1111
00:59:21.649 --> 00:59:23.149
- Hey!
- Gosh.

1112
00:59:23.269 --> 00:59:24.439
Go faster!

1113
00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:27.780
Hey, wait up!

1114
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:29.950
- Wait, hold on.
- Hey!

1115
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:31.359
Come this way!

1116
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.530
This way! Move it! Faster!

1117
00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.039
Now, the first five. Go!

1118
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.120
Go, run! Only the first five!

1119
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.120
Hey! Go faster.

1120
00:59:42.169 --> 00:59:44.249
- Hey! Wait up!
- Move it.

1121
00:59:46.169 --> 00:59:47.629
I'm so exhausted.

1122
00:59:48.129 --> 00:59:50.129
I feel like throwing up.

1123
00:59:50.129 --> 00:59:51.260
I feel like I'm dying right now.

1124
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.839
- Hey.
- I'm dying.

1125
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.600
Me too.

1126
00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.060
- Gosh.
- I can't believe this.

1127
00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.060
- Hey, I'm dying.
- Me too.

1128
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.609
I'm dying because I'm so smitten by the platoon leader.

1129
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:06.019
He's totally my type!

1130
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:09.899
Hey, what about that handsome guy on social media?

1131
01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:13.240
Oh, him. How should I put this? He's not mature enough.

1132
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.160
Girls, look. Look at my rash!

1133
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.620
This is what happens when I'm in the sun even for a short moment.

1134
01:00:19.039 --> 01:00:20.539
- What about me?
- What about me?

1135
01:00:20.539 --> 01:00:22.580
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. I told you. Look at this!

1136
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.959
Gosh, you're so loud.

1137
01:00:23.959 --> 01:00:25.959
I'm about to throw up, so be quiet.

1138
01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:27.499
What about me?

1139
01:00:28.169 --> 01:00:29.339
Your face is red.

1140
01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:31.010
- Why? Is it red?
- Yes.

1141
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.089
- Look at this!
- It hurts.

1142
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.430
Why do I have to do this?

1143
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:40.269
Darn it! Now that I think about it, those jerks make me so angry!

1144
01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.850
That jerk is crazy.

1145
01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.640
Darn it. I'm fuming mad.

1146
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.939
This is nuts.

1147
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:49.359
Gosh, she's at it again.

1148
01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:51.939
Lee Soon Yi is crying again!

1149
01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:54.200
Hey, please!

1150
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.740
Girls, hand over your rifles. Don't leave them everywhere.

1151
01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.490
Look at my sun rash. What about my face?

1152
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.330
Gosh, seriously!

1153
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.160
- Look, my arm...
- Gosh.

1154
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.709
Hey!

1155
01:01:05.669 --> 01:01:07.249
Do you want to do that race again?

1156
01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.379
Bring your rifles over here and organize them. Now.

1157
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.180
- Gosh.
- Ouch...

1158
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:20.680
Mom.

1159
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.939
(Lee Soon Yi, Class 2)

1160
01:01:24.939 --> 01:01:26.019
Mom...

1161
01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:27.519
They tricked us.

1162
01:01:27.519 --> 01:01:29.439
(Hong Jun Hee, Class 2)

1163
01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:31.399
They said it'd be like a camping trip.

1164
01:01:31.899 --> 01:01:33.990
But it's like being in the real army!

1165
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.910
Mom, Dad. Don't worry about me.

1166
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:38.910
The platoon leader is very handsome and charismatic.

1167
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.289
I'll listen to him and follow him around.

1168
01:01:41.289 --> 01:01:42.789
(Cha So Yeon, Class 2)

1169
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:43.870
I feel hot.

1170
01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:49.209
(Cho Jang Soo, Class 2)

1171
01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:50.289
I'll do a good job.

1172
01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.339
Oh. That's it?

1173
01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.669
Yes, that's it.

1174
01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:59.300
Once I complete this, you have to buy me a motorcycle. Okay?

1175
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.180
Grandma, don't skip meals.

1176
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.180
And don't forget to take your medicine.

1177
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.189
(No Ae Seol, Class 2)

1178
01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:09.979
I numbered them for you yesterday. Remember?

1179
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.729
Don't forget to take them as you promised.

1180
01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:15.689
Okay?

1181
01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:20.950
- Gosh.
- Hey, look at this.

1182
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.240
- Oh, my.
- That's nuts.

1183
01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:26.999
Hey, this is crazy! Gather around.

1184
01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:28.039
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1185
01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:29.120
Guys.

1186
01:02:29.669 --> 01:02:31.339
- What is it?
- What is it?

1187
01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:32.839
Guys, you need to see this.

1188
01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:38.010
They're here. What should we do?

1189
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.089
Oh, no.

1190
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.260
What are you doing?

1191
01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.390
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

1192
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.649
What the... Isn't this fake?

1193
01:02:49.649 --> 01:02:50.649
Yes, it's got to be.

1194
01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:52.439
Why would soldiers kill animals?

1195
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.149
This is totally fake.

1196
01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:55.439
No.

1197
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.819
I've seen this before.

1198
01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.289
You see, one of the things...

1199
01:03:05.539 --> 01:03:08.160
that the government does before war breaks out...

1200
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.370
is getting rid of the animals in zoos.

1201
01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:12.999
Tigers, lions,

1202
01:03:13.339 --> 01:03:14.339
elephants!

1203
01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:16.839
They kill such vicious animals.

1204
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.260
But why?

1205
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.930
If starving animals escape,

1206
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.970
they'll eat people. That's why.

1207
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.479
Then what about the animals that aren't vicious?

1208
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.729
Well, they'll be just left there to starve and die.

1209
01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:35.859
Starve to death, you idiot.

1210
01:03:35.859 --> 01:03:37.649
- Hey, let me eat the chips.
- Hold on.

1211
01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:39.819
If what Duk Joong is saying is true,

1212
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.990
it means a war has broken out.

1213
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.120
That's right.

1214
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:51.370
It's either that, or it will begin very soon.

1215
01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.209
No way.

1216
01:03:55.539 --> 01:03:57.839
Duk Joong, who told you that?

1217
01:03:57.919 --> 01:03:58.919
What?

1218
01:03:59.209 --> 01:04:00.510
Where did you hear about it?

1219
01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.050
"Machine Gun Parade March."

1220
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.800
It's an animated film.

1221
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.100
Darn you.

1222
01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.560
- It's a masterpiece.
- Goodness.

1223
01:04:11.019 --> 01:04:12.729
You deserve a beating, you fool!

1224
01:04:12.729 --> 01:04:14.899
- Get this!
- You little...

1225
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.359
Seriously...

1226
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.080
- Get this!
- Does this hurt?

1227
01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.289
- Hey!
- Get this!

1228
01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:29.789
What is going on here?

1229
01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:38.879
Where are you going?

1230
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.300
I have to study.

1231
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.220
You're not allowed to go off on your own.

1232
01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.180
If you want to study, do it here.

1233
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.970
They're too loud. I can't focus here.

1234
01:04:54.189 --> 01:04:56.729
Kwon Il Ha over there has his cell phone.

1235
01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:04.819
You're not allowed to keep your cell phone. Did you not know that?

1236
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.330
Hand it over.

1237
01:05:12.999 --> 01:05:14.039
Go, hurry.

1238
01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.800
You violated the rules for cell phone use.

1239
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.550
You get three penalty points.

1240
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:28.050
Okay, sure.

1241
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.729
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

1242
01:05:37.399 --> 01:05:38.439
We can talk now.

1243
01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:42.069
You little piece of...

1244
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:43.189
What are you doing?

1245
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:49.620
Follow me, both of you.

1246
01:05:54.249 --> 01:05:55.499
Darn it.

1247
01:05:58.499 --> 01:05:59.669
It's all your fault, idiot.

1248
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:03.959
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go.

1249
01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:05.760
Darn it.

1250
01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.300
Gosh.

1251
01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.970
Hold it properly, will you? It's splashing all over me.

1252
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:15.979
This is why you have no friends. What a loser.

1253
01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:20.560
You piece of...

1254
01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:21.979
Hey.

1255
01:06:22.569 --> 01:06:24.649
Seriously, what's your problem?

1256
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.950
Hey. You're really getting on my nerves, you little jerk.

1257
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.740
Hey, got a death wish?

1258
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.490
Gosh, he's at it again.

1259
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:42.749
Hey, do you know that everyone thinks you're obnoxious? You loser.

1260
01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.499
That's rich coming from someone who plays bully.

1261
01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.550
You gangster want-to-be.

1262
01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:50.390
Oh, your family must be happy...

1263
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.350
that a piece of trash like you is gone.

1264
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.760
You little...

1265
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.680
Hey, guys!

1266
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.140
- You piece of...
- Hey, don't!

1267
01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.560
- Hey! Please.
- Move.

1268
01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.899
- Hey, please.
- Let go.

1269
01:06:59.899 --> 01:07:01.689
- Please don't do this.
- Why you little...

1270
01:07:01.689 --> 01:07:03.899
- You stupid piece of...
- Please, guys.

1271
01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:06.359
Please stop. Hold on.

1272
01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:20.709
Darn...

1273
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.100
Hey, guys.

1274
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.399
What is that? That thing.

1275
01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:48.819
Can't you tell?

1276
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.740
It's the sphere.

1277
01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.330
I've never seen one right in front of my eyes.

1278
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.450
- Hey, wait!
- Why?

1279
01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:01.160
Don't. It could be dangerous.

1280
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.919
Darn it!

1281
01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:06.800
I got my phone taken away because of that loser.

1282
01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:09.169
If I post this, my follower count will skyrocket.

1283
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.379
It really is too bad.

1284
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:19.269
Is that right?

1285
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.689
Then why don't you post videos of yourself bullying the others?

1286
01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.019
Those videos will go viral too.

1287
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.279
Scumbag.

1288
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:32.279
Hey, Young Hoon! Hey.

1289
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.110
- Please calm down!
- Let go!

1290
01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.779
- Darn it, seriously.
- Calm down, please.

1291
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:40.119
You are a scumbag.

1292
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:43.169
When you don't like something,

1293
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:46.749
you get angry and hit others.

1294
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.360
(Duty After School)

1295
01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860
There, it's ready.

1296
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:55.610
Well...

1297
01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:58.199
State your class, student number, and name.

1298
01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.409
Then say a few words to your parents and friends...

1299
01:10:05.789 --> 01:10:06.789
You can just...

1300
01:10:07.619 --> 01:10:09.709
say a few words to your parents.

1301
01:10:11.169 --> 01:10:12.169
Well...

1302
01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.180
Is Cyberpia Internet Café still around?

1303
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.180
We used to play video games there back in middle school.

1304
01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.520
Oh, that place?

1305
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.100
That's random.

1306
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.690
Why? Did they go out of business?

1307
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.560
No, it's still there.

1308
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480
I see.

1309
01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:35.779
Do they still cook instant noodles for you?

1310
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.239
- Yes.
- What about the egg yolk?

1311
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.409
They pop it.

1312
01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:44.999
Still?

1313
01:10:45.499 --> 01:10:48.209
They really shouldn't pop the yolk.

1314
01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:50.249
The owner always forgets.

1315
01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.510
You know, that game...

1316
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.680
Is my ID still saved as one of your friends?

1317
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.270
Yes, of course.

1318
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:10.980
Let's go back there sometime and play it together again.

1319
01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:20.610
(Jang Young Hoon, Class 2)

1320
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.619
Sure.

1321
01:11:22.619 --> 01:11:23.829
After the CSAT.
