(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.679
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:46.550
What is this?

4
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.099
Something suddenly fell from above.

5
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.099
And then... And then what happened again?

6
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.599
Darn it.

7
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.570
Oh, right. Duk Joong. Did he arrive safely?

8
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.070
What about Na Ra?

9
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.429
Darn it. Where are the other cars?

10
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.469
Don't tell me we're the only ones who escaped.

11
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.599
No way.

12
00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.060
They must be behind us.

13
00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.489
I wonder if the shelter is all right.

14
00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.200
The shelter our parents are.

15
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.200
Mom.

16
00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.909
Mom.

17
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.038
Mom.

18
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.050
Hey. Stop crying, will you?

19
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.509
It's annoying.

20
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.519
The others must be in another car, right?

21
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.309
Including Won Bin.

22
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.149
Yes. They're probably okay.

23
00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.950
They must be okay.

24
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.880
Gosh. I must be crazy.

25
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.640
I'm dead scared but dead sleepy at the same time.

26
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.850
Well, me too.

27
00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.439
Is it because I feel relaxed now?

28
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.610
I hope...

29
00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.739
it all turns out to be a dream after I wake up.

30
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.619
What was that? Darn it!

31
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
What the heck?

32
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.219
Guys, get out!

33
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.550
Stop! It's dangerous!

34
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.809
Stop it! Get out!

35
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.599
- Shoot straight!
- Hurry up!

36
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600
Shoot!

37
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.450
"Shoot?"

38
00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.040
Darn it.

39
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.839
Oh, gosh. Are you guys all right?

40
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.550
It hurts.

41
00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.760
Is everyone okay?

42
00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.679
- Hold on a second.
- So Yeon.

43
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.850
- Where's So Yeon?
- What?

44
00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:22.019
So Yeon!

45
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:24.559
So Yeon. Are you okay?

46
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.600
Chi Yeol, help her up.

47
00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.360
Get up. Be careful.

48
00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.360
- Hold her arm.
- Be careful.

49
00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.030
Let her sit down. Here, sit. Slowly.

50
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.610
Are you okay?

51
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.030
Let us have a look.

52
00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.739
- Darn it.
- Oh, my gosh.

53
00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.619
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

54
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.128
- You scared me!
- What is it?

55
00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.138
- It hurts. What do I do?
- Are you okay?

56
00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.100
I think my bone is broken.

57
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.229
Let me see.

58
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.269
- It's bad, right?
- Darn it.

59
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.270
Hey. Stop being a crybaby.

60
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.939
- It hurts.
- It's just a scratch.

61
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.530
But it hurts.

62
00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.489
Will So Yeon be okay?

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.819
Darn it.

71
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.170
It's empty.

72
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.340
- What about you?
- Me too.

73
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.050
Darn it.

74
00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.429
I'm sorry. Seriously.

75
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.138
- I think she has a fever.
- What?

76
00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.139
What do we do? Hang in there, So Yeon.

77
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.730
Hey, Jang Soo.

(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

79
00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.689
How are the soldiers?

80
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.238
They're all dead.

81
00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:22.280
- What?
- What?

82
00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.239
Darn it. What now?

83
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:28.449
What do we do now?

84
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.709
Isn't it obvious? We should go back to Seoul.

85
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.328
Hey, are you crazy? Can't you see all of this?

86
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.669
We're out of bullets. So what? Return so that we can die?

87
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.879
What else can we do?

88
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.129
Where were we assembling again? Shouldn't we go there?

89
00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:43.179
- Mount Soak.
- Right, Mount Soak.

90
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.759
There are soldiers there. It should be safer than Seoul.

91
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.429
Young Sin. How long will it take us to Mount Soak?

92
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.939
We're about here. The gathering place is over here.

93
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.738
It's about 20km from here to the gathering place.

94
00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:05.949
- What? About 20km?
- About 20km?

95
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.489
Darn it.

96
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:10.198
Are you mad?

97
00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.790
How on earth can we walk 20km in this blazing heat?

98
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.170
Rather than getting tired midway, let's wait here to get rescued.

99
00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.089
He's right, guys. Let's just wait, okay?

100
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.669
Hey. What if a sphere jumps out as we wait?

101
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.379
What if it does as we walk? Is that any different?

102
00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:28.009
And look.

103
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.389
There aren't as many spheres here compared to Seoul.

104
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.230
There are no traces of fallen spheres either.

105
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.819
What? Why aren't there any here when there are tons in Seoul?

106
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.370
Is it because there are no people here?

107
00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:52.370
Is that why?

108
00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:55.120
I can't go. I'm going to wait here.

109
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.339
Hey, guys. It didn't seem like any other cars passed by...

110
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.420
on our way here.

111
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.838
Isn't it better to go to Mount Soak?

112
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.549
Will you use your darn brains already?

113
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.389
Let's just stay here, you idiots!

114
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.049
Seriously! Hey.

115
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.270
Will you take responsibility if no one comes? Will you?

116
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.769
You little...

117
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.058
Guys, we better move to a place we can rest first.

118
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.558
So Yeon's condition looks bad.

119
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.530
Darn it. Hey. Look around, will you?

120
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.189
Where on earth can we rest?

121
00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:28.739
Forget it. I can walk. Let's go to the gathering place.

122
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.319
- Hey.
- It hurts.

123
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.289
I stopped the bleeding. But her wound is severe.

124
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.160
She'll get worse if we don't get her treated fast.

125
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.999
Then let's search as we walk...

126
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.709
Darn it! Seriously!

127
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.959
Do you only use your brain to study?

128
00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:47.300
We don't even know what's around.

129
00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.550
Are we going to look around blindly?

130
00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.020
Yes. Hee Rak's right.

131
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.229
There aren't any villages on the map.

132
00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:04.319
It's best not to move when we don't know anything.

133
00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:08.530
See that? Cho Young Sin is the only one who understands.

134
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.569
Just stay here, you bunch of scum!

135
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.079
We saw it today, didn't we?

136
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.170
What happened to our friends.

137
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.000
I don't want any of us to fall into danger.

138
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.550
I don't want to lose anyone.

139
00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:45.069
Let's search the area first.

140
00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:48.609
If we don't find anything after looking around for 30 minutes...

141
00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.660
Let's think about it, then.

142
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:59.410
Then I'll search that side first.

143
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.459
- I'll take the other side.
- Okay. This side for me.

144
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.879
I'll go with Tae Man.

145
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.339
Hey. Take me with you.

146
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.880
You guys. Since when did we have such great teamwork?

147
00:11:23.689 --> 00:11:26.059
You can stay here with Young Sin.

148
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.150
Gosh.

149
00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:04.439
Get out.

150
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.500
I don't think the first vehicle arrived yet.

151
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.780
Are you all okay?

152
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.120
What about the first vehicle?

153
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.660
They were ahead of us.

154
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.349
Did you see that?

155
00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:15.609
Why aren't they here yet?

156
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.449
I hope nothing happened to them.

157
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.790
They should already be here.

158
00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.370
Something bad must've happened to them.

159
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.540
No way.

160
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.880
- They'll be here soon.
- You saw what happened.

161
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.669
In Hye was trying to get in the vehicle and...

162
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.759
Hey.

163
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.839
Yoo Ha Na.

164
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.229
Starting this moment,

165
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.229
stay here until further orders.

166
00:14:57.609 --> 00:14:58.650
What about the others?

167
00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:01.109
We haven't...

168
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.990
heard from them yet.

169
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.780
You haven't heard from them?

170
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.578
They should already be here.

171
00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:09.250
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

172
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.620
Let's wait a bit longer.

173
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:11.870
Until when?

174
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.249
Hey.

175
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.339
You should've let us leave when we wanted to.

176
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.000
- Darn it.
- Il Ha.

177
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.420
- What?
- That's enough.

178
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.589
If it weren't for him,

179
00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:25.390
we wouldn't be alive now.

180
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:33.189
Lieutenant.

181
00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:38.650
Please make sure...

182
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.699
the others arrive safely.

183
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160
Please.

184
00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:03.339
You should...

185
00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:06.219
all get some rest.

186
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.900
Darn it.

187
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.699
I'm tired and hungry.

188
00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:25.780
I hate all this.

189
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:27.949
I hate it.

190
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.329
There's nothing.

191
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.870
We didn't find anything either.

192
00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:39.339
Hey, guys!

193
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.380
Did you find something?

194
00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:46.429
Yes.

195
00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:47.429
- What?
- What?

196
00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:48.429
Where?

197
00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.719
Over there.

198
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.890
Are you serious?

199
00:16:55.479 --> 00:16:56.770
- I'll help you get up.
- Okay.

200
00:16:56.979 --> 00:16:57.979
One, two.

201
00:16:58.979 --> 00:16:59.979
Are you okay?

202
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.189
I'll carry So Yeon.

203
00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:05.699
- Okay.
- No, thanks. I can walk.

204
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.030
Your injury will get worse. Get on his back.

205
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.319
I'm fine.

206
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.910
I'll walk until I can't.

207
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200
Help her.

208
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.039
- I'll help her.
- Hold her for a minute.

209
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040
Okay.

210
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.930
We're ready. Let's go.

211
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760
Wait a second.

212
00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:34.849
Aren't you going?

213
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.930
I want to,

214
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.308
but my knee hurts so much I can't take a single step.

215
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.229
Hey. Stop being a baby.

216
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.148
It really hurts.

217
00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:45.399
She's so annoying.

218
00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:47.399
I'll carry Soon Yi then.

219
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.780
You're too weak to carry anyone.

220
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.290
There.

221
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.169
Stop worrying and get on my back.

222
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:04.919
Thank you.

223
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.879
I'm quite heavy.

224
00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:17.020
Let's go.

225
00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:19.349
Are we leaving?

226
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.190
We're leaving?

227
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.020
Those crazy idiots.

228
00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:25.399
Seriously?

229
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.819
- Hey.
- Yes?

230
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.780
You're staying, right?

231
00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:31.159
What?

232
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.118
Hey, Park So Yoon. Wait for me!

233
00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.119
Hurry up.

234
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040
Darn it.

235
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.030
No way.

236
00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:09.399
We're at war.

237
00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:13.568
Transport vehicles are as important as soldiers' lives during a war.

238
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.829
I can't let you use it for personal reasons.

239
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.329
It isn't a personal reason.

240
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.750
Some of my platoon members seem to have fallen behind.

241
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.169
Please help me find them.

242
00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:29.379
Lieutenant Lee.

243
00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:32.550
Take a look outside.

244
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.838
It isn't just your platoon members.

245
00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:38.220
Tons of Student Reserve Forces haven't arrived yet.

246
00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:41.180
None of the Jungreung High School students made it here.

247
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.729
Don't cause more damage,

248
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.189
and take care of the kids that are here.

249
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.859
I'm sure the kids are alive.

250
00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.069
Please.

251
00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:00.659
I'm begging you.

252
00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:04.079
Later,

253
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.669
you'll be thanking me.

254
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.809
How did it go?

255
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.609
What should we do now?

256
00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:38.200
Won Bin.

257
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.869
Yes.

258
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.500
How much do you trust me?

259
00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:50.300
I'll even trust you if you say pigs fly.

260
00:20:52.879 --> 00:20:53.879
Thank you.

261
00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:01.059
I need to ask you for a tough favour.

262
00:21:01.139 --> 00:21:02.220
I said I trusted you.

263
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.559
Don't ask for a favour.

264
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.270
Just give me orders.

265
00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:14.940
Darn it.

266
00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:16.490
It's so hot.

267
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:23.159
I can't take this any longer! Hey, Chi Yeol.

268
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.210
When will we arrive at the house? Darn it.

269
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.619
Did you really see one?

270
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.339
Careful.

271
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800
I'm sure...

272
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680
it's here somewhere.

273
00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:45.230
So where is it, you idiot?

274
00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:46.889
Well...

275
00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:48.849
I'm not familiar with this area and was running.

276
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.979
It must be here somewhere.

277
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.318
You idiot.

278
00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:54.148
I shouldn't have believed him.

279
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:55.149
Hee Rak.

280
00:21:55.569 --> 00:21:57.608
That's enough. You aren't the only one exhausted.

281
00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:01.199
I told you we should stay there, you idiots.

282
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.490
If we stayed there like I said we should,

283
00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:04.040
we'd be rescued by now.

284
00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:06.119
This is so annoying!

285
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.930
- I see it!
- Where?

286
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.469
Over there.

287
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.470
What?

288
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.730
We're saved!

289
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.270
- I'm so relieved!
- I know.

290
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.030
Gosh.

291
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.239
Hey, guys.

292
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.490
There's a room here. Let's have So Yeon lie down inside.

293
00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.700
- We're here.
- Just a little more.

294
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:44.369
(Safety first)

295
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.200
Watch your step.

296
00:22:55.589 --> 00:22:56.629
Darn it.

297
00:22:58.589 --> 00:22:59.970
Put her down here.

298
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:01.800
Here you go.

299
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.599
- I'll help her.
- Okay.

300
00:23:05.139 --> 00:23:06.470
One second, So Yeon.

301
00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:11.770
Thank you.

302
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.980
It's okay.

303
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.710
What was that?

304
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.249
(Under construction)

305
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.879
It's so hot.

306
00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.180
She has a high fever.

307
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:45.638
Find me some clean water and cloth to cover her wound.

308
00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:47.809
- I'll go and find it.
- I'll help.

309
00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:53.439
Also, try to find medication for her fever or antiseptics.

310
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.059
Okay, I'll go look.

311
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.658
Let's look for food or anything that will come in handy.

312
00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:04.659
Okay.

313
00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:14.119
Darn it.

314
00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:21.168
Liquid nitrogen.

315
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:26.680
(Liquid nitrogen)

316
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.849
Why are they making me do this?

317
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:47.319
(Storage area, Water supply and drainage facility)

318
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.579
Darn it.

319
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.790
Everything here is useless.

320
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.220
I wonder if everyone in the other vehicle arrived safely.

321
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.760
I can't wait to see them.

322
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.280
Soo Chul, you've been quiet.

323
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.359
What is it? Do you feel sick?

324
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:31.159
Do you think the others are alive?

325
00:25:31.409 --> 00:25:34.540
Of course. Why would you ask that?

326
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:46.510
- Woo Taek.
- What?

327
00:25:48.889 --> 00:25:50.680
I couldn't save Woo Taek.

328
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.970
What do you mean? Isn't he in the second vehicle?

329
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.349
Woo Taek...

330
00:26:03.399 --> 00:26:06.109
I left him behind.

331
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.790
No way.

332
00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:20.540
Is Woo Taek dead?

333
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.309
There's nothing here.

334
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.559
How is there nothing here?

335
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:44.859
Did anyone even live here?

336
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.980
(Butane gas)

337
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.069
- Did you find anything?
- What?

338
00:26:52.869 --> 00:26:53.990
No, I didn't.

339
00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:56.619
What is with you?

340
00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:03.629
I found something. Look.

341
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.719
I'm sorry. That must hurt. Hang in there.

342
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720
Here you go.

343
00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.770
I'm cold.

344
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.230
Her fever won't drop.

345
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.530
We need a fever reducer.

346
00:27:31.069 --> 00:27:32.609
This looks like cold medicine.

347
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.240
(Fever reducer)

348
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.079
So Yeon, this is a fever reducer. Take it.

349
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.329
Here's some water.

350
00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:52.760
I think this was a construction site office.

351
00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:55.510
There is nothing to eat here other than water.

352
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.599
I found a blanket.

353
00:27:57.889 --> 00:28:00.349
I think we can create a stretcher for So Yeon with it.

354
00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:03.639
I found something quite important. Something we need at night.

355
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:06.770
What is it?

356
00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:09.149
Mosquito repellent incense.

357
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.450
Seriously.

358
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.369
Do you know how vicious mountain mosquitoes are?

359
00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:19.909
I'm hungry.

360
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.960
The phone is dead. Darn it.

361
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.089
We'll starve to death at this rate.

362
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.180
- Where are you going?
- What?

363
00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:44.230
The bathroom.

364
00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:01.740
No one will get full if I share.

365
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.829
It's better for one person to get full.

366
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:27.690
Who is going to take responsibility if something goes wrong?

367
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:28.940
I'm sorry, sir.

368
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.770
This isn't the first time.

369
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:35.109
Reorganize this starting from a month ago.

370
00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:36.319
Yes, sir.

371
00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:38.609
Sir.

372
00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:48.169
(Park Jin Soo)

373
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:51.339
Park Jin Soo, I didn't expect to see you here.

374
00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.550
(Kim Won Bin, Republic of Korea Army)

375
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.338
- Do I know you?
- Come on.

376
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.010
We were in the same troop.

377
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:03.930
From where?

378
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.269
Nonsan.

379
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.888
- Nonsan?
- Yes.

380
00:30:08.889 --> 00:30:10.059
I was in Chuncheon.

381
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.030
We said it would've been easy if we were stationed in Nonsan.

382
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:20.949
I'm disappointed you don't remember me.

383
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.159
Come on. Can't you remember me?

384
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.960
That's right. You wanted chocolate snacks so bad...

385
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.800
that you converted to Catholicism. Don't you remember?

386
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.929
I remember.

387
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.180
There you go. You startled me.

388
00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:48.598
- How have you been?
- Good.

389
00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:49.639
It's so good to see you.

390
00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:53.059
Have a seat. It's really good to see you.

391
00:30:53.809 --> 00:30:58.648
Did all your kids make it here?

392
00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:00.818
Yes, they did.

393
00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:03.030
Why? Aren't your kids here yet?

394
00:31:03.159 --> 00:31:06.369
No, I'm waiting.

395
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.750
They'll be here soon. Just wait and see.

396
00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:11.369
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

397
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.000
Sergeant Park Jin Soo at Transportation speaking.

398
00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.419
Yes, sir.

399
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.129
I'm getting it ready, sir.

400
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.180
Yes.

401
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.599
I'll have it ready by 1pm.

402
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.930
Yes.

403
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:32.770
Yes, sir.

404
00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.609
You're still muscular.

405
00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:39.649
Of course, I still work out.

406
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.780
- You do?
- Yes.

407
00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:41.818
Keep up the good work.

408
00:31:41.819 --> 00:31:42.859
- Okay.
- See you.

409
00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:44.740
Wait a minute.

410
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.119
What is it?

411
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.460
Do you have any cigarettes?

412
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.550
I don't smoke.

413
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:03.010
- Stop lying.
- I'm serious.

414
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.889
Wait a second. Give me your hand.

415
00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:09.599
What?

416
00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:18.769
You really don't smoke.

417
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.030
No, that's what I told you.

418
00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:23.318
- I'll smoke next time. See you.
- Okay.

419
00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:25.569
Bye, Won Bin.

420
00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:36.250
Do you know what the punishment is...

421
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.919
for stealing a transport vehicle during a war?

422
00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:40.129
Death.

423
00:32:42.589 --> 00:32:44.260
I know that much.

424
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.800
I'll be back.

425
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.020
I'll go with you.

426
00:32:55.059 --> 00:32:56.979
No, if I'm sentenced to death,

427
00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.899
I need someone to take care of my dog tags.

428
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.829
Gosh.

429
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.290
- Won Bin.
- You scared me.

430
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:17.000
What are you doing here?

431
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.629
Where is the lieutenant going?

432
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.169
He isn't going to eat something.

433
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.839
It's none of your business.

434
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:30.470
You should button up.

435
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.639
Wait.

436
00:33:37.899 --> 00:33:38.899
Let's go.

437
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.649
Be honest. What were you eating in there?

438
00:33:43.819 --> 00:33:44.940
Ginkgo nuts?

439
00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:50.990
Listen, guys.

440
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.119
Guys.

441
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.540
I think the platoon commander is off to rescue the kids.

442
00:33:57.829 --> 00:33:59.079
- Really?
- Yes.

443
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.669
We've been told to wait here until further notice.

444
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.419
So why else would he go outside?

445
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.260
He must have the same thing in mind.

446
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.299
I also think Soo Chul and the others are alive.

447
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.719
Would they be dead, then?

448
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.809
- Of course, they're alive.
- Right.

449
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.520
Speaking of which,

450
00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.268
I'm going to go with him.

451
00:34:18.269 --> 00:34:19.479
Hey, are you out of...

452
00:34:19.979 --> 00:34:22.359
Are you out of your mind? Aren't you scared?

453
00:34:22.689 --> 00:34:24.109
Yes, I'm scared.

454
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.318
But if it were Soo Chul, he'd come for my rescue...

455
00:34:27.319 --> 00:34:28.490
without thinking twice.

456
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160
I'll go with you.

457
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.200
I'm too frustrated to wait without doing anything.

458
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:44.589
Hey, Na Ra.

459
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.589
- Get me my gun too.
- Hey!

460
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.220
Darn it.

461
00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:00.560
Ae Seol.

462
00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:04.108
What are you doing? You can't even protect yourself.

463
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:05.609
Just stay here.

464
00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:07.530
I'm going too.

465
00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:10.109
Look, guys.

466
00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:12.990
Let's try to think rationally.

467
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.280
If they're alive, they would've come already.

468
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.998
And what if we get caught going outside to rescue them?

469
00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:19.120
If we get caught,

470
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.620
then what?

471
00:35:24.129 --> 00:35:25.748
We could get penalty points all together...

472
00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:27.378
to take joint responsibility or whatnot.

473
00:35:27.379 --> 00:35:28.629
- Then...
- You idiot.

474
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:31.219
You actually think we'll take the CSAT in this situation?

475
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.010
They didn't say we wouldn't.

476
00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:34.510
So we'll probably take it.

477
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.849
You know we can't go to the college we want if we get penalty points.

478
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:39.850
Gosh.

479
00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:45.060
Forget it.

480
00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:47.189
What did I even expect from you?

481
00:35:47.399 --> 00:35:48.479
I'm off.

482
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.359
Me too.

483
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.160
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not going.

484
00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:02.660
Gosh! What?

485
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.379
Goodness...

486
00:36:23.189 --> 00:36:25.729
Gosh. Kimchi, hand me the pincers.

487
00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:30.149
- Hey.
- What?

488
00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:31.490
What's on your mind?

489
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.780
No, nothing.

490
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.990
What is it?

491
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.289
Anyway, it seems those people rushed away from this place.

492
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:47.079
They even left a delivery van in the garage.

493
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.288
Darn it.

494
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.459
Why couldn't you tell us sooner?

495
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:52.878
Let's ride that to escape.

496
00:36:52.879 --> 00:36:54.879
Will you cut the nonsense?

497
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.759
- None of us can drive.
- I'll do it.

498
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.429
You're poor at driving a motorcycle, to begin with.

499
00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.759
Still, I'm better than Kwon Il Ha.

500
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.220
What are you saying, idiot?

501
00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:16.160
I should have some left in case I need it later.

502
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.550
Who's screaming?

503
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.260
What is it with her this time?

504
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.139
- Darn, we're doomed!
- What on earth?

505
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.389
- Woo Taek!
- Let's go inside.

506
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.850
- Behind you!
- Gosh.

507
00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:48.850
Help me!

508
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.268
Go in!

509
00:37:50.269 --> 00:37:51.269
- What is it?
- Go inside.

510
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.818
- Run!
- Help me!

511
00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:53.978
Behind you, darn it!

512
00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:55.489
- Oh, my.
- Go inside.

513
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.069
- Watch out!
- No!

514
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.990
- Run!
- Go inside already.

515
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.910
Watch out!

516
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.830
- Goodness!
- Get up!

517
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.959
Close the door!

518
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.299
No. That won't be enough.

519
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.390
Let's move this thing.

520
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.810
Gosh.

521
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.719
- Do it with them!
- What's wrong with you?

522
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.479
- Goodness, gracious.
- Hurry up.

523
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.580
Did it leave?

524
00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:50.749
Goodness.

525
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.839
- Darn it.
- Come on!

526
00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:11.518
It's coming through the ventilator!

527
00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:13.019
Go into the room now!

528
00:39:13.229 --> 00:39:14.310
Quickly!

529
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:15.569
Go!

530
00:39:15.649 --> 00:39:17.280
- Get in there!
- Get the door.

531
00:39:35.749 --> 00:39:36.919
Do something.

532
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.339
What do we do?

533
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.089
It's okay. Don't worry.

534
00:39:42.629 --> 00:39:44.300
- Soo Chul, the windows.
- Okay.

535
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.850
- Yeon Ju, check that window.
- Okay.

536
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.729
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

537
00:39:56.319 --> 00:39:57.519
It doesn't open?

538
00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:01.149
I think this one's good too.

539
00:40:03.319 --> 00:40:05.239
Guys, over here!

540
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240
- Let's block this.
- Darn it.

541
00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.390
Why does it keep moving around?

542
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:39.229
Did it leave?

543
00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:55.419
Darn it. There are two.

544
00:40:57.669 --> 00:40:58.919
Let's check.

545
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:01.339
No, don't.

546
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:05.089
I think we should check.

547
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.830
I think there's just one.

548
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.410
What are you guys doing here?

549
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.749
You're off to find the kids.

550
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.999
Leave it to me and go back to the camp.

551
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:24.050
Do you know...

552
00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:26.919
what will happen if you get caught?

553
00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.470
Probably get penalty points.

554
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.390
What about you, though?

555
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.889
- Duk Joong.
- What?

556
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.269
What happens in this case?

557
00:42:38.019 --> 00:42:40.100
He'll be executed, at the least.

558
00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:45.530
Let's keep going.

559
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:47.899
We've come too far to go back.

560
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.700
Let's just go back.

561
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.510
What is this?

562
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.560
The thing is...

563
00:43:19.729 --> 00:43:22.399
Jun Hee, did you have ramyeon?

564
00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.269
Well...

565
00:43:29.689 --> 00:43:32.199
But I couldn't eat anything all day.

566
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.029
Are you out of your mind? We're all starving!

567
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.369
You let that thing find you...

568
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:37.539
while eating alone in secret?

569
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.289
- Let go.
- Knock it off.

570
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.370
What matters is how we will escape.

571
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:49.879
I'm sorry.

572
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.268
Anyway, why did it suddenly stop...

573
00:43:58.269 --> 00:43:59.600
moving around?

574
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.729
Could it be...

575
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.810
This is just my guess,

576
00:44:04.519 --> 00:44:07.648
but maybe it knows that we can't run away due to the window guards.

577
00:44:07.649 --> 00:44:08.819
What?

578
00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:10.439
Think about it.

579
00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:12.568
It knows that we can't run away through the windows.

580
00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:14.280
It's waiting for us in front of the only way out.

581
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.830
It can't be that smart, though.

582
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.660
I thought they were unicellular creatures.

583
00:44:21.249 --> 00:44:23.080
We know nothing about the spheres.

584
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.749
If they're intelligent, where they came from,

585
00:44:29.629 --> 00:44:30.760
and why they came.

586
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.430
But one thing is certain.

587
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.010
It reacts to sounds.

588
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.240
So Yeon?

589
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.490
So Yeon.

590
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.339
What's going on?

591
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.390
Her wound started festering. Her fever is back too.

592
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.979
She'll be seriously ill if we don't take action.

593
00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:32.689
Let's just get in the truck and drive away.

594
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.819
What am I saying?

595
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.830
What are you doing?

596
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.490
I have to tell them.

597
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.700
That we should drive away in the truck, as you said.

598
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:49.628
I was just saying. I wasn't actually suggesting it.

599
00:45:49.629 --> 00:45:52.459
So, we just sit here and watch So Yeon suffer?

600
00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:14.439
Chi Yeol.

601
00:46:15.899 --> 00:46:17.069
Be careful.

602
00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:18.740
I will.

603
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.200
Hee Rak, block it as soon as I leave.

604
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.289
Chi Yeol.

605
00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:30.209
Are you sure about this?

606
00:46:32.669 --> 00:46:33.709
I'll be fine.

607
00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:42.010
(Disinfectant Storage)

608
00:46:49.689 --> 00:46:55.899
(Disinfectant Storage)

609
00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.220
Shoot.

610
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.069
Hey. Jang Soo.

611
00:47:39.609 --> 00:47:40.649
Jang Soo!

612
00:47:54.129 --> 00:47:55.419
How did you get out?

613
00:47:56.499 --> 00:47:57.669
Is that Chi Yeol?

614
00:47:57.879 --> 00:47:59.589
Yes. How did he get here?

615
00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:02.550
So Yeon's condition is worsening.

616
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.680
So, we had an idea.

617
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.310
Why don't we just get in the truck and drive away?

618
00:48:12.729 --> 00:48:15.649
Chi Yeol, do you think you can let us out?

619
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:17.689
Let's see.

620
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.580
Gosh.

621
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.370
No. Not with my bare hands.

622
00:48:35.789 --> 00:48:38.169
- We're going to need some tools.
- Tools?

623
00:48:41.129 --> 00:48:44.180
(Butane gas)

624
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.220
Okay. I'll go and find one.

625
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.720
Hey.

626
00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:51.850
Be careful.

627
00:48:52.769 --> 00:48:55.600
I will. Don't worry.

628
00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:02.240
Gosh.

629
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.240
Is this the right way?

630
00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.660
We'll have to try something.

631
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.999
We can't just stay locked up here.

632
00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.850
Come on, man.

633
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:02.300
- What's taking him so long?
- Gosh.

634
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.379
What if something happened to him?

635
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.780
Oh, no.

636
00:51:07.319 --> 00:51:09.780
What was that? What's happening?

637
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.870
Take this!

638
00:51:26.839 --> 00:51:29.589
Guys! Retreat!

639
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.469
Guys! Retreat!

640
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.889
- Open the door!
- The door!

641
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:36.600
Get the door! Hurry!

642
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.519
- Let's go.
- Come on!

643
00:51:40.269 --> 00:51:42.809
- Go!
- Where is he?

644
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.268
- Go!
- Run!

645
00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:46.019
Open the door!

646
00:51:47.439 --> 00:51:48.479
The door!

647
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:52.450
- Shoot.
- Chi Yeol!

648
00:51:52.569 --> 00:51:55.449
- What's happening?
- What do you think is happening?

649
00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:58.870
- The door!
- Keep running!

650
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.120
- This way.
- Hey, Chi Yeol!

651
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.879
- Block it.
- Come back in.

652
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:14.969
What is going on outside?

653
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.680
You listened to the whole thing, darn it!

654
00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:21.850
At least, Chi Yeol is safe, right?

655
00:52:24.189 --> 00:52:25.359
Guys.

656
00:52:26.899 --> 00:52:28.189
Do you think this can get you out?

657
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:35.620
Kimchi. You were much faster than usual.

658
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.999
Let's get ready to break out.

659
00:52:45.459 --> 00:52:46.539
Wait.

660
00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:50.800
We have to make the sphere think that we're still inside.

661
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.628
- What?
- How do we do that?

662
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:55.220
What are you talking about?

663
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.479
- What is he up to?
- I have no idea.

664
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.769
("The Host")

665
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.539
What is this?

666
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.209
I thought that was only a movie.

667
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:32.050
Do you remember how that movie ends?

668
00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:36.050
They kill the monster and win at the end, right?

669
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:41.560
Beats me. I haven't watched it.

670
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:46.310
Yes. That is how it ends.

671
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.859
But the daughter they tried to save...

672
00:53:50.819 --> 00:53:53.280
ends up dying.

673
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:56.780
What? She dies?

674
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.789
She dies?

675
00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.060
Guys, move this.

676
00:54:31.229 --> 00:54:32.569
It's the guys.

677
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:40.620
Come outside.

678
00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:54.088
- I'm scared.
- Jun Hee.

679
00:54:54.089 --> 00:54:55.839
- Let's go and find the car keys.
- What?

680
00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.839
Hey.

681
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.310
(Under construction)

682
00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:14.069
Darn it.

683
00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.910
Gosh.

684
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.209
Let me help.

685
00:55:30.209 --> 00:55:31.419
Careful.

686
00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:39.510
Oh, gosh.

687
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.160
Darn it.

688
00:56:32.769 --> 00:56:34.228
The flue!

689
00:56:34.229 --> 00:56:35.978
What is it? Gosh.

690
00:56:35.979 --> 00:56:37.519
- Run!
- It's dangerous!

691
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:45.699
Go!

692
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.870
Take her and go first.

693
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:48.660
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

694
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:51.248
- Let's go!
- Go!

695
00:56:51.249 --> 00:56:52.330
I said go!

696
00:56:53.249 --> 00:56:54.419
Run!

697
00:56:55.209 --> 00:56:56.999
Let me do it. Let's do it together.

698
00:56:57.289 --> 00:56:59.248
- Just leave it and go!
- Go!

699
00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.669
- Let's do it together!
- Go!

700
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.299
Run!

701
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.088
- What's going on?
- Run!

702
00:57:07.089 --> 00:57:10.220
- Run!
- Retreat!

703
00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.389
I brought So Yeon.

704
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.810
Be careful.

705
00:57:16.229 --> 00:57:18.560
Go!

706
00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:20.019
Let's just go!

707
00:57:22.899 --> 00:57:23.899
Gosh.

708
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.568
Darn it. Come here!

709
00:57:25.569 --> 00:57:26.859
Hey! It's here!

710
00:57:27.819 --> 00:57:30.450
- There.
- Come here!

711
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.620
Soon Yi! Behind you!

712
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.289
Run, Chi Yeol!

713
00:57:37.879 --> 00:57:39.588
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Chi Yeol.

714
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.918
- Yes?
- Where are Tae Man and Soo Chul?

715
00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:42.878
I don't know. The sphere came out.

716
00:57:42.879 --> 00:57:44.629
Come here!

717
00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.439
Darn it.

718
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.319
So Yeon, stay with me. All right?

719
00:58:03.609 --> 00:58:04.740
Why aren't they coming?

720
00:58:07.819 --> 00:58:09.910
Hey, do something!

721
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:11.990
Darn it!

722
00:58:19.249 --> 00:58:20.459
Get up! What are you doing?

723
00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:24.669
Why aren't they coming?

724
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.429
- They are coming.
- Hurry!

725
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.969
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

726
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.219
- Go inside.
- Hurry.

727
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.220
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

728
00:58:41.649 --> 00:58:43.899
- It's this, isn't it?
- All right!

729
00:58:44.609 --> 00:58:47.530
- We're going to spend all night!
- Is that not it?

730
00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:48.899
Darn it.

731
00:58:57.999 --> 00:58:59.918
Hey. This. This is it, isn't it?

732
00:58:59.919 --> 00:59:01.330
All right!

733
00:59:01.539 --> 00:59:02.959
- All right!
- Hurry!

734
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.889
Darn it. I'm doomed.

735
00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.680
- What is it?
- It's manual.

736
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:14.720
What's that?

737
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.889
- How's So Yeon?
- Not good.

738
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.229
Hurry.

739
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:20.019
There.

740
00:59:23.859 --> 00:59:25.069
Darn it.

741
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.780
What is he doing?

742
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.660
Hey! We have to go!

743
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.369
You said you could drive!

744
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.580
Darn it.

745
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.998
- It's different from my dad's car.
- What?

746
00:59:38.999 --> 00:59:41.369
Darn it. This is crazy. What are we supposed to do then?

747
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.709
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

748
00:59:44.749 --> 00:59:46.708
- Move. I will do it.
- You know how to drive?

749
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:48.588
- I do. Give it to me.
- You really know?

750
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:51.180
- Move! Gosh.
- Hey!

751
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.088
- Hey!
- Hey!

752
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.089
- Darn it.
- Hey!

753
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.140
Hey!

754
00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.810
- Darn it.
- Move. I got it.

755
00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:00.060
Move.

756
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.189
Darn it.

757
01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.859
Just a little more.

758
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.280
One more time.

759
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.450
- No?
- No.

760
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.998
Darn it. Let's just run.

761
01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:22.330
We can't. We will all get caught if we carry her on the back.

762
01:00:22.499 --> 01:00:24.458
So why would you meddle with it when you don't know a thing?

763
01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:26.458
You stop messing around, idiot!

764
01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:28.129
My family runs a driving school!

765
01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:32.550
Darn it.

766
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:35.760
Isn't that the sphere?

767
01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:43.560
If it comes in here, we will all die.

768
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.229
Our best chance of survival is...

769
01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:51.990
leaving So Yeon behind.

770
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.239
- What?
- What?

771
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.489
Hey. Are you mad?

772
01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:57.280
Right. None of us wants to do that.

773
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:06.129
It's my fault.

774
01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:10.589
I am sorry, guys.

775
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.140
No, it's not your fault. It's all right.

776
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.719
Then one person should lure the sphere and the rest should...

777
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.309
ride the truck and escape. That's the only way.

778
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.680
What if that person gets caught?

779
01:01:23.979 --> 01:01:25.100
That's too risky.

780
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.310
The tentacles!

781
01:01:31.149 --> 01:01:32.189
This is...

782
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.609
the best decision we can make to not have any regrets later.

783
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.930
Gosh, will you hurry and choose?

784
01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:16.399
Show yours.

785
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.169
Hee Rak.

786
01:02:30.669 --> 01:02:31.709
Yes?

787
01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:34.879
Woo Hee Rak.

788
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.180
I think it's me.

789
01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:47.100
I'll get going.

790
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.689
Jang Soo!

791
01:02:51.689 --> 01:02:52.729
Hey!

792
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.289
What are you waiting for? Open it.

793
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.560
Jang Soo.

794
01:03:28.019 --> 01:03:29.180
Be careful.

795
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.950
(Duty After School)

796
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.870
You can begin.

797
01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:50.499
I'm well and healthy.

798
01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.418
I hope you are well too, Mom and Dad.

799
01:03:52.419 --> 01:03:54.789
(Cho Jang Soo, Class 3-2)

800
01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:56.050
Wait.

801
01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:57.760
That's it?

802
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.089
Yes.

803
01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.089
It's too short.

804
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.010
You don't have anything else to say?

805
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.978
Thanks to you, Dad, I'm getting trained well.

806
01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:13.979
Right. Your dad is a soldier.

807
01:04:14.609 --> 01:04:18.229
Did he not tell you anything when you were coming to the training?

808
01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:24.990
There's something he says when he drinks.

809
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.789
You wear a gas mask during the CBR training, you know.

810
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.538
To find out if the training is over,

811
01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:33.829
they have to get one person to take the mask off.

812
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:34.879
What?

813
01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:36.749
Gosh. Really?

814
01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.129
That must be hard to choose.

815
01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:43.930
But if you are the commander, you must not hesitate to do it.

816
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.970
When you decide who can and who can't do it.

817
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.179
Whichever decision you make,

818
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.390
the commander becomes the villain at that moment.

819
01:04:50.769 --> 01:04:51.890
When I heard that,

820
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.019
I thought I would never be able to be the commander.

821
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.819
The tenacious Cho Young Sin might be able to do it.

822
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.359
Then...

823
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.660
what do you think it would be like if you become the commander?

824
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:08.660
I don't know.

825
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.208
I guess I will have no choice but to become the villain too.
