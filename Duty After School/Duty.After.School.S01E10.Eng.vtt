00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.079
I can't walk anymore.

(Seongmun Port)

6
00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.969
Shoot. We've been walking for two days.

7
00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.090
And we still have 100km more to go?

8
00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.469
Gosh.

9
00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.310
Are you sure we're going the right way?

10
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.060
Yes. It's this way.

11
00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.099
I can't feel my feet.

12
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.400
I don't think I can walk anymore.

13
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.530
I'm starving.

14
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.699
We're running out of food too.

15
00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.870
Wait. There's a car.

16
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.000
- Stop!
- What?

20
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280
Look.

21
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.740
This was a sphere's job.

22
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.129
Shoot.

23
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.039
They're...

24
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.379
What is it?

25
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.879
It's them, isn't it?

26
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.099
We met them...

27
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.310
at the service area.

28
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.430
From the science high school.

29
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.900
They said they were going to Seoul.

30
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.150
But...

31
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.569
they all died here.

32
00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.030
Oh, no.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.100
Guys.

37
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.019
We have to go back.

38
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.730
Let's go back and get back to our mission.

39
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.899
Maybe the CSAT isn't cancelled.

40
00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.949
You can go by yourself if you want to.

41
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.410
But...

42
00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.910
we've been through so much...

43
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.250
for those extra points.

44
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.209
We can't just die in vain like them.

45
00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.470
Yeon Ju, try and stop them.

46
00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.470
They won't listen to me!

47
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.720
Fine.

48
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.930
Do you know how many spheres I killed so far?

49
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.689
Here. Look!

50
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.149
I killed 37 of them!

51
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.860
I might even...

52
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.990
get accepted to SNU with these extra points.

53
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.410
Young Soo, are you still hung up on extra points?

54
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.120
You need to stop.

55
00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.379
Guys. No.

56
00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.420
Do you want to get yourselves killed just like them?

57
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.089
No, right?

58
00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.889
Yeon Ju.

59
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.889
Help me persuade them. Please.

60
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.889
Sorry.

61
00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:59.649
Yeon Ju.

62
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:02.730
Yeon Ju! Wake up, guys!

63
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.399
You're all...

64
00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.029
- Come on.
- Jang Soo.

65
00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.620
I have to talk them out of it. Please help me.

66
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.699
No. I don't want to die like this.

67
00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.329
Jang Soo, I want to live.

68
00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:18.870
I have to go to college!

- Gosh.

72

- Oh, gosh.
- That hurts.

73
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.589
I'm exhausted.

74
00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:52.300
Oh, boy.

75
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.259
Let's get some rest here. And get something to eat.

76
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.810
I'm too tired.

77
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:09.360
Yes!

78
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.569
- Awesome.
- It's food.

79
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.660
They've all gone bad.

80
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:26.879
Wait. There's food!

81
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.129
And here!

82
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.959
- I found more.
- Where?

83
00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.550
- Yes!
- Great job.

84
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.089
- Put them all in. How many?
- Here.

85
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.009
- Multiple. There's a lot.
- "Multiple?"

86
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.200
Gosh.

87
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.820
This would have been tastier if it was warm.

88
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.029
I know, right? I saw a microwave oven inside.

89
00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:01.330
This is good enough. Just eat it.

90
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.789
I'll see if there's a generator.

91
00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.460
- Be careful.
- I'll come with you.

92
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.340
Come.

93
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.139
Should we ask them if they want this too?

94
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.980
Yes.

95
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.690
No.

96
00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:29.399
- Yeon Ju.
- I'm still mad at them.

97
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.279
I can't forgive them for lying to us.

98
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.779
By the way,

99
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.450
the students from the science high school...

100
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.830
They had different opinions,

101
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.500
and only eight of them were going to Seoul.

102
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.500
When I saw their bodies, I thought...

103
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.419
that it might have been us if we had separated.

104
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.549
Yu Jung and Jang Soo weren't wrong, after all.

105
00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:02.309
Right.

106
00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:07.019
I was furious and felt betrayed at first.

107
00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:10.940
But...

108
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.440
we all know that they were doing their best in their own ways.

109
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.629
Hey, you guys.

110
00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:38.179
What?

111
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.889
Stop staring, and just join us.

112
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.850
Okay.

113
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.570
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

114
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:06.950

116
00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:21.470
Move it, Cho Jang Soo. Have this.

117
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.350
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:32.440
Here.

119
00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:34.649
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:37.399
Me too.

121
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.509
Hey. Is it that good?

122
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:06.470
Yes.

123
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:08.559
It's good.

124
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:13.809
By the way,

125
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.320
it's been ages since we last came to an amusement park.

126
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.190
It was fun when we went together with the guys in Class One.

127
00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:21.779
You're kidding me.

128
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:23.779
Don't you remember your ex-boyfriend puked...

129
00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:24.990
after riding the pirate ship?

130
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.000
Oh, right. That jerk.

131
00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:34.629
We should've gone with our class.

132
00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:37.169
Before all this happened.

133
00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:41.629
Oh, Soo Chul.

134
00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:44.889
He wanted to go to the amusement park at the beginning of the term.

135
00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:49.809
We weren't close back then, so the plan just fizzled out.

136
00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.309
I should've just gone with him back then.

137
00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.279
- What?
- What?

138
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.159
The lights turned on.

139
00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:20.419
What's going on?

140
00:13:27.929 --> 00:13:28.970
Hey!

141
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.100
I did it!

142
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.139
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

143
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.769
- Park So Yoon!
- Park So Yoon!

144
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:35.100
- For real?
- Amazing.

145
00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:36.350
It was me.

146
00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:38.360
What are you saying? Hey.

147
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.769
- You really...
- What are you spouting?

148
00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:42.149
Hey.

149
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.399
Let's ride them.

150
00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:44.649
- Really?
- Yes, let's.

151
00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:46.279
- Let's ride them.
- But I'm scared.

152
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.279
No.

153
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.740
What if the spheres appear?

154
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.500
There aren't any around the area.

155
00:13:54.409 --> 00:13:57.460
Wouldn't it be okay as long as we don't scream?

156
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.629
- He's right.
- Yes.

157
00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.590
- Let's ride them.
- I'm in.

158
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.460
- Come on.
- Let's ride them.

159
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.090
Of course, I'll ride them.

160
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.509
By the way,

161
00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.720
it's beautiful, isn't it?

162
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.179
For real. Let's try it.

163
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.190
Gosh, seriously.

164
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.200
No!

165
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.250
We're flying!

166
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960
Stop!

167
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.980
(All cars need a minimum of 2 people.)

168
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.870
Yes, spin!

169
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.289
Oh, no.

170
00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:27.259
Duk Joong! So Yeon!

171
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.549
Hey! What the heck?

172
00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.629
- Get on.
- Come on.

173
00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:32.009
Hold tight.

174
00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:33.429
- Gosh.
- Save me!

175
00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:50.200
Now then, it is the long-awaited final round.

176
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.409
Who will be named the best sharpshooter?

177
00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:55.450
(Shoot the pretty doll down, and it's yours!)

178
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.200
Na Ra!

179
00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:02.710
- Lee Na Ra!
- Lee Na Ra!

180
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.710
Next.

181
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.210
Bo Ra!

182
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:09.419
- Yeon Bo Ra!
- Yeon Bo Ra!

183
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.799
- Yeon Bo Ra!
- Yeon Bo Ra!

184
00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:12.929
Yeon Bo Ra!

185
00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:15.639
Get ready.

186
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.100
Fire.

187
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.480
Look.

188
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.100
- For real?
- Oh, my gosh.

189
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.940
- Yeon Bo Ra!
- Yeon Bo Ra!

190
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.399
- Na Ra!
- Oh, no.

191
00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:26.860
Gosh, Na Ra!

192
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.950
(Shooting Range, Baseball Pitcher, Balloon Darts)

193
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.700
- Bo Ra!
- Na Ra!

194
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.909
Are they kids or what?

195
00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:38.740
Why are they going all out in a game?

196
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.909
- They're so childish.
- I know, right?

197
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.080
What do you think?

198
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.120
- Ta-Da!
- Ta-Da!

199
00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:47.419
- Hi, darn it.
- Look.

200
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.549
I don't know who's childish now.

201
00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:53.720
They're a lost cause. Don't you agree?

202
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.600
Darn it. This isn't the time to have fun.

203
00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:05.399
They're mad. They completely lost it.

204
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.880
Darn it.

205
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.509
I haven't been studying for days now. Will I be okay?

206
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.339
What if I forgot all of it?

207
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.220
Let's see.

208
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.849
A squared is B squared plus C squared...

209
00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:42.599
minus one. 2bc...

210
00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:44.390
Cosine...

211
00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:47.019
Come on. Remember it.

212
00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:48.859
Again.

213
00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:52.400
B squared is A squared plus C squared...

214
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.529
minus A...

215
00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:54.900
Are you even studying now?

216
00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:56.990
Why not hang out with the others?

217
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.369
Let's go relieve our stress.

218
00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:00.369
Darn it.

219
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.369
Is this really the time to do that?

220
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.160
Have you all gone crazy?

221
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:06.160
We should hurry up and check...

222
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.539
if the CSAT is really cancelled.

223
00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:09.170
I get that you're upset.

224
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.880
But just accept it.

225
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.420
And we'll probably take the CSAT next year.

226
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.630
Think of it as studying for another year.

227
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.980
"Another year?"

228
00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:27.809
That scumbag.

229
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.150
Only jerks like you have another chance.

230
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.900
You might have academies and private tutors.

231
00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.109
But I can't even afford to go to an academy.

232
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:38.819
How could you say that so easily?

233
00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:44.740
You started it.

234
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.750
What did I do? You always blame me.

235
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.789
You should've kept quiet.

236
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:49.539
- Move it.
- She's here.

237
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.250
Bo Ra.

238
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.130
It's okay. Losing is no big deal.

239
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.720
- Seriously?
- It hurts. Why did you hit me?

240
00:18:58.049 --> 00:18:59.089
Go ahead and tell her.

241
00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:01.299
Over there. There are darts too.

242
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.599
How about a revenge match?

243
00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.930
- Go for it.
- Let's do it.

244
00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:09.099
No, I'm good.

245
00:19:10.269 --> 00:19:11.650
- What is it, Bo Ra?
- Bo Ra!

246
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.150
- Bo Ra!
- Bo Ra's sulking!

247
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.230
- Bo Ra, wait for me.
- It's okay.

248
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.779
- Take the darts.
- Yeon Bo Ra.

249
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.359
- Yeon Bo Ra!
- Yeon Bo Ra!

250
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.950
- That's nice.
- Yeon Bo Ra!

251
00:19:22.069 --> 00:19:23.069
Yes! What?

252
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.539
- Let's go.
- Yes, come on.

253
00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:27.500
- You'll definitely win.
- He's right.

254
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.750
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

255
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.829
- Shoot!
- Do it.

256
00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:32.130
Don't worry. It's okay. Try it again.

257
00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.420
I fought with Soo Chul at the hospital.

258
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.380
Yeon Bo Ra! A mistake is okay.

259
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.420
What?

260
00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:41.549
Are you crazy?

261
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.009
Why did you bring this here?

262
00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:44.349
You should've gotten rid of it.

263
00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.809
I forgot to burn it.

264
00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:47.349
How could you forget that?

265
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.309
What if the guys find out we swapped it?

266
00:19:50.809 --> 00:19:52.769
Darn it. I've had enough.

267
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.690
What?

268
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.569
Deceiving the guys. I can't do it anymore.

269
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.150
So what? Should we come clean?

270
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.569
Do you think they'll be understanding?

271
00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:02.700
I don't know, darn it.

272
00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:05.160
Either way, this feels wrong.

273
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.329
Then what? Go back like this?

274
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.160
Should we run away? Is that it?

275
00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:14.579
Darn it.

276
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Hey.

277
00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:22.009
You look mental these days.

278
00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:24.890
Come to your senses.

279
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.759
Is someone in there?

280
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.150
Why?

281
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.740
I just thought I heard something.

282
00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.200
Were you with someone?

283
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.779
No, I was alone.

284
00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:49.450
Oh, I see.

285
00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:52.210
He died because of me.

286
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:56.539
Young Hoon also died because of me.

287
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.799
Do friends who get close to me die?

288
00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:11.019
Am I an unlucky punk?

289
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.849
Hey.

290
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.190
Did you call those things?

291
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.359
What?

292
00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:22.900
Did you call the spheres?

293
00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:26.660
Did you make us fight the spheres?

294
00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:28.700
(Bumper Car)

295
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.829
You didn't.

296
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:33.910
Young Hoon and Soo Chul...

297
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.000
didn't die because of you.

298
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.089
It's not because of you...

299
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.470
or anyone of us.

300
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.509
Why did I live so foolishly?

301
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.059
Gosh.

302
00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:56.019
We're all fools.

303
00:21:57.849 --> 00:21:59.859
We just signed the consent form as we were told.

304
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.730
Goodness.

305
00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:12.700
(Bumper Car)

306
00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:24.130
Why are you hesitating?

307
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.470
Just break it and take it. Nobody will know anyway.

308
00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:35.140
You really are frustrating.

309
00:22:58.329 --> 00:22:59.750
I was keeping it to smoke it on my way home...

310
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.880
after everything was over.

311
00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.130
Don't tell anyone.

312
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:04.750
Especially Kwon Il Ha.

313
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:13.140
I used to hate people who inconvenience others...

314
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.559
the most in the world.

315
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.230
My dad was like that.

316
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.769
That's why seeing you always irritated me.

317
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.859
But I was wrong.

318
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.779
It's not an inconvenience.

319
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.069
To be fair, it's normal for you to be slow at assembling a gun...

320
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.700
and be bad at shooting a gun.

321
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.710
Freezing when you see a monster.

322
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.539
Not being able to pass someone by when they're asking to be saved.

323
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.710
That's normal.

324
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.640
Why? Is what I'm saying all too obvious?

325
00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:00.140
I don't know what I'm saying either.

326
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.109
I'm good at shooting now.

327
00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:10.779
Yes, you're good at shooting a gun.

328
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.490
You know I'm a bit better though, right?

329
00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:14.779
Yes.

330
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.180
We wanted to take it with you. How disloyal of you.

331
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.720
You can't leave Duk Joong out during photo time.

332
00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:41.769
- Exactly. Let's go.
- Go.

333
00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:42.769
Wait up!

334
00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:43.940
Should we go too?

335
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.609
Sure.

336
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.319
- Let's take it. One, two.
- Come on.

337
00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:51.569
- Are we all in there?
- One, two, three.

338
00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:52.609
- Come here.
- Let's go.

339
00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:53.950
- Yes!
- Hey.

340
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.069
- Get out!
- Hey!

341
00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:56.240
- Okay.
- Yes!

342
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.529
- Oh, my.
- Did you fart?

343
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:59.329
- Duk Joong!
- Goodness!

344
00:24:59.329 --> 00:25:01.750
- Get out.
- Nice.

345
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.960
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

346
00:25:03.619 --> 00:25:04.869
- Okay!
- Okay!

347
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:07.000
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh, my.

348
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.460
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

349
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.470
(Life Four Cuts)

350
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.799
- What is this?
- Look.

351
00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.589
- Look at that.
- What is that?

352
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.099
- Are you some sort of goddess?
- Seriously. You look so good.

353
00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:20.220
- Goodness. You look so pretty.
- You look so pretty.

354
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.269
- Because I opened it...
- Really?

355
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.559
- What?
- Look at this.

356
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.769
Gosh. Kim Duk Joong.

357
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.849
- He does look cute.
- It turned out well.

358
00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:28.150
We should all take one together.

359
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.019
- Sounds nice.
- That sounds nice.

360
00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:31.730
- That sounds very nice.
- Seriously.

361
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.150
- Okay.
- Let's take one.

362
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.609
Do you think we can all fit?

363
00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:37.410
- It is a bit small.
- That's true.

364
00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:40.079
Chi Yeol. We can take it with your camcorder.

365
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.750
- That's true.
- Good idea.

366
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.660
- Can you take it?
- Okay.

367
00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:47.829
- He said he could.
- Yes!

368
00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:49.089
- Come here.
- Nice.

369
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.670
Guys. You're all in, right?

370
00:25:51.089 --> 00:25:52.170
- Let's go.
- Wait.

371
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.049
Where's Jang Soo and So Yeon?

372
00:25:55.589 --> 00:25:57.390
Right. Young Soo's not here either.

373
00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.849
Whatever. Let's take one and find them after.

374
00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:01.220
Chi Yeol. Are you ready?

375
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.470
Okay. One, two, three.

376
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.059
- Kimchi!
- Kimchi!

377
00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:06.190
Wait a second.

378
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.690
I have to clean out my memory card. Sorry.

379
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.730
- Come on.
- Come on.

380
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.900
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

381
00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:14.690
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

382
00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:16.029
My arms are going to fall off.

383
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:17.160
Wait.

384
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.490
What is this?

385
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.990
Why?

386
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.460
First, I'll convince Mom somehow.

387
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.259
No.

388
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.180
Retaking it won't do anything.

389
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.759
I'll get caught up anyway.

390
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.390
I won't be able to go to college. I'll be a failure forever.

391
00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:48.230
I'll end up like Mom and Dad.

392
00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:52.769
Goodness. Seriously.

393
00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:59.569
(Equipment Rental Fee, Hoe 1 dollar, Rain boots 2 dollars)

394
00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:01.869
Wait.

395
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.240
(The 2023 CSAT Proceeds as Planned. Cancellation Withdrawn.)

396
00:27:05.369 --> 00:27:07.579
It's not cancelled.

397
00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:09.289
It's not cancelled!

398
00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:12.170
I need to tell everyone right away.

399
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:14.670
Gosh. Look!

400
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.630
There's no way they would cancel the CSAT.

401
00:27:39.069 --> 00:27:40.200
What are you doing here alone?

402
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.119
Why are you standing watch here all by yourself?

403
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:44.950
Are you trying to show what a good student you are?

404
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.049
Sorry.

405
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.220
I think I wanted...

406
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.430
to protect you all like Mr. Lee,

407
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.720
but I'm nothing.

408
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.099
Hey.

409
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.319
We're still students.

410
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.819
How can you protect us?

411
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.369
I'll be 20 in a month.

412
00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:28.539
Do you think you're an adult as soon as you turn 20?

413
00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:32.119
How old do you have to be to become an adult, then?

414
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.670
Your age isn't important.

415
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:44.180
Taking responsibility for your actions. That's an adult.

416
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:47.680
Like Mr. Lee.

417
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.299
I miss him.

418
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.759
Me too.

419
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.680
I miss him.

420
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.569
Wait.

421
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.579
What is this? Gosh, Kim Chi Yeol. He's so clumsy.

422
00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:56.369
He left his camcorder.

423
00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.710
What? He didn't even turn it off.

424
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.599
(Guidelines for Restriction of Hospital Visits)

425
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:36.500
Sorry. I was the one who broke the walkie-talkie.

426
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:41.960
You all must be very surprised once you find out.

427
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.299
You'll be angry too.

428
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.650
When we were in school,

429
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:02.230
we had to study for the CSAT, study until late at night,

430
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.480
and go to academy.

431
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.400
I really hated it back then.

432
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:09.069
But...

433
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.160
thinking about it now,

434
00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:15.910
things were nice back then.

435
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.579
I just wanted...

436
00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:24.049
the war to end soon so we could go back to those times.

437
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.670
To do so, I need to get rid of all of them.

438
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.339
Those spheres. I'm going to get rid of them all.

439
00:31:32.009 --> 00:31:34.640
Those spheres that killed Woo Taek and Mr. Lee.

440
00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:38.180
All of them.

441
00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:42.559
Oh, no!

442
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.109
Take that!

443
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.220
No!

444
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.380
No!

445
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.900
That's a relief.

446
00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:37.119
What I mean is...

447
00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:38.160
I get it.

448
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.619
I get what you mean.

449
00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.450
So Yeon.

450
00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:20.950
You scared me.

451
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.579
What are you doing here?

452
00:33:23.829 --> 00:33:26.250
Look at this. The CSAT isn't cancelled.

453
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.210
- What are you talking about?
- Quick. Look at it.

454
00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:35.839
They're making a mistake.

455
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.759
The decision to cancel the CSAT has been withdrawn.

456
00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:40.140
If we leave the operation area, that's considered desertion, right?

457
00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:43.480
That means all of the certificates we received so far are all gone.

458
00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:46.190
So we need to tell everyone and go back to the operation area.

459
00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:51.859
Where are you going?

460
00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:58.200
This is an old newspaper.

461
00:33:58.529 --> 00:33:59.700
Get it together.

462
00:34:00.579 --> 00:34:01.579
What?

463
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.789
Really? I definitely saw it earlier.

464
00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:16.549
I definitely saw it earlier.

465
00:34:16.549 --> 00:34:19.469
Hey. I know you're obsessed with going to college,

466
00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.559
but how can you still talk about the CSAT in this situation?

467
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.690
No. I saw it earlier.

468
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.150
But I must've dropped it on my way here.

469
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.739
The CSAT hasn't been cancelled.

470
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.449
Really.

471
00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.159
Let go.

472
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.039
You want to follow Mr. Lee's words, don't you?

473
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.340
If so, we should see this operation through to the end.

474
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.469
Let go. You're hurting me.

475
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.179
Let go of me.

476
00:35:01.389 --> 00:35:02.719
Why do you keep avoiding me?

477
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.059
Why?

478
00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:09.099
Do I smell? Do I?

479
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.860
I'm better than Cho Jang Soo.

480
00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.780
If I go to a better school than Cho Jang Soo,

481
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.360
I can treat you even better.

482
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:17.780
Are you crazy?

483
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.570
What kind of nonsense is that?

484
00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:22.949
You don't know the seriousness of this situation.

485
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:28.159
I saw you and Cho Jang Soo kissing.

486
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.869
Is this the time to be kissing and playing around?

487
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.039
What are you saying?

488
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.300
Let go. Let go of me, you crazy bastard!

489
00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:46.059
So Yeon.

490
00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:47.980
So Yeon.

491
00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:53.110
So Yeon.

492
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320
So Yeon.

493
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.280
So Yeon.

494
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.110
So Yeon. Wake up, So Yeon. Please?

495
00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:04.409
So Yeon. Open your eyes. So Yeon.

496
00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:08.949
Oh, no.

497
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.130
So Yeon. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

498
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.380
Please open your eyes, So Yeon.

499
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.510
Please open your eyes, So Yeon.

500
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:30.519
You pervert.

501
00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:34.730
What is this smell? I keep smelling the spheres.

502
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.940
Their peculiar fishy smell.

503
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.539
You wench.

504
00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:53.670
You think you're better than me?

505
00:36:54.789 --> 00:36:56.380
Why do you look down on me?

506
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.420
Why don't you trust what I say?

507
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.309
Hey.

508
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.650
So Yeon.

509
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360
So Yeon?

510
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.949
Cha So Yeon.

511
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.019
Gosh. What am I doing?

512
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.940
Straighten up, Kwon Il Ha.

513
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.320
What is he doing?

514
00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:14.829
Goodness.

515
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.170
Are you crazy? I saw everything, you punk.

516
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.170
- Gosh. Are you insane?
- Saw what?

517
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.800
She passed out, so I was just helping her.

518
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.469
Don't be ridiculous, you jerk.

519
00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:32.719
Goodness. What's wrong with you?

520
00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:43.230
What's wrong with her?

521
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.400
- Did you do this?
- No! It wasn't me!

522
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.489
Goodness.

523
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:51.829
Cha So Yeon. Are you okay? Open your eyes.

524
00:38:51.949 --> 00:38:53.159
Goodness.

525
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.789
What's wrong with you?

526
00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:58.250
Hey, Cha So Yeon.

527
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.670
Oh, no. What do I do?

528
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:08.300
What am I supposed to do? Hey, Cha So Yeon.

529
00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:09.760
Cha So Yeon.

530
00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:18.309
- What are you doing?
- Are you going to tell?

531
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.940
Are you going to tell the others?

532
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.110
- If I do, what are you going to do?
- Don't tell.

533
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.610
If you do, I'll kill you.

534
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.239
If you tell them, my life is over.

535
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.699
I can't end it like this.

536
00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:36.449
- What?
- Gosh. Don't tell them!

537
00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:39.329
- Because of you, I...
- Okay.

538
00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:41.750
Okay. I won't tell them.

539
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.460
Really?

540
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.800
Yes. Really.

541
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.269
- Goodness, this punk.
- Oh, no!

542
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.530
- Punk.
- Oh, no.

543
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.659
- Jerk.
- Oh, no.

544
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.380
Oh, Cha So Yeon. Are you awake?

545
00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:34.510
It's me, Il Ha. Open your eyes!

546
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.849
Cha So Yeon.

547
00:40:37.099 --> 00:40:39.599
Cha So Yeon!

548
00:40:40.929 --> 00:40:42.019
Cha So Yeon.

549
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.440
You punk!

550
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.900
Goodness.

551
00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:56.829
- Yes!
- Oh, my.

552
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.329
- Let's go!
- How nice.

553
00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:00.619
You won't join us?

554
00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:01.789
Right?

555
00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:03.869
- Come on, Jang Soo.
- Get on.

556
00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:05.750
- Come and play.
- Hi, Jang Soo.

557
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.170
- Hi.
- Get on a horse.

558
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.800
- Cho Jang Soo. Come on.
- Come over here!

559
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.010
Why did we choose such a boring ride for the finale?

560
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.969
Why? It's not that bad.

561
00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:19.349
We're going in circles, so no one wins...

562
00:41:19.469 --> 00:41:20.849
or gets overtaken.

563
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:25.599
What?

564
00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.650
Cho Young Sin, you're pretty cool.

565
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.820
We're going in circles.

566
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.070
No one wins.

567
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.280
Or gets overtaken.

568
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:36.530
- Hey.
- What?

569
00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:38.030
Darn it.

570
00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:42.579
No. I will overtake you.

571
00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.789
Let's go, mustang! Giddy-up!

572
00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:46.880
Go!

573
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.460
I won't let you.

574
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.170
Go, my trusted steed!

575
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.219
Giddy-up!

576
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.760
Go!

577
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.889
- Wait.
- What was that?

578
00:41:58.429 --> 00:41:59.429
What was that sound?

579
00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:01.349
- A gun?
- It was gunshots.

580
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:02.429
What happened?

581
00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:21.489
- So Yeon.
- So Yeon!

582
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:24.329
So Yeon.

583
00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:28.710
So Yeon, wake up!

584
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:31.420
- Hey!
- What happened?

585
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.800
What happened to So Yeon?

586
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.670
What happened?

587
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.880
- What happened, So Yeon?
- There's blood!

588
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.010
Oh, no.

589
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.969
So Yeon. Cha So Yeon!

590
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.349
- So Yeon.
- Blood...

591
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.519
A sphere...

592
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.860
A sphere...

593
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.489
- A sphere attacked.
- What?

594
00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:00.989
So, a sphere...

595
00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:03.239
A sphere...

596
00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:06.289
A sphere suddenly attacked us.

597
00:43:06.619 --> 00:43:08.329
- A sphere?
- Where is it?

598
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:09.369
Where is it?

599
00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:10.539
Be on guard!

600
00:43:11.079 --> 00:43:12.170
Darn it.

601
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.380
A sphere attacked So Yeon?

602
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.469
No, what happened was,

603
00:43:20.469 --> 00:43:23.139
So Yeon suddenly collapsed.

604
00:43:23.139 --> 00:43:26.639
And a sphere tried to take her,

605
00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:28.559
so Il Ha tried to stop it,

606
00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:33.150
and the sphere dragged him into the water.

607
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.530
What are you talking about? Get your story straight!

608
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.320
Where's the sphere?

609
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.780
- It's over there.
- What's he on about?

610
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.989
Wait. Spheres are coming.

611
00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:47.949
What?

612
00:43:50.579 --> 00:43:52.420
There's a ton of them.

613
00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:53.789
What?

614
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.210
So Yeon.

615
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.550
- So Yeon.
- Get up.

616
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.969
- Shoot.
- What do we do?

617
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.800
Did our noise attract them?

618
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.139
Darn it.

619
00:44:04.139 --> 00:44:05.219
Kwon Il Ha.

620
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.599
- We have to go.
- What about Il Ha?

621
00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:08.769
We can't save him.

622
00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:11.230
He'll be dead by now.

623
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:16.820
Pull yourself together and answer me!

624
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.400
Where's Il Ha?

625
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.699
I'm so sorry, I tried to stop it.

626
00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:22.739
It was so fast and I couldn't do anything.

627
00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:24.030
Sorry, my bad.

628
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.619
What are you talking about?

629
00:44:27.989 --> 00:44:29.000
Kwon Il Ha!

630
00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:33.380
Kwon Il Ha!

631
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.539
Kwon Il Ha!

632
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.550
Il Ha!

633
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.050
- Il Ha.
- I tried to save him.

634
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.599
The water was so dark.

635
00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:49.219
- It was so dark and I...
- Young Soo.

636
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.559
Take your time. Start at the beginning.

637
00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:55.150
The water was so dark.

638
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.820
I couldn't see anything.

639
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.190
I saw what looked like Il Ha, so I tried to grab him.

640
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.530
- It was so slippery and...
- Guys, let's go!

641
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.360
We must go!

642
00:45:03.989 --> 00:45:06.280
- So Yeon. Get up.
- Wake up, So Yeon.

643
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.699
- You need to get up.
- Come on.

644
00:45:09.369 --> 00:45:10.369
Darn it.

645
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:12.829
So Yeon!

646
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:14.670
- We have to go.
- Are you okay?

647
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:15.670
Are you awake?

648
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.250
- Let's move it.
- So Yeon's awake.

649
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.750
- Get moving!
- So Yeon.

650
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.300
- Wait!
- Let's go!

651
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.010
Can we please wait?

652
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.550
- Darn it.
- Wait!

653
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.800
Let's go!

654
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.260
Oh, whatever.

655
00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:30.599
(Official Test Track)

656
00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:32.179
Hurry up!

657
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.480
Kook Young Soo!

658
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.190
- Let's go.
- Young Soo, hurry.

659
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.489
What should we do now?

660
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:33.500
Gosh...

661
00:46:35.869 --> 00:46:37.369
Kwon Il Ha, that jerk.

662
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.920
We have to go.

663
00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:40.349
So Yeon. Are you okay?

664
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.190
Can you walk?

665
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:44.900
Yes. I'm okay.

666
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.320
Hang in there.

667
00:47:49.989 --> 00:47:51.570
We have to go a little further.

668
00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:55.039
Can you not remember anything?

669
00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:56.909
The accident.

670
00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:04.920
She's concussed.

671
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.960
She needs to go indoors and rest.

672
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.130
Will she get better after a while?

673
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:10.719
It's not serious, is it?

674
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.719
I'm not sure.

675
00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:14.929
A light concussion shouldn't last.

676
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.349
So Yeon, tell me if you're too tired.

677
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.219
Guys, I don't think we can go any further.

678
00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.480
The detector isn't catching anything,

679
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:03.519
so let's spend the night there.

680
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.489
Are you okay, So Yeon?

681
00:49:36.679 --> 00:49:37.679
Are you okay?

682
00:49:44.139 --> 00:49:48.400
The detector didn't detect any spheres.

683
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.440
Darn it.

684
00:49:53.489 --> 00:49:55.530
We left Il Ha behind.

685
00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:06.289
Do you think he swam to safety?

686
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.130
Is there...

687
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.760
Is there a slight possibility?

688
00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:24.389
Let's look for him in the morning.

689
00:50:25.809 --> 00:50:28.610
Yes. Let's find his body at least.

690
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.190
It could be floating.

691
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.900
No way. It can't be.

692
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.949
I weighed him down with rocks. They can't find him.

693
00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:42.239
Yes.

694
00:50:42.949 --> 00:50:44.750
It's not right to just leave.

695
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.789
What should we tell...

696
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:52.500
his parents?

697
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.469
What if his body is floating?

698
00:50:58.929 --> 00:51:02.099
If they see the gunshot wounds, they'll know I shot him.

699
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:07.889
Let's not split up ever again.

700
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.480
I really...

701
00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.690
don't want to lose anyone else.

702
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.619
Darn it. What should I do?

703
00:52:06.409 --> 00:52:08.159
Did I do that bad a thing?

704
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.369
He tried to shoot me.

705
00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:13.170
It was self-defence.

706
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.880
If I didn't shoot him, he'd have shot me.

707
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:21.800
Even if we made it,

708
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.219
my life would end if he told people what I'd done.

709
00:52:29.269 --> 00:52:31.269
I did it to survive, didn't I?

710
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.599
To survive.

711
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:38.280
The scumbag.

712
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.909
He bullied and annoyed me for ages.

713
00:52:43.409 --> 00:52:46.030
It was my luck we were in the same class for two years.

714
00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:49.619
I wouldn't have to see him again once we graduated!

715
00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:52.750
He'd only get into a college that had openings left.

716
00:52:53.039 --> 00:52:55.079
It's better for society...

717
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.420
if I were to survive and not the likes of him.

718
00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.550
Right?

719
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.760
It's that witch Cha So Yeon's fault.

720
00:53:05.719 --> 00:53:07.679
She looks down on me.

721
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:23.650
My gosh.

722
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.949
Darn it.

723
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:30.449
Kook Young Soo.

724
00:53:34.619 --> 00:53:36.960
Stay there! Don't come closer!

725
00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.460
Don't come nearer.

726
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:40.670
How does it feel to be a murderer?

727
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:43.840
Now everyone will know.

728
00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:46.889
And you'll be screwed.

729
00:53:48.179 --> 00:53:50.179
I knew you'd end up like this.

730
00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:53.139
You pathetic loser.

731
00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:24.090
Darn it.

732
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.679
What? Young Soo?

733
00:54:30.929 --> 00:54:32.099
It can't be.

734
00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:34.269
- But...
- But what?

735
00:54:34.889 --> 00:54:35.980
What is it?

736
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:39.480
Did you see something?

737
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.230
Kook Young Soo.

738
00:54:45.739 --> 00:54:46.739
He acted weird.

739
00:54:49.699 --> 00:54:52.079
He talked crap about the CSAT happening.

740
00:54:53.869 --> 00:54:55.199
I tried to get away.

741
00:54:56.119 --> 00:54:57.250
Let go.

742
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.500
Let go of me, you crazy bastard!

743
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.670
When I woke up,

744
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:08.840
I saw Il Ha.

745
00:55:08.969 --> 00:55:10.260
It's me, Il Ha.

746
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:11.800
Open your eyes!

747
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:14.059
That's all I remember.

748
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.440
When I woke up again,

749
00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:21.059
you were around me.

750
00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:23.110
But...

751
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.230
the spheres...

752
00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:28.949
There weren't any.

753
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.869
What?

754
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:33.199
Are you sure?

755
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:35.789
Darn it.

756
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:42.420
I don't know what happened.

757
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.010
So Yeon. You should rest.

758
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.469
Get some rest, then take your time later...

759
00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:53.510
to think.

760
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:56.389
And...

761
00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.099
until then,

762
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:01.440
let's not...

763
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.860
suspect Young Soo too rashly.

764
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.530
Okay?

765
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.860
Let's go.

766
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.690
(Raising happy and caring talent)

767
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.610
Why did we come into Class 3-2?

768
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.530
Whose idea was it?

769
00:56:54.199 --> 00:56:55.239
You're right.

770
00:56:56.829 --> 00:57:00.000
I just noticed we're sitting in our usual seats.

771
00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:02.960
We are.

772
00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:06.380
I took my spot without thinking.

773
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.010
Soo Chul used to sit in front of me.

774
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.389
In Hye sat next to me.

775
00:57:17.389 --> 00:57:18.559
Young Hoon sat here.

776
00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:19.849
Darn it.

777
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:22.269
I'm alone in the back.

778
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.519
It feels weird.

779
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.860
It almost feels like...

780
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.650
Il Ha will barge in with a curse.

781
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:34.989
Don't you think they just went home?

782
00:57:36.869 --> 00:57:37.869
In Hye,

783
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:41.079
Woo Taek, Soo Chul, Il Ha.

784
00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:43.460
That they're not dead.

785
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.210
That we'll see them all again back at school.

786
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.500
Yes.

787
00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.090
Sitting around like this...

788
00:57:54.929 --> 00:57:56.590
makes it feel like we're in school.

789
00:57:59.179 --> 00:58:00.929
I want to go back.

790
00:58:00.929 --> 00:58:03.429
Me too. I wish we could go back in time.

791
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.769
Me too.

792
00:58:04.769 --> 00:58:08.110
Then I'll invent a time machine.

793
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:10.230
What?

794
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:11.230
Who, you?

795
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.360
First, I must get into KAIST.

796
00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:14.650
Seoul National University?

797
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.449
That would be better.

798
00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:18.280
- As if.
- You?

799
00:58:18.699 --> 00:58:20.409
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

800
00:58:20.989 --> 00:58:23.659
I'll take that to go back in time,

801
00:58:24.409 --> 00:58:26.789
and stop my parents from signing the consent form.

802
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:29.789
- Me too. I'll never sign it.
- No.

803
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:30.840
Not ever.

804
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:32.340
Never.

805
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.960
- Gosh, no.
- Never ever.

806
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:50.019
I remembered something.

807
00:58:50.019 --> 00:58:51.110
- What?
- What?

808
00:58:51.519 --> 00:58:53.230
What is it?

809
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.239
Young Soo...

810
00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.360
killed Il Ha.

811
00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.489
- What?
- What?

812
00:58:59.489 --> 00:59:00.530
- Young Soo...
- For real?

813
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:02.159
tried to sexually assault So Yeon.

814
00:59:02.159 --> 00:59:04.119
- What?
- No way.

815
00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:05.619
- Hey!
- Where is he?

816
00:59:05.619 --> 00:59:07.119
- For real?
- Find him!

817
00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:08.460
- What a jerk!
- Oh, gosh.

818
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.829
- How could he?
- Darn him!

819
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:11.250
- Let's kill him.
- Hey.

820
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:12.460
Don't stop me!

821
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.460
- He's a psycho!
- Let's get him!

822
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.760
Don't get so upset. Calm down.

823
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.219
The bastard!

824
00:59:18.219 --> 00:59:19.840
- How could he?
- Get him.

825
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.219
Let's do something.

826
00:59:21.219 --> 00:59:22.219
Keep still!

827
00:59:22.219 --> 00:59:23.809
- The bastard.
- Let's kill the jerk!

828
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:25.139
What a bastard!

829
00:59:25.139 --> 00:59:27.269
- We must do something!
- Darn it.

830
00:59:28.019 --> 00:59:29.900
Screw it. What do I do now?

831
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.360
What should I do?

832
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.280
I just wanted to survive.

833
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.989
I should've killed So Yeon sooner. The witch.

834
00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:44.079
Darn it. I'm doomed.

835
00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:45.159
Shoot.

836
01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.019
Spheres...

837
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.320
The spheres...

838
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.329
Guys.

839
01:00:25.909 --> 01:00:27.699
What do you want to do when you go home?

840
01:00:31.369 --> 01:00:34.590
The first thing I'll do is soak in a hot bath.

841
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.250
And wash myself thoroughly.

842
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.840
I'll feel clean and refreshed.

843
01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:43.139
I bet all the dirt will clog your sewer.

844
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.679
Yours will be worse.

845
01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:47.519
You could make an eraser with your dirt.

846
01:00:48.769 --> 01:00:49.809
Darn it.

847
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:53.230
I think...

848
01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:54.980
once I go home,

849
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.110
I'll forget everything else and sleep.

850
01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.449
I'll treat my parents better...

851
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.909
without getting so annoyed.

852
01:01:04.909 --> 01:01:05.949
Me too.

853
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.750
I always got told off for using my phone too much.

854
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.250
Now I've realized that I can live without it.

855
01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:16.539
I'll talk a lot with my parents when I go home.

856
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.880
That sounds nice.

857
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.800
I miss my mom.

858
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.889
What'll happen when we go home?

859
01:01:25.469 --> 01:01:26.639
Who knows.

860
01:01:28.599 --> 01:01:29.969
Will we be able...

861
01:01:30.889 --> 01:01:33.440
to return to our normal lives?

862
01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:38.440
Things will be a bit different.

863
01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.780
Maybe our parents...

864
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.530
will stop nagging at us to study and get into good universities.

865
01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:47.449
No way.

866
01:01:47.449 --> 01:01:51.199
Gosh, I wanted to get a nose job before going to university.

867
01:01:51.199 --> 01:01:53.659
- Hey!
- Hello there.

868
01:01:54.039 --> 01:01:57.539
Ms. So Yeon. In my opinion, even if you have a higher nose,

869
01:01:57.539 --> 01:02:00.300
your other features... I doubt your nose is the issue here.

870
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.969
And your own face? Do you want a beating?

871
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:04.219
I'm tired of this relationship.

872
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.389
Me too.

873
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.269
When I go to university, I'll slack for a few months without studying.

874
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:15.519
I'll have fun going to blind dates and field trips.

875
01:02:16.019 --> 01:02:18.230
I'll let loose by trying everything.

876
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.480
Aren't you the only senior who enjoys himself freely?

877
01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:22.860
Don't act like you've been restrained.

878
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.570
As a senior, I'm trying to enjoy despite the stress.

879
01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:28.909
I'll be free and happy in university. It's not the same.

880
01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:29.989
- That's right.
- Come on.

881
01:02:30.239 --> 01:02:34.159
After all we've been through, how can you still think of college?

882
01:02:34.159 --> 01:02:35.659
I know, right?

883
01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:39.630
In any case, I hope we go back to Seoul soon.

884
01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.670
I'm sick of this...

885
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:45.219
and hope the stupid war ends soon.

886
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.010
- Gosh.
- I'm so sick of it.

887
01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.179
Goodness.

888
01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:53.559
If we get to go back to Seoul,

889
01:02:55.429 --> 01:02:56.599
no matter...

890
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.019
what happens when we're back,

891
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.320
let's have faith in each other...

892
01:03:02.519 --> 01:03:03.650
and protect one another.

893
01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:09.449
Okay.

894
01:03:19.539 --> 01:03:22.460
- I'll be nicer to you.
- Me too.

895
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.219
By the way, where's Young Soo?

896
01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:30.840
- Is he in the toilet?
- Beats me.

897
01:03:31.219 --> 01:03:34.059
I haven't seen him for some time. Where did he go?

898
01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:38.889
I'll look for him. We should also take turns keeping watch.

899
01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:41.269
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

900
01:03:42.769 --> 01:03:44.650
- He said to take turns.
- Keep watch.

901
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.190
- I'll go.
- My gloves are all wet.

902
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.739
- Gosh.
- Ae Seol, let's go.

903
01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:56.329
Jang Soo!

904
01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:58.000
No, stop!

905
01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.289
The guns! Get your guns!

906
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.480
Gosh, Chi Yeol. Had a sweet dream?

907
01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.530
- Where are the guys?
- What about them?

908
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.030
- We have to go soon.
- Do that again.

909
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:37.159
- One more time.
- What was that?

910
01:04:38.199 --> 01:04:40.659
- My goodness.
- Stop that!

911
01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:43.630
- Oh, my goodness!
- My gosh.

912
01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:45.380
- What is this?
- What are you looking at?

913
01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.460
What's that?

914
01:04:50.969 --> 01:04:53.969
- Oh, my.
- No way.

915
01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:58.679
- Catch me.
- Gosh.

916
01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:00.769
Chi Yeol, are you still half-asleep?

917
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.230
Why do you look so dazed and silly?

918
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.019
Oh.

919
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.280
I must've dozed off by accident.

920
01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:14.739
Accident, my foot. Wipe your saliva first.

921
01:05:16.659 --> 01:05:19.949
My, it smells nice and musty.

922
01:05:20.659 --> 01:05:22.789
Hey, what happened?

923
01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:24.079
Is the war...

924
01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.380
over?

925
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.090
What about the spheres?

926
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:33.630
Chi Yeol.

927
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.389
What nonsense are you spouting?

928
01:05:38.469 --> 01:05:39.469
Oh, dear.

929
01:05:42.389 --> 01:05:43.440
I mean...

930
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.650
- I had a strange dream.
- What kind of strange dream?

931
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.690
We were hunted by spheres.

932
01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.949
But...

933
01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:57.829
I'm glad that everyone's alive.

934
01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:00.869
Gosh. I'm even more glad for you.

935
01:06:01.159 --> 01:06:02.409
Seriously, poor you.

936
01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:04.670
Left, left, right!

937
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.460
Hey, that's mine.

938
01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:09.880
- Seriously, Im Woo Taek!
- It's not me.

939
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.920
Hey, Chi Yeol.

940
01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:14.719
Kim Chi Yeol.

941
01:06:18.389 --> 01:06:19.510
Kim Chi Yeol!

942
01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:21.849
Wake up, Chi Yeol.

943
01:06:25.389 --> 01:06:26.809
Chi Yeol, please.

944
01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.110
Wake up, please.

945
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:47.460
Come on, Kim Duk Joong. Please.

946
01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:56.550
Duk Joong!

947
01:06:57.719 --> 01:06:59.219
Wake up, please.

948
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.769
Wake up. I'm begging you.

949
01:07:04.599 --> 01:07:05.679
Let's go.

950
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.690
Come with me. Please.

951
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:13.730
Duk Joong, please wake up.

952
01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:20.949
Oh, my goodness!

953
01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:25.619
- Jang Soo!
- No!

954
01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:27.920
Jang Soo.

955
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.500
I'm sorry.

956
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.800
But I have to go to university.

957
01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:43.179
Oh, my!

958
01:07:43.599 --> 01:07:45.099
- What?
- Young Soo, please.

959
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:47.309
How could you...

960
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.650
It was you.

961
01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.119
Chi Yeol!

962
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.789
- Please!
- Oh, no.

963
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.179
Hurry, run!

964
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.220
Come on!

965
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.819
You bastard!

966
01:08:42.909 --> 01:08:44.319
Please!

967
01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:56.250
My gosh.

968
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.010
Help.

969
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:03.800
Wake up, Chi Yeol.

970
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:07.510
Chi Yeol, please.

971
01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.109
Bo Ra.

972
01:09:21.489 --> 01:09:22.779
Come on.

973
01:09:24.949 --> 01:09:27.409
Go. Run away, quick.

974
01:09:28.949 --> 01:09:30.369
Please go.

975
01:09:30.619 --> 01:09:32.539
Bo Ra, please don't.

976
01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.750
Duk Joong.

977
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.920
Wake up, please. Wake up.

978
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.840
Duk Joong. I'm begging you.

979
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.510
I can't.

980
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.930
Please go already.

981
01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:55.729
Bo Ra.

982
01:09:57.399 --> 01:09:58.479
Bo Ra.

983
01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:14.289
Please, don't.

984
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.170
Don't.

985
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.920
Help! Stop it.

986
01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.840
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

987
01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:26.130
This isn't like you, right?

988
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.180
Please, I beg you.

989
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.310
Will we go?

990
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.399
Yes, let's go home together.

991
01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.020
It'll be all right. Let's go home together,

992
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.649
Young Soo.

993
01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:58.380
No!

994
01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:21.109
No...

995
01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:24.029
Stop it. Young Soo! Please.

996
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:27.819
Come on. Why are you doing this?

997
01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:31.449
Put the gun down. I beg you.

998
01:11:32.029 --> 01:11:34.579
Please come to your senses!

999
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.590
I didn't want to do this either.

1000
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.880
I wished I could have...

1001
01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:49.220
a future to dream of.

1002
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.100
I had no choice.

1003
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.390
This darn war...

1004
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.939
ruined my life.

1005
01:12:07.399 --> 01:12:08.489
It's all ruined.

1006
01:12:09.609 --> 01:12:10.779
It's all over!

1007
01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.420
I'm sorry.

1008
01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:39.010
What should I do?

1009
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We made...

1010
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.130
a promise.

1011
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.470
I'm sorry.

1012
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.399
Sorry, everyone.

1013
01:15:34.069 --> 01:15:35.399
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:15:45.289 --> 01:15:47.710
(Things we want to do after the war.)

1015
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.710
(Eating an apple that mom cuts for me.)

1016
01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.710
(Go see flowers with grandma.)

1017
01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:53.710
(I want spicy tuna too. Super spicy.)

1018
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.710
(I want to eat tteokbbokki.)

1019

(Let's do a pyjama party at my place.)

1020
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.720
(I would love that.)

1021
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.060
CSAT resumed after two years.

1022
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:11.350
Experts predict that the test will be very difficult.

1023
01:16:11.649 --> 01:16:14.399
The controversy over extra points for CSAT related to serving duty...

1024
01:16:14.399 --> 01:16:17.189
hasn't settled yet, and CSAT will still be held.

1025
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:19.899
There are growing concerns over this issue.

1026
01:16:19.899 --> 01:16:22.279
- You can do it!
- Go for it!

1027
01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:24.409
We oppose extra points!

1028
01:16:24.409 --> 01:16:26.329
- We oppose it!
- We oppose it!

1029
01:16:26.329 --> 01:16:28.289
Abolish the benefits!

1030
01:16:28.289 --> 01:16:30.000
- Abolish it!
- Abolish it!

1031
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.920
- You can do it!
- Let's go!

1032
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.710
- Abolish it!
- Abolish it!

(Yes)

1041
01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.710
After the incident,

1042
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.300
in less than two months, they developed a new weapon,

1043
01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.260
and ridiculously, only in a few weeks,

1044
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.970
Almost all the spheres which we risked our lives against...

1045
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:28.890
were eliminated.

1046
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600
Now,

1047
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:35.859
I am sitting in a CSAT test room...

1048
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:38.859
where my friends couldn't make it to.

1049
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:03.420
No!

(Divisional commander)

1053
01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.819
Why has Young Soo gone mad?

1054
01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.659
If the war could end so easily,

1055
01:18:28.449 --> 01:18:30.119
why did we have to fight it?

1056
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.789
Did I really need extra points?

1057
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:40.130
Why did I want to go to college?

1058
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.090
It's just that everyone goes there.

1059
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:48.140
I might be left behind if I don't go to college.

1060
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.729
What I learned from the painful war...

1061
01:18:55.979 --> 01:18:58.020
was something they don't teach at school.

1062
01:18:59.939 --> 01:19:03.319
To survive, you don't need to beat your friend next to you.

1063
01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:05.779
You have to help out...

1064
01:19:06.699 --> 01:19:08.159
and protect each other.

1065
01:19:10.909 --> 01:19:12.869
What really matters in life...

1066
01:19:13.199 --> 01:19:15.619
wasn't CSAT or going to college.

1067
01:19:17.079 --> 01:19:20.539
Rather, it was the warmth of my friends.

1068
01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.340
However, after all,

1069
01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:28.680
we failed to protect each other and that was it for us.

Maybe, what we really had to fight against...

1072
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.810
wasn't spheres,

1073
01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.560
but something else, I wonder.

- No.

No, I'm not.

1083
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.569
- I don't know.
- You put in a lot of effort.

1084
01:20:28.569 --> 01:20:29.949
This is the key.

1085
01:20:29.949 --> 01:20:32.279
It's me.

1086
01:20:32.279 --> 01:20:33.779

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.430
You look gorgeous.

1097
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.930
You look like Lee Hyo Lee.

1098
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:59.930
You look like IU.

1099
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.850
IU?

1100
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:04.689
Come on!

1101
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.029
- Are you...
- Song Hye Kyo?

1102
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:10.859
Don't say that.

1103
01:21:11.319 --> 01:21:13.779
Shall I put this kind of makeup on and do my hair this way?

1104
01:21:13.779 --> 01:21:14.779
Yes.

1105
01:21:15.159 --> 01:21:16.239
I love it.

1106
01:21:17.079 --> 01:21:19.619
Who helped you with that makeup?

1107
01:21:19.619 --> 01:21:21.460
My grandma did.

1108
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.920
It's because you look so pretty.

1109
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920
You look so nice.

1110
01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.590
This is my grandma's favourite colour.

1111
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.720
I think your grandma knows the perfect colour for you.

1112
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.840
Your skin tone looks bright especially today,

1113
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.390
like your future.

1114
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.350
Ouch, your nose is so sharp.

1115
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.060
I hope I look good in the graduation photo.

1116
01:21:44.439 --> 01:21:45.560
Don't worry. Just focus.

1117
01:21:45.939 --> 01:21:46.939
Goddess.

1118
01:21:47.109 --> 01:21:48.779
They totally went crazy.

1119
01:21:51.319 --> 01:21:54.859
I wrote it in the group chat of our class.

1120
01:21:55.529 --> 01:21:58.159
It's the popularity vote for girls in our class.

1121
01:21:58.529 --> 01:22:00.289
- Did you all see it?
- Hey.

1122
01:22:00.579 --> 01:22:02.079
What were you thinking?

1123
01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:04.329
The girls will go mad if they find this out.

1124
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.090
That's why...

1125
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:10.590
this is a secret among us.

1126
01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.050
- I voted.
- Did you?

1127
01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.510
Good job.

1128
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.060
- I did it.
- You too, Jang Soo?

1129
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.140
Me too.

1130
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.390
Look at you, Young Soo!

1131
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:25.479
Do Soo Chul.

1132
01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:26.939
You...

1133
01:22:27.689 --> 01:22:30.229
Whom did you pick?

1134
01:22:31.109 --> 01:22:32.189
It's a secret.

1135
01:22:32.649 --> 01:22:34.449
I can definitely tell that you picked Lee Na Ra.

1136
01:22:34.739 --> 01:22:36.199
You punk!

1137
01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:38.239
- You picked No Ae Seol.
- I didn't vote.

1138
01:22:38.239 --> 01:22:39.909
- No Ae Seol.
- I didn't pick anyone.

1139
01:22:39.909 --> 01:22:41.199
What about you?

1140
01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:43.449
- I didn't.
- Be quiet.

1141
01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.289
It's useless to vote now.

1142
01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:51.300
Girls totally transform when they go to college.

1143
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.920
How do you know?

1144
01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.050
My older sister.

1145
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.810
You have an older sister. I see.

1146
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:02.850
- There comes the teacher.
- Come with me.

1147
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:05.479
Look at your lips.

1148
01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:06.850
Hello, Ms. Choi!

1149
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:09.359
Are you entering a beauty pageant?

1150
01:23:10.649 --> 01:23:12.020
Are you in a fight or what?

1151
01:23:12.479 --> 01:23:14.279
All your makeup looks so awkward.

1152
01:23:14.279 --> 01:23:16.109
- Don't wear it.
- What?

1153
01:23:17.779 --> 01:23:18.989
Just like Yu Jung,

1154
01:23:18.989 --> 01:23:20.869
it's best to take a picture just the way you are.

1155
01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:22.949
Don't you think so?

1156
01:23:22.949 --> 01:23:25.750
That idiot.

1157
01:23:26.539 --> 01:23:28.119
Watch your mouth.

1158
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:32.250
Why?

1159
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.550
Gosh.

1160
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:36.090
It took her two hours to do her hair...

1161
01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:37.630
and an hour for the makeup today.

1162
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:38.970
Two hours?

1163
01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.680
Just shut your mouth.

1164
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.470
Gosh.

1165
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.560
Yu Jung!

1166
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.729
Yu Jung.

1167
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:48.689
Gosh, Yu Jung!

1168
01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.020
You idiot.

1169
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:53.069
Goodness.

1170
01:23:53.069 --> 01:23:54.109
Do you have eyes?

1171
01:23:54.109 --> 01:23:56.239
Why are students wearing makeup?

1172
01:23:56.439 --> 01:23:57.489
Go and remove it now!

1173
01:23:57.489 --> 01:23:59.319
Is that our teacher?

1174
01:23:59.319 --> 01:24:01.279
Block him!

1175
01:24:02.199 --> 01:24:03.989
Get out quickly!

1176
01:24:03.989 --> 01:24:05.239
- I'm so busy.
- What do we do?

1177
01:24:05.239 --> 01:24:06.949
What are you doing?

1178
01:24:07.289 --> 01:24:09.000
Let me in.

1179
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.250
Careful!

1180
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:11.880
Move over, you punks!

1181
01:24:13.289 --> 01:24:14.300
Sit down!

1182
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.960
Come on!

1183
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.180
(Duty After School)

1184
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:44.989
- Goodness.
- Tell me.

1185
01:26:45.859 --> 01:26:47.909
Who ordered you...

1186
01:26:48.659 --> 01:26:49.909
to do something tough like this?

1187
01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:51.699
Mr. Lee, of course!

1188
01:26:52.409 --> 01:26:54.619
I miss my mom!

1189
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:08.180
Wait. What is this?

1190
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.470
This is very heavy

1191
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:13.180
It's all lined up

1192
01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.850
The soldiers gave us weapons

1193
01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:16.939
We haven't seen them except for in games so far

1194
01:27:16.939 --> 01:27:18.060
Can we really use this?

1195
01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.609
- If we join the army?
- Something this heavy?

1196
01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:21.569
In games, we just go back and forth

1197
01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:23.649
Everything is possible by moving your hands a bit

1198
01:27:23.649 --> 01:27:24.689
- Bang!
- Bang!

1199
01:27:30.319 --> 01:27:32.029
A strange sound I haven't heard

1200
01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:33.489
I wake up by that sound

1201
01:27:33.659 --> 01:27:35.619
They wake me up so early, I run like crazy

1202
01:27:35.619 --> 01:27:36.960
I get exhausted after that

1203
01:27:37.079 --> 01:27:38.539
When would this end?

1204
01:27:38.539 --> 01:27:40.289
Do I have to eat this?

1205
01:27:40.289 --> 01:27:42.000
I wish the snack bar is open

1206
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.750
I can't stand this food anymore

1207
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.130
- Boom - Boom

1208
01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.140
They tell us to build up physical strength

1209
01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:53.850
- We really don't want to do this - We really don't want to do this

1210
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.640
They tell us to run more if we want to survive

1211
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.479
If we run even more, our lungs might burst out

1212
01:27:57.729 --> 01:27:59.149
What can I even protect?

1213
01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:01.109
Someone who loses rock-paper-scissors should do it

1214
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.899
Anyway, someone has to do it

1215
01:28:02.899 --> 01:28:04.609
Mr. Commander is ordering us

1216
01:28:04.609 --> 01:28:05.989
Protect even if it's hard for you

1217
01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.529
But when would it end?

1218
01:28:07.529 --> 01:28:09.319
It's natural for us to do it for other people, they say

1219
01:28:09.319 --> 01:28:11.069
But why does it have to be us?

1220
01:28:11.069 --> 01:28:13.159
Cowardly people in high ranks

1221
01:28:13.159 --> 01:28:14.659
All seem to have run away

1222
01:28:14.659 --> 01:28:16.000
- Even adults can't do this - Even adults can't do this

1223
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.539
- Why are they telling us to do it?
- Why are they telling us to do it?

1224
01:28:17.539 --> 01:28:18.710
- Why?
- Why?

1225
01:28:20.289 --> 01:28:21.750
Hey, No Ae Seol!

1226
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.039
Gosh, where is she?

1227
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.390
Gosh.

1228
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.470
If we go to college after this

1229
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:35.180
Let's do everything

1230
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.890
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1231
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:38.810
We'll become adults soon

1232
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.310
If we go to college after this

1233
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.850
Let's do everything

1234
01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:43.560
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1235
01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.569
We'll become adults soon

1236
01:28:45.569 --> 01:28:47.189
- If we go to college after this - If we go to college after this

1237
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:48.819
- Let's do everything - Let's do everything

1238
01:28:48.819 --> 01:28:50.529
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1239
01:28:50.529 --> 01:28:52.529
- We'll become adults soon - We'll become adults soon

1240
01:28:52.529 --> 01:28:54.029
- If we go to college after this - If we go to college after this

1241
01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.659
- Let's do everything - Let's do everything

1242
01:28:55.659 --> 01:28:57.409
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1243
01:28:57.409 --> 01:28:59.539
- We'll become adults soon - We'll become adults soon

1244
01:28:59.619 --> 01:29:01.420
Sing a military song.

1245
01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.500
The song is...

1246
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.630
- Born as - Born as

1247
01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.210
- a 12th grader - a 12th grader

1248
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:09.550
- We have darn so much work to do - We have darn so much work to do

1249
01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.720
- You and I protecting the country - You and I protecting the country

1250
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.350
- Do not say it's an honour - Do not say it's an honour

1251
01:29:21.979 --> 01:29:24.189
Who changed the military song and sang it?

1252
01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.109
I guess everyone has so much energy.

1253
01:29:31.319 --> 01:29:32.949
Gather in the school yard in five minutes.

1254
01:29:33.279 --> 01:29:34.489
- What?
- Excuse me?

1255
01:29:34.819 --> 01:29:36.949
- Nonsense.
- That's impossible.

1256
01:29:36.949 --> 01:29:38.329
Are you crazy?

1257
01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:39.409
It's nonsense.

1258
01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:41.329
Gosh.

1259
01:29:41.539 --> 01:29:42.920
Only five people who get there first.

1260
01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.170
- Five?
- Five.

1261
01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.210
Run!

1262
01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:47.000
Run!

1263
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.210
- Come with me!
- Darn it!

1264
01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.930
(School motto)

1265
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:00.180
(Protect even if it's hard for you.)

1266
01:30:05.729 --> 01:30:08.109
(But when would it end?)

1267
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:10.399
(If we go to college after this)

1268
01:30:10.399 --> 01:30:12.529
(Let's do everything)

1269
01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:23.329
If we go to college after this

1270
01:30:23.329 --> 01:30:24.920
Let's do everything

1271
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:27.420
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1272
01:30:56.569 --> 01:30:58.489
If we go to college after this

1273
01:30:58.489 --> 01:31:00.619
Let's do everything

1274
01:31:00.619 --> 01:31:03.289
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1275
01:31:03.289 --> 01:31:05.789
We'll become adults soon

1276
01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.020
You, there...

1277
01:31:31.439 --> 01:31:33.149
Shall we disclose it?

1278
01:31:36.529 --> 01:31:37.659
Open the door!

1279
01:31:38.069 --> 01:31:40.369
How dare you make fun of the commander?

1280
01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:45.289
You were so cool!

1281
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.289
Again!

1282
01:31:47.289 --> 01:31:51.840
- Again!
- Again!

1283
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.760
- Again!
- Again!

1284
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.430
- Again!
- Again!
