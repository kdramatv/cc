It's okay now. All the spheres have been killed.

4
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.030
What happened?

5
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.879
Is this...

6
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.760
a dream?

7
00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.779
I think they also have survivors.

8
00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:10.158
There are boys too.

9
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.778
- I told you.
- They have many people.

10
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.200
Don't step on her.

11
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.830
Don't step on her.

12
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.080
Hey.

13
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.709
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.259
Don't step on my friend.

15
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.429
Don't step on her.

16
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.599
My friend...

17
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.310
Don't step on my friend.

18
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.110
Don't step on her!

19
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.360
Don't step on her!

20
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.280
Oh, gosh.

21
00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.039

- I don't know.

Are there any?

Darn it.

29
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.040
- Gosh.
- Here...

30
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.290
Excuse me?

31

(Shelter 8, Maesong-Si)

32
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.170
Mr. Lee.

33
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.670
There are no signs of spheres.

34
00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.100

Gosh.

37
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.700
It stinks.

38
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.730
Any survivors?

39
00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.489
It seems everyone's dead here.

40
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.530
I don't think there are any survivors.

41
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.829
I wonder if my parents are okay.

42
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.629
Guys, check this place.

43
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.650
This must've been a dormitory.

44
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.840
You kids are...

45
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.960
the only survivors.

46
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.590
We were told to deliver supplies to the shelter.

47
00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.470
But when we arrived...

48
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.439
- What about the person in charge?
- We don't know.

49
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.689
He disappeared.

50
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.569
Why did you stay here...

51
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.280
without the commander in charge?

52
00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.069
We were told to wait.

53
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.989
That's why we waited.

54
00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.540
We did as we were told.

55
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.499
So why...

56
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.429
It must be very hard,

57
00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:27.270
but please calm down.

58
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.020
We'll talk again once things are sorted out.

59
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.980
Okay...

60
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.069
Yu Jung, take care of them.

61
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.199
Okay.

62
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.499
Aren't you hungry?

63
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.340
Do you want something to eat?

64
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.739
- One, two, three.
- All right.

65
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:26.869
You're not...

66
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:30.869
Kim Dong Hoon, a senior at Hamil High School.

67
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.460

- Jang Seung Hee.
- Jang...

71
00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:13.290
Did you...

72
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.619
see her eyes earlier?

73
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:19.999
They were unfocused.

74
00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:22.590
Completely blank.

75
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:27.590
It is just dreadful.

76
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.439
If I had been left alone,

77
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.189
would I have become like them?

78
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.189
Will we be able to survive?

79
00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:09.679
This small-sized shelter...

80
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.809
was devastated as if there was a surprise attack.

81
00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:16.848
Shelters were set up in the outskirts of the city...

82
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:19.189
where medium spheres don't appear in the first place.

83
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.270
Besides, there are no traces of medium spheres falling.

84
00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:26.319
I wonder how this place was raided by smaller spheres.

85
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.569
Spheres looking for prey swarmed in here.

86
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.540
How did they know that the shelter was here?

87
00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.459
Mr. Lee.

88
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.459
Ae Seol might cause big trouble at this rate.

89
00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:48.719
She was already weird, but it's gotten worse now.

90
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.300
Something might actually happen.

91
00:09:51.849 --> 00:09:54.179
Don't worry about her.

92
00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:57.559
She's doing good enough, and she will continue to do so.

93
00:09:57.809 --> 00:10:00.189
You don't know much about her.

94
00:10:02.109 --> 00:10:03.819
Just don't regret it later.

95
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:10.609
It's because of No Ae Seol, that darn wench.

96
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.370
Bo Ra.

97
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.630
There are no spheres.

98
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.469
There are no spheres.

99
00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:33.760
No spheres.

100
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.099
Gosh.

101
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.650
This is too bad.

102
00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:45.819
I heard their commander-in-chief ran away.

103
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:50.949
Thank goodness, we have Mr. Lee.

104
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240
I know.

105
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.750
You must be starving. Eat up.

106
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.949
- No way.
- Hey.

107
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.510
What are you doing?

108
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.189
Why are you holding a rifle?

109
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.870
What are you doing?

110
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.949
I...

111
00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.579
ran away.

112
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.829
My friends...

113
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:31.550
They asked me for help.

114
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.550
But I...

115
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.890
ran away alone.

116
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.599
They all died.

117
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.689
No.

118
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:49.689
It's not your fault.

119
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.359
It was the same for me.

120
00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.359
When my friends died,

121
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.740
I was busy running away.

122
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.579
It's never your fault.

123
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.000
Please put the rifle down.

124
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.050
It's dangerous, that's why.

125
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.589
Yoon Seo.

126
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:31.819
Please put the rifle down.

127
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.240
Don't come close.

128
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.579
Your name...

129
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.040
is Yoon Seo, right?

130
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.999
Yes.

131
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.420
I know...

132
00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:52.880
you've suffered a lot in fear.

133
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.589
From now on,

134
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.390
we'll protect you.

135
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640
Put down...

136
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.270
the rifle.

137
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.819
Yoon Seo.

138
00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:16.530
Please put the gun down.

139
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:18.900
Please...

140
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.959
You said it was okay.

141
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.890
That we just had to do as we were told.

142
00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:50.809
That we should wait.

143
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.650
I know you'll run away again.

144
00:14:55.939 --> 00:14:56.979
- Yoon Seo.
- Stop.

145
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.939
Extra points?

146
00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:04.160
What's the big deal about all that?

147
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:07.370
It's merely nothing!

148
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.290
I don't believe you anymore. Because of you people...

149
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.839
Because of you adults, everyone died.

150
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.260
My friends...

151
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.219
They're all dead.

152
00:15:21.469 --> 00:15:24.890
You killed them all!

153
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.140
No!

154
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.809
- What was that?
- Darn it.

155
00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:31.979
What was that sound?

156
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.188
- What?
- Wasn't that a gunshot?

157
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:35.270
- Hold on.
- Was it shot in this building?

158
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.990
Darn it.

159
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.420

161
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.510
- Gosh.
- What do we do?

162
00:16:08.929 --> 00:16:10.808
Wake up, Won Bin.

163
00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:11.890

164
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.599

- Go get the blood-stopper!

- Yeon Ju, the blood-stopper!
- Won Bin.

167
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.780
Quickly!

168
00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:24.109
- Oh, my!
- Go get it quickly.

169
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.990
Darn it.

170
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:29.120

171
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.160

No...

00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:40.800

177

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.819
He...

190
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.040
Is he asleep?

191
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.790
Mr. Lee.

192
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.050
Is he okay?

193
00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:30.129
Fortunately, the bullet went through his shoulder.

194
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.429
He's not going to die.

195
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.089
Oh, goodness.

196
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.930
But he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

197
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.559
I'm all good,

198
00:19:45.609 --> 00:19:47.519
so don't worry.

199
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.190
Won Bin, are you okay?

200
00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:53.069
Gosh, I'm telling you I am.

201
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.290
- Don't get up.
- Thank you.

202
00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:04.579
You guys should go now.

203
00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:07.339
- Duk Joong, what time is it?
- What?

204
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.800
It's 10pm.

205
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.129
It's time to give him painkillers.

206
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.760
Leave that to me. Thanks.

207
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.638
I'm not going. I want to stay by his side.

208
00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:22.058
- Let's just go already.
- Why?

209
00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:24.730
- Are you sure he's okay?
- He will be all right.

210
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.309
I don't want to go.

211
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.649
Gosh.

212
00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:36.659
Oh, goodness. Mr. Lee...

213
00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:39.530
Please do it gently.

214
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.040
I'm already holding myself back from wanting to throw you a punch.

215
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.210
You were in no position to take that bullet for me.

216
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.839
If something bad happens to you,

217
00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:56.760
the kids will be left without you.

218
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.430
I can't take care of them alone.

219
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.569
Don't blame...

220
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.030
that girl too much.

221
00:21:15.569 --> 00:21:17.409
She must've been...

222
00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.490
confused and terrified.

223
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.409
She'd believed that the adults would protect her,

224
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.000
so she must've felt betrayed.

225
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.379
I used to be like them as well.

226
00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:35.589
Then now what?

227
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.639
I'll do the best I can.

228
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.139
How did it go?

229
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.599
How's Mr. Kim?

230
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440
He's all right.

231
00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:56.399
- Goodness.
- What a relief.

232
00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:04.159
Guys, what if they end up...

233
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.868
shooting us too?

234
00:22:05.869 --> 00:22:08.079
Hey, lower your voice.

235
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.629
They might hear you.

236
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500
Gosh.

237
00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:16.509
I'm just anxious, that's why.

238
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.550
You really need to watch your tongue.

239
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.349
But I understand her in a sense.

240
00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:25.849
It was like she took the words...

241
00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:27.930
right out of my mouth.

242
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.700
Mr. Lee wants to see us all.

243
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.500
As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, we will withdraw...

244
00:22:50.829 --> 00:22:51.918
and return to the camp.

245
00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.039
- What?
- Can we do that?

246
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.089
What about the mission?

247
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.379
I can't guarantee your safety here.

248
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.050
We can't even figure out how many spheres are out there.

249
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.760
And if they attack us all together,

250
00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:06.720
we won't be able to handle them.

251
00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:08.980
Look, Mr. Lee.

252
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.099
With what happened last time,

253
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.690
won't you get in trouble if you keep disobeying orders?

254
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.649
I've just decided that your safety is the current priority.

255
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.740
I'll take responsibility.

256
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.109
Don't worry.

257
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.159
The sentinels should make sure to keep guard on alert.

258
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.780
The rest should go to bed.

259
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.409
We'll take off right when the morning comes.

260
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.079
That's all.

261
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.299
- What?
- But...

262
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.588
- Gosh, why must we go back?
- He can't just go like that.

263
00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:40.628
- It was hard to come here.
- We're going back?

264
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:43.299
- My gosh.
- If we just go like this...

265
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.759
- Are we really going back?
- Just like this?

266
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.800
Let's go.

267
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.680
If this is what happened to a shelter,

268
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.270
I wonder what happened...

269
00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:57.190
to our school.

270
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.030
But if we go back,

271
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:05.200
won't Mr. Lee get punished?

272
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.950
- What if he goes to the guardhouse?
- The guardhouse?

273
00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:12.619
This is worth the death penalty for sure.

274
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.790
- Death penalty?
- No way.

275
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.629
Hey.

276
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.460
Stop, or you might jinx it.

277
00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:23.970
Come to think of it, Mr. Lee's quite disobedient.

278
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.970
That's because of us.

279
00:24:26.589 --> 00:24:27.849
By the way,

280
00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:33.770
what will happen with extra points if we fail our mission?

281
00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:35.689
Darn you.

282
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.109
We have to clear the mission to get extra points.

283
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.030
His nonsense is so darn consistent.

284
00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:45.108
But if they don't send us to our parents...

285
00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:47.568
for not clearing the mission?

286
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:51.159
Is that actually your concern when someone's to be executed?

287
00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:54.290
Well, I was just saying...

288
00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:55.669
Let's look on the bright side.

289
00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.250
It's good that we're returning from this dangerous situation.

290
00:25:03.379 --> 00:25:07.339
Culprits are bound to be at a crime scene.

291
00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:10.430
("Dr. Frost")

292
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.809
Hold on.

293
00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:15.230
What the?

294
00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:17.099
My Coke.

295
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.230
I swear I put it in here.

296
00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.439
- What?
- Gosh.

297
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.779
- So Yoon.
- What?

298
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.359
- Was it you?
- What are you saying? I'm innocent!

299
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.990
What are you looking at?

300
00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:34.950
I think that punk already drank it.

301
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:38.249
Darn, who took it?

302
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.249
- Hey. Goodness! Where is it?
- What are you doing?

303
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.499
- Move. Where did it go?
- Are you kidding me?

304
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.168
Knock it off, you punk.

305
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:47.930
- What is the matter with you?
- Did you see it? Where did it go?

306
00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.020
So Yeon.

307
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:09.700
You should be asleep. Why aren't you in bed?

308
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.909
Well, the thing is...

309
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.960
I'm worried about the return.

310
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.710
It's not yours to concern.

311
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.919
You came to say that?

312
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800
Pardon?

313
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.020
Actually,

314
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.099
I have something to tell you.

315
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:43.940
What is it?

316
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.490
Mr. Lee.

317
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.159
The truth is, I...

318
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.869
- Duk Joong.
- Good heavens!

319
00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:59.040
- What are you doing?
- Well, I...

320
00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:01.369
I'm off to the bathroom.

321
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.379
- Go on.
- Thank you...

322
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:09.419
Gosh.

323
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.720
What are you waiting for? Go on now.

324
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.430
This requires a great deal of focus.

325
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.440
What is it that you have to say?

326
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.790
It's nothing. Goodnight.

327
00:28:13.069 --> 00:28:14.450
(Woo Hee Rak)

328
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.319
"Woo Hee Rak"?

329
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.659
I wonder how it went.

330
00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:20.118
Kim Duk Joong, that pooper.

331
00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:22.500
- She's back.
- This is so annoying.

332
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:25.960
Did you tell him how you feel?

333
00:28:27.879 --> 00:28:30.878
No, I don't think the time is right.

334
00:28:30.879 --> 00:28:32.838
- Gosh.
- My friend's helpless.

335
00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:34.629
Goodness.

336
00:28:35.639 --> 00:28:37.010
I'll do it when we return.

337
00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:39.599
I don't get why you like him.

338
00:28:40.849 --> 00:28:41.889
Gosh.

339
00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.559
You see it's bound...

340
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:48.479
to get beautiful when you fall in love during a time of war.

341
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.940
What are you saying? Gosh, you're insane.

342
00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:13.129
Na Ra, there's no need to do that much.

343
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.760
Okay?

344
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.550
Oh, right.

345
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:19.889
Get some sleep while I keep watch.

346
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.349
I'm okay.

347
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.730
I see.

348
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.780
Should I tell her now?

349
00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:39.869
No, she'll think I'm a psycho if I tell her at this time.

350
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.079
Still,

351
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.960
it's just us here. This might be a chance to tell her.

352
00:29:53.089 --> 00:29:56.050
- Look.
- What?

353
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.760
Well...

354
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.220
Na Ra, do you perhaps...

355
00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:08.389
have someone...

356
00:30:12.569 --> 00:30:14.230
Do you perhaps have...

357
00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:18.240
a celebrity you like?

358
00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:26.409
- I see spheres.
- What?

359
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.088
The detector doesn't show anything.

360
00:30:33.089 --> 00:30:34.710
They're outside its radar.

361
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.760
About 2km away from here.

362
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.339
Let me see.

363
00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:14.839
Are you saying they exchanged signals?

364
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.800
We're not exactly sure,

365
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:26.260
but a giant sphere gave out light in the sky.

366
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:29.889
Then a boss sphere emitted light as well.

367
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.599
After that,

368
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.849
they went somewhere.

369
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.859
It seemed like they were communicating.

370
00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:38.730
So they're showing...

371
00:31:40.069 --> 00:31:42.450
a pattern where a few go somewhere...

372
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.319
and come back...

373
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.659
after exchanging signals.

374
00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:53.500
Maybe they're looking for something.

375
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.750
- Could it be...
- Scouting.

376
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.879
Scouting?

377
00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.919
Yes, it's as if they're scouting.

378
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.639
They're checking where people went.

379
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.139
They're smarter than we think.

380
00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:18.480
They went somewhere around here and came back.

381
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.280
What's there?

382
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.490
I heard a shelter was there.

383
00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:28.530
Our platoon commander said so.

384
00:32:28.659 --> 00:32:31.200
That a small-sized shelter was there.

385
00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:33.040
Hold on a second.

386
00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:37.210
Then does it mean they got an order from the giant sphere...

387
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.629
and decided on a nearby shelter as their next target?

388
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.799
No way.

389
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.930
Because it has...

390
00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:48.010
a lot to prey on.

391
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.809
- Pardon?
- People gathered to find shelter,

392
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.230
but it ended up becoming a place full of prey.

393
00:32:57.349 --> 00:32:58.859
And it got much easier for the spheres.

394
00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:04.359
- Gosh.
- We better inform them quickly,

395
00:33:04.609 --> 00:33:05.909
but the communications are down.

396
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:07.990
What do we do?

397
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.790
We will...

398
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.669
withdraw tomorrow morning as planned.

399
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.510
Okay.

400
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:26.719
What about the shelter?

401
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.639
The number is too many.

402
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.930
Let's return as soon as possible and come up with another way.

403
00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:36.139
What if the spheres attack them before then?

404
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:40.480
Given their speed, it'll be too late when the backup force arrives.

405
00:33:41.609 --> 00:33:43.190
What are you trying to say?

406
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.279
There's nothing much we can do.

407
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.319
Right, we have to follow orders.

408
00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:52.030
We can't go home until we kill all the spheres, no?

409
00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:54.078
You know what happened to the Hamil High students.

410
00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:55.290
You don't want to die, do you?

411
00:33:56.619 --> 00:33:59.379
Right, it's too dangerous.

412
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:03.250
Soon Yi. You're scared too, right?

413
00:34:04.589 --> 00:34:05.589
I'm scared.

414
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.050
But...

415
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.430
someone's parents might be there.

416
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:15.220
Who's going to protect them?

417
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:31.280
If we go, other students will come.

418
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:34.789
Sungjin High instead of Hamil High.

419
00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:38.580
And another high after that.

420
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.839
Gosh.

421
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.390
I guess it's decided.

422
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.229
- Thank you.
- You make me smile.

423
00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:51.200
Doesn't it feel like...

424
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.859
the kids somehow became so mature?

425
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.490
Gosh, I feel so proud.

426
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.499
Maybe this is how a parent feels to watch their child grow.

427
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.919
Be honest with me. How old are you?

428
00:36:12.629 --> 00:36:13.629
I'm 41.

429
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.060
It's a different spot.

430
00:36:26.979 --> 00:36:30.280
We're going to get busy. Stay focused.

431
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:35.200
What are you talking about? I'm a patient.

432
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.740
There are no exceptions.

433
00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:46.329
- Sir, you're too mean.
- You heard me.

434
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.330
Oh, please.

435
00:36:48.169 --> 00:36:49.169
Attention.

436
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:52.379
The spheres are scattered near the neighbourhood,

437
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.970
and it's too dangerous to find and kill them 1-by-1.

438
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.100
Right.

439
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.510
So we will...

440
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.060
gather the spheres here at Maesong City University...

441
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.269
and get rid of them all at once.

442
00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:08.649
- What? How?
- How will we do that?

443
00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.358
- At once?
- How?

444
00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:12.858
- Is that even possible?
- How?

445
00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:13.859
From now on,

446
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.740
listen carefully to what I say.

447
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.780
(Seolbong Building)

448
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.620
Be careful.

449
00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:31.499
Oh, that.

450
00:37:32.379 --> 00:37:33.419
What is it?

451
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.889
Isn't this the one, guys?

452
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.260
Yes, I think it is.

453
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.019
First off, we'll combine dynamite with depleted uranium...

454
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:46.640
to make depleted uranium explosives.

455
00:37:47.769 --> 00:37:49.149
It was here.

456
00:37:51.149 --> 00:37:53.399
- Hey, be careful!
- Be careful.

457
00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:56.399
Careful.

458
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.530
Be careful.

459
00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:00.120
This is not right.

460
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.410
Gosh.

461
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120
There.

462
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.169
Platoon Two, attention.

463
00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:13.499
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

464
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.209
Each team should figure out where to install the explosives...

465
00:38:15.629 --> 00:38:17.300
and install them while ensuring safety.

466
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:19.180
When you're all done,

467
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.680
move quickly to the rooftop of Seolbong Building and stand by.

468
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.059
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

469
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.099
All teams, get to work.

470
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

471
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:43.990
Team One...

472
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.700
will restore power in the machine room.

473
00:38:51.709 --> 00:38:52.709
(Basement Floor)

474
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.609
When the power is restored,

475
00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:17.319
the rest will place the explosives in the building.

476
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:25.910
Team Six will observe the spheres...

477
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.740
until the job is done...

478
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.660
and cover the other teams so that they can leave safely.

479
00:39:31.289 --> 00:39:34.789
If the spheres make an unusual move in the middle,

480
00:39:35.129 --> 00:39:36.209
report to me right away.

481
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.589
So what are we doing with the explosives, Soo Chul?

482
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.259
Didn't you hear Mr. Lee?

483
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.019
I got distracted because I chipped my nail.

484
00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:53.399
We'll place the explosives, lure the spheres, and...

485
00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:54.560
And?

486
00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:57.569
Bam!

487
00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:03.030
It's simple.

488
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.490
Simple, you say?

489
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.410
If we fail to place the explosives, we'll die.

490
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.160
If we fail to lure the spheres, we'll die.

491
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.499
If we fail to kill them all at once, we'll die.

492
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.709
We'll also die if we're distracted during this operation like you.

493
00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:20.669
What do you think? Is it simple?

494
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.350
Where? Where do we look to keep watch?

495
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.720
Gosh.

496
00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:41.899
- Duk Joong.
- Yes.

497
00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:47.869
- Duk Joong.
- Wait. I'm working on it.

498
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.950
Take this.

499
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.659
- Jun Hee.
- Yes.

500
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.870
- So Yeon.
- Hold this.

501
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.329
Didn't you learn how to do this?

502
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.999
Darn, I learned the easy way.

503
00:40:57.249 --> 00:40:59.588
When you're all done installing the explosives,

504
00:40:59.589 --> 00:41:02.709
- Slowly.
- seal every door to the outside...

505
00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:06.339
and move swiftly to the rooftop to stand by there.

506
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.140
- Do we install the explosive here?
- Yes.

507
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.979
Give it to me. I'll do it.

508
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.620
What is this smell?

509
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.870
- It keeps smelling like spheres.
- What?

510
00:41:34.749 --> 00:41:37.249
You know, there's this fishy smell peculiar to them.

511
00:41:54.269 --> 00:41:55.479
What's with this mood?

512
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.189
Hey, Young Soo. Do you have a crush on So Yeon?

513
00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:01.019
What are you saying? I don't.

514
00:42:01.939 --> 00:42:04.030
I guess you do like her.

515
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.398
Hey, this is enough.

516
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:11.200
Hey, you shouldn't say it stinks about a boy who likes you.

517
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.700
I mean, I really appreciate it. Right, Young Soo?

518
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.160
Stop it.

519
00:42:19.249 --> 00:42:21.669
What on earth? You don't stink at all.

520
00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:23.919
Hey, try smelling him again.

521
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.800
Darn, I told you to stop!

522
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.260
Are you out of your mind, you darn moron?

523
00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:36.430
- Hey.
- Stop.

524
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.939
This isn't the time to fight. Come back to your senses.

525
00:42:42.189 --> 00:42:44.609
Wait until we talk later.

526
00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:06.550
We'll lure the spheres,

527
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:11.010
and when every entrance is sealed, we'll explode the bombs...

528
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.050
and kill them all.

529
00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:47.419
- They've started moving.
- What?

530
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.300
Darn it.

531
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.430
Where?

532
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.189
Hey, hold this.

533
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:06.819
Mr. Lee, the spheres are moving unusually.

534
00:44:07.189 --> 00:44:08.439
I think they're preparing to take off.

535
00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:21.789
- Already?
- Darn it.

536
00:44:22.539 --> 00:44:24.620
Guys, let's do it quickly.

537
00:44:26.419 --> 00:44:27.669
The kids.

538
00:44:28.709 --> 00:44:29.749
What about the kids?

539
00:44:30.169 --> 00:44:31.919
They aren't done with their job yet.

540
00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:33.800
What do we do about them?

541
00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:51.779
- Did you hear it?
- Yes.

542
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.068
- Gosh.
- It's too soon. What do we do?

543
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:55.568
Isn't it obvious? Let's install them quickly.

544
00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:57.530
- Let's move.
- Go.

545
00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.949
They're moving already?

546
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.539
Gosh, this is strange.

547
00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:02.789
Darn it.

548
00:45:03.539 --> 00:45:05.788
What are you waiting for? Run!

549
00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:07.419
Goodness, gracious.

550
00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:12.129
We must change their direction before they arrive at the shelter.

551
00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.100
Aren't you done yet?

552
00:45:24.729 --> 00:45:25.939
We have a few left.

553
00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:30.439
If we don't lure them now, the shelter will be attacked.

554
00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:32.228
But if this rings, they'll come in 10 minutes.

555
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.319
What, 10 minutes?

556
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.109
Let's wrap it up in 10 minutes and leave this place.

557
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.990
Platoon Two, begin luring the spheres.

558
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.379
- Young Sin, can you do it?
- Yes, I think so.

559
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.260
We'll begin the operation to lure the spheres now.

560
00:45:55.379 --> 00:45:57.970
Everyone, wrap it up in 10 minutes...

561
00:45:58.089 --> 00:45:59.589
and move to Seolbong Building.

562
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.300
Are you kidding me?

563
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.069
Gosh.

564
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.410
It's stuck!

565
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.789
Let me try.

566
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.289
Push!

567
00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:38.470
Quickly!

568
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.600
All right, it's loud.

569
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.850
One, two, three.

570
00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:05.370
Oh, come on!

571
00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.498
My hands are so shaky that I can't do it properly.

572
00:47:09.499 --> 00:47:12.080
- Let me do it.
- Help me.

573
00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:16.669
Aren't you done yet? We must get out now.

574
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:18.339
I'm almost done.

575
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.879
- Are you?
- Yes.

576
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.890
Do we do it for real?

577
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.470
- Do it!
- Darn it.

578
00:47:33.649 --> 00:47:34.689
What are you waiting for? Smash it now!

579
00:47:37.569 --> 00:47:40.609
- They're almost here. Hurry up!
- Where are the others?

580
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.579
We must go. Let's go!

581
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.870
Let's go!

582
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.249
- Run.
- Goodness.

583
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.870
Gosh!

584
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.749
(Seolbong Building)

585
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.129
Mr. Lee, we must get out now.

586
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:05.470
I have to connect them all. I'm almost done.

587
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.430
We'll do the rest.

588
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.390
Then finish it up in the hallway.

589
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.310
Let's go.

590
00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:30.330
Let me help.

591
00:48:59.359 --> 00:49:00.729
They're crowding in.

592
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:05.740
Why aren't they coming?

593
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.288
- Bo Ra.
- Guys. What about the others?

594
00:49:10.289 --> 00:49:11.410
- Gosh.
- Where?

595
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.919
There are too many!

596
00:49:18.209 --> 00:49:20.879
Darn, we're doomed.

597
00:49:22.669 --> 00:49:24.419
Mr. Lee, you must get out of there quickly!

598
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.220
Run!

599
00:49:37.979 --> 00:49:38.979
Go without me.

600
00:49:40.359 --> 00:49:41.359
Mr. Kim.

601
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:44.990
I'll follow you soon. Be careful.

602
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.080
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

603
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:06.550
- Come on. Do it faster.
- Darn it.

604
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.839
How many more do you have left?

605
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:12.680
A few more.

606
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.680
Darn.

607
00:50:15.269 --> 00:50:16.310
Hurry.

608
00:50:19.979 --> 00:50:21.269
Darn it.

609
00:50:21.859 --> 00:50:23.019
We have no time. Finish it quickly!

610
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.080
They went toward the main building, right?

611
00:50:34.539 --> 00:50:35.950
I can't see.

612
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.830
Let's go downstairs.

613
00:50:40.419 --> 00:50:41.919
Goodness.

614
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.918
- What do we do?
- They shouldn't come this soon.

615
00:50:44.919 --> 00:50:47.049
- Guys!
- What?

616
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.129
- What is it?
- Let's go first.

617
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.509
- Gosh, where are you going?
- This way!

618
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.560
- What?
- Darn it.

619
00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:56.930
What do we do?

620
00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.479
- What is it?
- What? Why are they going there?

621
00:51:00.689 --> 00:51:02.609
- Let's do this quickly.
- Darn.

622
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:08.530
Mr. Lee.

623
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.240
The spheres have come very close.

624
00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:17.450
Goodness.

625
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.749
I'll wrap it up. Move to Seolbong Building.

626
00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:24.089
I'll do it.

627
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:27.459
The kids' safety comes first.

628
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.169
Go with the kids.

629
00:51:31.089 --> 00:51:32.140
Now.

630
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.680
Finish it and join us quickly.

631
00:51:39.979 --> 00:51:41.100
Kids, let's go downstairs.

632
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.439
No, I'm not going.

633
00:51:48.229 --> 00:51:50.189
- Hurry and go.
- No.

634
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200
Now!

635
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.370
No...

636
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.458
I'm not going!

637
00:52:01.459 --> 00:52:02.459
Hurry up!

638
00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:05.208
I don't want to go.

639
00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:07.708
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

640
00:52:07.709 --> 00:52:09.588
- I don't want to go.
- Come on!

641
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:10.669
Go!

642
00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:13.550
- Go quickly.
- Move!

643
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.430
Darn it.

644
00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:35.700
Darn, not again.

645
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.200
There are too many.

646
00:52:39.039 --> 00:52:40.789
They're swarming in.

647
00:52:46.169 --> 00:52:47.169
What about the others?

648
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:53.050
Soo Chul...

649
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:09.819
Let's go.

650
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.740
Let's go.

651
00:54:57.129 --> 00:54:58.220
Come quick.

652
00:55:14.609 --> 00:55:16.819
Let's arrive safely first.

653
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.200
Now.

654
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.660
Darn it.

655
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.379
Gosh.

656
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.720
Gosh.

657
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.788
They should be here. Why aren't they coming yet?

658
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:13.709
- Guys, they're coming.
- What?

659
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.749
Young Sin, over here!

660
00:56:16.419 --> 00:56:19.209
- Gosh.
- Young Sin.

661
00:56:19.379 --> 00:56:20.550
Thank goodness.

662
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:25.549
- Why is it just you two?
- Yeon Ju.

663
00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.719
What about the rest?

664
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.349
- Oh, no.
- Darn it.

665
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.470
- Why aren't they coming?
- What...

666
00:56:36.939 --> 00:56:38.019
Gosh.

667
00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.490
Goodness.

668
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.668
- They're here.
- Oh, it's them.

669
00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:27.470
- Eun Young.
- Thank goodness.

670
00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:30.760
- Are you okay?
- Yes, what about you?

671
00:58:36.019 --> 00:58:37.390
Jang Soo, connect the line.

672
00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.939
What about Mr. Lee?

673
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:43.189
What happened?

674
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:47.609
Everyone,

675
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:51.160
stand by here...

676
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.789
until there's an order from Mr. Lee.

677
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:58.209
- What?
- Why?

678
00:58:58.749 --> 00:58:59.789
- What?
- What's going on?

679
00:58:59.959 --> 00:59:01.708
So Yeon, what happened?

680
00:59:01.709 --> 00:59:04.589
- So Yeon, where's Mr. Lee?
- Why isn't he here?

681
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.550
- So Yeon.
- What is it?

682
00:59:07.419 --> 00:59:08.760
- What happened?
- What is going on?

- This is the platoon commander.
- Mr. Lee.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.589
Initiate...

689
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.600
the explosion now.

690
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:22.430
But you are still in the building.

691
01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:26.979
I'm not, so explode the building.

692
01:01:28.649 --> 01:01:29.689
Where is he?

693
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.660
You must do it now to kill the spheres.

694

No, Mr. Lee. Get out of there now. Quickly!

695
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080
Mr. Lee.

696
01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:47.209
I'll go now.

697
01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:49.459
- What?
- I'll go too.

698
01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:51.300

all of us will die.

702
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.350
No... No, Mr. Lee.

703

Please get out of there.

Please!

This is an order.

709
01:02:28.169 --> 01:02:29.289
Blow it now.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.419

711
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.839

No...

715
01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.289
- No.
- There is no other way.

716
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:18.800
You promised...

717
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.640
that you'd protect us until the end.

718
01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:29.180
So please get out of there.

719
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.810
Please!

720
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.410
I'm sorry...

721
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.249
I can't protect you until the end...

722
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.999
as I promised.

723
01:03:56.339 --> 01:03:57.379
And...

724
01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.629
for dragging you into this war as an adult.

725
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.939
At first, I thought you were just disobedient kids.

726
01:04:18.569 --> 01:04:20.240
But now that I think about it,

727
01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.069
I'm so grateful...

728
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.330

731
01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.919
didn't feel so frightening.

732
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.510
So,
