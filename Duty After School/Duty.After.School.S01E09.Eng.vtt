00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.590
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.799
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.060
- Yes.
- We're all getting out!

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.519
We should capture one of them and hear them out.

5
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.560
Got it.

6
00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.940
They wouldn't have gotten far, so spread out and search.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.440
Wouldn't they have made a run for it?

8
00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.570
I don't know what they have in mind,

9
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.699
but they won't leave her behind.

10
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.280
They don't seem like your average school buddies,

11
00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.660
but I don't know what their story is.

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.409
- Tell me about it.
- Right.

13
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.170
Let's get on our separate ways.

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.579
The doors were unlocked, and there isn't a problem.

15
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.750
Look here, mister. Unbelievable.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.460
How stupid can you be?

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.719
We should find out what's going on outside.

18
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:54.880
- I'm not interested.
- Is that so?

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.509
Then, you should be on your way.

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.310
You'll be heartbroken...

21
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.020
if your mother isn't at the nursing home.

22
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.100
I mean...

23
00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.060
- Hold on.
- Hey.

24
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.770
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.939
I asked my boys outside to look out for your mother.

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.569
Don't you dare lay a finger on her,

27
00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.870
you sick psycho.

28
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.909
It's why we should help each other out.

29
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.170
Come on, darn it. Stop being so scary.

30
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.879
What are you glaring at me for?

31
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.060
After I get you the kids,

32
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.060
we won't see each other again.

33
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.650
Sure thing.

34
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.109
I don't care about the boys, so kill them all.

35
00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.689
- Only bring the girls.
- Sure.

36
00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.780
What was her name again? Right, it was Bo Ra.

37
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.280
Make sure she isn't harmed in any way.

38
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.030
She's one I must groom.

39
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.290
It's been a while, and I'm getting excited.

40
00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.909
Darn.

41
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.129
The one with the glasses is more my type though.

42
00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.629
I see you like those in glasses. Go ahead, then.

43
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.719
You can take that one if you want.

44
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.469
- She's too docile, which is boring.
- Okay.

45
00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.219
Get up, will you?

46
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.060
Hey.

47
00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.479
Hey, keep walking.

48
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.479
I must've lost weight while not being able to eat and all.

49
00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.229
My pants keep slipping down.

50
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:32.819
Let's hurry up and eat.

51
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.110
I'll enjoy my meal and also the one with glasses.

52
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.740
Gosh, it's nice to be out,

53
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.159
but the fine dust...

54
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.289
Are you really going off on your own?

55
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.539
- What a moron.
- What? Unbelievable.

56
00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.340
Hey, hairy guy.

57
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.629
Wait for me, hairy guy. Are we going this way?

58
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.219
Shoot.

59
00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.889
Keep yourself hidden down to your strands of hair

60
00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.150
Kids, where are you?

61
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.229
Let's play.

62
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.110
Here you are!

63
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.610
I guess not.

64
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.199
Kill...

65
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.830
the boys.

66
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.289
While the girls...

67
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.870
There they are.

68
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960
Darn it.

69
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.139
Stop.

70
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.599
(Infirmary)

71
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.789
Hey, shouldn't we finish up what we started earlier?

72
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.080
Why don't we swap clothes?

73
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.590
Would it kill you to give me a livelier response?

74
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.840
Kids!

75
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.970
Where are you going?

76
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.149
This has been my home for years, you know.

77
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.439
I know this place like the back of my hand.

78
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.110
Darn, you're not here.

79
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.990
Why aren't you here?

80
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.449
You little turds.

81
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.629
Keep yourself hidden

82
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.629
Down to your strands of hair

83
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.720
What...

84
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.019
Are you kidding me, you little freaks?

85
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.149
Where the heck are you? Get out here!

86
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.779
What the heck?

87
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.459
You little cow.

88
00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.550
Darn it.

89
00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.259
You ugly little cow.

90
00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.009
Get back here, you cow! Darn it!

91
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.850
What the...

92
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.810
Hey! Get back here!

93
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.980
You little cow.

94
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.519
Are you kidding me?

95
00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.439
Don't waste my energy and get out here, darn it.

96
00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:05.529
Open up.

97
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.410
You little cow!

98
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.990
Are you kidding me?

99
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.660
Get out here!

100
00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:13.699
Darn cow.

101
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.250
Get out here!

102
00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:23.709
Who's there?

103
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.550
What the heck is that?

104
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.189
Darn it!

105
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.610
Darn...

106
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:45.939
What the...

107
00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.449
No...

108
00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.079
I see he screams when he has orgasms.

109
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.079
You darn morons.

110
00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:01.040
How hard is it to catch a couple of kids?

111
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:03.879
Are you kidding me?

112
00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:07.170
Darn it!

113
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.389
It has begun.

114
00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.680
Oh, no.

115
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.389
Will the others be all right?

116
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.350
Hang in there, Ae Seol.

117
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.769
Wait, is that a sphere?

118
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.029
- Where did it come from?
- There are four of them.

119
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.610
- And they're drawing near.
- Oh, no.

120
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.029
At this speed, they'll reach the building in minutes.

121
00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.199
We have no choice. We should let them go.

122
00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.120
Wait.

123
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.670
This might be our way to save Ae Seol.

124
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.430
Lure the spheres your way while we get to Ae Seol.

125
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.970
And be careful.

126
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.980
Will it be okay? We'll all be in danger.

127
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.189
There's no other way at this point.

128
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.810
It'll work out.

129
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.819
Ae Seol is stronger than you think.

130
00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:27.750
- Okay, let's open this door.
- Hurry.

131
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.000
- You must have the keys.
- Unlock it.

132
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.589
- Hurry, will you?
- There we go.

133
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.009
And then...

134
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.759
The door will now open.

135
00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:55.070
- Did it work?
- We need the rest inside.

136
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.080
- You pricks!
- You pricks!

137
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.250
Here they come.

138
00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.509
Who knew I'd be playing Tag with them?

139
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:18.720
Just don't let them catch up.

140
00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:25.139
Are you telling me you're not getting horny?

141
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.149
There's no need to be on full Rambo mode.

142
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.899
No one's here.

143
00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.029
The one with the glasses seems to like the colour white...

144
00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:37.240
like the Gray in my hair.

145
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.740
What?

146
00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:42.830
I'm also armed, you freak.

147
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.000
What? I'll shoot, darn it.

148
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:04.559
Anyway, the one with the glasses likes the colour white...

149
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.850
like the Gray in my hair.

150
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.309
Where are you going?

151
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.159
What the...

152
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.049
If you keep moving about on your own,

153
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.009
I won't let you have fun.

154
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.879
What on earth?

155
00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.840
Did the kids do this?

156
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.090
I think someone else is in play.

157
00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:43.600
Something isn't right.

158
00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:46.269
I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving.

159
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.269
What the heck is this? Darn it.

160
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.399
My gosh.

161
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.330
Get off me!

162
00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:14.879
Darn it!

163
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.590
Save me! Do something!

164
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.720
Oh, my gosh.

165
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:23.100
Save me!

166
00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:01.340
Jerk.

167
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.360
For goodness' sake. Bo Ra.

168
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.149
You couldn't hold it in and moved on your own?

169
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.649
Stupid No Ae Seol is alone.

170
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.690
Jerks.

171
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.360
Let's go.

172
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.500
- We have to get out immediately.
- Why? What's going on?

173
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.629
Everyone's attacked.

174
00:13:17.169 --> 00:13:18.840
Those little brats?

175
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.919
It's not the kids.

176
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.629
Then who?

177
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.049
I don't know.

178
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.720
I think it's a weird monster.

179
00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:27.549
A monster?

180
00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:30.720
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.389
You jerk. Did you kill them?

182
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:37.100
I saw it with my own eyes.

183
00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.769
We need to get out quick. If you want to live.

184
00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.190
What are you talking about? Darn it!

185
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.370
What's that?

186
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.710
Gosh. Hey.

187
00:13:55.909 --> 00:13:58.710
Hey. Be careful. Hey.

188
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.960
Hey! Shoot!

189
00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:10.470
Why isn't it dying? Hey! Look at this.

190
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.929
- Hey. Oh, gosh.
- Gosh!

191
00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:15.139
For goodness' sake.

192
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.809
Shoot. What is it?

193
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.690
Darn it!

194
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.809
He got what he deserved.

195
00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:03.480
Let's hurry and find Ae Seol and get out of here.

196
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.659
For goodness' sake.

197
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.580
She's not there?

198
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.919
For goodness' sake. Where is she?

199
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.330
Perhaps...

200
00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:24.750
No Ae Seol!

201
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.590
- For goodness' sake.
- No Ae Seol!

202
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.620
No Ae Seol!

203
00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:01.500
- No Ae Seol!
- Yes?

204
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.960
- Bo Ra.
- Are you okay?

205
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.460
- No Ae Seol!
- Ae Seol!

206
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.299
You're okay, right?

207
00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:10.669
Yes, I'm okay.

208
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.769
What about others?

209
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:21.230
They're fine. Let's go first.

210
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.389
Let's go.

211
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.610
Oh, my gosh!

212
00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.190
Go ahead!

213
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.200

214
00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.490
They're here again!

215
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.289
I told you we shouldn't have come! Darn it!

216
00:16:46.289 --> 00:16:47.879
- Run!
- For goodness' sake.

217
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.009
Darn it.

218
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.590
Gosh. Shoot!

219
00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:01.559
- Hee Rak!
- Oh, gosh! Shoot!

220
00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:02.850
Don't come!

221
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:04.350
Stay down!

222
00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:11.440
Darn it. I'm done for.

223
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.400
For goodness' sake!

224
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.490
Come here, you wench!

225
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.200
Why? What?

226
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.210
Come here.

227
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.170
You witch!

228
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.039
You ruined everything!

229
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.880
Darn it!

230
00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:39.509
You seemed unlucky since the first time I saw you. Come here.

231
00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:41.509
I'll make a hole in your head. You witch. Come here.

232
00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:42.559
Watch carefully.

233
00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.519
Look.

234
00:17:46.269 --> 00:17:47.440
You're crazy.

235
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.400
You witch. Are you pretending to be kind?

236
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.980
For goodness' sake.

237
00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:55.529
Oh, gosh! You witch! Seriously!

238
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.740
Gosh. Shoot!

239
00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.119
Gosh. Darn it!

240
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.000
You witch. Seriously!

241
00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:10.339
Shoot. You brat. I'll kill you.

242
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.960
Yes. Shoot them all.

243
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.509
Kill all the witches here.

244
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.259
Oh, shoot. Seriously.

245
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.720
What are you doing standing there doing nothing? You fool!

246
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.640
Shoot them! Shoot to let them meet their moms. You fool.

247
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.930
Shoot them! Darn it!

248
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.650
What are you doing?

249
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.240
For goodness' sake.

250
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.089
I was curious...

251
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.059
why those appeared out of nowhere.

252
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.349
I think I know why now.

253
00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:12.769
It's because humans...

254
00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:16.319
are trash.

255
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.240
They're here to clean up.

256
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.309
Are you okay?

257
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.019
Bo Ra. You're bleeding.

258
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.400
Bo Ra. You're bleeding.

259
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.869
- Jerks.
- Are you okay?

260
00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:07.160
I'm fine.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.740
What shall we do with Soo Chul?

265
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.990
Shall we bury him?

266
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.160
We have to take him.

267
00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:30.200
How can we leave him here?

268
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.130
Soo Chul.

269
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.839
No.

270
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.180
How did he fall?

271
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.390
What was with the gunfire?

272
00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.099
There was no sphere nearby.

273
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:50.849
Shoot.

274
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.309
First,

275
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.519
let's go back with Soo Chul before it gets too dark.

276
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:21.710
What?

277
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.799
Take a look at this.

278
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.009
What is that?

279
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.480
- That's...
- It's a ballot.

280
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.109
Why is that here?

281
00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:42.980
This is mine.

282
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.740
This is mine.

283
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.279
Hey, what are you talking about?

284
00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:51.950
It's my ballot from yesterday.

285
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:54.119
It's mine for sure.

286
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.750
But why is that here?

287
00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:12.349
(Yongdu Service Area)

288
00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:13.680
We'll be leaving now.

289
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.809
You guys should change your minds too.

290
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.940
There's no reason to stay here when the CSAT has been cancelled.

291
00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:22.809
All right.

292
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.569
I'll talk to the others when they get here.

293
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.069
All right, then. Be careful.

294
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.490
Stay alive.

295
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.200
- Bye.
- Best of luck.

296
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.369
- Best of luck.
- Be careful.

297
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:34.700
Wait.

298
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.539
Well...

299
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.619
about the walkie-talkie.

300
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.670
What you guys said about someone breaking it on purpose...

301
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.670
Is there not even a single chance that you could have been mistaken?

302
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.549
- The thing is...
- You're right.

303
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:50.220
We could have been mistaken.

304
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.509
- We'll get going, then.
- Bye.

305
00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:55.680
- Seriously.
- Bye.

306
00:23:56.099 --> 00:23:58.930
We should tell them. Are we really going to just leave like this...

307
00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:00.390
without telling them?

308
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.769
If it makes them feel comfortable...

309
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.769
to think that we were mistaken, then we made the right choice.

310
00:24:07.069 --> 00:24:08.319
What are you talking about?

311
00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:12.490
It'll only get harder once we start losing each other's trust.

312
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.200
- Keep moving.
- But...

313
00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:26.670
It doesn't make sense.

314
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.630
Why would Do Soo Chul rig the ballots?

315
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.420
It doesn't make sense.

316
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.259
But what is this, then?

317
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.180
It's proof that our votes have been manipulated thus far.

318
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.430
Don't jump to conclusions.

319
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.470
Even after seeing this?

320
00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:41.019
Hey, that's just nonsense.

321
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:44.150
What is this situation?

322
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.319
Only Soo Chul will know.

323
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.109
That means we've been needlessly suffering because of Do Soo Chul.

324
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:54.819
Hey, you lunatic, watch your mouth! He's dead!

325
00:24:54.819 --> 00:24:56.450
Darn it! Then what else am I supposed to do?

326
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.700
- Darn you.
- Stop!

327
00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.740
I can't think because of you guys.

328
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.170
Hasn't Soo Chul been acting strange recently?

329
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.759
He's been awfully quiet.

330
00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.430
Do you think...

331
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.180
he committed suicide because he couldn't handle the pain?

332
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.269
Someone also committed suicide at the garrison due to depression.

333
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.150
No, it's not suicide.

334
00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:35.859
I told her she could get back to me slowly.

335
00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:39.200
But even if I get rejected, I won't give up.

336
00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:43.079
I'm going to keep trying until my feelings get accepted.

337
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.710
There's no way he would've committed suicide.

338
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.839
Then why did he die?

339
00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:00.759
You want to come clean now?

340
00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:03.269
Do you think the others will be understanding?

341
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:07.309
Gosh.

342
00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:09.809
Is anyone there?

343
00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:18.869
What?

344
00:26:20.369 --> 00:26:21.490
Earlier...

345
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.420
No way.

346
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.799
There's no way.

347
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.930
That can't be true. Think about it.

348
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.809
They broke it on purpose? How does that make sense?

349
00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:44.930
What if it's true?

350
00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:49.309
If it's true, who in the world broke it?

351
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.019
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

352
00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:55.440
- They must be here.
- Hey.

353
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.950
Let's keep it to ourselves for now.

354
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.779
- Why?
- Hey, it could end up...

355
00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:03.369
creating tension between everyone.

356
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.410
Let's tell Yu Jung at a later time.

357
00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:07.579
She's right.

358
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.710
We don't even know what actually happened with the walkie-talkie.

359
00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:12.750
Fine.

360
00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:16.049
- I don't know.
- Seriously.

361
00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:17.759
Bo Ra got hurt pretty bad.

362
00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:19.220
I feel like I'm going to die.

363
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.799
Darn it, we have to deal with criminals on top of spheres.

364
00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:23.549
Hey, it just happens like that.

365
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:25.720
- Stop being so annoying.
- Come on.

366
00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:28.940
Oh, my gosh! Yeon Bo Ra, are you okay?

367
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.440
- What?
- Be quiet. Stop making a fuss.

368
00:27:31.809 --> 00:27:33.230
Yeon Ju isn't here. What should we do?

369
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.019
Oh, right. Emergency first aid.

370
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:37.940
Bo Ra, let's go.

371
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.740
I'll take care of it on my own.

372
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:43.069
Bo Ra, just go and get treated.

373
00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:51.829
Let go. I can walk on my own.

374
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:56.130
- Hey.
- Don't bother me.

375
00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:02.839
Did something happen?

376
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.299
How did Bo Ra get hurt?

377
00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:07.309
Were there a lot of spheres?

378
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.140
It wasn't the spheres.

379
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:13.230
What? Then what was it?

380
00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:18.859
But why weren't you guys keeping watch?

381
00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:20.650
- What?
- Well...

382
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.910
The thing is...

383
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:26.119
something came up.

384
00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:32.829
Right. Did you guys find a walkie-talkie?

385
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.170
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

386
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.750
No, there weren't any.

387
00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:41.130
You said there would be!

388
00:28:41.259 --> 00:28:42.589
You were so confident!

389
00:28:42.589 --> 00:28:44.339
Why are you raising your voice?

390
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.470
Hey, is that our fault?

391
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:48.849
- We almost died.
- Darn it.

392
00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:51.930
Why?

393
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.849
What happened?

394
00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:57.190
Forget it. I'm too exhausted...

395
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.109
to talk right now.

396
00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.740
Hey.

397
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.619
We said we'd keep it to ourselves.

398
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.119
All right.

399
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.380
I'll rub the ointment now.

400
00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:32.349
Thanks.

401
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.769
And sorry for acting on my own.

402
00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.900
My body just reacted instinctively.

403
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.400
Stop trying to build a relationship with me.

404
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.740
I couldn't help it.

405
00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:57.039
After my parents got divorced,

406
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.130
no one wanted to raise me, so I was left with my grandma.

407
00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:05.259
I never said I was curious.

408
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.009
I'm just making an excuse...

409
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.519
because I'm so sorry.

410
00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:18.309
- Hey.
- Yes?

411
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.480
Didn't I hurt my ear?

412
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.779
Sorry. I'll wrap it again.

413
00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:30.160
It's okay. I'll ask Yeon Ju to help me later.

414
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.829
By the way...

415
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.759
Never mind.

416
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.640
What's that look on your face?

417
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.809
- Are you okay?
- Do you think so? I got shot.

418
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.690
Yeon Bo Ra, at the penitentiary, No Ae Seol...

419
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.109
You don't have to explain.

420
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.240
Bo Ra.

421
00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:16.500
I was shocked earlier.

422
00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:20.079
I didn't die. Are you my boyfriend or what?

423
00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.539
Why were you shocked?

424
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.130
Why? Do you want me to be your boyfriend?

425
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:30.890
What are you saying?

426
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:35.599
- Hey.
- The others are back. Let's go.

427
00:31:36.059 --> 00:31:37.930
- You guys went through a lot.
- Yes.

428
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.099
- Guys, you're here.
- You're here.

429
00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:41.599
- Soon Yi!
- Good work.

430
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.269
- Soon Yi, Yeon Ju.
- What's wrong?

431
00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:45.859
- What's wrong, Yeon Ju?
- Soon Yi, Yeon Ju.

432
00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:47.359
- What is it?
- What's going on?

433
00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:49.529
- What is it?
- What?

434
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.529
- What?
- What's going on?

435
00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:55.240
What is this?

436
00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:03.460
Where's Soo Chul?

437
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.670
Come on. Answer us.

438
00:32:07.589 --> 00:32:10.839
Why aren't you saying anything? You're making me anxious!

439
00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:11.970
Hey, Kwon Il Ha.

440
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.049
Why aren't you talking?

441
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:16.849
Chi Yeol.

442
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.750
No.

443
00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.339
What happened?

444
00:32:52.259 --> 00:32:53.930
Say something!

445
00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:02.430
(Convenience store)

446
00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:14.319
Soo Chul...

447
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.910
Soo Chul.

448
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.369
Poor Soo Chul.

449
00:33:25.619 --> 00:33:27.630
Poor Soo Chul.

450
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.509
Soo Chul...

451
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.769
What's this?

452
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.190
The ballot Soo Chul had.

453
00:33:50.069 --> 00:33:51.400
There were three dissenting votes.

454
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.240
Tell me why Soo Chul...

455
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.990
had these.

456
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.490
What the...

457
00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:03.789
What are these?

458
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.920
Why are the dissenting votes here?

459
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.299
I voted against staying yesterday.

460
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:13.089
The fact he hid these...

461
00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:15.720
was to fool us into thinking that more voted to stay.

462
00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:17.130
Who fooled us?

463
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.969
Are you saying that Soo Chul did?

464
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.300
What are you talking about?

465
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.900
I asked Soo Chul to destroy the ballots.

466
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.400
That must be why he had them.

467
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.199
Why did he only have ballots that were against the idea?

468
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.699
And three of them?

469
00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.320
It's proof that the poll was rigged.

470
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.530
Don't jump to conclusions.

471
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.949
Soo Chul had no reason to do that.

472
00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.659
What are you all barking about?

473
00:34:44.789 --> 00:34:46.869
Tell me so that I can understand.

474
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:48.170
Guys, hold on.

475
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.710
Why are we suspecting one another?

476
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.250
This will only lead to misunderstandings.

477
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.550
Then let's get to the truth right now.

478
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:54.880
If the poll wasn't rigged,

479
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.340
today's poll will produce the same result.

480
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.340
Raise your hand if you voted X.

481
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.389
Hey.

482
00:35:01.429 --> 00:35:03.059
We shouldn't be raising hands...

483
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.309
Why are you stopping us?

484
00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:05.679
Wang Tae Man,

485
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.639
you're acting awfully suspicious.

486
00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:08.690
What?

487
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.309
You've been losing your cool today,

488
00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.820
- and I'd rather you shut your trap.
- Shut my trap?

489
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.070
- That's right.
- Hey!

490
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.650
- What?
- I can swear too, you know.

491
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.989
Go ahead, then.

492
00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:19.699
Guys, stop.

493
00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:20.860
What the...

494
00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:24.369
Unbelievable.

495
00:35:25.329 --> 00:35:26.539
Darn it.

496
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.670
Let's calm down and talk this out.

497
00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:33.090
Soo Chul...

498
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.750
How did he die?

499
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.010
Squad Two, don't you know anything?

500
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.139
Say something.

501
00:35:48.389 --> 00:35:49.559
Soo Chul...

502
00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:53.400
I heard him argue before dying.

503
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.610
- What?
- What?

504
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.070
Soo Chul...

505
00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.110
- What if it weren't an accident?
- Kim Chi Yeol.

506
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.780
What on earth are you saying?

507
00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.329
Who did Soo Chul argue with?

508
00:36:04.409 --> 00:36:05.489
Are you sure about it?

509
00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:07.750
Why are you only mentioning it now?

510
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:11.670
I was too startled earlier to put two and two together.

511
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.539
It's why I didn't say anything.

512
00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.250
What on earth is going on?

513
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.920
First,

514
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.010
we must know who Soo Chul argued with in the hospital.

515
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.099
Tell me...

516
00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:29.519
where you were...

517
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.980
and what you were doing at the time.

518
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.230
What?

519
00:36:34.519 --> 00:36:36.070
Are you suspecting us?

520
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.230
Are you out of your mind? You're asking for our whereabouts?

521
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.030
Tell us where you were first!

522
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.150
Why should we believe you, anyway?

523
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.739
I'm not saying we should suspect each other.

524
00:36:42.739 --> 00:36:45.159
We should at least find out how Soo Chul died.

525
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:46.239
Then...

526
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.619
What you're saying is that...

527
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.329
one of them...

528
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.500
killed Soo Chul.

529
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.420
- What?
- Ha Na, watch your mouth...

530
00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.630
and don't say whatever comes to mind.

531
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.929
What if Soo Chul didn't trip and fall?

532
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.179
It means someone killed him.

533
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:06.510
As if that makes sense!

534
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.469
Stop it. My head's about to explode.

535
00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:16.650
Let's first confirm what we can.

536
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.530
We have proof that the poll was rigged,

537
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.530
so let's figure that out first.

538
00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:28.989
Kim Yu Jung, tell us. You probably know what's going on.

539
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:33.829
Why won't you tell us? Speak up!

540
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:35.500
Don't badger her like that.

541
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.340
Jang Soo, maybe you were in on it as well.

542
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.460
- This isn't time to take sides.
- Hey, don't.

543
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.380
Tae Man, why are you advocating for them?

544
00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.550
- Maybe you're in on it too.
- I'm in on it too?

545
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.849
Hey, don't push your luck.

546
00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.349
Having a mouth doesn't mean you can say anything.

547
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:51.389
- Darn you.
- Guys, let's calm down.

548
00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:53.389
She's right. We're too worked up.

549
00:37:53.389 --> 00:37:55.099
How can one not be?

550
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.400
We almost died today.

551
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.860
If that isn't the case, explain yourself.

552
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.440
Answer the darn question!

553
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.320
- You!
- That's enough!

554
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.739
Let go of me, you jerk.

555
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.239
This has been a touchy issue for you today.

556
00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:09.369
You were in on it for sure!

557
00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:10.869
- Why you...
- Don't!

558
00:38:10.869 --> 00:38:11.949
- Hey.
- You jerk.

559
00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:14.079
What was that, you jerk?

560
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.409
- Kim Chi Yeol!
- Hey!

561
00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:17.579
- How dare you?
- You started it.

562
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.079
You jerk!

563
00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:21.550
- That's enough!
- Have you lost it?

564
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.670
- What?
- That's enough!

565
00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:36.730
- Kwon Il Ha.
- Hey.

566
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:41.730
It was me.

567
00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:49.280
Soo Chul...

568
00:38:50.409 --> 00:38:51.530
and I...

569
00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:55.159
have been rigging the polls.

570
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.960
Kwon Il Ha, what are you saying?

571
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:07.719
Is this true?

572
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.389
Soo Chul and I...

573
00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:16.179
were scared at first and wanted to leave.

574
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:19.980
But the fear only fuelled our anger.

575
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.059
We wanted to wipe out the spheres!

576
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.190
You feel the same way, don't you?

577
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.239
What? You fooled us...

578
00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:29.530
just to keep hunting the spheres?

579
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.280
What are you barking on about?

580
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.119
Of course you're angry, but...

581
00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:35.409
Kwon Il Ha, are you out of your mind?

582
00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:39.039
How could you two have done that, though?

583
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.250
It would've taken more than you two to rig them.

584
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.719
It...

585
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.179
It's all my fault.

586
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:57.719
It was my idea.

587
00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:00.269
You darn prick!

588
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.940
Answer me, you prick!

589
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.610
Who was it? Who else was in on it?

590
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.239
Answer me, darn it!

591
00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:10.400
Guys.

592
00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:12.570
I'm sorry.

593
00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:15.909
Kim Yu Jung?

594
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.170
And Cho Jang Soo?

595
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:35.800
What on earth?

596
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:38.559
Why would you do this?

597
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:42.190
Were you all in on it?

598
00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:45.980
Kim Yu Jung and Cho Jang Soo.

599
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.940
I don't want to believe it.

600
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.110
Is this why you suggested a poll?

601
00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:56.070
No, they wouldn't have.

602
00:40:56.579 --> 00:40:57.699
Right?

603
00:40:57.909 --> 00:41:00.659
Tell us, Yu Jung. Tell us!

604
00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:02.409
Why can't you say anything?

605
00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:04.960
Tell us why you fooled us this second!

606
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.170
Tell us!

607
00:41:17.679 --> 00:41:20.179
I couldn't put us all in danger.

608
00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:24.349
What are you talking about?

609
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.769
Is it true that you deceived us?

610
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.820
That's insane.

611
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.239
It can't be. I...

612
00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:36.159
Why, though?

613
00:41:36.699 --> 00:41:37.699
Because...

614
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.079
Because...

615
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.090
Because the CSAT was cancelled.

616
00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.210
What?

617
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.670
Kim Duk Joong, what are you saying?

618
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.050
- What was that?
- What?

619
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.219
- Kim Duk Joong.
- What did he just say?

620
00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.469
What do you mean by that?

621
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:00.429
Why was the CSAT cancelled?

622
00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:04.269
That's right. The CSAT was cancelled.

623
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.980
The other units must've received the radio message.

624
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.440
Don't you lie to us.

625
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.110
That's a lie, isn't it?

626
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.949
It's true.

627
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.789
I knew it, darn it!

628
00:42:23.539 --> 00:42:24.579
No.

629
00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:27.329
The CSAT hasn't been cancelled. Who said that?

630
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.090
It's a lie, isn't it?

631
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.420
There's no way the CSAT would've been cancelled.

632
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.469
Young Soo, calm down.

633
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:36.969
Tell me that it's a lie!

634
00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:38.260
Kook Young Soo!

635
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.510
The CSAT was already cancelled when the spheres first landed.

636
00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:44.849
But how is that important right now?

637
00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:46.769
It's more important than my life! Darn it!

638
00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.599
Don't you know what life until now...

639
00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:53.150
has been designed around?

640
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.360
So don't you lie to me.

641
00:42:57.739 --> 00:42:59.909
Don't you lie, darn it!

642
00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:07.039
Duk Joong, please.

643
00:43:07.579 --> 00:43:10.079
Please tell me it's not true.

644
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.670
Duk Joong.

645
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.920
Duk Joong, please.

646
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.889
Duk Joong, please.

647
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:25.559
Is it true that the CSAT...

648
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:27.389
was cancelled?

649
00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:30.559
How did you hear about it when we've lost communication?

650
00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:35.320
(Yongdu Service Area)

651
00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:47.409
Kids from the science high school came by today.

652
00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:50.289
They received a radio message about the CSAT being cancelled...

653
00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:53.500
and were on their way to Seoul.

654
00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.710
We said we didn't hear about it...

655
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.380
because our radio died.

656
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.599
And?

657
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:09.480
They opened it up to fix it for us,

658
00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:12.099
only to find that someone had sabotaged it.

659
00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:14.650
What are you talking about? Are you serious?

660
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.570
Someone deliberately took it off the circuit board.

661
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.900
What?

662
00:44:21.489 --> 00:44:22.860
Darn it.

663
00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:34.250
Why would someone do that?

664
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.380
Who?

665
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.139
Hey. Hey!

666
00:44:47.139 --> 00:44:49.429
Did you all do this too?

667
00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:51.349
Explain it!

668
00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:54.480
You broke the walkie-talkie to hide the cancellation of CSAT?

669
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.190
You rigged the vote too!

670
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.110
This is absurd.

671
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.570
Why are there so many issues?

672
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.530
Does anyone have more? Tell me if you have.

673
00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:04.659
Say something! Darn it!

674
00:45:05.489 --> 00:45:08.159
We've worked so hard to fix the walkie-talkie.

675
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:11.199
You saw everything. Why did you do it?

676
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.329
Why?

677
00:45:13.789 --> 00:45:15.670
Did you want us to die all together?

678
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.750
Say something! Why?

679
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.469
The CSAT isn't cancelled.

680
00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:30.519
I doubted it...

681
00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:32.599
when I heard the news from the walkie-talkie.

682
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.769
Even if it was true, I didn't want to believe it.

683
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.440
Why did you lie to us?

684
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.860
Was it important to kill...

685
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.199
more spheres whether we get killed or not?

686
00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:50.699
Are you insane? Are you crazy?

687
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.880
Explain this situation right now.

688
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.840
What's all this nonsense?

689
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:07.340
The day we heard the news of CSAT cancellation,

690
00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:10.809
Soo Chul and I...

691
00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:14.179
were on guard.

692
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.150
- What?
- I told you.

693
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.730
It has been decided to cancel the CSAT this year.

694
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.360
The extra points you've earned so far will be applied next year.

695
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.409
So keep the operation going without any deserter. Over.

696
00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:32.329
What? Wait. Hello?

697
00:46:32.909 --> 00:46:34.869
Hello? Wild Goose. This is Seagull.

698
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.579
Wild Goose. Respond!

699
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.170
Darn it...

700
00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:48.679
What nonsense is this?

701
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.800
The CSAT is cancelled, but they want to keep the operation going?

702
00:46:55.269 --> 00:46:58.190
How many of us got killed until today?

703
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.940
Now the CSAT is cancelled.

704
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.110
They kept us by using extra points.

705
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.480
The jerks are doing whatever they want to.

706
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.989
They must think of us as pushovers.

707
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.449
Darn it.

708
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.409
Darn it!

709
00:47:16.039 --> 00:47:17.039
Where are you going?

710
00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:20.079
What do you mean? I shall tell others.

711
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.920
Wait.

712
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.510
Let's do this instead.

713
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.320
Is it okay to do this?

714
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.449
If they find out, they'll want to go home.

715
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.110
It doesn't make sense to go to Seoul at this point.

716
00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:57.619
- But...
- Tell me.

717
00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.750
Kwon Il Ha. Did you stay because of the CSAT?

718
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.460
No, right?

719
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.920
You didn't care about extra points.

720
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.170
Why did you stay?

721
00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:11.719
For goodness' sake.

722
00:48:16.809 --> 00:48:19.679
This isn't up to adults.

723
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:23.349
It's up to us.

724
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.440
I need to end this war.

725
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.860
I'll kill all the spheres.

726
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.989
Then I want to go back to school.

727
00:48:35.989 --> 00:48:38.619
So we broke the walkie-talkie.

728
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.869
Soo Chul and I were going to keep the secret to ourselves.

729
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.420
But...

730
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.050
(Yongdu Service Area)

731
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.840
There's only one vote difference.

732
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.599
At this rate, there will be more votes to go to Seoul.

733
00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:59.679
We promised that since the start.

734
00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:03.309
It's more dangerous to go now. You know that too.

735
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.900
There's no way to communicate.

736
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.820
What's the point of continuing the duty?

737
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280
No.

738
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:13.659
We need to follow the operational order until we get through.

739
00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:16.239
There'll be more spheres as we get closer to Seoul.

740
00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:18.409
It's better to stay here since we're used to being here.

741
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.659
There is some food for us to last here too.

742
00:49:21.199 --> 00:49:23.789
The others got adjusted too.

743
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.460
If we leave the operational area at our disposal...

744
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.300
and don't join them,

745
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.469
we'll be in big trouble.

746
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:36.719
You're right. But...

747
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:38.050
Let's...

748
00:49:39.469 --> 00:49:40.719
make a yes vote...

749
00:49:41.639 --> 00:49:43.599
in advance for the next voting.

750
00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:46.150
You want to manipulate the vote?

751
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.860
Just until we fix the walkie-talkie.

752
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.230
We don't know which area is safe. We can't just move without a plan.

753
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.610
Otherwise, we'll all be in danger.

754
00:49:57.909 --> 00:49:59.949
I don't want to see...

755
00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:02.500
anyone dying again.

756
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.630
Okay.

757
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.139
Just until we fix the walkie-talkie.

758
00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:21.679
Just until then.

759
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:38.780
What are you doing up at this hour?

760
00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:42.289
I agree with the vote rigging.

761
00:50:44.289 --> 00:50:45.829
But it will be hard for you two to do it.

762
00:50:46.409 --> 00:50:47.500
We'll help.

763
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.039
No. Guys...

764
00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:52.920
I broke the walkie-talkie.

765
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.920
What? What are you talking about?

766
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:57.130
Are you crazy?

767
00:50:57.929 --> 00:50:58.929
Wait.

768
00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:09.019
They can only find us through radio.

769
00:51:09.809 --> 00:51:11.650
- They aren't coming.
- How do you know that?

770
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:12.940
The CSAT is cancelled.

771
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.150
- What?
- The CSAT is cancelled.

772
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.900
But they want us to continue with the operation.

773
00:51:20.949 --> 00:51:22.119
You get what it means, right?

774
00:51:22.949 --> 00:51:24.659
To adults, we're just tools.

775
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.659
They have no intention to protect us.

776
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.039
Not at all.

777
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.590
I don't care if we're just a tool.

778
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.630
I'm not going to Seoul.

779
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.710
I'm not sure...

780
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:40.550
if I'll be able to...

781
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.889
face my dead friends.

782
00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.940
I thought it was nonsense at first.

783
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.530
But think about it.

784
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.400
This place is relatively safe.

785
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.659
It's too dangerous to go to Seoul.

786
00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:02.530
Then is it not dangerous to stay here forever?

787
00:52:02.699 --> 00:52:04.159
There are less spheres here.

788
00:52:04.159 --> 00:52:05.739
We have food to endure for a while too.

789
00:52:05.739 --> 00:52:07.000
Stop lying!

790
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.789
Hey. What are you trying to do?

791
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.840
What's the reason you're keeping us all here?

792
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.630
You could've told us the truth from the start.

793
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.849
I thought you'd be upset if you found out...

794
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.599
that the CSAT was cancelled.

795
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.019
The CSAT?

796
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:34.769
Hey. Darn it. What about having the CSAT cancelled?

797
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.030
Why would that matter at this point?

798
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.690
Do you think CSAT kept us to live like this?

799
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.409
Why didn't you ask our opinions?

800
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:44.619
Why?

801
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:46.829
Who are you to do that?

802
00:52:50.369 --> 00:52:51.369
I'm sorry.

803
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.420
Darn it.

804
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.719
I can't believe you all now.

805
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:07.349
Did you kill Soo Chul because he wanted...

806
00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:08.929
to tell the truth?

807
00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:10.980
- Are you insane?
- Yes, we are!

808
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:13.190
I'm going crazy because of you all.

809
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:14.440
We saw it today.

810
00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:16.860
Humans are scarier than the spheres.

811
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.570
You all are...

812
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.320
the same as the criminals.

813
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.000
I've really...

814
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.670
thought about it...

815
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.460
hundreds of times.

816
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.179
About the way we can all be together.

817
00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:48.969
The platoon commander said...

818
00:53:49.139 --> 00:53:50.889
that we have to protect each other.

819
00:53:51.769 --> 00:53:54.099
That's how we can survive until the end.

820
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:58.610
But once you hear that CSAT is cancelled,

821
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:02.989
I thought you would all scatter.

822
00:54:05.199 --> 00:54:08.199
So I wanted to keep you all using the CSAT.

823
00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:12.329
I'm sorry.

824
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.289
I thought we should stick together...

825
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:19.210
even by taking severe measures.

826
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.130
Guys...

827
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.929
We...

828
00:54:29.719 --> 00:54:32.010
We need to survive.

829
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:34.309
Right?

830
00:54:36.639 --> 00:54:37.650
I'm sorry.

831
00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.730
I didn't mean to lie to you from the start.

832
00:54:50.699 --> 00:54:51.869
You should have...

833
00:54:53.239 --> 00:54:54.909
told us that in the first place.

834
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:04.420
You should've...

835
00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.550
discussed it with all of us.

836
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.679
Now, it's too late.

837
00:56:33.639 --> 00:56:34.639
Now,

838
00:56:36.969 --> 00:56:38.389
what do we do?

839
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.610
We should go to the shelter, where our parents are.

840
00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.320
How would we know where that is?

841
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.570
We'll have to look for it.

842
00:56:57.579 --> 00:56:58.659
You know...

843
00:57:01.039 --> 00:57:03.460
Do you think Soo Chul actually died in an accident?

844
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.460
Or did something happen to him?

845
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.590
Beats me.

846
00:57:14.929 --> 00:57:16.679
Only Soo Chul will know.

847
00:57:21.929 --> 00:57:23.139
But why?

848
00:57:27.019 --> 00:57:28.150
Who?

849
00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.400
There's no evidence.

850
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.280
You might regret it...

851
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.820
once you doubt someone.

852
00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:42.659
Why did the adults...

853
00:57:44.539 --> 00:57:46.460
give us rifles?

854
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.550
They should have stopped us from holding them.

855
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:15.630
(Yongdu Service Area)

856
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.050
Compared to when we first grabbed our rifles,

857
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.840
how much will we have changed...

858
01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:02.510
by now?

859
01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:08.230
All we did was barely survive every day,

860
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.150
and we were already turning 20 soon.

861
01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.530
What awaits us at the end of this road?

862
01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:21.570
If we safely make it home,

863
01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.619
can we go back to how we were before we used these rifles?

864
01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:35.380
That day,

865
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.050
we should not have left the service area.

866
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.800
(Duty After School)

867
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:45.389
Next.

868
01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:46.679
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

869
01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:49.769
Aren't you tired?

870
01:00:52.769 --> 01:00:54.019
Of course, I am.

871
01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.570
But we're not here to hang out.

872
01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:58.610
Our mission is to eliminate the spheres.

873
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.739
We can go back once we finish the mission.

874
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.909
That's true, but everyone is exhausted...

875
01:01:06.989 --> 01:01:08.659
after the platoon commander died.

876
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.579
We just need to remember our training.

877
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.579
Let's be honest.

878
01:01:14.579 --> 01:01:17.920
I bet all seniors in this country have similar extra points.

879
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.340
Then, what would be the point?

880
01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:24.550
I have to finish the mission to stay on top.

881
01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:28.599
Don't underestimate those extra points.

882
01:01:28.599 --> 01:01:30.349
It will make a difference in the end.

883
01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:32.639
You'll take the CSAT to go to college after this, won't you?

884
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.110
Well, I guess so.

885
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.190
But...

886
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.199
Young Soo, why are you so obsessed with college?

887
01:01:47.409 --> 01:01:50.449
Well, people normally say,

888
01:01:50.869 --> 01:01:52.039
"I'd like..."

889
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:56.000
"my family to stay the same."

890
01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:59.460
But I want the opposite.

891
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.380
What do you mean by that?

892
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.050
My mom and dad work from dawn till dusk.

893
01:02:08.679 --> 01:02:10.679
When they come home, we don't have the luxury of talking.

894
01:02:10.679 --> 01:02:12.559
They just go straight to bed.

895
01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:14.519
And at dawn,

896
01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.059
while my parents groan in pain,

897
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.400
I study with earplugs on.

898
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.449
Sure, war is dreadful.

899
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.409
But do you know what's more dreadful?

900
01:02:30.949 --> 01:02:32.119
It's poverty.

901
01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:34.829
You guys don't know...

902
01:02:35.289 --> 01:02:37.289
what it's like to be really poor.

903
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.130
My family...

904
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.260
can never work our way out of this destitution...

905
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.059
unless we win the lottery ticket.

906
01:02:54.679 --> 01:02:56.599
For my younger siblings to go to college as well...

907
01:02:59.519 --> 01:03:02.650
and talk about what happened that day at the table...

908
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.489
To have that normal life...

909
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.409
that's insignificant to others,

910
01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:15.789
I must get accepted by a good college...

911
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.880
and get a job at a good company.

912
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.760
Can you delete this video?

913
01:03:30.219 --> 01:03:32.179
