00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.120
Gunshots.

4
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.449
- Those are gunshots, right?
- Yes.

5
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.999
Seems like it. Did something happen?

6
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.499
Let's head outside.

7
00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:39.589
We'll know then.

8
00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.059
Hey.

9
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.479
Cho Jang Soo.

10
00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:55.979
What are you doing?

11
00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.019
What? No.

12
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.940
- Don't do it.
- Wait.

13
00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:05.400
Hey!

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.029
You idiot!

15
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.449
Hey.

16
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:13.909
That scared me!

17
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.789
What is that thing?

18
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
I don't know.

19
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.179
- I'm not going.
- Come on. Hurry up.

20
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.440
No. I don't want to.

21
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.399
Darn it. Get moving. The exit is over here.

22
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.769
No, I'm not going.

23
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440
Follow me.

24
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.239
- Darn it.
- Don't go.

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.069
Seriously.

26
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.539
For goodness' sake. Darn it.

27
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.009
Kook Young Soo!

28
00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.429
Here I go.

29
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.640
Hey. What the heck are you thinking, you idiot?

30
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.480
Let go of me, punk.

31
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.110
Seriously?

32
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.580
Hey. Try it with your finger.

33
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.540
- My finger?
- Yes.

34
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.179
That tickles. It tickles.

35
00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.600
It really tickles.

36
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.730
- It does?
- Again.

37
00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.660
- Hey. What the heck?
- Help me!

38
00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.029
Get off!

39
00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.489
- Get it outside!
- Hey!

40
00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:32.969
What is that?

41
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.559
Get up. Hurry.

42
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.899
- What?
- This way.

43
00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.570
Darn it!

44
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.239
Hey. What is it?

45
00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.119
Why is it coming to me?

46
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.540
No. Hey. Im Woo Taek.

47
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.130
I caught it. I did.

48
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.880
- What? Hey, come on. Help me.
- Got it.

49
00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.719

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.850
Hey, Hee Rak!

51
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.719
- Get up.
- Darn it!

52
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:23.140
What was that?

53
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.400
I don't know.

54
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.230
- What the heck?
- Let's run.

55
00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:38.489
What do I do?

56
00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:39.739
Darn it!

57
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.989
- Darn it.
- What do I do?

58
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.960
Take this, you jerk.

59
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.670
Hey, run.

60
00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.679
Nice.

61
00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.319
- Hey.
- What?

62
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.439
- Let's go.
- Okay.

63
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.239
- Let's go already.
- Okay.

64
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.660
- Darn it.
- Got it.

65
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Hurry.

66
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.329
One, two, three.

67
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.749
Hey, hurry up.

68
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.329
No.

69
00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:05.949
- No.
- Please help us.

70

- Platoon commander!

71
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.020
Are you okay?

72
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.059
Hurry up and go.

73
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.650
Didn't you hear me? Go!

74
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.069
Darn it! Hurry up and evacuate!

75
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.739
- The exit is over there.
- What about Cho Jang Soo?

76
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.819
Two, three.

77
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.489
Woo Taek!

78
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.119
Go get it.

79
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.710
- Hurry up and shoot the sphere!
- I'm scared.

80
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.210
- Hurry up.
- The gun won't work.

81
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.210
What are you saying?

82
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.210
- Why won't you shoot?
- The gun won't work, you idiot!

83
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.970
You were trained to shoot.

84
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.429
It won't work, okay?

85
00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.850
- Woo Taek!
- Darn it, the gun won't work!

86
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.179
Just shoot at it!

87
00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.850
Hurry up, Woo Taek!

88
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.410
- Platoon commander.
- Platoon commander.

89
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.670
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

Let's leave.

(Safe Booth)

94
00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:13.710

(From Grade 3 Class 2)

98
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.160
How did this happen?

99
00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:01.920
I've contacted the nearby unit to recover the bodies.

100
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.219
Did you give them bullets?

101
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.349
Yes. Three each.

102
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.990
What you saw today...

103
00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:34.829
are the divisions of the sphere that fell from that sky.

104
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.829
Those separated smaller spheres...

105
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.290
attack people...

106
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.050
and devour them.

107
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.339
"Devour them?"

108
00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:50.010
You are being trained...

109
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.760
to kill those spheres.

110
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.390
Darn it.

111
00:09:59.939 --> 00:10:00.979

112
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.410
(Warning Notice)

113
00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:23.790
Prepare to shoot.

114
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.339
Woo Taek and So Yoon. Prepare to shoot.

115
00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:37.809
I'm throwing my helmet to the front.

116
00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:41.270
If the smaller spheres attack, everyone shoots. Understood?

117
00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:42.979
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:29.609
Don't shoot!

119
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:32.449
Cease fire!

120
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.959
- Hey.
- Ae Seol.

121
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.880
Hey, Woo Hee Rak!

122
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.849
Are you okay?

123
00:11:58.679 --> 00:11:59.719
Are you hurt anywhere?

124
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.179
Are you all right?

125
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.059
- Are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

126
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.479
We were worried about you.

127
00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:07.689
- Where were you? Darn it.
- Help him.

128
00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:25.709
Private No Ae Seol.

129
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.260
Everything's okay now.

130
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.890
Move faster!

131
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:47.849
- Move faster!
- Move faster!

132
00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:51.109
- Be quick and precise.
- Move!

133
00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:52.900
- Be quick.
- Hit harder.

134
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.490
- Move faster!
- Move faster!

135
00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:57.280
- Move quickly.
- One.

136
00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.240
- Why aren't you moving?
- Two.

137
00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:01.329
- One.
- One.

138
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.729
Hey, what's up with them?

139
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.819
Didn't they go shooting?

140
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.400
What happened to them?

141
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.030
- I think they got hurt badly.
- It's...

142
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.030
What on earth happened?

143
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.030
Darn it.

144
00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:47.579
(Kook Young Soo)

145
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.179
Have a seat.

146
00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:14.729
The official investigation ends today. Well done.

147
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:16.150
What will...

148
00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:18.199
happen now?

149
00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.199
You will either be transferred to another unit...

150
00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:22.410
or get discharged early if you want.

151
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.740
I am talking about the spheres.

152
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.920
It's a state of war, as serious as a DEFCON Level One.

153
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.079
A mobilization order will be issued.

154
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.880
Reserve forces and even civilians will be drafted.

155
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.589
There's a chance even high school seniors will be drafted.

156
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.390
Even students?

157
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.020
One sphere destroyed an entire division of the army.

158
00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:49.640
Imagine all of them up there dropping down.

159
00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:52.770
The number we have now will be nowhere enough then.

160
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.229
But they are still students.

161
00:14:55.109 --> 00:14:57.229
- Will they accept the situation?
- We will make them accept it.

162
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.240
There's...

163
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.530
the CSAT, you know.

164
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.949
We can never hold the CSAT.

165
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:11.579
You know that better than anyone, sir.

166
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.670
They will all die in vain.

167
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.209
They will die even if they don't do anything.

168
00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.550
At least give them guns.

169
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.380
I am not trying to kill them.

170
00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:25.219
I am trying to save them.

186
00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.020
(Yoo Ha Na)

187
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400
(Mathematics, Type Ga)

188
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:07.910
This isn't...

189
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.370
a dream, right?

190
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.250
Did Ms. Park...

191
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:17.000
really...

192
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:19.829
Really...

193
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.099
(Yoo Ha Na)

194
00:17:32.809 --> 00:17:33.930
I am sorry.

195
00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:37.139
I didn't intentionally not open the car door.

196
00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.899
I was scared.

197
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.780
Never mind. I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

198
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.399
I am sorry, Bo Ra.

199
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:50.030
I am going home.

200
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.700
I can't stay here any longer.

201
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.619
So Yeon.

202
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.250
I am going home too.

203
00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.079
Darn it. In the end, they just want us to fight that thing.

204
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.629
- Darn it.
- Right. I'm going home too.

205
00:18:02.629 --> 00:18:04.000
Will you stop acting like a child?

206
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.589
I don't care about college or getting extra points for CSAT.

207
00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:08.680
Will you think before you act?

208
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.389
Don't just pack up your bag right away.

209
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.970
Never mind. I am going too.

210
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.559
- I'm going too.
- Don't go.

211
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.099
Hey. Don't do this.

212
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:23.899
I'm going home.

213
00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:24.980
Sit.

214
00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:27.859
Screw that.

215
00:18:29.069 --> 00:18:30.109
Sit!

216
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.419
Take a seat first.

217
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.559
It's dangerous outside.

218
00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.149
School is the safest place for now.

219
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.020
Safe?

220
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.069
Our homeroom teacher died.

221
00:19:07.569 --> 00:19:09.319
And we heard Young Hoon died too.

222
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.319
And you call that safe?

223
00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:13.450
Being protected by someone else doesn't mean you will be safe.

224
00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.079
You have to protect yourself.

225
00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:18.829
And school is training you to do that.

226
00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:20.460
But you saw us. We can't even shoot a gun.

227
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.619
So how can we...

228
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.089
How can we protect ourselves?

229
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.669
Just send us home.

230
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:29.379
We will stay put at home.

231
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.379
Then we will be all right, right?

232
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.680
Please send us home.

233
00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:36.139
I want to go home.

234
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.849
Right.

235
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.730
Let's say you went home.

236
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.480
What if the spheres attack your home?

237
00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:52.069
What will you do then?

238
00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:53.319
(Lee Soon Yi)

239
00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:03.079
The night training will be held as scheduled.

240
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.790
- What?
- What?

241
00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:07.040
Better get ready for it.

242
00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:12.169
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

243
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.800
Darn it.

244
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.599
Despite what the platoon commander said,

245
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.309
some of you must still want to go home.

246
00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:30.069
I think we should either all go together...

247
00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:32.649
or...

248
00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.030
all stay together.

249
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.530
I think nothing will come of it if we don't come to an agreement.

250
00:20:41.829 --> 00:20:42.950
You all saw it.

251
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.869
Platoon commander is right.

252
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.460
If we go outside like this, we will fall prey to the spheres.

253
00:20:49.129 --> 00:20:52.419
I'd rather stay here than die miserably outside.

254
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:55.379
Darn it. What difference does it make if we stay here though?

255
00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:56.839
Let's just go!

256
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.339
Did you hear what he said?

257
00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:00.180
We have to act as a team.

258
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.849
If you think about it,

259
00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:02.889
all of this happened because you didn't act as a team, you know.

260
00:21:02.889 --> 00:21:04.349
Darn it.

261
00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.599
What did you just babble about, Bo Ra?

262
00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.899
You want me to babble about some more?

263
00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.480
Is it time to quarrel?

264
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.859
What then? What do you suggest we do?

265
00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:14.280
What do you want me to do?

266
00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:17.490
Right. It was our fault.

267
00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.369
Hee Rak,

268
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.579
it was our fault, you know. Right?

269
00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:26.040
Let go, you idiot.

270
00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:37.470
Guys.

271
00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:40.139
I am sorry.

272
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.020
So you are saying...

273
00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:47.980
it's better to stay here together?

274
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.190
Let's not get too extreme.

275
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.859
Let's hear what everyone has to say.

276
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.230
Hear what everyone has to say? What for?

277
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.399
Just take a vote.

278
00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:56.440
Whether we will go...

279
00:21:57.569 --> 00:21:58.659
or stay.

280
00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:03.869
All right. Let's decide by show of hands.

281
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.869
Who thinks we should go home?

282
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.960
You darn idiots.

283
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.710
- Won't you raise your hands?
- Kimchi.

284
00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:30.520
Darn it.

285
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.190
- Il Ha!
- You selfish jerk.

286
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:35.480
Raise your hand.

287
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.069
I said raise your hand!

288
00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:38.530
- Stop it, Il Ha.
- Say what?

289
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.819
Everyone has their own opinion and story.

290
00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:43.369
What story? The extra points?

291
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.290
Even if your homeroom teacher and your classmate died,

292
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.450
you are happy as long as you get the extra points for CSAT?

293
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.119
How about you then?

294
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.919
Why didn't you say anything when you knew about Young Hoon?

295
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.629
If you told us, things would have changed.

296
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.550
He was an outcast, and we never cared about him anyway.

297
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.430
Or did you care?

298
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.559
You must've been happy.

299
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.389
Your ranking will go up once he's gone.

300
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.309
Darn it!

301
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.649
We gathered to have a discussion,

302
00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:19.530
not to fight.

303
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.700
So what is your brilliant idea?

304
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.240
Should we all die here?

305
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.409
Darn it!

306
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.750
Hey.

307
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.040
We are not real soldiers, are we?

308
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:35.079
I am going home.

309
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.169
If you want to stay, stay all you want.

310
00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:39.379
That's why we should discuss it and come to an agreement.

311
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.220
I don't know about other things.

312
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.680
I just can't stand her. Send her away.

313
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.349
Why are you blaming Ae Seol?

314
00:23:48.349 --> 00:23:51.230
We won't die because of the spheres. We will die because of her.

315
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.230
That's why we should send her away.

316
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.849
We have to come together.

317
00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:56.770
Why do you keep trying to fight?

318
00:23:57.609 --> 00:23:58.690
You all saw it.

319
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.440
After all we've been through, nobody asked...

320
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.609
if we are all right...

321
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.700
and how tough it must have been.

322
00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:09.369
Did anyone ask that?

323
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.250
That's who we always have been.

324
00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.919
When it comes to CSAT,

325
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.829
we can't say anything.

326
00:24:17.129 --> 00:24:18.169
Right.

327
00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:22.550
They know that CSAT is our weak spot.

328
00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:26.220
Right.

329
00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:28.849
Let's stop getting fooled by what the adults say.

330
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.230
Right.

331
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.030
Let's take a vote again by show of hands.

332
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:50.740
Who thinks we should go home?

333
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.930
Guys...

334
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.770
Yes?

335
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.399
Something terrible has happened,

336
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.980
but what if nothing happens after this?

337
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.399
We'll be the only ones who don't get additional points.

338
00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:27.780
If so, I'll be at a huge disadvantage...

339
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.700
- Hey!
- Kwon Il Ha!

340
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.700
You can wait a million years, but the CSAT won't happen for you.

341
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.040
Raise your hand.

342
00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:35.909
Raise your hand, you piece of crap!

343
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.790
- Stop that.
- You jerk!

344
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.589
- Let go of me. Get back here!
- Stop it.

345
00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:43.129
- Stop that.
- Let go of me!

346
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.389
Young Soo.

347
00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:57.389
I'm begging you.

348
00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.899
I can't stay here anymore.

349
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:01.899
I'm...

350
00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:04.399
I'm too scared.

351
00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:07.609
Let me go to my mom, Young Soo.

352
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.409
Please!

353
00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:38.430
(Operation Sphere Removal)

354
00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:40.230
(Concentrated in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province)

355
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.270
(Sungjin High School 2nd Semester)

356
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.359
(November 18: Day of CSAT)

357
00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:09.839
The whole class agreed on this.

358
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.720
(Petition)

359
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.089
We all want to go home.

360
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:25.940
It was just one.

361
00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:30.609
Just one sphere killed hundreds of soldiers.

362
00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:35.740
The area is now crawling with spheres,

363
00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:37.740
so how do you expect to go home?

364
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.619
Even if you do go home,

365
00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:48.129
- your parents won't be there.
- What?

366
00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:49.919
A nationwide evacuation order has been issued.

367
00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:53.180
They will have arrived at the shelter by now.

368
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.970
That's crazy. Are you sure?

369
00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:01.980
You're lying, aren't you?

370
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.770
Can't you take us to the shelter as well?

371
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.440
You are current soldiers of the military,

372
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.359
and we are at war.

373
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.450
You may not leave as you please.

374
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.079
So don't get any ideas...

375
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.659
and prepare for training.

376
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:32.089
Are you kidding me?

377
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:37.430
Seriously?

378
00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:00.909
Are you okay?

379
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.079
Shut it.

380
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.290
What?

381
00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:10.839
What are you looking at?

382
00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:13.629
I'm worried, that's all.

383
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.129
So what if you are, you prick?

384
00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:21.760
Young Hoon's death...

385
00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:25.849
- isn't on you, so...
- Hey.

386
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.730
Run your mouth again,

387
00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:30.559
and I'll kill you myself.

388
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:41.619
Pick up the pace!

389
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.490
Faster!

390
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.659
Run faster.

391
00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:51.040
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

392
00:29:51.879 --> 00:29:53.000
Run!

393
00:29:54.129 --> 00:29:55.589
Run if you wish to survive.

394
00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:59.589
Run!

395
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.260
Get moving, Private.

396
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.099
Run.

397
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.430
Keep guns pointed up.

398
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.059
Run faster!

399
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.349
Run if you wish to live.

400
00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.270
Run!

401
00:30:14.109 --> 00:30:16.530
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

402
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.490
Keep going.

403
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.569
Get up and move if you want to live.

404
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.909
Private No Ae Seol,

405
00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:25.950
do you wish to be a burden on your friends?

406
00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:29.750
No, sir!

407
00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:31.500
Then, run.

408
00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:32.919
Run!

409
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.629
- Keep moving if you want to live.
- Darn it!

410
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.800
No one will protect you.

411
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.260
Don't be a burden on your friends.

412
00:30:43.139 --> 00:30:44.680
Run if you wish to live.

413
00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:48.099
Move faster.

414
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.020
No one will protect you.

415
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.730
Survive on your own.

416
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.069
Keep moving if you wish to live.

417
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.319
Run!

418
00:31:02.409 --> 00:31:04.579
Private. Get running.

419
00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:07.119
Run if you wish to live!

420
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.500
I can't.

421
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.839
No, I can't.

422
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.589
Commander, I can't.

423
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:27.809
I can't do this anymore.

424
00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.329
I'm scared.

425
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.300
This never made sense from the start.

426
00:31:59.629 --> 00:32:01.050
How could we go through this training...

427
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.470
and take the CSAT at the end of the year?

428
00:32:03.879 --> 00:32:07.139
We were too naive like a bunch of fools.

429
00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:10.470
Hey, we weren't the ones who were naive.

430
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.099
The adults wronged us.

431
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.730
That platoon commander...

432
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:18.230
enjoys torturing us.

433
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.899
And here I thought he was a good person.

434
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:25.359
Don't think that way about the platoon commander.

435
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.740
Darn it!

436
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.540
The training will kill me at this rate, not the spheres!

437
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.710
You'll find out later on...

438
00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:38.540
that the platoon commander...

439
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.839
is watching out for you.

440
00:32:55.899 --> 00:32:57.899
As if.

441
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.800
The spheres are immune to weapons of mass destruction.

442
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.970
And with rifles, all we can do is slow them down.

443
00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:17.689
Only depleted uranium ammunition has been working on them so far.

444
00:34:17.979 --> 00:34:19.019
Depleted uranium ammunition?

445
00:34:19.479 --> 00:34:21.060
But only on those small ones.

446
00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:23.019
Those medium-sized seem to be immune.

447
00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:42.669
But the problem is this.

448
00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:44.589
We don't have enough ammo,

449
00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:47.510
and we lack in the number of rifles...

450
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.800
that can shoot the spheres.

451
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.220
That is why...

452
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.180
we had to recruit high school seniors.

453
00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:09.700
Okay.

454
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.330
The coast is clear. We're free to talk.

455
00:35:20.749 --> 00:35:23.080
Must we stay like this?

456
00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:25.459
We don't have any other option.

457
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:26.839
Darn it.

458
00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:30.800
Honestly, I don't believe that our parents went to the shelter.

459
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.470
What if he lied to make us stay?

460
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.350
As if the platoon commander...

461
00:35:39.729 --> 00:35:41.560
He isn't one to lie.

462
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.939
Darn.

463
00:35:43.189 --> 00:35:46.519
I want to believe him, but I don't trust anyone anymore.

464
00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:53.109
Let's confirm it ourselves.

465
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:54.950
How stupid are you?

466
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.370
We can't call, and the Internet is down.

467
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.249
And that is your limit. Of course, we can still communicate.

468
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.120
Is there a way to contact them?

469
00:36:06.459 --> 00:36:07.709
What do we have a lot of in school?

470
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:10.839
I don't know.

471
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.300
Pigeons.

472
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.010
We'll tie a note around their legs and...

473
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.180
Somebody shut him up.

474
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.930
Let's rewind it a few steps.

475
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.390
We have no other option but to confirm it ourselves.

476
00:36:25.689 --> 00:36:27.939
Here. I'll go.

477
00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:30.359
Kimchi, shouldn't you go as well?

478
00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:32.359
Me? Why me?

479
00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:34.240
Your house is the closest.

480
00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:35.910
It's the easiest place to confirm.

481
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.410
- But...
- Chi Yeol will come with.

482
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.740
But I'm not ready for this.

483
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.120
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

484
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.379
Our house is quite far away.

485
00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:52.209
(Restroom)

486
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.019
- We'll break out from here.
- What?

487
00:37:09.979 --> 00:37:11.399
How can one go through there?

488
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.319
Jang Soo and I won't be able to manage,

489
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:16.950
so I'm off.

490
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.169
This is a school of history and tradition.

491
00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:27.539
What could I mean by that?

492
00:37:32.169 --> 00:37:34.089
- Why you...
- It's old.

493
00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:35.970
Watch.

494
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.510
I get it. What?

495
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.140
Careful.

496
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.310
Careful.

497
00:37:46.479 --> 00:37:49.229
Darn it.

498
00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.740
Be careful.

499
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240
Be careful.

500
00:38:13.089 --> 00:38:14.129
Follow me.

501
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:25.430
We're going too?

502
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:27.479
Jang Soo!

503
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.870
Quick!

504
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.870
You should go next.

505
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.039
Darn it.

506
00:38:49.789 --> 00:38:51.459
Hey, are you all right?

507
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:52.749
Just get out now.

508
00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:01.930
- Hey!
- Just come out now.

509
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.470
Do we really have to do this?

510
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.769
Darn.

511
00:39:13.399 --> 00:39:14.769
Hey, are you okay?

512
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:16.780
Is it Duk Joong?

513
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.609
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

514
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:25.330
Come out now. What are you doing?

515
00:39:38.669 --> 00:39:40.879
Be quiet.

516
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.950
Shoot.

517
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580
Where are they going?

518
00:40:14.249 --> 00:40:15.249
Go.

519
00:40:15.249 --> 00:40:16.499
Get down.

520
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.419
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

521
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.379
Oh, my.

522
00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.089
Who's it there?

523
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:28.430
- Goodness.
- Sorry. What shall we do?

524
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:30.810
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

525
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.060
You must be curious why you're here even when your home is not close.

526
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.439
What? Yes.

527
00:40:36.939 --> 00:40:37.939
I'm sorry.

528
00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:39.819
Why?

529
00:40:40.569 --> 00:40:41.649
Hey!

530
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.109
Duk Joong.

531
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.289
Hey!

532
00:40:50.289 --> 00:40:52.870
What are you doing here at this hour... What did you eat?

533
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:53.959
I didn't eat anything...

534
00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:02.169
Why?

535
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:03.760
- That thing...
- What is it?

536
00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:05.839
What's wrong?

537
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:07.339
What is it?

538
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:08.640
Catch me if you can!

539
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.720
That punk... Hey!

540
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.019
- Let's move.
- Let's go.

541
00:41:18.269 --> 00:41:19.649
- Oh.
- Gosh.

542
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.149
What on earth are you doing here?

543
00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:28.280
Hey, do you want to run?

544
00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:34.499
If I do that, you should...

545
00:41:34.499 --> 00:41:36.419
Gosh, what are you saying?

546
00:41:36.419 --> 00:41:37.499
"What are you saying?"

547
00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:39.879
- Follow me if I...
- What?

548
00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.589
You idiots...

549
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:45.339
- What?
- You idiots...

550
00:41:45.629 --> 00:41:47.010
Run, idiots...

551
00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:49.850
- Run, idiots.
- Run, idiots.

552
00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.850
Run, idiots!

553
00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:57.519
- Go!
- Run now!

554
00:41:57.519 --> 00:41:59.399
- Duk Joong!
- Where are you going?

555
00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:04.939
Run fast!

556
00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:06.819
Run!

557
00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:07.859
Hey!

558
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:10.319
- Wait!
- Run!

559
00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:18.620
Stop following us!

560
00:42:19.879 --> 00:42:20.999
Stop there!

561
00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:22.339
Stop!

562
00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.129
- Stop!
- Quick!

563
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.470
Sir, everything is fine!

564
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.600
Any movements on the sphere?

565
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.890
Everything is fine so far. We'll keep watching.

566
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.600
- Duk Joong!
- Gosh!

567
00:42:38.729 --> 00:42:40.649
- Stop!
- Gosh.

568
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.689
What are you doing? Come here.

569
00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:44.569
- Run!
- Run.

570
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.939
What is it?

571
00:42:57.039 --> 00:42:59.370
Catch them!

572
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.289
Catch them...

573
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.919
Did you catch them?

574
00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.220
I caught Duk Joong.

575
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.720
Oh my...

576
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.019
Second platoon, roll to the right.

577
00:43:18.019 --> 00:43:19.600
- To the right!
- To the right!

578
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600
To the right!

579
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.350
- To the right.
- Sorry.

580
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.399
Roll to the left.

581
00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:25.149
- To the left!
- To the left!

582
00:43:26.689 --> 00:43:28.689
- Stand up.
- Yes, sir!

583
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.780
Stand up!

584
00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:33.620
Okay.

585
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.990
From now on, you're not students.

586
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.080
I'll treat all of you as soldiers now.

587
00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:43.080
You can't act like a baby...

588
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:45.999
and have no privilege as a student.

589
00:43:47.169 --> 00:43:50.760
You have to follow every order I give...

590
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:53.970
as soldiers.

591
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:56.970
Do you understand?

592
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.060
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.479
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:44:00.479 --> 00:44:01.479
Second platoon, lie face down.

595
00:44:01.479 --> 00:44:03.140
- Face down!
- Face down!

596
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.310
Face down!

597
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.859
Face down!

598
00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:08.649
- One!
- One!

599
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:11.319
- Two!
- Two!

600
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:12.609
Focus!

601
00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:15.450
Gosh.

602
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:19.080
Does anyone still want to go home?

603
00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:24.419
- Second platoon, stand up.
- Stand up!

604
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:31.970
From now on, if you get out of here, it's desertion.

605
00:44:33.339 --> 00:44:35.010
And you'll be tried by court-martial.

606
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:53.490
From this very minute, anyone who leaves without permission,

607
00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.200
will be considered as a deserter...

608
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.120
and may be shot under my order.

609
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.830
Has the platoon commander gone really crazy?

610
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.370
Are they really going to shoot us?

611
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.379
No way. They won't really shoot us.

612
00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:51.289
But what if they do?

613
00:45:51.419 --> 00:45:53.249
It will hurt so bad.

614
00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:54.629
When you get shot,

615
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.510
the bullet hole is small in the front...

616
00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:01.640
but it's as large as a watermelon in the back. I heard.

617
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:04.640
That's a lie.

618
00:46:05.979 --> 00:46:07.019
Is that true?

619
00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:10.109
You can try and see.

620
00:46:11.149 --> 00:46:13.109
Are you really going to stay put?

621
00:46:13.899 --> 00:46:15.689
But there's no other way.

622
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.530
We should either endure this or hold up.

623
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.280
Aren't those the same thing?

624
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.870
To endure and to hold up.

625
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.169
So, that's the only way, I mean.

626
00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:31.999
There's a way.

627
00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:38.720
There's a way we can try.

628
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.069
Young Hoon is dead.

629
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:03.410
What?

630
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:04.740
He's dead.

631
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.410
Hey, you know Young Hoon, right?

632
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.370
- We do.
- Yes.

633
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.379
I'm not lying.

634
00:47:12.379 --> 00:47:14.419
See? I was almost dead.

635
00:47:14.419 --> 00:47:16.050
Just right there...

636
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.459
What was the reason?

637
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.430
I'm leaving.

638
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.760
- Wait.
- Let's talk for a minute.

639
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.310
Let me go.

640
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.310
We might all end up dead.

641
00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:30.729
Hey, come here quickly!

642
00:47:30.729 --> 00:47:32.149
- What is it?
- Quick!

643
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.979
I heard Ms. Park and Young Hoon are dead.

644
00:47:33.979 --> 00:47:36.109
- What?
- What?

645
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:38.819
That alien or something did that!

646
00:47:38.819 --> 00:47:40.359
Is what students in Class Two saying true?

647
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:42.319
- Is it?
- Is it?

648
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:43.740
Is the CSAT only an excuse you made...

649
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:46.450
and are you trying to make us fight against the spheres?

650
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.410
- You should tell us!
- Teacher, tell us!

651
00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.749
- What's happening?
- What's your plan?

652
00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:52.249
- What's going on?
- Calm down!

653
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.640
My class will follow what your class does.

654
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.390
Thank you.

655
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:10.180
- Just give us the signal.
- Okay.

656
00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:21.240
(Confidential)

657
00:48:21.689 --> 00:48:23.780
- Thank you.
- It's mine.

658
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.330
I think you should get some sleep.

659
00:48:34.709 --> 00:48:35.749
What about the kids?

660
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.339
They have a lot of complaints.

661
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.220
You know,

662
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.890
after what happened, isn't this too much?

663
00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.140
You know how it feels to lose a colleague.

664
00:48:55.479 --> 00:48:56.939
It's hard for us.

665
00:48:58.359 --> 00:48:59.939
It must be even harder for the kids.

666
00:49:01.859 --> 00:49:05.319
We need to give them time to mourn and console them.

667
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.080
There's no time to console them.

668
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.910
If I can save one more kid, I can be even harsher than this.

669
00:49:19.879 --> 00:49:22.089
Let's go. The kids are waiting.

670
00:49:24.669 --> 00:49:25.800
Let's go!

671
00:49:26.379 --> 00:49:27.390
Let's go!

672
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.140
- Come out!
- Let's go!

673
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.060
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

674
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.430
Let's go and take our freedom!

675
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.769
- Let's go!
- Gosh!

676
00:49:34.769 --> 00:49:36.519
- Move over!
- Let me go!

677
00:49:36.519 --> 00:49:38.229
Stop them!

678
00:49:38.229 --> 00:49:40.189
Quick!

679
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:43.189
Block them! You punk, move over!

680
00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:45.359
Push them back!

681
00:49:45.569 --> 00:49:47.030
You punks!

682
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.200
Push them back!

683
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.620
Block them!

684
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.410
Go back inside!

685
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:55.999
Darn it!

686
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.209
You punks...

687
00:50:01.709 --> 00:50:03.709
What are you doing? Go back to your classroom!

688
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:06.300
- I heard Ms. Park is dead.
- She's dead!

689
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.680
I heard it from the kids in Class Two!

690
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.390
- I heard everything!
- Is that true?

691
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.680
I don't want to die!

692
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.720
Jang Young Hoon of Class Two is dead too.

693
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.979
- Please send us home!
- Send us home.

694
00:50:16.979 --> 00:50:18.060
- Now!
- Let us go home.

695
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.600
Who said so?

696
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.810
- Gosh.
- Let's push through.

697
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:21.939
Gosh, what?

698
00:50:21.939 --> 00:50:23.979
What are you doing?

699
00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.819
Stop the kids!

700
00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:32.530
What are you waiting for?

701
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.830
Stop them!

702
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.950
Why wouldn't you let us go?

703
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.120
Why these little...

704
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.999
Listen.

705
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:45.169
Doing this won't do you any good.

706
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:46.800
You won't get any extra points...

707
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.510
for your college entrance exams.

708
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:49.930
Look, mister.

709
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.510
I don't care, so just let me go home!

710
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.810
You'll get penalty points, you punk.

711
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.519
Thanks for that.

712
00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:56.600
- Let's go!
- Okay!

713
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.560
Don't you dare!

714
00:50:58.939 --> 00:51:00.060
Let us go!

715
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.060
Stop!

716
00:51:01.899 --> 00:51:03.060
What are you doing?

717
00:51:03.729 --> 00:51:05.149
What do you think you're doing?

718
00:51:06.359 --> 00:51:07.569
Go back inside now.

719
00:51:10.149 --> 00:51:12.990
Doing this won't change anything. Hurry back inside!

720
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.620
Why must we do that?

721
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.240
We aren't even soldiers.

722
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.950
I already told you. This is all for your...

723
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.539
We don't need it.

724
00:51:20.919 --> 00:51:22.709
If it's for our sake, let us go.

725
00:51:23.209 --> 00:51:25.550
Why can't we have anything our way?

726
00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:28.669
Why can't we do what we want?

727
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:46.769
What are you waiting for?

728
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.939
Force them back inside if you must!

729
00:51:49.569 --> 00:51:50.649
Stop them.

730
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:51.899
- Get them inside now.
- No!

731
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.490
- Move!
- I'm going to go home.

732
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.950
- Let us go!
- Goodness.

733
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.289
Stop them.

734
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.580
No!

735
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.100
Stand up.

736
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.780
