(Lee Chun Ho)

4
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.000
Catch me if you can

5
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.969
Has it been a month already?

6
00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.549
(Reservist number 9, Park So Yoon)

7
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:55.929
Since we've been on our own.

8
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.009
Gosh. It feels like only yesterday...

9
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.469
that we were so scared of that little sphere.

10
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.679
(Reservist number 3, Kim Duk Joong)

11
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.679
There's something...

12
00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.689
(Reservist number 3, Kim Duk Joong)

13
00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.229
different about their eyes.

14
00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.540
Keep up, you little jerks.

15
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.920
Darn it. Let's go!

16
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Whatever, darn it.

17
00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.140
I just catch them. I have no grand plans.

18
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.560
(Reservist number 2, Kwon Il Ha)

19
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.689
I just want to destroy all of those spheres.

20
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.459
Yeon Bo Ra!

21
00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.509
Come on. There are so many of them.

22
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.479
Take that, you stupid spheres.

23
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.580
Our shooting skills improved overall.

24
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.580
We're not the same students...

25
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.870
who had their first shooting drill in the range.

26
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.000
(Reservist number 20, Cho Jang Soo)

27
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.379
If Mr. Lee were to see us now,

28
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.550
(Reservist number 20, Cho Jang Soo)

29
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.669
he would be surprised.

30
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.300
Yeon Bo Ra, are you ready?

31
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.930
Hurry up. There are so many of them.

32
00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.639
Let's go!

33
00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.939
I got you!

34
00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.939
(Danger)

35
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.110
What?

36
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400
Where did it go?

37
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.939
Darn it. I'm sure it came in here.

38
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.569
Come on. That sly prick. Darn it.

39
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.530
Gosh, this is so annoying.

40
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:27.909
Look at that jerk!

41
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.430
Get it.

42
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.360
Hey, drive steady.

43
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
Darn it. Why don't you drive then?

44
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.419
Nothing about this feels real.

45
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.250
Sometimes, it feels like I'm playing Battlegrounds.

46
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.960
(Reservist number 11, Yeon Bo Ra)

47
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.379
It feels like this is all a dream.

48
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.759
Hey, I told you to stop!

49
00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.810
Gosh. Look at that jerk.

50
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.730
Seriously? That's where you're heading to?

51
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:32.889
Gosh.

52
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.860
Come back here. It's over now. You jerk.

53
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.110
Look at that rat.

54
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.410
Come on.

55
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.750
Hide well Or I'll see a glimpse of your head

56
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.250
I wonder where the sphere went.

57
00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:59.670
You know what? In your next life, be born as a human.

58
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.750
You punk.

59
00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.629
With that said...

60
00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.339
Goodbye.

61
00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:17.939
I'm doomed.

62
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.480
I need help!

63
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.860
Guys! I need backup!

64
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.029
Somebody save me!

65
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.660
I'm just worried about my grandma.

66
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.660
(Reservist number 7, No Ae Seol)

67
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.910
Other than that, I'm okay.

68
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.620
Help!

69
00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.410
It's showtime.

70
00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:17.829
Fire!

71
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.930
Take that!

72
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.839
Die, you jerks!

73
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.730
Take that! Die!

74
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.230
I'm so relieved that the CSAT was postponed for a month.

75
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.560
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

76
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.399
I couldn't study a lot because of the war.

77
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.189
Hey, I thought they got weak in cold environments.

78
00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.029
How come they are still so strong?

79
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.199
They're adapting to the weather pretty well. How annoying.

80
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.449
I think we got rid of them all in this area.

81
00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:56.750
Let's do a status report.

82
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.709
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.500
- I have 2 left.
- I have 1 left.

84
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.709
I'm empty.

85
00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:05.050
- What?
- What?

86
00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:08.509
I mean, I'm out.

87
00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.129
I see.

88
00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.339
Really?

89
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.050
Then...

90
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.100
my fuel tank is empty too.

91
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.060
And my stomach too.

92
00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:19.769
It's empty.

93
00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.480
If we're talking about, I'm with you too.

94
00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:25.649
Me too!

95
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.110
Let's go eat.

96
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:30.069
Let's head back now.

97
00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.410
- Okay.
- Let's go.

98
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.410
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

99
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.660
I'm heading out first.

100
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.199
- Hey, wait up!
- Bye.

101
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.620
Hey, wait for us.

102
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.000
- Wait for us.
- Let's go.

103
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.829
- Catch me if you can - It'll take forever.

104
00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:41.040
Come on!

105
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.959
Let's hurry back and eat!

106
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.589
Wait for us, Duk Joong.

107
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.959
- Hurry up.
- How long will it take?

108
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.629
(Reservist number 13, Woo Hee Rak)

109
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:50.759
Do you know what irritates me the most about this?

110
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:51.879
(Reservist number 13, Woo Hee Rak)

111
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:55.050
We've adjusted to this new norm now.

112
00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.769
You think the spheres are adjusting fast?

113
00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:58.970
You guys are adapting much faster!

114
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.100
Don't you think so?

115
00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:03.189
On top of that, you guys are enjoying this!

116
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:05.860
Hey, stop complaining. Okay?

117
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.610
How can anyone enjoy this?

118
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.980
I thought we were the search team.

119
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.110
We already caught three spheres just today.

120
00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.399
You call this searching?

121
00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:15.449
We must look around to know what we should be careful of.

122
00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:17.990
So what have we learned from walking around here?

123
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.160
How much longer must we do this? Darn it!

124
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.250
If we were going to give up now, why come here in the first place?

125
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.879
And besides, do you want to forfeit the extra points we earned so far?

126
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:27.589
Shut your mouth.

127
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:29.170
Il Ha has been going easy on you lately.

128
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.670
You think that gives you the right to speak up?

129
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.300
The radio has to work for us to decide our next step.

130
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.800
Exactly! When will the walkie-talkie get fixed?

131
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.180
We're all going to get killed out here.

132
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.470
- Exactly, my point!
- "Exactly, my point."

133
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.929
That's enough. You guys are always so grumpy.

134
00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.480
Let's discuss this at home.

135
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.019
"Home?" You just called it home.

136
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:47.649
- Did you hear her?
- Yes.

137
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.360
- Guys, she...
- She said we'd discuss it at home.

138
00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:51.649
What's wrong with you?

139
00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:54.820
I don't care about the CSAT.

140
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.409
I just want to go home.

141
00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:58.870
(Reservist number 24, Hong Jun Hee)

142
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.490
I filed the consent form that day.

143
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.870
That's my biggest regret.

144
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.039
(Reservist number 24, Hong Jun Hee)

145
00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:08.250
Chi Yeol. You don't regret it?

146
00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:10.500
Gosh. It's home.

147
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.799
- I'm so tired.
- Crazy. She called it home.

148
00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.720
- We might end up at a cram school.
- We're here.

149
00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:16.679
Hey, this is our home. What else could we call it then?

150
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.100
Hey, be quiet.

151
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.350
Hey. You be quiet.

152
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.100
- Hey, it's them.
- Be quiet.

153
00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:27.059
The search team is back.

154
00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.399
Let's go. Hurry up.

155
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.440
Ridiculous. Do you think we're here on a trip?

156
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.649
We're the only ones here. Why are we doing this every day?

157
00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:34.649
Hey, be quiet.

158
00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.899
- Everyone is back, right?
- The spheres might hear us.

159
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.909
- That nuisance.
- Let's go to an easy spot.

160
00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.539
Let him be. Complaining gets him going.

161
00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:43.750
Dry shampoo!

162
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.000
- We don't have it!
- We don't have it!

163
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.960
What? You said you would get me the dry shampoo.

164
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.750
Why don't you shave your head instead?

165
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.250
Yes. That might be better.

166
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.799
Hee Rak, did you get the clam chowder I asked for?

167
00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:55.669
No clam chowder! Beat it!

168
00:09:56.549 --> 00:09:58.840
Jang Soo, can you put me in raiding party tomorrow?

169
00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.850
For the bonus points.

170
00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:01.639
- Really? I'll think about it.
- Chi Yeol.

171
00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:02.850
- Thanks.
- How about...

172
00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:04.139
the clam chowder I asked for?

173
00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:06.519
How could I get that in this rural area?

174
00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.559
But you promised!

175
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.320
Why is he taking it out on me?

176
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.730
- Good job.
- I hate the spheres

177
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.990
- I hate them - I really hate them

178
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.320
- I despise them - No

179
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.990
- This is nice.
- Right?

180
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.070
Let's play it to the guys.

- Come on.

- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

186
00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:30.539
Hey. Did you do everything you were supposed to do?

187
00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:32.090
- What?
- I don't know.

188
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.210
You guys didn't do it.

189
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.470
- What?
- You were supposed to fix the leak.

190
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.470
- Right! Darn it.
- Right! Darn it.

191
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.009
- Here.
- Gosh.

192
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.100

- She's gone mad.
- Enough is enough.

196
00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.820
You know what I think? She's not sick at all.

197
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.820
She's faking it.

198
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.779
- Gosh.
- Girls.

199
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:05.120
- She's stressing me out.
- Gosh.

200
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.539
How come her acting never gets better?

201
00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.539
Are you okay?

202
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.710
I'm hungry.

203
00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:14.039
Come to think of it,

204
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:17.460

- Here's more tuna.

- I have ssamjang.
- Ssamjang.

292
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.110
Look at that.

293
00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:33.529
Wait a second. I'll mix gochujang here and ssamjang here.

294
00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:34.950
- Here's the gochujang.
- Here's ssamjang.

295
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.779
- Can I have half and half?
- I want gochujang.

296

No, you can't.

297
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.870
- Tuna and kimchi sound good.
- I love it.

298

- I want ssamjang.

318
00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:36.549
I was checking the places we should go tomorrow.

319
00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:48.400
What are you writing?

320
00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:50.769
Is it a letter or your journal?

321
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.529
It's nothing.

322
00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:59.369
I'm not good at talking or writing.

If it weren't for the war,

330
00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:34.109
we wouldn't have spoken like this.

331
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:37.779

You're right.

333
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.160
There is a good side to this.

341
00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:06.430
But I don't think so.

342

344
00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:28.619

- You're good.
- Impressive.

346

- He's good, right?
- Yes, he is.

351
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.059
I know.

352
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.480
Impressive.

353
00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:57.779
All right.

354
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:59.900
Leave my sideburns.

355
00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:02.819
Don't worry. It's almost done.

356
00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:09.200
Okay.

- Nice.

That's not bad.

362
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:22.130
It's nice.

363
00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:26.140
Good job.

364
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.519
- Seriously.
- What is with them?

365
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.349
Cut my hair too.

366
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.059
- What?
- Just cut it at a hair salon later.

367
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.190
We don't know when we can go.

368
00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.609
It's annoying since we can't wash our hair.

369
00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:40.400
- Just cut it off.
- Still...

370
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.490
- I'd be sad.
- Me too.

371
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.819
Don't complain afterwards.

372
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.279
I won't.

373
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.160
All right then.

374
00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:50.579
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

375
00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:51.660
I can't watch this.

376
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.460
Men and women have different hair.

377
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.630
- I'll cut it short.
- Okay.

378
00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.500
Short?

379
00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:10.349
Oh, no.

What's this?

383
00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:36.289
You haven't been talking or eating much.

384
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.250
I was keeping it for myself, but you can have it.

385
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:44.720
Have it and joke around like you used to.

386
00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:47.470
I'm not a kid.

387
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.720

Wild goose.

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:14.289
This is Seagull, over.

390
00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:21.210
Wild goose, this is Seagull, over.

391
00:22:23.589 --> 00:22:24.710
It isn't working, is it?

392
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.089
It's working, but there's no signal.

393
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.970
Why did it break all of a sudden?

394
00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:37.099
About the radio...

395
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.650
Would we be able to find the parts at that place?

396
00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:41.109
- Where?
- Where?

397
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:44.650
On my way back here after removing the spheres,

398
00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:46.359
I saw a penitentiary.

399
00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:49.910
It seemed unharmed as if it didn't suffer any damage.

400
00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.410
If we go there, we may find what we need.

401
00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:57.910
What? You didn't go inside and take a look?

402
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.039
What? Oh...

403
00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:02.670
Well, we only had a few bullets left.

404
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.920
And Duk Joong kept saying he was hungry, so we just came back here.

405
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.299
Darn it. He's never helpful.

406
00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:10.299
My point exactly.

407
00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:11.299
Hold on.

408
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.759
A penitentiary? They must have communications equipment.

409
00:23:15.009 --> 00:23:16.019
We should go there tomorrow.

Okay.

416
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.579
Done!

- Oh, my.
- Nice job, Duk Joong.

Duk Joong, you're pretty good.

419
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.210
Hey.

420
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.049
Can you give me a haircut too?

421
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920
What?

422
00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.180
- It looks nice.
- Yes.

423
00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.099
I want the same haircut as Bo Ra's.

424
00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.480
Oh, sure.

425
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.349
- Should I get a haircut too?
- No.

Well...

430
00:24:17.829 --> 00:24:21.039
Just because. She already looks so pretty.

431
00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.039
I don't want her to ruin her hair.

432
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.089
Right, but why are you worried about her hair?

433
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.380
Well...

434
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.880
I'm against it too.

435
00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:33.049
I like her hair now.

What about me? What kind of hairstyle would suit me?

438
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.190
Well, anything would do.

439
00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.309

440
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.279

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.240

Ha Na.

443
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.910

448
00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:01.619
Yes, go ahead and cut it.

449
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.210
All right.

450
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.079
- Should I do it too?
- If you cut your hair...

451
00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.000
Then I'll give you a short haircut like Bo Ra's.

452
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Sure.

453
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880
Okay.

454
00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:22.849
Don't do it.

455
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.400

456
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.940
Can we do it another time?

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.309
The haircut really suits you.

467
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.480
- Right?
- Yes.

469
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.690
How do I look? Nice, right?

470
00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:11.609
Sure, it's not bad.

471
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:14.029
You look ugly.

479

- Goodness.

486
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.900
Me too.

487
00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:53.779
Give me one too.

488
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.109
Darn it. Of course, I'm submitting X.

489
00:26:59.069 --> 00:27:00.950
Everyone will submit X this time, right?

490
00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.700
We should go home.

491

492

Hey!

494
00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:22.509
Submit X.

495
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.390
You idiot!

496
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.559

Why? Is there a reason you don't want to go home?

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.079
I mean, who keeps voting to stay?

545
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.960
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

546
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.460
Hey, Soon Yi. We said we'd never ask.

547
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.380
Well, she's not wrong.

548
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.670
Do you guys not want to go home?

549
00:30:01.089 --> 00:30:02.880
What are we doing here?

550
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.299
We said we'd follow the majority opinion.

551
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.680
If you want to go back, you guys can go ahead.

552
00:30:09.849 --> 00:30:10.849
Well...

553
00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:14.230
I never said I'd leave now.

554
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.980
You're scared of going alone, aren't you?

555
00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:18.849
Whatever we do, we must do it together...

556
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:20.400
like the platoon commander said.

557
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.859
He's at it again.

558
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:27.950
Hang in there, guys.

559
00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:31.410
We said we'd follow the majority opinion until we fixed the radio.

560
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.910
Darn it! We'll all die at this rate!

561
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.710
You saw what happened yesterday. Il Ha nearly died.

562
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.829
Let's be honest. We almost died multiple times...

563
00:30:39.829 --> 00:30:41.210
even on our way here.

564
00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:43.670
It's a miracle that we're still alive!

565
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.380
No matter what we decide to do, we are in danger.

566
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:48.470
We can't move without accurate information.

567
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680
That's true.

568
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.059
Whether we follow the orders and continue with the operation...

569
00:30:53.349 --> 00:30:54.470
or go back to Seoul,

570
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.309
we need to talk to them first to decide. That's safer.

571
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.230
How long will it take for us to fix it?

572
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.730
We'll go to the penitentiary tomorrow and try to find the parts,

573
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.940
so stop whining. Okay?

574
00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:09.450
I know everyone is stressed and exhausted,

575
00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:11.200
but let's try to stay strong.

576
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.450
If the platoon commander sees us fighting like this,

577
00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:14.910
he won't be happy.

578
00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:16.079
That's right.

579
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.000
You guys keep saying that.

580
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.920
All right, Platoon Two. Time to go to bed.

581
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.710
Don't forget the order for your night duty.

582
00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:26.299
You're dismissed.

583
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.630
- Let's go.
- We should go home!

584
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.180
It's over. Come on. Let's go.

585
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.839
- Gosh...
- I'm sorry.

586
00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:33.259
- Me too.
- So many Os!

587
00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:34.809
I'll catch these jerks and beat them up to a pulp.

588
00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:36.769
- Hey, come on.
- How could this happen every time?

589
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:38.480
I have a family too!

590
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.440
- Okay, we heard you.
- I have a family too!

591
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.940
- Come on.
- You guys are way too optimistic.

592
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.359
You jerks.

593
00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:45.519
Come on.

594
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:47.490
Why does this happen every time?

595
00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:51.529
The raiding party for Squad One.

596
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:53.740
Kim Yu Jung, Cho Jang Soo, Wang Tae Man, Yeon Bo Ra,

597
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.200
Cho Young Sin, No Ae Seol, Park So Yoon, Woo Hee Rak.

598
00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:57.869
Squad Two's search team.

599
00:31:57.869 --> 00:32:00.210
Do Soo Chul, Cha So Yeon, Choi Yeon Ju, Kook Young Soo,

600
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.460
Lee Na Ra, Kim Chi Yeol, Kwon Il Ha, and Yoo Ha Na.

601
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.670
Squad One's raiding party will go to the penitentiary...

602
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.460
and find the parts for the radio. Then on your way back,

603
00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.549
take care of the spheres that the detector picked up.

604
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:12.259
Squad Two's search team will go to the hospital...

605
00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:14.009
to collect medicine and other supplies that we need.

606
00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.720
Those who will stay and stand guard are...

607
00:32:16.009 --> 00:32:18.640
Kim Duk Joong, Lee Soon Yi, and Hong Jun Hee.

608
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:19.980
All good?

609
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.349
- Yes, ma'am!
- Okay!

610
00:32:21.349 --> 00:32:22.650
I want to join the raiding party.

611
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.609
You're hurt. Just join the search team today.

612
00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.400
Can't she and No Ae swap their positions?

613
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.279
Why do you keep sending No Ae to the raiding party?

614
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:30.900
Hey, Ae Seol knows how to hit the mark.

615
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.779
She can shoot better than you. You're too impatient.

616
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:33.910
What?

617
00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:36.079
I can join the raiding party.

618
00:32:36.619 --> 00:32:39.039
I want to join the raiding party too, not the search team.

619
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.869
You still have a cold.

620
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.539
You were in the raiding party the whole month. You're overworked.

621
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.079
Join the search team today.

622
00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:48.839
Goodness. This is all pointless.

623
00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:51.470
If things go south, we'll all be in danger.

624
00:32:52.049 --> 00:32:53.130
Exactly.

625
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:56.259
Don't let your guard down. Let's stay focused, guys.

626
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.640
- We got this!
- Okay!

627
00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.769
- Let's be careful.
- By the way...

628
00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:01.980
I don't see Ha Na.

629
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.980
- What?
- What?

630
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.650
Gosh, Yoo Ha Na...

631
00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:07.569
I'll go get her.

632
00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:11.650
My goodness.

633
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.160
Ha Na.

634
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.119
Ha Na?

635
00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:22.579
Ha Na.

636
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:25.250
I'm so sorry!

637
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.170
Duk Joong.

638
00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:31.339
Yes?

639
00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:33.920
I think I have a fever.

640
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.680
Hey, you were totally fine earlier.

641
00:33:42.349 --> 00:33:43.980
You stood guard yesterday too.

642
00:33:50.569 --> 00:33:51.690
I'm really sick.

643
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.819
For real?

644
00:33:54.069 --> 00:33:56.740
I'm telling you the truth.

645
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.039
You can touch me.

646
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:07.539
Hey, you... I know you're feigning illness.

647
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.500
Touch my forehead.

648
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.219
Ha Na is sick.

649
00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.139
Whatever.

650
00:34:24.309 --> 00:34:26.690
Hey, she always pretends to be sick.

651
00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:29.860
And her acting is so awkward. Goodness.

652
00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:31.400
No!

653
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.489
Gosh.

654
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.820
She really is sick today.

655
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.199
She has a high fever. I think she has a cold.

656
00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:40.489
She must've caught a cold!

657
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.739
Is Ha Na really not feeling well?

658
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:46.369
- Gosh, I can't stand her.
- I'm not feeling well either.

659
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:47.500
- I know.
- Goodness.

660
00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:49.789
I'll swap with her.

661
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.250
Hey, Lee Soon Yi! Why would you do that?

662
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.590
All right. Then Soon Yi will swap with Ha Na today.

663
00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:00.389
Okay. Get going, Platoon Two!

664
00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:02.639
- You got this!
- We got this!

665
00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:05.849
Go!

666
00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:08.730
Go!

667
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.059
Let's go.

668
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.230
(Happy Correctional Institution, Happy Citizens)

669
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:27.159
(Building 2)

670
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.639
Nothing.

671
00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:45.309
My gosh. This is my first time entering a prison.

672
00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.429
As if it's my second time.

673
00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:49.019
First, let's look for the parts for the radio.

674
00:35:49.019 --> 00:35:50.940
We need to find a circuit board that looks like a card.

675
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.230
If you see anything that looks similar, show me or Young Sin.

676
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.570
It'll either be in the guards' office or the control room.

677
00:35:55.769 --> 00:35:56.900
Let's split up and look for it.

678
00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:10.789
Hey, for real?

679
00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:12.210
- Let's look for it together.
- Come on.

680
00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:14.630
Darn it. Open sesame!

681
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:33.059
(Wing 2)

682
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.030
Nothing, right?

683
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.110
Let's go that way.

684
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:57.420
Are we almost there yet?

685
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.260
No, hang in there just a little longer.

686
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.630
How much longer?

687
00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:06.260
You should've just stayed behind if you were going to whine like this.

688
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.849
Why did you swap with her?

689
00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:10.179
So I could take it easy tomorrow!

690
00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.849
The second day hurts the most. That's why.

691
00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:16.980
Give me your bag. Let me carry it for you.

692
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.820
Are you sure?

693
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.690
Thanks.

694
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.650
What if Na Ra decides to go out with him?

695
00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:30.489
She has no reason to reject him.

696
00:37:33.579 --> 00:37:36.880
(Last night)

697
00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:48.800
Chilli? Veggies? Jjajang?

698
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.429
Chilli? Jjajang?

699
00:37:50.429 --> 00:37:52.559
Hey, hurry up. What if someone shows up?

700
00:37:53.269 --> 00:37:55.730
Darn it. Forget the operation.

701
00:37:55.809 --> 00:37:57.059
We must eat to survive.

702
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.309
We'll starve to death at this rate.

703
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.480
Everyone will find out tomorrow.

704
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.489
They're very thorough, you know.

705
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.909
Guys, let's just go back!

706
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.199
Yes, I have to pee.

707
00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:13.409
I'm sure we'll get caught.

708
00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:15.869
Come on. We won't get caught if we only take 2 or 3.

709
00:38:15.869 --> 00:38:17.710
Everyone will assume they fell down or something.

710
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.960
Darn it. I never liked this idea.

711
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.750
We should've just gone straight back to Seoul.

712
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.630
You're all obsessed with college.

713
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.670
What are you doing?

714
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.340
- Gosh!
- Darn it.

715
00:38:27.969 --> 00:38:29.010
Oh, no!

716
00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:33.219
Done with the inventory check? Then let's go.

717
00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:35.980
Gosh.

718
00:38:37.099 --> 00:38:38.559
- Yes.
- All right.

719
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.820
Okay, let's go. Come on, guys.

720
00:38:45.739 --> 00:38:46.820
Hey!

721
00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:50.409
Gosh, what do we do?

722
00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.659
What do we do now?

723
00:38:57.289 --> 00:38:58.369
We're in trouble.

724
00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:00.210
Come on.

725
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.460
(National Tax Service Metropolitan Counselling Center)

726
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.639
Where were you?

727
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.969
- Did you steal something?
- What?

728
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:17.139
I was just asking. Why are you so surprised?

729
00:39:22.519 --> 00:39:23.650
You see...

730
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.690
I'm...

731
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:32.199
I keep feeling anxious these days.

732
00:39:32.449 --> 00:39:34.329
What? Why are you anxious?

733
00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:36.539
Why? Did something happen?

734
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.250
No. For some reason, I feel like today is the last day...

735
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.579
we can be at ease like this.

736
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.710
Weirdo. Don't make such an ominous remark.

737
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.090
So I want to tell her today.

738
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.630
What?

739
00:39:56.969 --> 00:40:01.230
I'll ask Na Ra to be my girlfriend when the war is over.

740
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:02.940
- What?
- What did you say?

741
00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:04.940
You mean, Lee Na Ra?

742
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.030
You like Lee Na Ra?

743
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.440
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

744
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.949
My goodness.

745
00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:14.159
Hey, you've got a quirky taste in women.

746
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.289
Hey, Do Soo Chul!

747
00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:18.789
So you'll confess your feelings to her in this situation?

748
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:25.000
I know for a fact that she'll think you're crazy.

749
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.170
Don't you think it's actually a good opportunity?

750
00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:31.679
"Opportunity?"

751
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.349
Just like me, she might be thinking that today is our last day.

752
00:40:38.099 --> 00:40:39.309
In times like this,

753
00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:41.559
you become sentimental.

754
00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:44.980
Yes, that's true.

755
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.400
- She might say yes right away.
- Yes, exactly.

756
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.320
Young Soo, you've never dated anyone. What do you even know?

757
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.909
I read in the column that it's easier to win over women...

758
00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:56.829
who seem to be the quiet, stern type.

759
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.369
- The column? Whatever.
- Kimchi, you've never dated either.

760
00:41:03.789 --> 00:41:05.420
Gosh.

761
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.550
Just pray for me, guys.

762
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.510
Hey, you'll tell her now?

763
00:41:16.429 --> 00:41:17.510
For real?

764
00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:24.230
Gosh, darn it.

765
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.440
My toes are so itchy that I can't sleep.

766
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.519
It's because you had frostbite and warmed them up right away.

767
00:41:29.519 --> 00:41:32.190
We'll find medicine for you at the hospital tomorrow. Hang in there.

768
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.369
Gosh, my atopic dermatitis is acting up too. This is driving me nuts!

769
00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:38.409
Hey, stop scratching.

770
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.659
Me too. I feel itchy too.

771
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.250
Hey, that's the athlete's foot.

772
00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:46.630
No, it's not.

773
00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:49.460
- Hey.
- Darn you. You scared me.

774
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.170
My gosh, Sorry...

775
00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.800
Hey, I'm sorry.

776
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.550
What? You're such a loser.

777
00:42:00.889 --> 00:42:04.059
Hey, can you get Na Ra for me?

778
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.519
- Na Ra?
- Yes.

779
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:09.059
I have to ask her something.

780
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.070
- Na Ra.
- Yes.

781
00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:18.070
Gosh, this is nuts.

782
00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:21.869
We can't go out there and mess it up.

783
00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:23.699
Hush, be quiet.

784
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.710
- Why did you want to talk to me?
- What?

785
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.170
Well, what was it?

786
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.389
Well...

787
00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:43.559
Shoot... What can I do to shoot better?

788
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.190
That idiot. That was so lame.

789
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.900
What? You want to know how you can become better at shooting?

790
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.989
Yes, I was just curious.

791
00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:57.699
Jang Soo is a good shooter too.

792
00:42:57.699 --> 00:43:01.119
Jang Soo? Right, he is.

793
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.539
Jang Soo is asleep. He went to bed early. He was snoring.

794
00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:10.880
- Hey.
- Yes?

795
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.090
At this rate, he won't even be able to bring it up. Right?

796
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.210
Totally.

797
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.050
Goodness. Soo Chul is such a sissy.

798
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.389
Well...

799
00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:27.230
My shots are the most accurate when I'm not nervous.

800
00:43:27.769 --> 00:43:30.730
I can't shoot well when I'm nervous.

801
00:43:32.559 --> 00:43:34.110
So you're saying...

802
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.570
Don't... Don't be nervous.

803
00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:40.360
That's your point, right?

804
00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:41.949
- Hey.
- Yes.

805
00:43:42.239 --> 00:43:45.119
- It's game over.
- That's what I think.

806
00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:47.250
It's game over.

807
00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.090
Oh, thank you.

808
00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.050
No problem.

809
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:03.679
It's getting late. Thanks.

810
00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:07.309
- Good night.
- Night.

811
00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:09.349
Go. Leave.

812
00:44:10.019 --> 00:44:11.980
Yes!

813
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.809
- I told you to trust me.
- Thank goodness.

814
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.400
Hey, Na Ra.

815
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.400
Yes?

816
00:44:26.909 --> 00:44:30.539
We'll go back to school once the war is over, you know.

817
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:32.500
Yes.

818
00:44:33.789 --> 00:44:36.880
Well... If we manage to return safe and sound,

819
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.340
will you be my girlfriend?

820
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.920
What?

821
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:43.929
Darn it. We're doomed.

822
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.510
Why?

823
00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:50.230
What do you mean, why?

824
00:44:51.809 --> 00:44:53.190
Na Ra, you transferred to our school...

825
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.019
and to my class when we were juniors.

826
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.570
I've had feelings for you since then.

827
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320
What?

828
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.110
Oh.

829
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:03.820
Right.

830
00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:05.739
Are you surprised?

831
00:45:07.409 --> 00:45:09.869
I'm not asking you to go out with me immediately.

832
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I'm just saying...

833
00:45:12.579 --> 00:45:13.750
if we go back to school,

834
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.170
let's study together...

835
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.460
and hang out.

836
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.130
I...

837
00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:25.679
Hey.

838
00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:27.719
Stop it.

839
00:45:31.269 --> 00:45:32.980
- I am...
- You don't...

840
00:45:34.769 --> 00:45:36.230
You don't have to answer me right now.

841
00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.230
If someone called me out suddenly...

842
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.070
and said something like this, I'd be flustered too.

843
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.159
Give it some thought before answering.

844
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.619
Just don't make me wait for too long.

845
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.269
Is she interested in someone else?

846
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:16.349
Could it be me?

847
00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.869
- Hey.
- Our eyes met again.

848
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.159
Come to think of it,

849
00:46:37.079 --> 00:46:39.460
my eyes often met Na Ra's.

850
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:43.960
Could she be interested in me?

851
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.880
It's the hospital.

852
00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:47.840
Hurry up, Young Soo.

Let's spread out.

858
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.980
Did you hear that?

859
00:47:48.489 --> 00:47:49.489
Let's check it out.

860
00:47:55.369 --> 00:47:56.949
I saw something like this.

861
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500
What was that sound?

862
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840
Hey.

863
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.590
Let's go outside.

864
00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:18.730
- Did you hear that sound?
- Yes.

865
00:48:23.099 --> 00:48:24.110
What was it?

866
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.190
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

867
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.820
- Where is the sound coming from?
- What could it be?

868
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.780
What is it? Could it be a sphere?

869
00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:38.449
No, it isn't.

870
00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:40.750
Then what is it? It's giving me the creeps.

871
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.119
I hear it again.

872
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.500
Wait a second.

873
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:46.590
Listen closely.

874
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300
What is it?

875
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.340
I know this.

876
00:48:54.889 --> 00:48:57.219
It's an SOS signal.

877
00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.269

No way.

882
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.280
Do you mean there is someone here?

883
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.550
Hey.

884
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.300
I think it's coming from down there.

885
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:18.929
Is there really someone there?

886
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.260
Everyone be careful.

887
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.519
What do you mean "be careful"? We should just go home.

888
00:50:24.429 --> 00:50:25.440
Wait.

889
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480

890
00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:30.480
- Let's go.
- Wait.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.320
No.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.800
So Yoon got over her cold,

905
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.800
but Il Ha caught it from her, so we need cold medicine.

906
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.599
Jun Hee is struggling with frostbite,

907
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.889
so we need something to treat that.

908
00:51:43.889 --> 00:51:45.389
(Reservist number 4, Kim Yu Jung)

909
00:51:45.389 --> 00:51:48.139
Don't you think Duk Joong lost weight?

910
00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:50.650
What? Not at all.

911
00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:51.730
No?

912
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.150
Young Soo is still studying hard.

913
00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.070
So Yoon doesn't seem to be able to sleep nowadays.

914
00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:00.739
I'll have to talk to her tomorrow.

915
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:03.070
- What else?
- Wow.

916
00:52:04.199 --> 00:52:05.579
How do you know all that?

917
00:52:06.449 --> 00:52:07.539
I'm a Senior Private.

918
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.329
Chi Yeol, when you record us,

919
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.420
you seem to take more footage of Na Ra than the others.

920
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.880
What?

921
00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:22.889
Na Ra? Well...

922
00:52:23.219 --> 00:52:24.929
Na Ra...

923
00:52:25.099 --> 00:52:26.099
Don't worry.

924
00:52:26.429 --> 00:52:27.929
I won't tell anyone.

925
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:30.559
Thank you.

926
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:33.269
Thank you?

927
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.150
Well...

928
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.530
What about you, Yu Jung?

929
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.409
Isn't there anything about you?

930
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.369
(Reservist number 4, Kim Yu Jung)

931
00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:46.369
Not really.

932
00:52:46.369 --> 00:52:47.449
(Reservist number 4, Kim Yu Jung)

933
00:52:50.579 --> 00:52:52.539
I'm just doing what the sergeant used to.

934
00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:57.130
I'm going to do everything I can...

935
00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.800
until the war ends...

936
00:53:01.969 --> 00:53:03.800
to make sure we can return home safely.

937
00:53:05.679 --> 00:53:07.139
Don't push yourself too hard.

938
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.190
- Chi Yeol.
- Yes?

939
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.269
If...

940
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:18.820
Just if...

941
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:21.360
What is it?

942
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:26.619
Never mind.

943
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:28.530
It's nothing.

944
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:31.119
That was lame.

945
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:37.710
