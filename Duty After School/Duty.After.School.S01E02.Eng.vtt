(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.679
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440
- What?
- What was that?

4
00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.649
That almost made me jump.

5
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:25.909
- What was that?
- What's that sound?

6
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.319
- It hurts!
- Sorry, Yeon Ju.

7
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.050
Young Hoon.

8
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.810
Young Hoon.

9
00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:36.310
Watch out!

10
00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.539
Private Chi Yeol. Are you all right?

11
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.750
Private Chi Yeol.

12
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:13.007
(Shin Hyun Soo, Lee Soon Won, Im Se Mi)

13
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.504

(Yoon Jong Bin, Lee Yeon, Ji Min Hyuk, Choi Moon Hee, Hong Xa Bin, Hwang Se In)

17
00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:38.314
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

18
00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:02.852
(Duty After School)

19
00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:08.939
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.040
Those spheres.

21
00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.999
You said that they weren't dangerous.

22
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.790
You clearly said...

23
00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.839
that the school was safe and nothing would happen.

24
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.550
But...

25
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.429
how did Young Hoon...

26
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.800
We were not able to predict Private Young Hoon's death.

27
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.140
Young Hoon...

28
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.809
was not a soldier.

29
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.769
He was a student.

30
00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.149
What do I do with my students now?

31
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.529
Shouldn't I send them home?

32
00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.739
Please keep it a secret for now.

33
00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.529
- Excuse me?
- To prevent nationwide confusion,

34
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.450
we have orders to keep our mouths shut...

35
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.619
about the spheres.

36
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.209
To minimize the confusion when this becomes known,

37
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.830
- the countermeasures are...
- A student has died!

38
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.130
Such a dangerous thing is at school, and the kids...

39
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.130
The kids are already under military supervision.

40
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.839
Everything will be handled...

41
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.929
according to military laws.

42
00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.270
I'll tell the kids.

43
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.210
Are you all right? Any injuries?

44
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.100
It's all good. I'm here for you.

45
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.069
It's not your fault, guys.

46
00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:04.790
It was an accident.

47
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.290
So, don't beat yourself up about it.

48
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.460
Come and talk to me when you're distressed,

49
00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.170
and during class...

50
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.210
You know what? You should take a few weeks off.

51
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.300
What do you say?

52
00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:26.770
Sorry.

53
00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:28.639
I'm also...

54
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.569
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

55
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.679
Let's tell them...

56
00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.470
that Young Hoon got hurt and went home.

57
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.100
Otherwise, it'll stir them up.

58
00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:12.189
I'll...

59
00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:14.860
talk to them about it later.

60
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:18.689
I hope you'll keep it from the other kids.

61
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.030
Can you do that?

62
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.660
Yes.

63
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.410
And Chi Yeol?

64
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
Hey, Kimchi.

65
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.889
Kimchi!

66
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:54.230
Hey.

67
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.520
You heard Ms. Park, right?

68
00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.400
Don't run your mouth in front of them.

69
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.319
You saw it too.

70
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.030
He started the fight with me.

71
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.829
To be fair, it wasn't even my fault.

72
00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:13.410
Young Hoon just got unlucky.

73
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.749
So, lie low...

74
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.379
unless you want to be an outcast like he was.

75
00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:38.360
(Lee Chun Ho)

76
00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:46.109
Lieutenant Lee.

77
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.740
How did the sphere attack?

78
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.079
Division? You mean that it split into pieces?

79
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.910
Can't you hear me? Lieutenant Lee!

80
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.170
Help!

81
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.380
Help!

82
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.550
Watch out!

83
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.130
Please!

84
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.679
Help!

85
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.229
Come on.

86
00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:23.479
Okay.

87
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.650
- Go!
- Seriously.

88
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.540
I heard a thud earlier.

89
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:35.079
Was there a car accident?

90
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.370
- Crap.
- All right.

91
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.709
Hey.

92
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.589
How are you studying in this situation?

93
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.800
You...

94
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.510
Ignore him.

95
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.179
Let's play.

96
00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:51.760
Here I go.

97
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:53.929
- It's my turn.
- Fine.

98
00:09:58.349 --> 00:10:00.020
- Here we go.
- Chi Yeol.

99
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.729
Didn't you hear anything outside?

100
00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.240
Why are only the two of you back? Where's Young Hoon?

101
00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.240
Well...

102
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.410
He...

103
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.000
hurt himself and went home.

104
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.209
He hurt himself? Where?

105
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.800
Just his body.

106
00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.219
How did he hurt himself?

107
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.630
He just hurt himself.

108
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:33.300
It must have been pretty bad if he had to go home.

109
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.059
Is he coming back?

110
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.390
I guess not.

111
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.309
He likes to play solo.

112
00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:45.729
No way.

113
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.650
Young Hoon said no to extra points on the CSAT?

114
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.160
- Are you smiling?
- No.

115
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.829
Well, I'm glad it's him.

116
00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:00.959
If it was a close friend of mine,

117
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.670
I would have pitied him.

118
00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:05.589
- Am I right?
- Right.

119
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.130
Good for you, Young Soo.

120
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.920
You're the top student if Young Hoon isn't here.

121
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:11.300
Are you finally living up to your name?

122
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.089
Studied Korean, Math, and English his whole life,

123
00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:15.260
- Kook Young Soo.
- Kook Young Soo.

124
00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.099
I'm not happy.

125
00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:20.770
You're holding your laughter.

126
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.890
No, I'm not.

127
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.270
- Yes, you are!
- Hey!

128
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.229
- You can't hide your smile.
- You're so happy.

129
00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:27.569
I'm really not.

130
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:28.900
Young Soo.

131
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.530
- Why do you study so hard?
- What's wrong?

132
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:33.240
You look seriously anxious.

133
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.819
- A doctor?
- A doctor?

134
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.280
Did something happen?

135
00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:53.719
No.

136
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:01.390
Starting yesterday, all high school students...

137
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.479
have started studying and getting military training.

138
00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:06.939
- ID, please.
- The authorities are putting...

139
00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:09.189
priority on safety to prevent accidents.

140
00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:11.229
Next up in the news. Last night,

141
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:13.990
spheres have dropped all over the country, including Seoul.

142
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:17.699
About 30 spheres seems to have fallen,

143
00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:19.280
- and the damage...
- Ms. Park.

144
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.829
has not been announced yet.

145
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.750
- When you come across a sphere,
- Ms. Park!

146
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.829
- Yes?
- do not approach it or touch it...

147
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:26.420
- Thank you.
- and make sure to alert...

148
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.290
the nearby troops or police force.

149
00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:30.709
Thank you.

150
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.109
(Jang Young Hoon)

151
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.199
So, those loud thuds were the spheres dropping?

152
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.199
The guys in Class Three told me...

153
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.949
that the gym was demolished.

154
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:06.000
That must have been it.

155
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.250
If it destroyed a building,

156
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.959
I bet the impact was huge.

157
00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:14.050
- You scared me!
- Come on!

158
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.550
- Sorry.
- Shoot.

159
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.179
- That was not funny!
- Awesome.

160
00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:22.260
Move! I need to write this.

161
00:13:22.349 --> 00:13:23.640
Idiot.

162
00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:26.689
That was uncool.

163
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.359
Maybe Young Hoon got hurt by one of the spheres.

164
00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:31.520
What?

165
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.030
Well, the timing's right.

166
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.150
Right. It is.

167
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.699
- This is so stupid!
- Come on!

168
00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:41.990
Get away from me.

169
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.540
- Is it reddening?
- It is.

170
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.199
- Absolutely.
- It's swelling.

171
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.079
Hey!

172
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.540
- Attention.
- At ease.

173
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.290
- Did you send the report?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.339
You got the reply, right?

175
00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:55.170
- We're working on it.
- Gosh.

176
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.469
They never told us that those things were...

177
00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.719
capable of attacking us, did they?

178
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.890
Gosh.

179
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.640
So, what do we do now?

180
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.349
The accident last night occurred out of the blue.

181
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.179
The students aren't prepared to...

182
00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.939
So, we should train them, shouldn't we?

183
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.809
Get them ready for rifle drills. Okay?

184
00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.729
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you think it's too soon?

185
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.479
Hey!

186
00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:18.030
They could be on the battlefield in no time.

187
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.030
We should at least teach them how to shoot before that.

188
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.319
Get to work now!

189
00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.829
You fire a gun at a monkey hanging on a tree.

190
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.880
The scared monkey lets go of the tree and free falls.

191
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.880
Then,

192
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.719
can the bullet hit the monkey?

193
00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.510
Anyone?

194
00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:46.469
At least, try and make a guess.

195
00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.020
Gosh.

196
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.729
Come on. How many ambulances are there today?

197
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.900
It's so loud.

198
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.059
You're loudest.

199
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.479
Close the windows.

200
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:56.819
- Come on! It's hot.
- It's hot.

201
00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:58.030
But it's hot.

202
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.490
Turn on the air-conditioner.

203
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.449
There's another ambulance.

204
00:15:03.449 --> 00:15:04.990
Oh, gosh.

205
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:06.449
Hey.

206
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.540
- Doesn't it sound like that?
- Like what?

207
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.620
"Death or life."

208
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.709
"Death or life..."

209
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.050
The ones by the windows, close them.

210
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.510
- Okay.
- Okay.

211
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.849
Vy is...

212
00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:34.020
Kids.

213
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:37.319
Listen carefully.

214
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.490
I said earlier...

215
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.030
that no one could help you with your life.

216
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.990
So,

217
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.370
study hard...

218
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.880
and train hard.

219
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.380
Understood? Do everything hard!

220
00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:00.420
- Okay?
- Okay.

221
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.839
Go!

222
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.800
- It hurts.
- Keep moving!

223
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.559
Focus.

224
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:11.559
Move quickly.

225
00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:14.189
Hold on to your rifle and headgear.

226
00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:17.270
- It hurts!
- Don't stop!

227
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.479
Move faster!

228
00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:19.520
Get out of there!

229
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.359
- Keep your rifle in your left hand.
- What do you think you're doing?

230
00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:24.400
- Move swiftly!
- Hey!

231
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.199
- Get out of there!
- Come on, move!

232
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.740
To the next one.

233
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.620
- Come on.
- Keep moving.

234
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.990
- Faster.
- Go.

235
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.000
To the left.

236
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.500
Keep your rifles up!

237
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.829
Hurry it up!

238
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.880
Who's standing still?

239
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.709
- Run!
- Let's do this!

240
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.089
All trainees, into your assault fire positions.

241
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.469
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

242
00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:51.469
Prone position in parts. One!

243
00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:52.719
- One.
- One.

244
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.599
- Two.
- Two.

245
00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:56.599
- Three.
- Three.

246
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.439
Stand up. Prone position in parts.

247
00:16:58.439 --> 00:16:59.609
- One!
- One!

248
00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:01.069
- Two.
- Louder!

249
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:04.030
- Quickly.
- Do not meet eyes with me.

250
00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.280
- Why are you looking at me?
- Put your head up.

251
00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:07.660
Aim forward!

252
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.870
Pick up your rifles!

253
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.829
Who has the rifle facing the ground?

254
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.079
- Aim forward.
- Look up.

255
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.450
Look up!

256
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.119
This is too hard.

257
00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:21.500
Mom...

258
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.589
I just want to give up and go home.

259
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.550
But if I do,

260
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.220
I can't get the extra points that everyone else gets.

261
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.720
That's what I'm worried about.

262
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.559
All trainees,

263
00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.599
focus and keep the stone on the barrel...

264
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:37.599
as you pull the trigger.

265
00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.399
Relax your body.

266
00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:40.609
Hold your breath.

267
00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.940
Focus.

268
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.980
Fire.

269
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.899
You can do it. Why do you...

270
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:47.950
Do you have hand tremors?

271
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.950
Young Soo.

272
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.030
Study the rifle as you study books.

273
00:17:51.869 --> 00:17:53.990
Come on! Darn it.

274
00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:56.909
The platoon commander is watching Hurry.

275
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.210
Fine.

276
00:18:10.639 --> 00:18:11.889
Move it.

277
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.139
Stand up.

278
00:18:16.139 --> 00:18:17.480
- Next, keep moving.
- Get in line.

279
00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:20.190
- Hold your rifles properly.
- Get moving.

280
00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.230
Left flank, march!

281
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.980
You have to be stupid to take this training seriously.

282
00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:28.359
Studying in my spare time is the best for me.

283
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.069
I just hope none of my classmates get hurt.

284
00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:33.490
I don't want this crap!

285
00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:35.329
What is this?

286
00:18:35.329 --> 00:18:36.790
This looks like rice cake.

287
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.409
- This is gross!
- I think it's gone bad.

288
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:41.500
I'm serious. Try it.

289
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.129
Start disassembling your rifles from Group One.

290
00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:45.710
Group One, begin disassembling.

291
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.050
- Begin!
- Begin!

292
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.669
When you've finished disassembling your rifle,

293
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.680
raise your hand and make sure to show me.

294
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.359
Hey, you have to put one on it so that I can start!

295
00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.520
Sorry.

296
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.480
This is insane.

297
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.909
- Pull the trigger.
- What?

298
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.030
Pull it.

299
00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:22.040
You can't do it even if I put one on it.

300
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.800
I am doing my best, but...

301
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.800
(Class 3-2, No Ae Seol)

302
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.379
But this keeps coming loose.

303
00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.300
Is yours okay?

304
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.470
- Are you okay?
- Wake up!

305
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.639
- Check the patient's breath.
- Check the breath!

306
00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.720
- Checking.
- If the patient is not breathing,

307
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.930
apply pressure to the chest.

308
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.940
- Begin!
- Begin!

309
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.980
Wake up!

310
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.399
- Keep going.
- Come on!

311
00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:46.899
Oh, my legs.

312
00:19:49.399 --> 00:19:51.530
Hey, Kimchi. Drink water.

313
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.740
Okay.

314
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.369
Drink up.

315
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.750
What's the matter?

316
00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:06.250
Hey.

317
00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:09.550
Chi Yeol.

318
00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.300
What do you mean, "How is it?"

319
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.629
It feels like crap.

320
00:20:15.389 --> 00:20:16.589
Hey.

321
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.599
Find somebody else to interview.

322
00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:20.430
(Class 3-2, Kwon Il Ha)

323
00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:26.559
- Guys.
- What?

324
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:28.730
Yu Jung.

325
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.440
Leave them be. I'll let you study by yourself today.

326
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.780
Okay.

327
00:20:51.379 --> 00:20:54.129
There are more students remaining than the ones who left.

328
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.260
(Class 3-2, Cho Young Sin)

329
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.889
It's better to go with the majority in such cases.

330
00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.970
This is nice.

331
00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:04.849
But I only wore it for five days. Maybe I shouldn't wash it.

332
00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:06.270
Five days? Give me that.

333
00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:10.899
Why would you smell that?

334
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:12.359
But...

335
00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:13.690
he said it's only been five days.

336
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.240
- Come on!
- Stop!

337
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.780
You're nasty!

338
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.859
Come on!

339
00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:19.200
During night watch?

340
00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:22.079
Chatting with the girls is...

341
00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:23.369
pretty nice.

342
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:26.290
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

343
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.079
It'd be so cool to be on watch with Ha Na.

344
00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:30.919
Make me look especially prettier.

345
00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:33.250
I want to date a British guy too.

346
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.169
- A British guy?
- But you don't even speak English.

347
00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.300
Those animals are right outside.

348
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.639
We have to dry our underwear here?

349
00:21:38.639 --> 00:21:39.930
Exactly!

350
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.430
- What if they steal it?
- That's what I'm saying.

351
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.889
You two are so grouchy.

352
00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:45.230
How are you two so alike?

353
00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:46.559
She and I?

354
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.230
- That's offensive to me.
- No, it's offensive to me.

355
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.730
Keep hanging the laundry.

356
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.609
Why are you throwing things?

357
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.480
Is he staring at me?

358
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.530
Pervert!

359
00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:56.740
Those guys are...

360
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.609
- You guys are crazy!
- Perverts.

361
00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.450
- What a pervert.
- I got goosebumps.

362
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.240
How long have they been standing there?

363
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.490
- Look at them.
- Creeps.

364
00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:12.710
- Tae Man, get changed!
- You smell awful.

365
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.839
You stink.

366
00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:14.919
What?

367
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.260
- Wash your clothes, man.
- Get away from me!

368
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.470
- You're crazy.
- Do you want one?

369
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.059
Thanks.

370
00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:26.430
(Class 3-2, Cha So Yeon)

371
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.599
I just washed, and I still stink.

372
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.020
Ha Na, smell me.

373
00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:38.280
- I don't smell anything.
- I don't?

374
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.240
What about me? Smell me.

375
00:22:43.159 --> 00:22:45.579
What? Smell me again. That can't be true.

376
00:22:45.579 --> 00:22:47.159
No, I'm starting to hate you.

377
00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:49.040
- Please smell me.
- Not again.

378
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.619
There's no way.

379
00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.250
We will keep trying until you don't drop the stone.

380
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.879
- It's shaking. Hold your breath.
- One second.

381
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.379
Private So Yeon.

382
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.050
Pull in your elbows.

383
00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:10.180
Relax your left hand.

384
00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:14.059
Hold your breath.

385
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.109
Focus.

386
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.319
Fire.

387
00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:36.960
The hardest part?

388
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.919
(Class 3-2, Lee Na Ra)

389
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.129
So far, none.

390
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.300
It's amazing!

391
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.220
Na Ra succeeded!

392
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:53.139
Yu Jung succeeded too.

393
00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:56.899
- I did it!
- Yes.

394
00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:58.440
- You did well.
- Did you see that?

395
00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.940
Get into your positions!

396
00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:02.359
- Move forward!
- Hurry and get out.

397
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.819
You jerks!

398
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:10.500
I feel alive.

399
00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:13.579
- Move faster to the next.
- Run!

400
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:15.500
Move quickly!

401
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.250
Eat more.

402
00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:19.169
Hey, stop.

403
00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:20.800
Quickly be back into your positions.

404
00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:22.720
- Get into your positions.
- Run!

405
00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:25.970
- Run quickly!
- Go ahead!

406
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.139
- Ready.
- Run!

407
00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:28.260
- Run!
- Pull yourself together!

408
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.809
- Let's do this!
- Assume the prone position!

409
00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:32.020
- Basic movement, one!
- One!

410
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.889
- Two!
- Two!

411
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.559
- Three!
- Three!

412
00:24:57.129 --> 00:24:58.169
Anyhow,

413
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.669
I don't feel safe.

414
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:02.510
I really didn't tell anyone!

415
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:09.430
Look.

416
00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:11.680
I said you're dangerous.

417
00:25:11.849 --> 00:25:14.770
I seriously won't tell anyone. Okay?

418
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.770
- I won't tell even if I die.
- Is that so?

419
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.190
I'll see.

420
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.319
If you won't tell after you die.

421
00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:23.609
What?

422
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:43.300
Don't do this!

423
00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:45.260
- You punk!
- Oh, gosh!

424
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.379
Come here.

425
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.649
Darn it. Where did he go?

426
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.280
Darn it.

427
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.309
For goodness' sake.

428
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.809
Please.

429
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.059
(Jang Young Hoon)

430
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.700
Kim Chi Yeol.

431
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:22.460
Where are you going?

432
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.669
I'm going to the bathroom.

433
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.629
Make it fast.

434
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.290
Na Ra.

435
00:29:13.629 --> 00:29:14.839
What are you doing here?

436
00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.260
I can't sleep after being on a night watch.

437
00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:21.099
How about you?

438
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:22.970
Well, I...

439
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:25.980
just woke up for no reason.

440
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.440
(Goodbye, friends.)

441
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.319
I think they're the names of the people who went out.

442
00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:40.280
(3-2: Baek Su Young, Cha Seung Ho, Jang Young Hoon)

443
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.530
If I had known this would happen,

444
00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:43.740
I would have gotten closer to them.

445
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.829
Is Young Hoon hurt a lot?

446
00:29:46.829 --> 00:29:47.919
What?

447
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.500
No.

448
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.339
Just...

449
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.210
a little bit.

450
00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:06.230
(Jang Young Hoon, give "birth" soon.)

451
00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:08.520
That letter means to give birth.

452
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520
Yes? What did you say?

453
00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:12.649
Never mind.

454
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:17.109
You lived in England, right?

455
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:19.200
Yes, why?

456
00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.240
Just asking.

457
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.250
Chi Yeol,

458
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.290
were you close with Young Hoon?

459
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.960
We were born and raised in the same village.

460
00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:39.089
Then you must've been close with him.

461
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:45.389
Yes.

462
00:30:49.809 --> 00:30:51.190
I'll go first.

463
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:17.169
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

464
00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:22.839
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

465
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.550
I'll give you a minute to disassemble and assemble the gun.

466
00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.919
- What?
- Sorry?

467
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.460
If you can't get it done in a minute,

468
00:32:01.089 --> 00:32:02.839
you'll get a penalty.

469
00:32:02.839 --> 00:32:04.010
- What?
- A penalty?

470
00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:10.139
Who whined?

471
00:32:10.849 --> 00:32:11.849
Come out.

472
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.149
Group One, disassemble and assemble the gun.

473
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.819
Start.

474
00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:20.899
- Start!
- Start!

475
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.200
So Yeon, does he still look cool to you?

476
00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:28.700
So Yeon?

477
00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:31.869
Yes, whatever he does is so cool.

478
00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:33.040
- Disassemble complete.
- Disassemble complete.

479
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.169
- Disassemble complete.
- Cool?

480
00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:35.290
- Who?
- What's next?

481
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.879
- Is it me?
- Disassemble complete.

482
00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:38.290
Shut it, squid.

483
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:39.919
"Squid?"

484
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.419
(The disassembly and assembly of guns)

485
00:32:45.379 --> 00:32:46.760
- Completed.
- Oh, gosh.

486
00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:48.220
Completed.

487
00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:49.680
- Completed!
- Completed!

488
00:32:51.309 --> 00:32:52.309
Completed!

489
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.889
Next is Group Two.

490
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.559
- Completed.
- Completed!

491
00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.770
Completed.

492
00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.940
- Completed.
- Completed!

493
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.480
Group Three, move forward.

494
00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:04.569
This!

495
00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:07.740
- Completed.
- Completed!

496
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.740
Completed.

497
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.619
- Impressive.
- Nice.

498
00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:16.419
Completed. Gosh!

499
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.750
Start.

500
00:33:22.589 --> 00:33:23.589
Completed.

501
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.800
Completed.

502
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.389
- Nice.
- She's fast.

503
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.809
Completed.

504
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.349
Completed!

505
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:35.940
- Nice work.
- Yes.

506
00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:52.369
Stop.

507
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.200
One minute passed.

508
00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:57.500
Assemble the rifle again.

509
00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:02.540
Private Ae Seol.

510
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.169
Assemble the rifle again.

511
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.339
- Yes.
- Hey.

512
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:13.559
She's lost.

513
00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:21.019
Again.

514
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:23.479
Why can't she do this?

515
00:34:24.189 --> 00:34:25.280
- Again.
- Gosh.

516
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:27.439
Again.

517
00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:29.319
- She just took it off now?
- Again.

518
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.819
- How long do we need to wait?
- She's doing her best.

519
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:33.370
My butt hurts.

520
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.950
- How many times is she trying?
- Again.

521
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.410
- Oh, gosh.
- I'm hungry.

522
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:38.370
- Gosh.
- She's taking it off.

523
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.249
- Again.
- What? Come on.

524
00:34:43.709 --> 00:34:45.050
- For goodness' sake!
- Again?

525
00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:50.760
(Sungjin High School)

526
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.260
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ae Seol, make it quick.

527
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.800
- I'm so tired.
- Do it well!

528
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.680
- Please.
- When is this ending?

529
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.390
- I'm starving.
- Oh, gosh.

530
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.390
I'm so tired.

531
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.560
Seriously.

532
00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:05.979
I'm about to die of hunger.

533
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:07.319
Same here.

534
00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:11.030
Hey, can you hear me?

535
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.080
Group Two, attention.

536
00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:22.580
Attention!

537
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:29.470
There are no individuals or me on the training ground.

538
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.220
There's only us.

539
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.640
But...

540
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.140
you criticize your friends' mistakes...

541
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.310
and jeer at them.

542
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.939
If this was a real situation,

543
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:47.439
you guys would all be dead already.

544
00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:50.030
Therefore,

545
00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.910
until the last person succeeds,

546
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.240
you will not be getting any dinner tonight.

547
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.330
- Gosh.
- What?

548
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.080
- That's not fair.
- We're starving.

549
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.410
- Seriously.
- I'm starving too.

550
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.080
Come on, that's not fair.

551
00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.959
- What is this?
- This is so annoying.

552
00:36:06.339 --> 00:36:07.539
Private No Ae Seol.

553
00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:12.010
Begin.

554
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:34.319
We're eating such great food thanks to somebody.

555
00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:37.030
I know. This food is totally awesome.

556
00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:42.620
Hey.

557
00:36:43.749 --> 00:36:44.870
Hey.

558
00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:48.419
You know we're eating this garbage because of you, right?

559
00:36:50.209 --> 00:36:51.339
Sorry.

560
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:52.800
Do you think saying sorry is enough?

561
00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:55.930
Sorry.

562
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.260
Hey!

563
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.600
Stop it. Ae Seol is eating.

564
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.640
Hey. This isn't the first time, you know.

565
00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:07.899
If it was, I wouldn't even be complaining.

566
00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:09.819
If you have something to say, say it after we're done eating.

567
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:15.780
Who are you? Her boyfriend or something?

568
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.280
If I'm her boyfriend, can I say that kind of stuff?

569
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.870
Then I'll be her boyfriend.

570
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.160
- Is that punk crazy?
- What?

571
00:37:25.499 --> 00:37:26.580
He must be crazy.

572
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.959
Are they going out?

573
00:37:29.419 --> 00:37:30.589
Are they actually dating?

574
00:37:30.629 --> 00:37:32.050
You're making me lose my appetite.

575
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.669
Eat up.

576
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.089
Hey. Big news.

577
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.930
What's this?

578
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.970
I'm upset by this reaction.

579
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.100
Just eat.

580
00:37:46.979 --> 00:37:48.649
Okay. I won't tell you.

581
00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:52.939
Big news.

582
00:37:52.939 --> 00:37:54.609
What is it?

583
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:56.240
Now that's the kind of reaction I was looking for.

584
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.160
Tomorrow,

585
00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:00.069
we're shooting real bullets.

586
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.830
I know that too.

587
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.410
What?

588
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.959
- We all know, man.
- How?

589
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:11.589
It says so on the training schedule in the front of the classroom.

590
00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:18.510
How smart you are.

591
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.220
You're awesome!

592
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.660
I've checked the route to the shooting range.

593
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.120
- Good work, Won Bin.
- Thank you, sir.

594
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.539
Bring the weapons too.

595
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.749
Those too?

596
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.709
I heard they were still being tested.

597
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:56.379
We never know what might happen.

598
00:38:57.129 --> 00:38:58.629
Watch over them carefully so there aren't any accidents.

599
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.220
Yes, sir.

600
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:04.930
But...

601
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.970
they're quite pretty when you look at them like this.

602
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.600
The spheres, I mean.

603
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:18.359
- You're not getting it right.
- One...

604
00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:19.569
Hey, stop playing around.

605
00:39:19.569 --> 00:39:20.990
- Gosh, seriously?
- Gosh.

606
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.450
- My gosh.
- This is annoying.

607
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:24.530
- There you go.
- Are you doing my whole face?

608
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.740
I'm here.

609
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.620
You're late. Hurry up.

610
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.459
- Ms. Park.
- Hey. Yes?

611
00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:31.919
Ms. Park, are you coming...

612
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:33.459
- to the shooting range with us?
- Class 2, total 22, no absentees.

613
00:39:33.459 --> 00:39:34.789
- Of course, I'm coming with you.
- All clear.

614
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:36.169
- Don't worry.
- Yes!

615
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:39.510
Just focus on your training. Let me see. Do you have everything?

616
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.089
Platoon Two, status check is complete.

617
00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:43.470
- I know, right?
- We're shooting real bullets today.

618
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.850
Oh, gosh.

619
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.640
Hey, just stay still.

620
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.350
- That's not it.
- Stop playing around.

621
00:39:53.229 --> 00:39:54.519
We're all set.

622
00:39:54.939 --> 00:39:57.819
- Oh, come on.
- Be quiet, guys.

623
00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:59.069
Platoon Two, attention.

624
00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:00.530
- Attention!
- Attention!

625
00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:04.069
Follow along so we don't lose anyone on our way to the shooting range.

626
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:05.160
Got it?

627
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:06.780
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

628
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.370
Platoon Two. March.

629
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.120
- March!
- March!

630
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.180
- Stop that.
- What are you doing?

631
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.810
Hey, look.

632
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.479
Hey, you scared me.

633
00:40:31.479 --> 00:40:32.680
You get scared too easily.

634
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.729
Oh, darn it!

635
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.810
What's this? Why are the streets empty?

636
00:40:37.729 --> 00:40:40.280
I know, right? All the shops are closed too.

637
00:40:41.229 --> 00:40:43.280
People might think the world has come to an end.

638
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.859
Oh, gosh.

639
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.200
Where is everyone?

640
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.740
- It feels eerie.
- Everyone is gone.

641
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.459
There were fire trucks yesterday, but I can't even hear those today.

642
00:40:57.959 --> 00:40:59.209
Isn't that right?

643
00:41:02.379 --> 00:41:04.089
- Do you need to go poop?
- Darn it.

644
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.720
Why are you asking him when you're the one who wants to poop?

645
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.839
Hey, Kim Duk Joong.

646
00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:08.890
- Darn it.
- Platoon Two.

647
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.180
Remain silent as we move to the shooting range.

648
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.350
Silent! No talking!

649
00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:24.490
This is no fun.

650
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.319
- Hey, get a move on.
- Okay.

651
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.430
- One.
- One!

652
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.220
Two.

653
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.060
- One.
- Down! Shoot!

654
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.100
- Two.
- Down. Shoot.

655
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.399
- One.
- Look straight ahead.

656
00:42:00.729 --> 00:42:02.569
- Stand up. Shoot!
- Salute.

657
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:04.319
- Were things okay on your way here?
- Stand up. Shoot.

658
00:42:04.399 --> 00:42:07.109
Class 3-2. Line up in front of your platoon sergeant!

659
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:08.410
- Line up.
- Line up.

660
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.410
- No.
- We're here!

661
00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:11.740
Who are those guys?

662
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:12.990
I don't know.

663
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.870
No talking!

664
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.129
Line up!

665
00:42:26.129 --> 00:42:27.550
- Get up.
- Get up.

666
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.339
Oh, my gosh!

667
00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:30.589
(Class 3-2, Im Woo Taek)

668
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:32.010
The sound of gunshots is...

669
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.850
so freaking loud.

670
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.310
I nearly pooped my pants, let alone wet myself.

671
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.229
Earlier, Duk Joong seriously pooped his pants.

672
00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:42.899
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

673
00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:44.519
The poop won't stop coming out.

674
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.700
Starting with those who are ready,

675
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:54.910
commence zeroing fire.

676
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:56.999
- Commence fire.
- Commence fire.

677
00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:05.300
One.

678
00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:07.209
- One.
- One.

679
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.669
One!

680
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.089
One!

681
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.470
- One!
- One.

682
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.220
- One.
- One.

683
00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:18.640
- One.
- One.

684
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.769
I just thought...

685
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.600
that it would be scary if a war broke out.

686
00:43:21.649 --> 00:43:22.810
I just thought...

687
00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.819
that I wanted to go home.

688
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.019
But...

689
00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:27.979
isn't Kwon Il Ha acting a bit weird these days?

690
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.200
Even when we're smoking, he keeps spacing out on his own.

691
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.109
(Class 3-2, Yeon Bo Ra)

692
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:34.660
I mean, he has always been a weirdo.

693
00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.209
Don't tell Il Ha.

694
00:43:42.709 --> 00:43:43.959
Clear on the left.

695
00:43:44.209 --> 00:43:45.419
Clear on the right.

696
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.749
All clear.

697
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.959
Shooters, check your target.

698
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.760
- Check targets.
- Check targets.

699
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:01.979
Kim Chi Yeol.

700
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.479
- Kim Chi Yeol.
- What?

701
00:44:07.189 --> 00:44:08.319
Are you okay?

702
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.530
Why is your face so red?

703
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.200
My face?

704
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.830
Where?

705
00:44:25.919 --> 00:44:27.039
Right here.

706
00:44:29.459 --> 00:44:31.050
Are you okay? It looks like a bruise.

707
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.760
Oh, this? It must be that.

708
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.269
When I was getting ready to shoot,

709
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.810
I was trying to set my sight,

710
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.390
so I put it right up against my nose.

711
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.609
But then, because of the recoil...

712
00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:51.109
You should be careful too. The recoil is no joke.

713
00:44:51.859 --> 00:44:55.240
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

714
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.410
- Kim Chi Yeol.
- What... Yes?

715
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.830
Aren't you going to check your target? Run!

716
00:45:06.169 --> 00:45:09.169
- What were you doing? Dating?
- Sorry, sir!

717
00:45:09.169 --> 00:45:10.919
- Hey, you did well.
- Gosh.

718
00:45:11.379 --> 00:45:12.589
Hey, you...

719
00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:14.169
- You just kept shooting.
- When did I do that?

720
00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:16.550
- Hey, I saw everything.
- Your face was hilarious.

721
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:17.550
When did I do that?

722
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.680
Platoon Two, attention.

723
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.220
- Attention.
- Attention.

724
00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.390
Private number three.

725
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.350
Private number three, Kim Duk Joong.

726
00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:27.600
I gave you three shots.

727
00:45:29.189 --> 00:45:30.479
Why is there only one hole?

728
00:45:31.649 --> 00:45:35.859
With my amazing shooting skills, all three rounds hit the bulls-eye.

729
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.240
- No way, really?
- Come on.

730
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.370
- Awesome.
- Unbelievable.

731
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.370
That's amazing.

732
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:43.660
- Get down.
- Get down?

733
00:45:45.039 --> 00:45:46.709
Who's poking holes right now?

734
00:45:48.919 --> 00:45:51.249
Private number 12, Wang Tae Man.

735
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:53.760
Wang Tae Man. Get down.

736
00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:55.629
Get down.

737
00:45:56.419 --> 00:45:57.550
That little punk.

738
00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.510
- Are you joking?
- How badly did he do?

739
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.220
- Private number eight.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.390
Private number eight, Do Soo Chul.

741
00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:07.390
Why do you have eight holes?

742
00:46:07.729 --> 00:46:08.899
Is this the solar system?

743
00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:10.899
Private number eight and the shooters next to him,

744
00:46:11.859 --> 00:46:13.069
all of you get down.

745
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.990
- Sorry, sir!
- Sorry, sir!

746
00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.870
Private number four.

747
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.789
Private number four, Kim Yu Jung.

748
00:46:27.249 --> 00:46:28.580
This is your target paper.

749
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.379
Gosh, she's terrible.

750
00:46:30.459 --> 00:46:32.169
- What is that?
- What a joke.

751
00:46:32.169 --> 00:46:33.879
- That's so bad.
- Where would you use those skills?

752
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.050
My hand.

753
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.760
- Be quiet.
- You did fine.

754
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.970
She actually did well here.

755
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.350
- What?
- But why?

756
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.600
She might've missed the mark,

757
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.479
but all three shots are clustered together to form a shot group.

758
00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:54.819
In this case, if you adjust the sight slightly,

759
00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:57.189
you will be able to hit the mark.

760
00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:00.069
- Go, class president.
- Class president.

761
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:02.120
- That's impressive.
- Nice one.

762
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.410
There's one person who did a really good job.

763
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.830
Private number 15.

764
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.209
Private number 15, Lee Na Ra.

765
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.249
This is perfect.

766
00:47:14.209 --> 00:47:15.550
All three shots were in the center.

767
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.310
Now, re-adjust accordingly...

768
00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.769
and fire again.

769
00:47:28.269 --> 00:47:30.560
- For goodness' sake.
- I don't want to.

770
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.850
You're going to get bad results again.

771
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.479
People who shoot well this time will gain extra points.

772
00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:37.609
So focus and fire. All right?

773
00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:39.189
How many extra points?

774
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.109
Three points.

775
00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:44.160
- Three?
- Three points?

776
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.620
Hurry.

777
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.700
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

778
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:51.370
Let's go.

779
00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:59.129
One shot!

780
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.220
(Class 2-3, Private Yeon Ju)

781
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:07.970
(Class 1-5, Private Na Ra)

782
00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.100
One shot.

783
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.439
Two shots.

784
00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:15.109
Three shots.

785
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.149
Oh, my gosh.

786
00:48:18.399 --> 00:48:19.479
For goodness' sake.

787
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.069
You still weren't able to make it.

788
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:23.990
- In the middle? Where?
- Just fire.

789
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.700
Dinosaur chicken, spring onion chicken.

790
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.830
- I like them all.
- For goodness' sake!

791
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.330
Why?

792
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.330
- We were saying...
- I'm tired.

793
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:31.620
I can't hear anything.

794
00:48:31.789 --> 00:48:32.830
Let's be quiet.

795
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.209
- But I still got three points.
- Oh, my.

796
00:48:35.209 --> 00:48:37.379
- I hope we can get more points.
- Or...

797
00:48:37.379 --> 00:48:39.589
- For goodness' sake.
- I gave up already.

798
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.839
- Let's go here.
- Give up?

799
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.879
You just couldn't make it.

800
00:48:42.879 --> 00:48:43.970
I can't.

801
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.220
Stop! Walk straight.

802
00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.300
For goodness' sake.

803
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.430
(We don't sell alcoholic beverages to minors under the age of 18.)

804
00:48:52.519 --> 00:48:54.560
- Platoon Two, halt!
- Halt!

805
00:48:57.399 --> 00:48:59.069
Take a ten-minute break at your positions.

806
00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:01.899
Take a ten-minute break.

807
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.069
Let's take a break here.

808
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.819
- Have a rest.
- Yes.

809
00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:08.870
Sit down.

810
00:49:10.289 --> 00:49:11.580
Don't go far away.

811
00:49:15.459 --> 00:49:16.539
It's the same thing we saw just now.

812
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.709
- Adjusting.
- Why is it here?

813
00:49:19.709 --> 00:49:21.379
- Soon Yi, keep it.
- What?

814
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.169
- Keep it.
- Should I?

815
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:24.760
- Yes.
- Okay.

816
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.970
Is everything okay?

817
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.019
- Hey.
- What?

818
00:49:36.269 --> 00:49:37.600
Don't you want to drink something cool?

819
00:49:37.689 --> 00:49:40.689
Yes, definitely. I want something sweet too.

820
00:49:40.689 --> 00:49:41.729
- Right?
- Yes.

821
00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:43.649
Do you want to go to the convenience store there?

822
00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.410
Okay.

823
00:50:04.339 --> 00:50:07.010
I'll go check the front just in case.

824
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.010
Yes.

825
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.930
Wait while making sure they don't cause any issues.

826
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.260
Yes, sir.

827
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.640
Check for live ammunition.

828
00:50:20.939 --> 00:50:21.939
Live ammunition?

829
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.280
- Check that side.
- Okay.

830
00:50:42.959 --> 00:50:44.050
Excuse me.

831
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:46.669
Hello?

832
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800
What?

833
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.310
Is there no one here?

834
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.229
The door is unlocked.

835
00:51:04.689 --> 00:51:07.109
Why are the things all scattered?

836
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.450
I'm starving.

837
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.200
You're so fast.

838
00:51:22.289 --> 00:51:23.379
- There's gum!
- Gum?

839
00:51:25.459 --> 00:51:28.169
They serve bad food. I'll have to bring everything here.

840
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:31.510
Gum.

841
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.300
No way. Cigarettes!

842
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.769
Nice work.

843
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:39.890
- Oh, my gosh.
- This one.

844
00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:44.649
Hey, there's money too.

845
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.749
Right? This is bad, right?

846
00:52:06.459 --> 00:52:08.089
- Okay.
- Okay.

847
00:52:09.879 --> 00:52:10.879
Gum.

848
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:12.680
Yeon Ju, you'll get better.

849
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.800
- Yes. You'll improve.
- You'll be good.

850
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.890
Gosh, I'm hungry.

851
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.060
Me too. Ms. Park, we're hungry.

852
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.979
I think we'll eat after we go back.

853
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.269
- Where are Tae Man and Hee Rak?
- Yes?

854
00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:25.859
Wait.

855
00:52:26.859 --> 00:52:29.359
Yu Jung, have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

856
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:33.450
They were here just now.

857
00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:34.859
Where did they go?

858
00:52:34.859 --> 00:52:36.240
Oh, gosh. These boys.

859
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.370
- Platoon sergeant.
- Yes?

860
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.629
Two of the boys are missing. Tae Man and Hee Rak.

861
00:52:46.629 --> 00:52:48.499
What? Since when?

862
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.589
They were here just now.

863
00:52:51.339 --> 00:52:52.419
Corporal Park.

864
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:57.430
Two boys broke away.

865
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.010
Check that side. I'll check this side.

866
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.019
Yes.

867
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.850
Don't move and stay here with the students.

868
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:05.939
All right.

869
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:11.859
These boys aren't scared at all.

870
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:14.700
Have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

871
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.819
- No.
- No, I haven't seen them.

872
00:53:16.819 --> 00:53:19.240
- You didn't see them, right?
- No one was with them?

873
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.580
Hey, are we going to be punished because of them?

874
00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.620
- No way.
- Don't say something terrible!

875
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.120
I'll kill them both.

876
00:53:25.749 --> 00:53:26.830
It's annoying.

877
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.080
Ms. Park. I...

878
00:53:32.669 --> 00:53:34.470
I heard them say something about a convenience store.

879
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:35.680
- What?
- What?

880
00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.339
- Convenience store?
- They went to a convenience store?

881
00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:38.930
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

882
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.060
- What are they thinking?
- Where's the convenience store?

883
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.600
- Why are they like that?
- I don't know.

884
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.140
Yu Jung, let's go find them.

885
00:54:47.249 --> 00:54:50.330
Gosh, who put their weapon like this?

886
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.999
They should be punished. For goodness' sake.

887
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.760
Isn't she Yu Jung?

888
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600
Where are you going?

889
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.100
- What's wrong with her?
- What's going on?

890
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.430
- It's Yu Jung, right?
- Let's follow her.

891
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:12.269
Didn't this fall last time?

892
00:55:13.979 --> 00:55:16.319
Why is there nothing?

893
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:20.030
Gosh.

894
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.030
What's wrong?

895
00:55:29.039 --> 00:55:30.209
- What?
- What is it?

896
00:55:30.209 --> 00:55:31.499
- Oh, gosh.
- What is it?

897
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:32.879
- What's that!
- Gosh!

898
00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:35.959
- What's that!
- Gosh!

899
00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:38.629
- Oh, my!
- It's someone's hand!

900
00:55:39.129 --> 00:55:40.879
Why is it here?

901
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:41.970
Is it real?

902
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.760
- Gosh. What's going on?
- What happened?

903
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.100
Is this real?

904
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.310
- Are you okay?
- Look at the nails.

905
00:55:49.019 --> 00:55:50.060
Why did this happen?

906
00:55:50.519 --> 00:55:52.519
- What is this?
- I feel sick.

907
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.109
- What is it?
- I want to throw up.

908
00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:56.939
Is it real?

909
00:55:58.729 --> 00:56:01.530
I want to go home.

910
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:03.069
Ms. Park!

911
00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.289
Don't go. I feel bad about this.

912
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.499
No, Chi Yeol. I'll go and check.

913
00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:13.370
Stay here. Okay?

914
00:56:18.169 --> 00:56:19.260
Ms. Park.

915
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:21.169
Ms. Eun Young!

916
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:23.589
Don't go. What if it's the spheres?

917
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.720
Young Hoon died because of the spheres too!

918
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.970
- What?
- Young Hoon died? Why?

919
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.390
- That idiot.
- I thought he left.

920
00:56:31.519 --> 00:56:32.939
- What is he talking about?
- No way.

921
00:56:33.019 --> 00:56:34.939
Il Ha, what is he talking about?

922
00:56:34.939 --> 00:56:36.769
- Do you know something?
- What's all this, Il Ha?

923
00:56:36.769 --> 00:56:39.030
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know too!

924
00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:48.620
Everyone, run!

925
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.499
Oh, my gosh.

926
00:57:35.999 --> 00:57:37.080
No.

927
00:57:39.459 --> 00:57:40.499

00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:04.780
Run...

929
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.950
Oh, my gosh!

This is real!

931
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.419
- Oh, my!
- No!

932
00:58:17.419 --> 00:58:18.459

Oh, my gosh.

934
00:58:22.089 --> 00:58:23.169
What's that?

935
00:58:23.629 --> 00:58:24.669
Run away!

936
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.800
Quick! Run away!

937
00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:06.550
Run faster!

938
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.050
Hurry up and go!

939
00:59:25.149 --> 00:59:28.109
- It hurts!
- Hey!

940
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.319
Hey, this way!

Darn it, what are those things?

943
00:59:43.169 --> 00:59:44.839
- Oh, gosh!
- Let's go.

944
00:59:45.039 --> 00:59:46.499
Kim Yu Jung, what are you doing?

945
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.600
Hey, Yu Jung. Get up.

946
00:59:59.769 --> 01:00:00.939
Are you okay?

947
01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:11.240
Save me, please.

948
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.740
Save me.

949
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:15.910
Save me, please.

950
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.870
No, don't go.

951
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.039
What happened to you?

952
01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:20.870
Are you okay?

953
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.459

What on earth are those things?

963
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.479
What about the others?

964
01:02:11.399 --> 01:02:13.280
Darn it, I don't know.

965
01:02:14.229 --> 01:02:15.240

Go away!

983
01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:58.609
What do I do?

984
01:04:58.819 --> 01:04:59.979
Seriously?

985
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.439
