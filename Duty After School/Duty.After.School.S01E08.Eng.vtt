00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.550
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.839
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.929
What is this?

4
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.730
Why are they the only ones here?

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.810
Did the prison officers really leave them behind?

6
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.899
Who knows what happened?

7
00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.649
We can't trust what they say.

8
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.570
From what I know,

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.820
in times of war, they let the petty criminals go,

10
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.239
and they transfer the hard criminals to Busan.

11
00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.579
All of those people must be hard criminals.

12
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.420
Maybe that's why they were left here until the end and got stuck.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
You saw the red tag earlier, right?

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.880
That means he's on death row.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.590
Then isn't he a serial killer or something?

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.840
Darn it, he looked super scary.

17
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:57.350
Maybe he's the boss of a gang,

18
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.429
and he wiped out his enemy gang before getting locked up.

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.850
Bring it on.

20
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.149
Get lost.

21
00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.399
Darn it.

22
00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.899
Hey, guys.

23
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.270
Are you still there?

24
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.399
Come here and open these doors for me.

25
00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.950
Darn it! At this rate, we might actually die! Open up!

26
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.409
Please, save us.

27
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.409
We're not bad people, guys.

28
00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.909
- Come over here for a minute.
- Guys!

29
00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.370
- Come over here, - Hey, guys.

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.079
and listen to us.

31
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.670
We can never open the doors for them. They're dangerous people.

32
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.290
- That's right.
- Guys!

33
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.340
But they said they haven't even eaten for days.

34
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.840
- Should we at least give them...
- Are you crazy?

35
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.219
Then should we just leave them alone and ignore them?

36
00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.599
If we leave them like that, they'll all end up dead soon.

37
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.310
Why should we care?

38
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.349
Let's just grab what we need and get out.

39
00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.230
Yes, let's leave them here and get out.

40
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.019
It's none of our business.

41
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.060
Darn it! Come and open the doors, you punk!

42
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.269
Shut it, you idiot!

43
00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:52.980
What should we do?

44
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.620
Darn it.

45
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.219
Hey, but...

46
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.759
I thought something was weird since a while ago.

47
00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.020
You guys look really young. What are you doing with guns?

48
00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.979
And why do you look like such a mess?

49
00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.439
Right now, the outside world is at war.

50
00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.569
At war?

51
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.110
There's a war going on?

52
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.530
Hold on, then...

53
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.069
Did North Korea invade us?

54
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.110
See? What did I tell you? Darn it.

55
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.780
I told you, didn't I?

56
00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.120
I said North Korea would invade us, didn't I?

57
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.039
That's why they left us behind and ran off.

58
00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.870
Those darned prison guard jerks.

59
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.000
Just wait until I get out of here. Those jerks.

60
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.379
I'll kill those guys first. Darn it.

61
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.800
I knew they'd be like this.

62
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.340
Gosh, I feel much better now. Thank you.

63
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.759
Kids.

64
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.300
If you go around that corner, there's an office for the guards.

65
00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.469
There are a set of keys in there.

66
00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.099
Go and grab them for us.

67
00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.270
- We can't do that.
- What?

68
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.900
What did you just say?

69
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.439
You darned punks!

70
00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.939
Hey, kids.

71
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.280
Stop joking around.

72
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.530
Hurry up and grab the keys.

73
00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.370
The outside is even more dangerous right now.

74
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.580
It's dangerous?

75
00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.000
What's it like out there?

76
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.919
Well,

77
00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.379
do you really not know anything?

78
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.169
Right now, there are...

79
00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.639
What is it? Why won't you finish what you're saying?

80
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.219
- Why? What is it?
- What on earth is going on?

81
00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.560
Did the spheres in the sky fall down or something?

82
00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.060
What? Those purple balloon things?

83
00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.439
That makes sense.

84
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.150
What's this?

85
00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.280
Is this for real?

86
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.900
Darn it, this is driving me crazy! Just say it.

87
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.949
No, you don't have to tell us.

88
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.659
We don't really want to know anyway.

89
00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.870
Hey, just open these doors for us, quickly.

90
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.199
Thanks for this. Now, open the doors.

91
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.000
Kids, we were wrongfully convicted.

92
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.169
All of us were framed by others.

93
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.759
That's right. We haven't done anything wrong.

94
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.220
Isn't that right? The prison guards didn't like us...

95
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.560
Aren't you going to eat?

96
00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.769
Are you sick?

97
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.810
You little punks.

98
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.189
- Excuse me.
- You darned kids.

99
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.860
Open the doors right now!

100
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.069
Go get the keys!

101
00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.120
Gosh, that jerk. Why are you yelling at the kids?

102
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.160
Please excuse him. It's because he's been locked up alone for so long.

103
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.540
Hey.

104
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.459
Kid. I'm sorry,

105
00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.420
but could I ask you for a favour?

106
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.589
My mom...

107
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.259
My mom doesn't know I'm in here.

108
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.470
I should've sent her to a senior home,

109
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.430
but I ruined everything.

110
00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.139
I just...

111
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.899
want to know if my mom is doing okay.

112
00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:21.980
- Hey, you punk!
- Come on.

113
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.779
Could you call...

114
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.360
this number, please?

115
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.949
Please do that for me.

116
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.660
The last time I saw my mom,

117
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.500
she couldn't eat very well.

118
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.170
Since I'm not around, I'm worried...

119
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.589
how she might be eating.

120
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.509
But we can't really call people...

121
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.009
Please, I'm begging you.

122
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.759
Tell her that her son is living happily, so she shouldn't worry.

123
00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.639
There's no need to worry, and I'm really sorry.

124
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.769
And tell her that I love her.

125
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.069
Sorry for bothering you.

126
00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:03.069
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.899
What are you doing? Go get them.

128
00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.449
Please, just open the doors!

129
00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.079
We'll go back as soon as we can and report on the situation here.

130
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.870
Please hang in there a little longer until then.

131
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.250
Darn it, open up!

132
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.879
Open the doors, darn it!

133
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.920
What a bunch of lies.

134
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.920
Hey, are you kidding me?

135
00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.839
- Let's go.
- Hey, where are you going?

136
00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.759
- Don't go!
- Darn it!

137
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.220
- We'll be back.
- Hey, stop.

138
00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:30.720
- Hey, don't go!
- Don't go.

139
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.810
Hey, you kids.

140
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.889
This is murder.

141
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.399
Then you won't be any different from criminals like us.

142
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.279
Darn it!

143
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.660
- Ae Seol!
- Kids.

144
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.949
- Hey, hurry up.
- Get over here.

145
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.829
Get over here.

146
00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:59.670
You punks!

147
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.040
Why is that murder? Darn it.

148
00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.629
Why did he have to say such a thing and make us feel gross?

149
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.670
This is the right thing to do, isn't it?

150
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.009
What would Mr. Lee have done in this situation?

151
00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.019
Mr. Lee would've done the same thing.

152
00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.100
Right.

153
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.399
When the walkie-talkies are fixed, we can report this to them too.

154
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.230
Darn it, this feels wrong.

155
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.779
But...

156
00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.110
the guy in the last room...

157
00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.360
He seemed really sick.

158
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.279
He couldn't even eat the food we gave him...

159
00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:35.660
Why are you getting all sentimental all of a sudden?

160
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.540
I think we need to help him. He might...

161
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.829
Hey, No Ae Seol.

162
00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:41.870
You seemed like you were coming to your senses. What's wrong now?

163
00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.670
We decided not to open the doors for them as a group.

164
00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:48.800
Then can we at least...

165
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.009
Stop caring, you idiot.

166
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.759
- I will...
- That's right, Ae Seol.

167
00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.970
We're also worried and feel bad about this,

168
00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:58.639
but for now,

169
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.350
we should focus on the reason we came here in the first place.

170
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.269
Let's look for the parts for the walkie-talkie now.

171
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.689
And let's grab anything else we might need and get going.

172
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.279
This is a prison, so there must be protective gear or weapons too.

173
00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.360
Right.

174
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.199
As I said earlier, we just need to find the circuit board.

175
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:15.949
- It's the thing that looks like...
- The thing that looks like a card.

176
00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.620
If we find it, we'll bring it to you or Young Sin.

177
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.120
Are we good?

178
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.290
Right.

179
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.500
Let's spread out and look for it.

180
00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:23.829
Be careful, guys.

181
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.209
Let's go.

182
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.019
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

183
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.750
(Duty After School)

184
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.629
(Yongdu Service Area)

185
00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:52.169
This is strange.

186
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.049
Gosh, seriously.

187
00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:57.129
Yes, that's it.

188
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.470
We are girls who dream, let's go

189
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.809
Can you feel me? Feel me

190
00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:07.019
Can you touch me? Hold onto me

191
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.230
Hey.

192
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.110
What are you doing there and not standing guard?

193
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.279
You came down here too.

194
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.779
I don't want to be alone.

195
00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:17.779
I had to go to the restroom.

196
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.990
How many times are you going to the restroom?

197
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.409
Aren't you just slacking off?

198
00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.580
I'm not.

199
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.080
I just have sensitive bowels.

200
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.500
Besides, you're the one who's slacking off.

201
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.129
I let you get away with faking sick.

202
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.500
I was really sick and had a fever earlier.

203
00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:36.419
Hey.

204
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.090
Why are you both in here?

205
00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:41.350
Darn it. What if the spheres suddenly appear?

206
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.970
They're not here.

207
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.850
Besides, we didn't see any spheres, let alone a single cat until now.

208
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.269
Don't go overboard.

209
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:50.730
Why, you little... You told me to go and sleep.

210
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.360
You're both slacking off. Darn it.

211
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.610
She's right, we have the detector too.

212
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.610
We don't have to be so strict about standing guard.

213
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.740
It's cold outside.

214
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.200
Let's get some rest.

215
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.909
- Hey, you...
- It's finished!

216
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.960
Ta-Da!

217
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.409
How is it?

218
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.919
It's so pretty.

219
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.129
Jun Hee, how is it?

220
00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:16.960
You look like a darned beggar! Darn it.

221
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.009
Why don't you even attach a flower to show how crazy you are?

222
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:22.049
Come on. It looks totally like an idol singer's stage outfit.

223
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:24.350
There you go again.

224
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:27.470
Pick me up...

225
00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:32.440
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

226
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.649
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me

227
00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:37.399
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

228
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.990
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Hey.

229
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.370
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

230
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.080
Pick Ha Na

231
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.409
All right, the honorary first-place winner...

232
00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:52.539
- is...
- Who is it?

233
00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:56.379
Trainee Yoo Ha Na!

234
00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:58.340
Thank you!

235
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.379
- Thank you, - Yoo Ha Na.

236
00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:02.889
- Yoo Ha Na.
- dear national producers.

237
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.509
You've got to be kidding me.

238
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.899
- What's wrong with her?
- It's because you called her lame.

239
00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:16.440
Me? What did I do?

240
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440
Goodness.

241
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.899
I wanted to début before the age of 20.

242
00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:32.460
Guys.

243
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.710
I think it's weird though.

244
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.710
What?

245
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:38.629
What is?

246
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.710
- What is?
- I mean, the voting.

247
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.220
A lot of those I asked threw negative votes.

248
00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:47.429
So why was the result always positive?

249
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.559
Maybe they actually voted positive and lied to you...

250
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:53.559
in case you would call them names.

251
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.519
Hey, not everyone is hung up on extra points...

252
00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.070
like you and Young Soo.

253
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.529
Extra points, my foot.

254
00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:02.570
A CSAT?

255
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.159
Forget it. We don't even know how things will be next week.

256
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.330
I saw you study in secret at night.

257
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.909
- Me too.
- Right, Duk Joong?

258
00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:15.000
You're 100 percent right, Ha Na.

259
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.289
Hey, you...

260
00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:17.750
So who's right?

261
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.629
- Wait.
- Within...

262
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.009
Guys, be quiet.

263
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.720
You're 100 percent...

264
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.720
- Darn, be quiet.
- Right.

265
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.049
- What's wrong with you?
- What is it?

266
00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:28.600
Just follow me.

267
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.720
What's this sound?

268
00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:31.720
- What is it?
- Do you hear it too?

269
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.059
Guys... Gosh, the rifle.

270
00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:35.139
The rifle.

271
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.559
- Hey.
- Why give this to me?

272
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.190
Be quiet!

273
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.269
Okay.

274
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.779
One, two, three.

275
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.070
- Take this.
- Goodness.

276
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.700
- Darn it.
- Who are they?

277
00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:50.029
Maybe they're here for backup.

278
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.620
- Let me...
- Just stay still.

279
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.039
- Stay put.
- Why must we hide?

280
00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.539
- Be quiet.
- We have to ask them.

281
00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:01.210
Don't be a fool. We don't know what they're like.

282
00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:03.049
What if they try to harm us?

283
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.720
- Oh, no.
- Darn you.

284
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.179
Guys, stay put here while I go take a look.

285
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:10.220
- Stay here.
- Okay.

286
00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:13.809
Darn it.

287
00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:18.399
- Guys.
- What is it?

288
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.230
Quiet. They're right next to us.

289
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.309
Stay still.

290
00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:23.149
- Is there anything?
- They took everything.

291
00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:24.860
- Go out!
- Go!

292
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.899
Stay still.

293
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.779
Guys, there's so much food here.

294
00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:30.870
- Gosh.
- Really?

295
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.950
- No way.
- Let's go.

296
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.789
- This is crazy.
- There's more here.

297
00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:35.870
- What on earth?
- No way!

298
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.370
- Awesome.
- Goodness.

299
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.669
That's my food!

300
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:41.039
- Hey.
- My food!

301
00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.840
Please be quiet. They might hear us.

302
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.460
But that's my food.

303
00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:46.210
Chi Yeol.

304
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:49.509
What's on your mind?

305
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.639
What?

306
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.809
Well, it's nothing.

307
00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:01.649
There are no clean sheets.

308
00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:05.690
I know. We have to take some blankets too.

309
00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:08.820
Should I express my feelings now?

310
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.450
Before Soo Chul makes a move first.

311
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.789
What do I do?

312
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.039
Look.

313
00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:26.419
I keep having anxious ideas these days.

314
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.679
It's been just us for a month now.

315
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:34.179
I wonder how things are in Seoul and other cities.

316
00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:35.970
Would it be similar to our situation?

317
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.389
All communication is dead.

318
00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:41.059
It's been so long since we heard from our parents.

319
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.399
I keep having bad imaginations.

320
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.690
Will we be able...

321
00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:50.860
to go back to school?

322
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.159
We're returning to school once this war ends.

323
00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:59.500
If we get to go back safely, will you go out with me?

324
00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:04.960
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.299
Maybe I made you feel down too.

326
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.509
We're all in the same situation after all.

327
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.340
There isn't any here. Let's check upstairs.

328
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.429
Na Ra.

329
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.429
By any chance,

330
00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:24.269
last night...

331
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.940
What?

332
00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:30.649
Last night...

333
00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:36.740
Did you sleep well?

334
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.539
I mean... At a time like this,

335
00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:45.960
you need to sleep and eat properly to keep yourself healthy.

336
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.340
Health comes first, you know.

337
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.590
Right.

338
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:55.389
I couldn't sleep, but I'm all right.

339
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.220
Now is the time.

340
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.610
Kim Chi Yeol, tell her how you feel. Tell her, you idiot.

341
00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.860
- Chi Yeol.
- Yes?

342
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.190
Thanks...

343
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.400
for looking out for me.

344
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.200
Don't mention it. This is only natural.

345
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.789
We're friends.

346
00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:27.500
Right. Let's go out.

347
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.509
You idiot.

348
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.720
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

349
00:17:41.849 --> 00:17:43.559
I wanted to go to med school too.

350
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.769
My mom was sick since I was little.

351
00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:52.690
But my grades weren't high enough...

352
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.400
that I decided to go to nursing school.

353
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.200
I might barely get accepted to nursing school though.

354
00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:06.460
When I was a junior, my first choice was med school too.

355
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.130
Apply for it. Your grades are high enough, no?

356
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.339
Well...

357
00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:15.970
The tuition costs too much.

358
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.680
And it takes too long to graduate.

359
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.009
I think it's better to just go to a regular college...

360
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.269
that offers a scholarship and take a civil-service exam later.

361
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.900
You should have a bigger picture in mind.

362
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.059
You know if you become a doctor, you'll earn much more.

363
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.660
My family isn't well-off enough to wait for me until then.

364
00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:41.410
And I have to get a job soon...

365
00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.740
for my siblings' college education.

366
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.450
I see.

367
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.000
This is unexpected of you.

368
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.000
Sorry?

369
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.130
What is?

370
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.049
I'm proud of you.

371
00:18:58.049 --> 00:18:59.880
Your parents must be.

372
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:03.970
Not really.

373
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.019
Guys! The dispensary is this way.

374
00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:08.690
- Come quick.
- Okay.

375
00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:11.269
- Let's go.
- Okay.

376
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.190
My gosh, there's so much useful medicine here.

377
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.400
Look.

378
00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:18.569
I'm so annoyed to think how many trips we made...

379
00:19:18.569 --> 00:19:19.900
to pharmacies just for nothing.

380
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.490
We need to take antibiotics and anticoagulants.

381
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.950
- Okay.
- We can treat frostbite with those.

382
00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:25.289
Really?

383
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.200
Jun Hee will be delighted.

384
00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:29.869
Oh, we should take cold medicine...

385
00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:31.619
and anti fungal drugs for athlete's foot too.

386
00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:32.710
Got it.

387
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.049
Never mind. Let's just take everything here.

388
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.089
Sure thing.

389
00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:38.839
Oh, right.

390
00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:42.180
So Yeon, wait. Let me carry that.

391
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.299
Young Soo. This too, please.

392
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.470
That too?

393
00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:47.809
Young Soo, wait. This too.

394
00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:49.140
This is...

395
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.690
- Goodness.
- Hey!

396
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.019
- Young Soo!
- Oh, dear.

397
00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.650
(Rooms 301 to 312)

398
00:19:58.069 --> 00:19:59.109
What's wrong with you?

399
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.819
Come on, Kim Chi Yeol.

400
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:06.029
Why regret now after not being able to say a word?

401
00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:08.869
That was a perfect moment...

402
00:20:12.829 --> 00:20:14.829
No way!

403
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.670
Goodness.

404
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.009
I haven't had a chocolate bar in such a long time.

405
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.390
Thanks for the food.

406
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.440
This is crazy.

407
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.779
This is the one! Nice.

408
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.200
There. I found it.

409
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.569
There are more than a few.

410
00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:48.119
It's worth a month at least.

411
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.119
Please...

412
00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:58.039
Yes!

413
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.509
Thank goodness.

414
00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:37.210
If...

415
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:44.799
by any chance, I end up dying,

416
00:21:45.259 --> 00:21:47.549
I won't be able to confess at all, so I'm leaving this.

417
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.930
Na Ra.

418
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.640
From the moment I saw you for the first time,

419
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.190
I have liked...

420
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.279
This is not it.

421
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.950
When we go back to school, will you go out...

422
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.789
Will you go out...

423
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.619
I just like... Let's go...

424
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.880
Darn my stupid mouth.

425
00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:27.680
Soo Chul...

426
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.140
was brave.

427
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.140
It's nerve-racking to do it alone,

428
00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:36.640
and he did it in front of Na Ra.

429
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.730
You're good. I will give you that.

430
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:45.029
What do you suggest we do? Should we just go back?

431
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.029
Are you suggesting that we just quit it like this?

432
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.349
You want to tell them everything now?

433
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.099
You think the kids will just understand it then?

434
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.150
Gosh.

435
00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:33.450
Is anyone there?

436
00:23:49.299 --> 00:23:50.509
What is it?

437
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.839
I thought...

438
00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:54.009
I heard something.

439
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.220
- Were you with someone?
- No.

440
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:58.680
I was alone.

441
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.650
Right.

442
00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:04.309
I see.

443
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:07.529
What is it? What did you hear?

444
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.150
It's...

445
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.369
It's nothing.

446
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.240
I must have heard it wrong.

447
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:22.460
Why aren't you asking me?

448
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.329
About what happened yesterday?

449
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.259
Yesterday. Right.

450
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.299
What happened?

451
00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:37.349
Na Ra said yes.

452
00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:38.599
We are together.

453
00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:44.349
I'm joking.

454
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.359
- Right.
- I told her to take her time.

455
00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:49.319
But...

456
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.740
even if she turns me down, I won't give up.

457
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:54.410
I will keep asking her out...

458
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:56.410
until she accepts me.

459
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.079
Right.

460
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.170
What's wrong?

461
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.089
Are you nervous because you have a rival now?

462
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.339
What are you talking about?

463
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.049
You like Na Ra too.

464
00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:21.309
How did you know...

465
00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:24.599
You stare at her every day.

466
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.730
Am I wrong?

467
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.980
Where are you guys?

468
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.990
- Chi Yeol!
- Guys!

469
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.319
- Kim Chi Yeol!
- They are calling for us.

470
00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:37.910
Let's go.

471
00:25:57.259 --> 00:25:59.470
(Yongwon Penitentiary)

472
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.529
Hey, Mister.

473
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.380
Are you really unwell, Mister?

474
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.349
Mister.

475
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.529
You witch!

476
00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:43.319
I can't find cigarettes anywhere.

477
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.990
I guess people make sure to take cigarettes with them.

478
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.910
I know.

479
00:27:51.329 --> 00:27:52.579
Did you hear that?

480
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.789
What?

481
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:57.880
- Where's No Ae Seol?
- What?

482
00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.299
Where is No Ae Seol?

483
00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:00.549
Wasn't she with you?

484
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.339
Darn it.

485
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.849
Why wouldn't you open the door?

486
00:28:06.849 --> 00:28:08.930
Why won't you listen to me, you witch!

487
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.099
Why would you make me the bad guy, you wicked witch!

488
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:17.730
I thought I was going to die in here.

489
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.279
Gosh.

490
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.450
My darling.

491
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.619
Thank you.

492
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.690
What is he saying?

493
00:28:55.099 --> 00:28:56.690
- I don't know.
- Gosh.

494
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.650
- What are you doing? Come on.
- You go.

495
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.069
- Darn it.
- Come. You have to do this.

496
00:29:01.069 --> 00:29:02.819
You go first.

497
00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:04.069
Never mind.

498
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.369
Gosh.

499
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.410
Darn it.

500
00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:13.250
Development plan. Search status.

501
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.250
Look at these.

502
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:18.250
They are actually pretty systematic.

503
00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:21.339
It looks like they are on their own without a commander-in-chief.

504
00:29:21.339 --> 00:29:22.420
Right.

505
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.799
Are they naive or stupid?

506
00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:25.430
They must've had a vote.

507
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.259
They've stocked up quite a lot of food too.

508
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.390
Look, guys.

509
00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:32.730
They've saved up a lot of bullets.

510
00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:35.190
- How many have they got?
- Over 800.

511
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.019
Let's ask them if we can borrow some.

512
00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:38.309
No. I'm shy.

513
00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.109
I will ask them.

514
00:29:40.819 --> 00:29:42.109
- You're the best.
- Look.

515
00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:43.609
There are lots of girls.

516
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.319
- Girls?
- Girls? Let me see.

517
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:47.740
- Look.
- How many are they?

518
00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.240
One, two, three, four,

519
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.039
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

520
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.789
- Ten girls!
- Hey.

521
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.910
- Are you happy?
- We are happy.

522
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.119
I am not happy.

523
00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:58.130
I hope they are...

524
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.500
the feminine type, unlike you girls.

525
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.130
- Right?
- Right.

526
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.589
Female sex chromosome wouldn't be their only female attribute.

527
00:30:04.589 --> 00:30:06.299
- Are you crazy?
- Think about how you look.

528
00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:07.759
- Hey.
- Gosh.

529
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.220
I will actually shoot you.

530
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.259
Just shoot him.

531
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.720
Do not hesitate.

532
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.309
Hands up!

533
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.480
Hands up!

534
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.730
You. Move.

535
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.400
- Okay.
- Move.

536
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.440
- Hands up.
- Hurry up!

537
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.569
Science high school?

538
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.369
Gosh, they are high school seniors too. We didn't have to get scared.

539
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:30.740
Don't get intimidated.

540
00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:33.369
Science high school.

541
00:30:33.619 --> 00:30:37.500
- So you study science?
- Yes.

542
00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:40.460
What's wrong with her?

543
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:43.339
Yes.

544
00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:44.920
We go to science high school.

545
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.730
You don't look nerdy, so we nearly got you wrong.

546
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.519
This?

547
00:30:57.809 --> 00:30:59.480
We normally don't get to do this,

548
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.480
so I thought I would do it now.

549
00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:03.650
And you know,

550
00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.900
and it's a prejudice that a smart kid has to look like a nerd.

551
00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:08.700
It's my first time to meet students from the science high school.

552
00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:11.160
You guys must be really smart.

553
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.490
Well, we are not too bad.

554
00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:18.410
But you are the worst among us.

555
00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:21.500
So what? There are three people after me.

556
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.130
So what? You're not any better than them.

557
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.549
Whatever you say.

558
00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:29.930
By the way, why are you here?

559
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.059
We were passing by, and it looked occupied.

560
00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:38.680
By the way, there are just the three of you?

561
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.599
No. Other kids went out on a mission.

562
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.650
We are guarding the base camp.

563
00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:46.730
Darn it.

564
00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:48.990
Hey, we don't know if they are an ally or foe.

565
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.740
Why would you give away our Intel?

566
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.569
They are not the spheres, are they?

567
00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:55.279
How can they be the foe?

568
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:56.950
We don't know who they are.

569
00:31:57.829 --> 00:31:59.710
And what is up with your tone?

570
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.579
What's wrong with my tone?

571
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:04.339
You sound too cute.

572
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:06.839
I always sound cute.

573
00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:10.509
And why do you care how I sound?

574
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.470
I am just worried.

575
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.589
Who asked you to worry?

576
00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:15.640
My heart wants to worry. My heart.

577
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.559
You two are going out, aren't you?

578
00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:23.480
- Is it obvious?
- It's obvious.

579
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.359
It's obvious?

580
00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:30.900
Just ignore them.

581
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.029
So where are you headed?

582
00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:36.450
- Seoul.
- Seoul?

583
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.200
Yes. We are going to the shelter in Seoul.

584
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.660
Do you want to join us?

585
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.710
Seoul?

586
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.170
On your own?

587
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.750
Sounds good. Let's go together then.

588
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.210
- That sounds good.
- I love it.

589
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.170
- I love it too.
- No.

590
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.130
We have to stay here.

591
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:54.430
We have to wait for the others.

592
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.140
- Right.
- Right.

593
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.640
We were like that first,

594
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640
but we decided to go separate ways this time.

595
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.849
What?

596
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.730
What about the others then?

597
00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:04.190
They are staying behind, carrying out the operation.

598
00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:07.309
CSAT is cancelled though.

599
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.190
What's wrong with them?

600
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.779
I know.

601
00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:13.279
What did you just say?

602
00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:15.869
I don't know what's wrong with them.

603
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.950
No. Before that.

604
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.450
CSAT got cancelled?

605
00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:22.160
Is that true?

606
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.619
Yes.

607
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.250
You...

608
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.039
didn't know?

609
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.210
Wait. CSAT really got cancelled?

610
00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:34.299
How did you guys find out?

611
00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.849
They radioed each unit and let us know.

612
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.519
Didn't you guys hear about it?

613
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.349
No. Our walkie-talkie is broken.

614
00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:49.609
Gosh, then were you here carrying out the operation...

615
00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:51.230
when your walkie-talkie is broken?

616
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.450
Gosh, it must've been hard for you.

617
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.069
- Hey, tell us in detail.
- What?

618
00:33:57.069 --> 00:33:58.619
Are you sure the CSAT is cancelled?

619
00:33:58.619 --> 00:33:59.990
Then is everyone supposed to go home?

620
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.829
Are we being discharged? What did they say?

621
00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:03.579
We're not being discharged.

622
00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:05.000
The CSAT has been cancelled,

623
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.960
but they'll give us extra points for next year's exams.

624
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.670
They said to continue with the operation as planned.

625
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.750
That's right. But we had different opinions.

626
00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:14.220
We can't really believe what they tell us.

627
00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:17.380
And as you can see, we're really exhausted. That's why.

628
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.889
So you guys were the only ones who got the news.

629
00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.769
Well, I'm sure the other schools got the news too.

630
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.849
Then we should go back to Seoul too.

631
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.610
Why should we stay here if the CSAT has been cancelled?

632
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.610
When the others get back,

633
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.269
- let's tell them to go home.
- Right.

634
00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:34.940
- Jun Hee. Let's go home.
- Did you really get the radio?

635
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.320
I want to hear it myself.

636
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.159
Could you maybe tell them news about our unit too?

637
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.579
But our walkie-talkie is with the others who stayed behind.

638
00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.789
- Gosh, darn it.
- Darn it.

639
00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:48.039
Do you want me to fix your walkie-talkie for you?

640
00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:51.210
What? Can you fix it?

641
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.880
No.

642
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.630
Not me, but him. I'm sure he can fix it.

643
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.510
He even entered a science competition and won.

644
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.349
Really? Can you really fix it?

645
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.019
I'm not sure.

646
00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:11.480
I'll have to see it first.

647
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.280
- Oh, so that's what it looks like.
- That's cool.

648
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.489
So you can get calls but can't get radio messages, right?

649
00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:20.530
Yes.

650
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.829
- What?
- Why?

651
00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:31.920
- I don't think this can be fixed.
- What?

652
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.630
Gosh, you were so confident before. My goodness.

653
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.880
No. This is a PRC-999K model.

654
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.429
From where you're standing, if you look at the bottom left,

655
00:35:42.429 --> 00:35:43.969
there's a thing called a circuit board card.

656
00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:46.099
That's this thing right here.

657
00:35:46.469 --> 00:35:47.889
Explain it in easy terms.

658
00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:49.940
Look here.

659
00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:51.940
This rectangular thing is the frequency modulator.

660
00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:53.190
But...

661
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.320
it's missing these two parts.

662
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.739
- Really?
- No way.

663
00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:58.820
You're right.

664
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.739
- What's he saying?
- No way.

665
00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:02.239
I told you to explain it in easy terms.

666
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.070
My goodness.

667
00:36:04.489 --> 00:36:06.119
This part is gone.

668
00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:09.159
So, you're saying we can't get radio messages...

669
00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:11.000
because we don't have this part, right?

670
00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:14.380
Did it bump into something and get knocked out?

671
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.420
Is that what happened?

672
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.590
This can't be removed unless somebody takes it out on purpose.

673
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.050
On purpose?

674
00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:26.849
He's saying it's not broken.

675
00:36:26.849 --> 00:36:28.679
Someone took it out on purpose.

676
00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:32.139
Someone did it on purpose?

677
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.980
Why?

678
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.750
(Hopeful Corrections)

679
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.590
What is it?

680
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.380
Who shot that? Was it a sphere?

681
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.719
Gosh, what do we do?

682
00:37:07.969 --> 00:37:09.010
Idiot.

683
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:10.679
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. Where are you going?

684
00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:11.730
Hurry up!

685
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.599
Darn it.

686
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:16.690
- Hey, wait up!
- Darn it.

687
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.690
Gosh, it was a real gun.

688
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.610
You scared me, you jerk.

689
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.280
Gosh, it was real.

690
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.610
Darn it.

691
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.659
Hey, scrawny man, nice job.

692
00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:29.079
Gosh, how scary.

693
00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:31.369
- Am I cool?
- Yes, you are.

694
00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:37.460
Oh, I borrowed your mom's photo for a little while.

695
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.039
We made it out thanks to that.

696
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.050
You used it like that?

697
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.760
- Unbelievable.
- I got goosebumps.

698
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.969
Brother, I salute you.

699
00:37:46.179 --> 00:37:47.969
Thank you very much.

700
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.309
What...

701
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:56.019
Hey, it would've been nice if you opened it sooner.

702
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.400
Did you really have to make us show you our true colours?

703
00:37:59.019 --> 00:38:01.280
Still, it's a good thing that she's naive.

704
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.440
We almost died in here.

705
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.530
- I know.
- Right.

706
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.780
Hey, look how soft her skin is.

707
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.070
- You're right.
- Let me touch it too.

708
00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:10.489
Stop that.

709
00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.829
Don't quiver. It's making me want you more.

710
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:16.119
What? Really?

711
00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:20.590
All right, cutie. What's going on out there right now?

712
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.969
Hey, stop wasting time and let's get going.

713
00:38:27.929 --> 00:38:32.059
Mister, there's no need to rush so much.

714
00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.849
What if the whole military is out there?

715
00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:36.559
We should find out what's going on out there first.

716
00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:40.269
You might have been the boss in the outside world,

717
00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:43.030
but in here, you have to listen to us.

718
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.110
Bang.

719
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.780
Hey, you're a good shot.

720
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.659
All right, now tell me.

721
00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:50.489
What are you guys hiding?

722
00:38:54.869 --> 00:38:55.949
Aren't you going to talk?

723
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.679
Please let me go.

724
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.929
Darn it, you really won't listen!

725
00:39:11.929 --> 00:39:14.099
- Hey, give me that.
- Okay.

726
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.889
Kids! Your friend is with us.

727
00:39:19.809 --> 00:39:21.440
Let's have a meeting!

728
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.269
Let's talk!

729
00:39:23.269 --> 00:39:24.690
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

730
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:31.739
Darn it!

731
00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:38.210
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

732
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:39.750
- Gosh.
- There are so many.

733
00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:43.090
Hey, they have regular ammo,

734
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.210
and they have more than two boxes of these.

735
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.420
- Really?
- Gosh.

736
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.719
But was this truck trying to get patients out?

737
00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:51.969
Why did they leave it here?

738
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.260
Were they attacked by spheres?

739
00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.519
Who cares? We have a whole lot of ammo now.

740
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.139
Is today some kind of special day? Is it our birthday today?

741
00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:04.190
If the others find out, they'll be so happy, right?

742
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.320
What? Yes, right.

743
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.400
Hey, we found the medicine. This is so great.

744
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.949
Yeon Ju, why are you crying?

745
00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:15.449
You should smile.

746
00:40:16.489 --> 00:40:20.000
Goodness, someone might think you found a river of gold.

747
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.670
Let's grab everything and get back.

748
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.920
I want to see the others become happy too.

749
00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:26.460
- Then I'll load up the ammo.
- And I'll help.

750
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.300
Then the rest of us should go upstairs and grab what we need.

751
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.679
We can get stuff like medicine, blankets, and anything else we need.

752
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.760
Okay, then we'll go get the water tanks.

753
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:35.929
Twenty minutes should do it, right?

754
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.719
- Then let's meet back here.
- Okay.

755
00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:40.389
- All right.
- Okay!

756
00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:42.809
The others will be so surprised.

757
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.519
Hey, but where is Soo Chul?

758
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.650
What?

759
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.739
Did he go to the restroom for a bit?

760
00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:56.119
Is that so? Then you get Soo Chul and grab the blankets.

761
00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:57.869
Why should I?

762
00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:01.250
Just do what you're told. Why do you ask so many questions?

763
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.539
Everyone else is helping out.

764
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.670
Hey, I'll just go.

765
00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:09.130
Darn it. That would've been nice.

766
00:41:13.929 --> 00:41:15.429
Then I'll see you later.

767
00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:22.480
Who does he think he is to order me around?

768
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.820
Do your ears hurt?

769
00:41:36.989 --> 00:41:39.079
Gosh, you guys got here so fast.

770
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.949
Oh, gosh. Your friends are here.

771
00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:42.289
Jang Soo.

772
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.710
What are they doing?

773
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.130
What are you doing? Darn it! You punks!

774
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.670
What do you think you're doing?

775
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.960
Hey, you punk!

776
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.420
- Hey, jerks. Can't you see?
- You darned punks!

777
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.679
Come with us.

778
00:41:56.969 --> 00:41:59.300
Your friends are here. Say hi.

779
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.260
Can't you see what's going on, you little punks?

780
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.599
- Let her go first.
- Open this door first, punk.

781
00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:05.230
I'll open it if you let her go!

782
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.230
Darn it.

783
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.940
Hey, open up first. If not,

784
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.190
your friend will die. Got it?

785
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.320
She really will die.

786
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.449
Got it?

787
00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:19.489
Okay?

788
00:42:21.949 --> 00:42:24.039
Darn it, here we go again.

789
00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:26.079
Hey, get on your knees.

790
00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:29.670
Darn it!

791
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.590
Your friend is dying because of you guys.

792
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.130
Do you not care?

793
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.469
She really will die.

794
00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:48.309
She's not our friend.

795
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.780
You nasty wench. Hang on. What are you doing?

796
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.900
- You guys, aim your guns too.
- Bo Ra.

797
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.570
We have seven guns. And they only have one.

798
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.320
Don't you see Ae Seol is being held hostage?

799
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.880
Darn it, what are they doing?

800
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:23.389
Hey.

801
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:25.559
Do you want to see your friend die?

802
00:43:25.559 --> 00:43:27.019
I told you, she's not our friend.

803
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:29.389
She acted however she wanted and got everyone in danger.

804
00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:30.440
She's no friend of ours.

805
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.230
Yeon Bo Ra. Just calm down for now.

806
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.360
Bo Ra is right.

807
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.690
There's no need to give in to these criminals' demands.

808
00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:40.239
Darn it, we're screwed. They have so many guns.

809
00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:41.869
No, they're bluffing.

810
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.909
- Can't you see his hands trembling?
- Darn it.

811
00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:47.289
- Gosh.
- Oh, man.

812
00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.789
Hey! You darned punks! Open up!

813
00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:55.460
I have to get out of here... Darn it.

814
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.510
Gosh.

815
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.340
If you just open these doors, no one gets hurt and it'll all be over.

816
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.929
Let Ae Seol go first.

817
00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:20.489
Just go.

818
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:28.329
And I'm really sorry for causing this situation.

819
00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:47.309
Shut your mouth, you wench.

820
00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:50.099
You darn stupid idiot.

821
00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:53.099
Why do you have to act up?

822
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.059
You filthy moron.

823
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.769
Darn it!

824
00:44:56.769 --> 00:44:58.730
Look at you, idiot.

825
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.440
Kids.

826
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.900
I'm sorry.

827
00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:06.159
That must hurt.

828
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:07.869
It must be painful.

829
00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:09.039
Get up. It's all right.

830
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.829
No!

831
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:15.210
- You little...
- Hey!

832
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.840
- Get up.
- What are you doing? Stop!

833
00:45:17.539 --> 00:45:18.960
It's been darn hard for me to hold it in.

834
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.300
Please stop!

835
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.050
Kids, it's time for sex education.

836
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.260
We'll teach you how babies are made.

837
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.179
Stop, darn it!

838
00:45:26.179 --> 00:45:28.050
Stop.

839
00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:30.719
- Stop!
- What are you looking at?

840
00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:33.769
I said, stop!

841
00:45:34.639 --> 00:45:36.400
Darn it! Get your hands off her!

842
00:45:49.489 --> 00:45:51.119
Darn.

843
00:45:51.409 --> 00:45:53.159
Goodness.

844
00:45:53.539 --> 00:45:55.829
Should I go first?

845
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.250
Never mind.

846
00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.550
Kids, I will give you...

847
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.260
just 10 minutes.

848
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.090
If you're even a second late,

849
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.969
I won't be able to stop these guys.

850
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.510
Gosh, a scent of woman.

851
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.019
Do you understand, Bo Ra?

852
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.949
Okay.

853
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.369
Goodness.

854
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.630
Let's just release them.

855
00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:47.880
There's no other way.

856
00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:49.090
Then what?

857
00:46:49.179 --> 00:46:52.059
Do you think they will let Ae Seol go that easily?

858
00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:55.429
All of us will be in danger.

859
00:46:56.059 --> 00:46:58.940
Then what do we do?

860
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.519
Darn it! Those despicable scums.

861
00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:11.699
What is it?

862
00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:13.369
Spheres?

863
00:47:13.369 --> 00:47:14.619
Where did they suddenly come from?

864
00:47:16.789 --> 00:47:17.869
There are four.

865
00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:19.289
They're approaching near.

866
00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:20.460
What do we do?

867
00:47:20.539 --> 00:47:22.880
Why even the spheres now?

868
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.469
Given this speed, they'll enter the building in a few minutes.

869
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.389
It can't be helped.

870
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.010
Let's release them.

871
00:47:33.679 --> 00:47:34.760
Gosh.

872
00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:38.099
What if they just ran off?

873
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.309
Maybe we're doomed for being all laid back.

874
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.940
Whether it's war or anything,

875
00:47:43.269 --> 00:47:46.110
something definitely happened outside.

876
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.400
In that case, going outside unprepared...

877
00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:52.159
could be more dangerous.

878
00:47:52.159 --> 00:47:53.320
Hey.

879
00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:55.739
Is it really true that the spheres or whatever fell from the sky...

880
00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.119
and caused a disaster outside?

881
00:47:57.289 --> 00:47:59.369
Be honest with me. Where did you come from?

882
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.039
Tell me.

883
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.710
Say something, you wench.

884
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.840
You should've cornered them even more...

885
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.210
instead of giving them 10 minutes.

886
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.800
They couldn't have run off, could they?

887
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.590
It's not that I don't trust you.

888
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.010
They will come back.

889
00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:15.219
Look at her.

890
00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:18.139
She's young, but she doesn't even weep for mercy.

891
00:48:18.139 --> 00:48:19.389
She just told them to go.

892
00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:21.059
Couldn't you tell by that?

893
00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:23.650
And think of how they looked at her.

894
00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:25.900
I won't doubt you.

895
00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:35.579
- They're here.
- See?

896
00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:36.789
Good to see you.

897
00:48:38.409 --> 00:48:39.659
Welcome.

898
00:48:39.659 --> 00:48:41.079
- It's nice to see you.
- Welcome.

899
00:48:46.539 --> 00:48:47.750
Nice to see you.

900
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.719
Two are missing.

901
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:52.800
What's there to worry, mister?

902
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.429
Maybe they ran off.

903
00:48:54.429 --> 00:48:55.889
Everyone, back off.

904
00:48:56.179 --> 00:48:57.349
And send Ae Seol over to us first.

905
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:58.639
The door first.

906
00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:00.269
Open it quickly.

907
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:02.019
We have no time for this.

908
00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:05.019
Kids, put the guns down.

909
00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:06.269
It's dangerous.

910
00:49:06.269 --> 00:49:08.070
- Tell them to put them far away.
- Yes, put them far away.

911
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.860
Put them away over there.

912
00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.400
Put them down.

913
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.110
- Put them down.
- Come on.

914
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.949
There's no need to fight.

915
00:49:14.949 --> 00:49:16.199
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

916
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:17.659
There's no time.

917
00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:18.699
I won't let you have her.

918
00:49:18.699 --> 00:49:20.199
Do you want her or not?

919
00:49:20.909 --> 00:49:22.500
Hurry up.

920
00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:25.460
- Come on.
- Do you want her?

921
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.679
Now open the door.

922
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.139
Open it.

923
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.139
There you go.

924
00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:41.719
Open it already.

925
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:44.849
Stick it in.

926
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.650
And turn it.

927
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.730
Now the door is open.

928
00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.860
That's smart of you. Good boy.

929
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.360
That's worth an award certificate.

930
00:49:56.739 --> 00:49:57.949
Now let Ae Seol go.

931
00:49:58.239 --> 00:49:59.329
Ae Seol?

932
00:49:59.659 --> 00:50:00.739
Who's that?

933
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.960
Why are you all so serious?

934
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.090
All right. Hey, go.

935
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.300
Send her over.

936
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.750
- Send her over.
- Ae Seol.

937
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:14.760
It's all right. Let's go.

938
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.719
Goodness, you're heavy.

939
00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:19.050
Let's go.

940
00:50:21.099 --> 00:50:22.469
You went through a lot, Ae Seol.

941
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:23.769
It was only for a moment,

942
00:50:23.849 --> 00:50:25.099
but my feelings were sincere.

943
00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:27.690
Go.

944
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.110
All right.

945
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.739
Now she's on her way.

946
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.360
Okay? Kids.

947
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.199
This seems to be all.

948
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.369
Gosh, I'm tired.

949
00:50:43.489 --> 00:50:44.699
Why aren't the others coming?

950
00:50:47.539 --> 00:50:49.289
What was that sound?

951
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:16.989
Goodness!

952
00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.909
What is it?

953
00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:31.460
Oh, my.

954
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.880
Now go.

955
00:51:44.179 --> 00:51:45.309
It was a lie!

956
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.230
It was a lie!

957
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:48.389
Run!

958
00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:50.230
Bang!

959
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.559
One kill. Two kills.

960
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.809
What's "three" in English?

961
00:51:53.059 --> 00:51:55.780
Be gentle. Or they will bleed.

962
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.440
Two, three.

963
00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:03.699
We're finally freed!

964
00:52:31.769 --> 00:52:34.769
(Duty After School)

965
00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:50.960
Even if you all criticize me, it can't be helped.

966
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:56.420
Now even I don't know...

967
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:58.880
if I'm doing right.

968
00:53:05.179 --> 00:53:06.389
But...

969
00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:14.519
But I want to put an end to it.

970
00:53:33.329 --> 00:53:36.380
(Duty After School)
