00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.550
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.679
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.619
What do we do?

4
00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.520
What's going on?

5
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:11.689
Shoot.

6
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.569
Guys, can't we just stay in the truck?

7
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:17.989
Come on.

8
00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:19.659
Move.

9
00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.500
Hurry.

10
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.250
What is that?

11
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.040
Isn't that Class One's truck?

12
00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:31.000
Yu Jung, you're with me.

13
00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.129
The rest of you, search the perimeter.

14
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.969
To your positions.

15
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.930
Wait.

16
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.598
Did they all get eaten up by the spheres?

17
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.730
Hey, stop saying unlucky stuff.

18
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.650
I'm just scared.

19
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.829
So, the kids...

20
00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.709
What the heck is going on?

21
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.250
What?

22
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.719
Lieutenant!

23
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.060
Look.

24
00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.240
They must have hidden.

25
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.659
They couldn't have gone far.

26
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.579
Duk Joong and Hee Rak, go back down and stay on guard.

27
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.699
Bo Ra and Na Ra, cover our right flank.

28
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.539
Ae Seol, Ha Na, and Yu Jung,

29
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.370
come with me.

30
00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.250
- To your positions.
- Sir.

31
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.219
But I'm scared.

32
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.150
What's that?

33
00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.229
What is it?

34
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.240
Something's flapping over there.

35
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.330
Darn it.

36
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.370
Lieutenant! It's a sphere!

37
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.539
Get ready to fire!

38
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.419
Oh, no.

39
00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.300
What do I do?

40
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:11.960
Move.

41
00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.129
Fire!

42
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.680
Die, scum!

43
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.600
Die!

44
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.439
Get the key!

45
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.899
Shoot.

46
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.480
Hey, punk!

47
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.489
Get in the truck. Now!

48
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.699
Shoot.

49
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.240
- Do you think you can reach it?
- Come on.

50
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.449
Darn.

51
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.620
- Kill them!
- Die!

52
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:22.990
Crap.

53
00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.160
Can you reach it?

54
00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.489
Hee Rak, get in the truck.

55
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.579
Just a little more. No?

56
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.540
What?

57
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.209
- Here.
- Get in the truck now!

58
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.680
Start the truck!

59
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.768
We're ready!

60
00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:55.060
Okay. Drive.

61
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.269
Here I go.

62
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.439
Hang on tight!

63
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.189
Jang Soo...

64
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.069
What do we do about him?

65
00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.160
Where's Hee Rak?

66
00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.160
Crap.

67
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.939
Crap! Go away!

68
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.399
Freak!

69
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.169
Stupid. Where's your bluff now?

70
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:10.340
I remembered that the thing was weak against the cold.

71
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.379
I wasn't sure, but...

72
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.009
Are you laughing?

73
00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.399
Here.

74
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.879
Idiot.

75
00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:51.169
Did you think I'd help you up?

76
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.090
Let's go.

77
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:08.059
Let's go!

78
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.558
I was the one who saved you.

79
00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.690
Why are you acting like the hero?

80
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.909
By the way,

81
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.289
why did you do it?

82
00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:27.370
Do what?

83
00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:30.539
Stop trying to be a hero.

84
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.669
Whatever.

85
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.379
We're so incompatible.

86
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.369
I thought I'd never see you again!

87
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.539
Do you want some water?

88
00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:15.549
- Where do you think you're going?
- What?

89
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.629
We thought that we'd lost you.

90
00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:20.258
Don't even get me started on that. We barely made it out.

91
00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:22.639
We had it pretty tough too.

92
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.638
- Right, Duk Joong?
- It was legendary.

93
00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.768
We'd need more than three days...

94
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.519
to finish telling our story.

95
00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.639
Jang Soo.

96
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.019
Am I wrong?

97
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.480
Four days.

98
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:43.450
- What did he say?
- That was so random.

99
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.120
- Lame.
- Lame.

100
00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:47.659
You're so boring.

101
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.709
- Guys.
- You still smell.

102
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.538
- What?
- Take a shower, please!

103
00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:54.589
- I did. Four days ago.
- What?

104
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.379
- Why?
- That's impossible.

105
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.589
It's good to see you alive.

106
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.628
Wasn't there water?

107
00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:00.840
What?

108
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.758
- I'm so glad to have you back.
- Get off me.

109
00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:05.799
Same here.

110
00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:11.559
Come here, Hee Rak!

111
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.690
- Is that okay?
- What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.768
I hurt myself.

113
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.979
- How?
- No, she's just being a crybaby.

114
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.028
- She is!
- Seriously.

115
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:20.359
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.860
How are you doing?

117
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.699
Fine.

118
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.029
We'll get you treated soon.

119
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.330
Are you okay?

120
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.370
Are you hurt?

121
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.710
Well, I'm fine.

122
00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:38.340
That's a relief.

123
00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:40.710
I was worried sick.

124
00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:42.009
What?

125
00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:46.509
I'm relieved...

126
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.679
that everyone's safe.

127
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:56.100
Right. Me too.

128
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.029
Thanks...

129
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.409
for coming for us.

130
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.230
- Won Bin!
- What?

131
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.059
- Kids!
- Won Bin!

132
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.439
- Won Bin!
- Look who's here!

133
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.898
- I can't believe it!
- You guys came!

134
00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:45.200
Are you all feeling okay?

135
00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:47.359
Are you hurt or anything?

136
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.569
- No.
- Are you okay?

137
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.119
You look way older.

138
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.039
I got older every second I waited for you.

139
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.409
- You're all safe?
- Yes.

140
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.210
Young Soo!

141
00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:02.049
- You're here.
- Hey.

142
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.590
It sounds like you don't want us here.

143
00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:07.629
Selfish bastard.

144
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.350
If we had failed to come, he would have celebrated...

145
00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:12.559
having less competition.

146
00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:15.519
Come on, buddy.

147
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.980
Young Soo!

148
00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:24.279
Did you set up all these by yourself for your classmates?

149
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.190
Good work.

150
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.450
Young Soo was...

151
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.490
also worried about you guys.

152
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.240
So, don't give him a hard time.

153
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.669
Attention.

154
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.128
Great job on making it alive.

155
00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:43.299
This is the boys' tent, and this is the girls' tent.

156
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.710
To your tents!

157
00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.470
You want us to rest here?

158
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.508
But we narrowly escaped death on our way here.

159
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:49.799
You'll have to get used to it.

160
00:14:50.429 --> 00:14:53.429
The cots are 1st-come-1st-served.

161
00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:54.850
To your positions!

162
00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:00.350
What?

163
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.939
You're so sneaky!

164
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.230
- Hurry.
- I want to go to the back!

165
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.939
Thanks.

166
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.070
Yes!

167
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.450
Awesome. It's soft.

168
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.450
I was dying to wash. They have everything here.

169
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.169
Lieutenant.

170
00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:24.090
Sergeant.

171
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.379
Welcome back.

172
00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:30.379
Take care of the kids.

173
00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:34.429
Check this out! See?

174
00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:36.769
- Hey.
- Not so fast.

175
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:38.559
Come on!

176
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.268
I'm taking it.

177
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:42.100
- Stop all this fight.
- Get him!

178
00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:45.819
But I want it!

179
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.190
Not on my watch.

180
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.320
- Catch him!
- Come here.

181
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.658
- But I want it.
- Throw it.

182
00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:53.909
Throw it away.

183
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.370
You ought to be executed!

184
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.158
Going AWOL, using unauthorized gear,

185
00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.450
and insubordination!

186
00:15:59.909 --> 00:16:01.159
What else?

187
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.000
- I apologize, sir.
- "Apologize?"

188
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.629
Buddy.

189
00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:11.509
Is that your apologizing look?

190
00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.309
- I ought to...
- Sir!

191
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.269
You'll be shot to death next time.

192
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:30.279
Eventually, you brought the kids here safely.

193
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.909
We'll at least be able to tell the superiors and parents something.

194
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.700
Thank you, sir.

195
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.029
You're a madman.

196
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.409
Dismissed.

197
00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.709
That imbecile.

198
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.539
I can't even send him to prison.

199
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:48.960
Should we send him?

200
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.379
What are you talking about?

201
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.759
He's twice as better a soldier as you are.

202
00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.299
Gosh.

(Duty After School)

210
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.880
- He looks good!
- Look at you.

211
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.180
You look like a middle-aged woman.

212
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.059
Hi!

213
00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:28.808
Stop filming.

214
00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:31.150
You certainly know who the cutest girl is.

215
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.979
It's better than I thought.

216
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.069
Soon Yi. How do I look?

217
00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.700
Check this out.

218
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.779
Get that camera out of my face!

219
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.289
How are you?

220
00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:46.410
You guys are a cute couple!

221
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.039
Beautiful.

222
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.250
I'm jealous.

223
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:55.170
We're not trainees anymore. We're reservists.

224
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.390
But now that I'm in uniform,

225
00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:03.049
it feels so odd.

226
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.939
We just finished counting.

227
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.568

(Reservist number 23, Choi Yeon Ju)

233
00:19:22.569 --> 00:19:24.200
I still can't believe it.

234
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.288
You have to shave this part nicely.

235
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.249
- You need to be careful.
- Gosh.

236
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.750
It was torn.

237
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Seriously. Do you want to see it?

238
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.630
Poor you.

239
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.048

240

- Sorry.

- I'm really sorry.
- Hey.

242
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.930
Pervert.

243
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.519
- What?
- What happened?

244
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680
What's wrong with me?

245
00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:51.558
- I'm so sorry!
- Is her eye okay?

246
00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:54.190
- Use that one.
- This one?

247
00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.690
How are you feeling, So Yeon? All right?

248
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.529
Yes. I'm all cured now.

250

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.789
You're so cool!

255
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.130
It's nothing.

256
00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:18.170
- Aren't they heavy, Soo Chul?
- They're not.

257
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.719
Soo Chul, you must be really strong.

258
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.970
This was nothing.

259

Cheer up, Young Soo.

260
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:25.720
Cheer up.

261
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.230

262
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.518
- Do you ever help?
- Fine.

263

264
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.268

265
00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:39.729

(Reservist number 12, Wang Tae Man)

But it was still the army.

268

Shovel it in properly.

269
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.660
We'd be perfectly fine if you held the bag properly.

270
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.920
Don't you think we're shovelling too often?

271
00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:03.048
We dig waterways, foxholes,

272
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:04.839
and make camps all day!

273
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.009

By the way, Chi Yeol,

276
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.889
- Yes?
- we'll be moved to a shelter...

277
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.479
before CSAT, right?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.149
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

279
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.109
Then, we'd only have a few days.

280
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.778
I didn't even get to mathematics for seniors.

00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:25.029
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

282
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.160
You're still talking about studying in these circumstances?

283
00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:32.039
- What?
- It's gone!

284
00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:33.159
- What?
- What?

285
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.869
- My underwear!
- Gosh.

286
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.788
- Unbelievable.
- You took it, didn't you?

287
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:40.549
- It wasn't me.
- Says who?

288
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.919
These perverts!

289
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.008
Gosh. It's right here.

290
00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.719
- Gross.
- I knew it.

291
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.099
I heard we'd be discharged soon. Is that true?

292
00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:55.099
- Yu Jung.
- Yes?

293
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.059
Do you have any info?

294
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.940
I have no idea.

295
00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:00.859
They all ask me, though.

296
00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:04.190
Yu Jung, you look exhausted.

297
00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:06.859
I'm fine.

298

Class President! What's for dinner?

299
00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:15.289
- Class President!
- Yes?

300
00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:17.959
- How do we do it?
- Are you slacking over there?

301
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.288
- Are you holding it?
- Yes.

302
00:22:19.289 --> 00:22:20.588
Is this how we do it?

303
00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.839
Three people sleep in this tiny tent?

304
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.009
It looks small even for two.

305
00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:28.220
No!

306
00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:33.679
This isn't a tent. This is a rag.

307
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.519
Anyway, we're doomed.

308
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.439
Tae Man is going to take up the whole space.

309
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.769
Stop complaining.

310
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.190
This is a fun activity, compared to other drills.

311
00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:46.440
Be optimistic and consider it camping.

312
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.490
Darn it.

313
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.039
It doesn't go in! This is so messed up.

314
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.159
The group that fails to set it up properly...

315
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.750
will have to take it apart and start over.

316
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.419
These are the tents that we'll use in the actual battle,

317
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.210
so stop fooling around. Take this seriously!

318
00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:06.379
I fixed it, so don't trip on it.

319
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.420
Okay.

320
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.470
Soon Yi!

321
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.258
Hey, Yu Jung! Come here.

322
00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:17.139
I can't be in this group. Let me move to a new one.

323
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.650
It's like they're crying for milk.

324
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.190
Just get in there!

325
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:28.779
That boy from another school was pretty cute.

326
00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:30.990
He asked for my number.

327
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:33.200
But we don't even have phones.

328
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.369
What about the boy in Class One?

329
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.039
I ended things with him already.

330
00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:38.829
He doesn't get training.

331
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.500
I can't date a guy who hasn't even fired a rifle.

332
00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:44.089
Men who haven't finished their military service...

333
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.049
are little boys to me now.

334
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.588
Whatever you say.

335
00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:48.630
Hey.

336
00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:50.799
You do it. I'm done.

337
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:54.508
But I can't do it if you can't do it!

338
00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:56.140
Oh, gosh.

339
00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:57.680
Let me try.

340
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.348
Na Ra!

341
00:24:03.349 --> 00:24:05.018
- Ae Seol, hold on tightly.
- Wait.

342
00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:06.230
Give me a second.

343
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.190
Seriously. What are you doing?

344
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:14.739
What is the matter with you?

345
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.410
Sorry.

346
00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:18.160
Hold onto it!

347
00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:43.808
Hi, Bo Ra.

348
00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:45.019
Hey, No Ae.

349
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.819
Why don't you just drop out?

350
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.700
- Why?
- It's for your own good.

351
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.029
What do you get from staying here?

352
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.910
Are you dying to go to college too?

353
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.539
No, right?

354
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.500
Who cares about college?

355
00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:07.000
You could get in serious trouble if you stayed.

356
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.130
I'm not leaving.

357
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.298
All my friends are here.

358
00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:14.180
You don't have any friends!

359
00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:17.009
Ae Seol does have friends.

360
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.559
Gosh.

361
00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:26.599
Never mind. I shouldn't have said anything.

362
00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:44.539
Stop being nosy about everything.

363
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.210
What is the meaning of being nosy?

364
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.839
Na Ra, are you being a show-off for being a good marksman?

365
00:25:54.339 --> 00:25:57.429
Why do you care what I say to No Ae?

366
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.469
You're always on her...

367
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.220
You probably feel fine because you manage everything.

368
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.019
Do you think you'll be accepting when she causes you trouble?

369
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.059
You don't know anything.

370
00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:10.690
Neither do you.

371
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.359
I don't manage everything.

372
00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:21.619
- What?
- We're all trying as we suffer.

373
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:24.160
The same applies to Ae Seol.

374
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.129
As you can see, most medium spheres...

375
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.930
have fallen.

376
00:26:38.049 --> 00:26:41.349
We seem to have eliminated 20 percent of the smaller spheres.

377
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.809
In the process, unfortunately, we have lost...

378
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.930
about 50 percent of our soldiers.

379
00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:50.269
Most of these spheres are crowded in the city.

380
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:53.569
There are fewer spheres in the suburbs.

381
00:26:53.819 --> 00:26:56.239
We believe that this is because the spheres...

382
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.569
take nourishment from humans.

383
00:26:58.910 --> 00:26:59.990
So,

384
00:27:00.569 --> 00:27:02.119
because they feed on humans,

385
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.039
they're mostly where there are people.

386
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.210
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:09.828
Also, since we figured out...

388
00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:11.670
that the spheres are weak against the cold,

389
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.169
the UN has been developing cryogenic weapons...

390
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.088
to get rid of them.

391
00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:17.338
We can't just wait for them.

392
00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:19.180
We're hopelessly outnumbered, sir.

393
00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:21.720
It will get cold soon, so we can wait until...

394
00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:28.518
If the large spheres drop as we wait,

395
00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.390
and we all die!

396
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.729
While the main units eliminate the spheres,

397
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.569
we need to stop those tiny evil beings!

398
00:27:41.819 --> 00:27:42.910
Hey.

399
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.950
What's the use of Student Reserve Forces?

400
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.589
The military and the people are...

401
00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.799
well aware of your hard work.

402
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.140
There have been sacrifices along the way,

403
00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:06.809
but you are the proud sons and daughters...

404
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.890
that protect this nation from alien beings.

405
00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:11.940
Have pride in it.

406
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.109
- Hey.
- To end this war...

407
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.230
What do you think he wants that it takes so long to build it up?

408
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.979
- Maybe...
- Eliminating...

409
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.739
- he's sending us home.
- the smaller spheres...

410
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.609
- Seriously?
- No way.

411
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.869
I'm worried.

412
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.279
From now on,

413
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.909
I will make the important announcement.

414
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.039
Sorry.

415
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.368
At 0700 hours the succeeding day,

416
00:28:30.369 --> 00:28:32.368
the reservists of the second platoon,

417
00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:34.000
Class 3-2 of Sungjin High School,

418
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.920
will carry out an operation of eliminating the spheres.

419
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.299
- An operation?
- What?

420
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:41.379
- Are we going to war?
- What is this nonsense?

421
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.889
- There's no way.
- I thought we were going home!

422
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.849
- This makes no sense.
- What's "the succeeding day?"

423
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.220
It means tomorrow.

424
00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:52.309
Quiet!

425
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:54.769
Second Platoon leader.

426
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.539
Second Platoon...

427
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:17.880
will leave the camp tomorrow at 0700 hours,

428
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:21.009
join the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade,

429
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.380
and carry out...

430
00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:27.049
the clean-up operation.

431
00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:28.890
Crap.

432
00:29:29.009 --> 00:29:31.969
The objective of this operation is to go through...

433
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.808
the nearby residential areas...

434
00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:35.190
and head to Maesong-Si.

435
00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:37.809
We must eliminate as many spheres...

436
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:41.529
we encounter along the way as possible.

437
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.700
As you know, these are hard times.

438
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.950
Most national infrastructure collapsed,

439
00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:51.869
and we've lost numerous soldiers.

440
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.910
We're in desperate need of riflemen.

441
00:29:54.829 --> 00:29:57.960
Keep in mind that you are currently soldiers.

442
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.380
What about the CSAT?

443
00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:05.838
I really need to take the CSAT.

444
00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:07.049
Shut it.

445
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:08.680
No way.

446
00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:13.519
After the operation, you will take the test as scheduled.

447
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.519
Given that you conducted the operation successfully,

448
00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:17.940
not only will you get extra CSAT scores,

449
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:22.319
but you will also return to your family.

450
00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:29.119
Dismissed!

451
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.759
Heck.

452
00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:49.339
I knew something was up.

453
00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:52.720
I asked the other kids,

454
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.308
and we're going first because we're the largest group.

455
00:30:56.309 --> 00:30:57.519
This is so annoying.

456
00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:01.359
Who made a fuss about being discharged?

457
00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.450
I can't eat.

458
00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.660
Well, that's a first.

459
00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:15.829
You're right. Being able to eat in this situation would be bizarre.

460
00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.390
A will, sir?

461
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.970
(Kim Yu Jung, Yeon Bo Ra...)

462
00:31:37.349 --> 00:31:39.309
But they're already scared.

463
00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:42.650
How would we ask them?

464
00:31:48.069 --> 00:31:49.950
- I'll hand them out.
- Leave them.

465
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:52.990
This will...

466
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:56.039
only put you in a fix.

467
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.589
Lieutenant!

468
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:19.269
(No Ae Seol)

469
00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:21.849
(Cho Young Sin)

470
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.619
Apparently, writing a will is...

471
00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.579
only a formality before an operation.

472
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.199
Also, cut your fingernails or your hair...

473
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.250
to submit them in these bags. These are for...

474
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.339
These are for your funeral...

475
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.879
when they can't find your body.

476
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.798
What? Are we going out to die?

477
00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:55.179
No, that's not it.

478
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.890
Stop scaring us.

479
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.558
It's a formality.

480
00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:03.440
Exactly. Why do we need to do it if it's only a formality?

481
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.940
It's because it's going to be dangerous!

482
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.900
I thought we were being discharged.

483
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:10.779
Why are they sending us for an operation?

484
00:33:11.569 --> 00:33:13.239
I'm not sure about that. But...

485
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.279
Hey.

486
00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.119
Ask again if you're not sure.

487
00:33:17.619 --> 00:33:20.038
Ask them if this is necessary...

488
00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.000
- Ha Na, stop.
- She's the class president.

489
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
Why don't you even ask them such things?

490
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.130
You had the nerve to just accept these?

491
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.920
Hey, stop yelling at her.

492
00:33:33.089 --> 00:33:35.429
You couldn't even say a word in front of the commander.

493
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.720
So what?

494
00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.640
She's Senior Private.

495
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.390
Then, she should represent all of us.

496
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.268
Are you grubbing...

497
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:45.099
for extra CSAT scores, or what?

498
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.940
You do it.

499
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:49.229
You little punk. What did you say to her?

500
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.900
Let go of me, jerk.

501
00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:53.818
- Darn you.
- Stop fighting, guys.

502
00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:55.359
What do you want?

503
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.319
Jerk.

504
00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:13.380
Yu Jung, how are you so unaffected?

505
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.589
Doesn't this scare you?

506
00:34:16.259 --> 00:34:18.469
Man, I hate this.

507
00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:22.969
Yu Jung.

508
00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.309
Even for me, a will doesn't sound right.

509
00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:51.539
Ridiculous.

510
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.320
Jang Soo.

511
00:35:23.369 --> 00:35:25.289
To be honest, I became the class president...

512
00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:27.710
for the student records.

513
00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:30.369
At first,

514
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.710
I had zero consideration...

515
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.670
for a sense of duty or responsibility.

516
00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:44.969
By only a one-vote difference,

517
00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:47.519
you became the president, and I the vice president.

518
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.269
Do you remember?

519
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.570
I just realized how lucky I was.

520
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.570
Because I couldn't have done it as well as you.

521
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.380
Hey, Kimchi.

522
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.550
Are you sleeping?

523
00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:22.130
No. I can't fall asleep.

524
00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:26.260
Do you remember the beginning of the semester...

525
00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:28.519
when we made a list of girls by popularity?

526
00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:30.389
Yes, I do remember.

527
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.940
Was So Yeon in first place?

528
00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:36.570
- And Ha Na was second?
- Hey.

529
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.609
The girls found out about it later on...

530
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.609
they threw a fit.

531
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.110
I was terrified.

532
00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:43.530
Me too.

533
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.448
Seeing the girls without washing or cleaning themselves up,

534
00:36:48.449 --> 00:36:50.659
the difference is noticeable.

535
00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:54.170
This must be what's truly scary about war.

536
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.750
It's terrifying.

537
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.420
Some aren't different.

538
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.719
Kimchi.

539
00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:09.010
What?

540
00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:12.939
We used to take classes,

541
00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.599
go to Internet cafés, and goof around.

542
00:37:16.769 --> 00:37:18.900
Days passed by without me giving much thought to it.

543
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.489
I never imagined...

544
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.860
this would happen to us.

545
00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.368
- Ouch.
- What was that?

546
00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:31.698
You're talking too much. I can't sleep.

547
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:35.250
Did we wake you up? I'm sorry.

548
00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:39.000
Can anyone sleep right now?

549
00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:47.139
The thought of having to sleep is keeping me awake.

550
00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:54.059
Hi.

551
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:56.480
You can't sleep either, right?

552
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.239
It's merciless.

553
00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.820
The kids...

554
00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:09.409
Wait.

555
00:38:09.739 --> 00:38:10.739
Where did it go?

556
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.159
You're all here.

557
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:55.619
I can't sleep.

558
00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:59.579
It's tomorrow. What are we supposed to do?

559
00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:02.750
I'm really scared.

560
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.049
It won't be that dangerous in the suburbs.

561
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.468
Then why would they have us write our wills?

562
00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:13.218
They'll let us go home if we get through this.

563
00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:15.599
That's the only reason I'm going.

564
00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:17.519
If we get through this...

565
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.610
I miss my parents.

566
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.820
Me too.

567
00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:30.989
Darn it.

568
00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:34.788
- Mom...
- I miss my mom's kimchi jjigae.

569
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:36.118
- I'd gulp it down.
- Mom.

570
00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:38.868
I miss my mom.

571
00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:41.039
- I miss my mom.
- What else?

572
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.960
Quiet.

573
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.260
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

574
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.510
It's hot in here.

575
00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.299
- Sorry.
- Stop it.

576
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.429
- Move it.
- Stop it.

577
00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:58.019
- Won Bin.
- Duk Joong.

578
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.400
You guys.

579
00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:15.909
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:17.789
We couldn't sleep.

581
00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:19.960
We'll go back immediately.

582
00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:22.749
- We should sleep.
- Go on.

583
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.038
Let's go.

584
00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:25.039
You guys.

585
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.010
I heard you didn't have dinner.

586
00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:35.010
Sergeant Kim.

587
00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:36.639
Yes, sir.

588
00:40:37.139 --> 00:40:38.429
Bring that over now.

589
00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:41.179
Yes, sir.

590
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.979
What is this?

591
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.399
- What is it?
- I don't know.

592
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.320
- It's bread.
- Is it good?

593
00:41:27.769 --> 00:41:30.440
This is a magic trick that turns hardtacks into a cupcake.

594
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.739
There you go.

595
00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:38.159
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

596
00:41:43.289 --> 00:41:44.709
It smells amazing.

597
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.959
It's so good.

598
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.670
- It really is.
- Hey.

599
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.670
Caught it.

600
00:41:58.429 --> 00:42:00.349
- Nice.
- Good job.

601
00:42:03.929 --> 00:42:04.940
Catch.

602
00:42:10.519 --> 00:42:12.649
I didn't know hardtacks were this good.

603
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.779
- I used to throw them away.
- Me too.

604
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.659
The hardtack-sando is amazing.

605
00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:20.280
I'll salivate when I see hardtacks from now on like Pavlov's dog.

606
00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:24.000
You mean the dog of Flanders.

607
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.210
Patrasche?

608
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.510
You can be the dog.

609
00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:45.730
Forget it if I'm wrong.

610
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:48.150
- You didn't...
- How could you?

611
00:42:48.269 --> 00:42:49.650
No way.

612
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:51.860
What are you doing?

613
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.400
Tae Man!

614
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.159
Look at him.

615
00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.409
Look at that.

616
00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:02.869
Hey.

617
00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:05.789
- How dare you play with food!
- Old man.

618
00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:11.920
Stop it.

619
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:14.170
Stop it.

620
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340
Look.

621
00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:18.219
Look!

622
00:43:19.429 --> 00:43:21.010
You don't get it, do you?

623
00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:23.558
- Do you?
- Won Bin.

624
00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:24.718
Let go of me.

625
00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:25.719
What?

626
00:43:32.269 --> 00:43:33.269
I'm sorry.

627
00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:35.570
I'm sorry.

628
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.900
Kim Won Bin.

629
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:49.249
Get him.

630
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.289
- Take this.
- I'll get you.

631
00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:49.058
- We're a mess.
- I'm covered in it.

632
00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:51.138
- Look at you.
- You look worse.

633
00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:53.650
You're so childish, Lieutenant Lee.

634
00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:56.149
You look like you're having more fun than we are.

635
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.439
That was cruel.

636
00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.819
He's right.

637
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.489
What did you do before you came here, Lieutenant?

638
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:04.909
I was part of a combat unit.

639
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.199
No, before that.

640
00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:09.409
Did you go to university?

641
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.460
Do you have a girlfriend?

642
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.460
You little...

643
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.468
I don't take questions unrelated to training.

644
00:45:24.469 --> 00:45:25.509
Do you hear me?

645
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.718
He has a girlfriend.

646
00:45:27.719 --> 00:45:29.259
No, he doesn't.

647
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.309
- Hey.
- What?

648
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.769
If we all go home...

649
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.779
and the war ends, what will you do? Will you go back to school?

650
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.949
I said I won't take questions unrelated to training.

651
00:45:45.239 --> 00:45:46.869
It's related.

652
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.578
We have to know more about you...

653
00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:53.460
for the platoon members to be more efficient.

654
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.039
Change the subject.

655
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.879
- Fine.
- Come on.

656
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.049
- Tell us.
- Please tell us.

657
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:08.089
Tell us.

658
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.010
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

659
00:46:10.219 --> 00:46:14.059
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

660
00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:17.348
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

661
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:19.439
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

662
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.150
- Tell us.
- Stop it.

663
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:29.449
Listen.

664
00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:37.670
I'm part of the ROTC, so I joined after graduating from university.

665
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:40.670
I have a year left to serve,

666
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.420
but I haven't decided whether I'll leave...

667
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.590
or extend my term. That's it.

668
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.638
Extend? Why would you do any more of this?

669
00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:53.009
I know, isn't it tiring?

670
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.019
- Better to go out into the world.
- You're right.

671
00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:59.730
Being out in the world is tough too.

672
00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:02.940
I'm still young and don't know much,

673
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.110
but it's a war out there too.

674
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.489
You could say getting into universities is a local war,

675
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.369
and being out in the world is a world war.

676
00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:14.239
This is the happiest you'll be.

677
00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.010
I have a question.

678
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.969
When will this war end?

679
00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.059
Will...

680
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.400
we be able to go home?

681
00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:44.940
They said we can go home if we get through this operation.

682
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.400
Can we...

683
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.449
believe that?

684
00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:54.489
Don't think we don't know anything because we're kids.

685
00:47:56.909 --> 00:47:58.328
Tell us the truth.

686
00:47:58.329 --> 00:48:00.670
What if we get stabbed in the back after trusting it?

687
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.179
I don't know when the war will end.

688
00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:21.019
But just remember this.

689
00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:26.610
Survive to the end.

690
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.199
I can't end the war for you,

691
00:48:32.449 --> 00:48:36.989
but I will help you fight to the end...

692
00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:41.409
without anyone getting hurt.

693
00:48:44.539 --> 00:48:46.039
I can promise you that.

694
00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:05.110
Let's go.

695
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.489
Squad One, marksman Cho Jang Soo.

696
00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:15.570
Assistant marksman Kook Young Soo.

697
00:49:16.239 --> 00:49:18.619
Squad Two, marksman Kim Yu Jung.

698
00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.619
Assistant marksman Wang Tae Man.

699
00:49:21.449 --> 00:49:22.460
Me?

700
00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:24.419
No.

701
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.039
Search team, Cho Young Sin, Kwon Il Ha.

702
00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.340
Sniper Lee Na Ra, spotter Do Soo Chul.

703
00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:37.218
When we arrive at our destination,

704
00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:38.889
the raiding party will put the guard up.

705
00:49:39.139 --> 00:49:40.598
The two people in the search party...

706
00:49:40.599 --> 00:49:42.268
will take the lead and request troops.

707
00:49:42.269 --> 00:49:43.349
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

708
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.449
This is a sphere detector.

709
00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:56.658
- A sphere detector.
- What is that?

710
00:49:56.659 --> 00:49:57.949
Does it detect spheres?

711
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.738
He just said it's a sphere detector.

712
00:50:00.739 --> 00:50:02.368
Why do you think it's called that?

713
00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:03.710
Is it a prototype?

714
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.210
What is that?

715
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:07.669
Something that hasn't been fully developed yet.

716
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.499
You're right. It isn't perfect yet.

717
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.340
So don't rely on it too much.

718
00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:14.760
What's its radius?

719
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.050
It's 1km in open areas.

720
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.928
In the city of villages,

721
00:50:18.929 --> 00:50:21.469
it'll only be 500 to 700m.

722
00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:22.639
So,

723
00:50:24.429 --> 00:50:25.598
always be alert.

724
00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:26.599
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

725
00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:28.099
That's it.

726
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.440
Let's go. Come here.

727
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.448
- Look at that.
- It's amazing.

728
00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:37.820
- Turn it on.
- Turn it on.

729
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.788
The people high up aren't just sitting back and watching.

730
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:47.868
You're right. Why didn't they give this to us earlier?

731
00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:49.210
Look at that.

732
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960
What's this?

733
00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.380
Why isn't it detecting anything?

734
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:55.760
Seriously?

735
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.260
- Since there is no sphere.
- Since there is no sphere.

736
00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:05.178
- That idiot.
- Seriously.

737
00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:06.268
Three minutes until we leave.

738
00:51:06.269 --> 00:51:09.558
Divide into your squads and get in the vehicles.

739
00:51:09.559 --> 00:51:11.018
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:51:11.019 --> 00:51:13.440
- Duk Joong.
- What is it?

741
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.820
Hurry up.

742
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.690
Darn it.

743
00:52:01.949 --> 00:52:02.989
Lieutenant.

744
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.539
We'll need equipment to move this.

745
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:13.579
Let's search the area first.

746
00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.769
Walk in a straight line.

747
00:52:31.389 --> 00:52:32.940
How does this work?

748
00:52:33.769 --> 00:52:35.110
I can tell you're a nerd.

749
00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.480
We just marvel at how cool it is,

750
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:40.110
but don't care about how it works.

751
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.820
I'm not a nerd. It's my family's genes.

752
00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:47.239
They're good genes.

753
00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:52.420
- Bam.
- What?

754
00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:54.879
- Stop it.
- Cut it out.

755
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.038
Go ahead.

756
00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.380
You go ahead.

757
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.839
Do you have the safety on?

758
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.840
What?

759
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.510
Yes, I do.

760
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.849
Don't shoot me in the back.

761
00:53:11.019 --> 00:53:13.440
You just have to turn this a little.

762
00:53:22.489 --> 00:53:23.489
I'm scared.

763
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.030
I am too.

764
00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:29.738
No Ae, keep up with us.

765
00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:30.750
Okay.

766
00:53:31.199 --> 00:53:32.869
- Yu Jung.
- Yes?

767
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:34.500
Why do you keep checking behind you?

768
00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:36.630
We have to watch our backs.

769
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.340
Just walk backward.

770
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.510
Is that better?

771
00:53:52.269 --> 00:53:53.639
- Help.
- I got you.

772
00:53:55.269 --> 00:53:56.349
Are you okay?

773
00:53:56.769 --> 00:53:57.769
Yes.

774
00:53:58.769 --> 00:53:59.769
I'm fine.

775
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.480
Thank you.

776
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.860
I didn't think you'd really walk backward.

777
00:54:06.739 --> 00:54:08.489
You're clumsier than I thought.

778
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.210
I feel queasy.

779
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.090
What is going on?

780
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.300
Let's see.

781
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:28.509
I know women.

782
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:31.349
You have it all wrong, Young Soo.

783
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:32.929
Then what should I do?

784
00:54:34.019 --> 00:54:36.349
Do better.

785
00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:38.400
Be manly and cool.

786
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:44.360
Be careful, Na Ra.

787
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:45.570
Okay.

788
00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:50.159
Be careful, Ha Na.

789
00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:52.239
Get out of my way.

790
00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:54.500
She wants me to get out of her way.

791
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:05.670
Are you anxious?

792
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920
About what?

793
00:55:07.469 --> 00:55:08.719
Those two.

794
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.639
It's like a melodrama.

795
00:55:14.179 --> 00:55:18.809
And this man that watches from afar.

796
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480
Hey.

797
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.610
Let's go quietly.

798
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.239
I have enough on my mind.

799
00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:32.988
Doesn't this feel like an operation?

800
00:55:32.989 --> 00:55:35.829
We are on an operation.

801
00:55:36.039 --> 00:55:37.079
Focus.

802
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.250
Whatever.

803
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.880
Quiet.

804
00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:47.880
Show yourselves, spheres.

805
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.340
Come on.

806
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.929
Cut it out.

807
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:53.638
Wait, over there.

808
00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:54.760
You scared me.

809
00:55:56.849 --> 00:55:57.889
- Look.
- Unbelievable.

810
00:55:58.429 --> 00:55:59.480
Awesome.

811
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.690
Isn't it working?

812
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.940
Hee Rak.

813
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:05.730
What is it?

814
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.820
It's nothing, sir.

815
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.360
Lieutenant.

816
00:56:16.409 --> 00:56:17.449
What is it?

817
00:56:18.449 --> 00:56:19.658
Look what I got.

818
00:56:19.659 --> 00:56:21.500
- Unbelievable.
- Give me some.

819
00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:23.169
- Ouch.
- I want a sip.

820
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.749
I'm going to save it, so get away from me.

821
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:28.379
- Don't be cheap. Share with us.
- Don't be cheap. Share with us.

822
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.259
You shouldn't shake cola, right?

823
00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.259
But I can since this is mine.

824
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.929
- Why you...
- Why you...

825
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.849
I love this.

826
00:56:37.639 --> 00:56:40.349
- Forget it.
- Forget it.

827
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:46.820
Lieutenant.

828
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.820
Il Ha.

829
00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:00.329
What's its location?

830
00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:06.500
It's 300m to the southwest.

831
00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:15.029
That hurts.

832
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.369
Why did you come this way?

833
00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:47.809
What was that?

834
00:59:20.929 --> 00:59:22.050
Lieutenant.

835
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.348
Lieutenant.

836
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:25.388
- Get ready to fire.
- Lieutenant.

837
00:59:25.389 --> 00:59:27.138
- Are they coming?
- Over there.

838
00:59:27.139 --> 00:59:28.979
- They're coming.
- What should we do?

839
00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.480
- Shoot them.
- Hurry.

840
00:59:31.769 --> 00:59:33.479
- They're coming.
- I don't think I can.

841
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.230
Hold your fire.

842
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.029
All right.

843
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:40.530
Open fire.

844
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:52.170
To the left.

845
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.880
- On 1, 2, 3.
- On 1, 2, 3.

846
00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:57.920
- No.
- I can't.

847
01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:06.099
- Shoot.
- Got it.

848
01:00:06.889 --> 01:00:08.519
Where is it?

849
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.979
Stay in position and fire.

850
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.400
- Die.
- Die.

851
01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:20.780
I got one.

852
01:00:24.239 --> 01:00:26.078
I got another one.

853
01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:27.539
Can't you do any better?

854
01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:32.000
I'll reload and try again.

855
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.538
That's hot.

856
01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:37.960
Why would you touch the barrel, you idiot?

857
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.550
Kook Young Soo, Lee Soon Yi.

858
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.718
- Pull yourselves together.
- Okay.

859
01:00:43.719 --> 01:00:45.719
Start firing.

860
01:00:48.469 --> 01:00:50.940
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

861
01:00:53.059 --> 01:00:54.440
Place it on your soldier.

862
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.940
I have horrible aim.

863
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.109
No. Tae Man!

864
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.779
Help me.

865
01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.409
Hurry.

866
01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:06.328
I can't get any of them.

867
01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.238
- Jang Soo.
- Yes?

868
01:01:08.239 --> 01:01:09.829
Help us, Jang Soo.

869
01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:11.960
Maintain your positions.

870
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:16.089
- Where did it go?
- Where are they?

871
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.210
Over there.

872
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.880
Darn it.

873
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.669
I'm out of ammo.

874
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:24.340
Hand me some now.

875
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:28.260
- What are you waiting for?
- Are you serious?

876
01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:35.809
What?

877
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400
What is it?

878
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.820
Why aren't they coming out?

879
01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:46.869
I don't know.

880
01:01:48.409 --> 01:01:49.489
Cover me.

881
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.659
I don't see them.

882
01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:56.079
What's going on?

883
01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.710
Are they going after something?

884
01:02:05.969 --> 01:02:07.599
I think they're hiding.

885
01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:13.559
- Where are you going?
- We have to find and kill them.

886
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:17.190
You can't do it alone.

887
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:18.809
- Let go of me.
- What's this?

888
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.939
It's still here.

889
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.940
What?

890
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.069
Where is it?

891
01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:27.239
Behind you!

892
01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:29.449
It's coming.

893
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.670
- Where did it come from?
- Where did it come from?

894
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.380
- Get it.
- Kill it.

895
01:02:53.559 --> 01:02:54.559
Are you okay?

896
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.448
What are you doing?

897
01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.280
Take your positions and search your surroundings.

898
01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.829
- Back to your positions.
- Yes, sir.

899
01:03:11.909 --> 01:03:13.039
Yes, sir.

900
01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:16.159
Young Sin.

901
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:20.880
Cho Young Sin!

902
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.460
Locate the sphere.

903
01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:30.760
Darn it.

904
01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.849
What should we do now?

905
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.849
We'll find every one of them...

906
01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:39.599
and eliminate them all.

907
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.190
Yes, sir.

908
01:03:51.489 --> 01:03:54.119
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

909
01:03:55.619 --> 01:03:56.789
Ladies first.

910
01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:58.329
You go first.

911
01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:13.510
Hey, that way.

912
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.969
Wait. Darn it.

913
01:04:37.199 --> 01:04:38.409
Darn it.

914
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960
No.

915
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.090
What happened?

916
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.509
We got one.

917
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.010
We just lost one.

918
01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.349
Seriously?

919
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.150
Up there.

920
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.119
That scared me.

921
01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.289
Na Ra.

922
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.170
Let's go.

923
01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.760
Come on.

924
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.840
I shouldn't have saved him.

925
01:06:03.039 --> 01:06:04.039
No.

926
01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:24.099
Darn it.

927
01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:27.558
Go to the left.

928
01:06:27.559 --> 01:06:28.650
Come with me, Chi Yeol.

929
01:06:37.949 --> 01:06:39.119
I don't believe it.

930
01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:42.198
Na Ra.

931
01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.119
Stop whining.

932
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.079
Stop with the whining.

933
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.510
Hey.

934
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:58.009
It's too dark. Maybe we shouldn't go in.

935
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:00.799
One was detected.

936
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.929
We have to get it.

937
01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:04.269
Take your lantern out.

938
01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:05.769
Okay.

939
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:15.280
Why am I in the lead?

940
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.109
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.

941
01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:20.779
- Seriously.
- I'm sorry.

942
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.909
Get it out of my face.

943
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:30.710
I don't think it's in here.

944
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.500
Careful.

945
01:07:41.679 --> 01:07:42.679
Okay.

946
01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.909
- There it is.
- Get it.

947
01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:04.989
I can't see it.

948
01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.390
It's getting away.

949
01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.109
Hey.

950
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.779
Duk Joong.

951
01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:21.279
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

952
01:09:23.909 --> 01:09:26.118
- I'm alive.
- Yes.

953
01:09:26.119 --> 01:09:27.119
You're okay.

954
01:09:27.869 --> 01:09:29.749
- You scared me.
- Are you okay?

955
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.289
I think he's okay.

956
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.130
- That scared me.
- I know.

957
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:38.750
Quiet.

958
01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:54.462
