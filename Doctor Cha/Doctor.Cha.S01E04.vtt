00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.918
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.510
Dr. Cha, were you a housewife
while you weren't working?

4
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.512
Yes.

5
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.014
Your family must be well-off.

6
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.641
What does your husband do?

7
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.852
My husband?

8
00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.479
Your husband.

9
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.242
He's dead.

10
00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.798
-Ow!
-Jung-min!

11
00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.760
-It's just alcohol. It's fine.
-I'm okay.

12
00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.516
It's okay.

13
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.476
Sorry.

14
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.769
Stop it.

15
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.104
-You're unbelievable.
-Give me some tissues.

16
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.232
Dr. Cha.

17
00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.234
I sincerely apologize.

18
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:50.819
For what?

19
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.446
I shouldn't have asked you that.

20
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.198
It's okay.

21
00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.535
But if I may,
may I ask you another rude question?

22
00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.703
When did he pass away?

23
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.666
Well…

24
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.753
He's been dead for a long time.

25
00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.258
Then may I ask you my final rude question?

26
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.802
Do you miss him from time to time?

27
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.851
I can't remember.

28
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:27.063
I can't even remember
if I ever got married at all.

29
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.365
Let's wrap it up here.

30
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.538
Drink up your beers!

31
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:47.500
About things that will never come back

32
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.503
Next up is the new doctor
Hollywood actors would be jealous of.

33
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.046
Let's invite Professor Roy to the stage.

34
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.214
Come on out!

35
00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.136
I will kiss your eyes

36
00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.765
As thoughts race through your mind

37
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.856
Let's walk together

38
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.776
After I met you

39
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.366
You can pick who'll go next.

40
00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.660
Then I'll pick…

41
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.079
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

42
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.833
Me? No.

43
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.168
No. Come on.

44
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.419
I can't sing.

45
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.921
-Cha Jeong-suk!
-Cha Jeong-suk!

46
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.964
-It's okay.
-Cha Jeong-suk!

47
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.674
-Cha Jeong-suk!
-Cha Jeong-suk!

48
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.980
You only live once so make no regrets

49
00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.943
Chase after what you truly want

50
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:58.321
Let's ride a flying magic carpet

51
00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:02.325
Over the magnificent blue sky

52
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.703
Let's ride a red car

53
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:09.749
Across the magnificent emerald ocean

54
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.253

58
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.019
Goodbye, everyone.

59
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.980
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

60
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.940
Let me say one thing.

61
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.317
Today's group dinner is truly over.

62
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.404
FEEL KARAOKE

63
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.738
Goodbye.

64
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:41.948
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

65
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.199
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

66
00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:44.867
Professor.

67
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.328
-The designated driver will be here soon.
-Okay.

68
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.413
Excuse me.

69
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.250
How are you all going home?

70
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.340
I'm planning to stay
at the resident dorms.

71
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.217
What about you?

72
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.011
I'm…

73
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.518
going to take a taxi.

74
00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:31.414
Then I'll get going first.

75
00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.419
Professor!

76
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.797
Which way are you going?

77
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.674
Could you give me a ride?

78
00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.345
Would you like that?

79
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.182
-Hop on.
-Really?

80
00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.687
Thank you.

81
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.320
-I didn't drink, so no worries.
-Okay.

82
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.828
-I'll go now. Hang tight.
-Okay.

83
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.582
How is it?

84
00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.838
I love it.

85
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.259
But I don't like your choice of music.

86
00:07:59.061 --> 00:07:59.896
Dr. Kim.

87
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.690
I feel nauseous.

88
00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.174
How dare you?

89
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:29.217
How dare I?

90
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.843
You may be my senior
at the hospital but not here.

91
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.973
Stay right there.

92
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.900
Dr. Cha, do you feel better?

93
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.069
-Yes.
-Have some water.

94
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.362
Thank you.

95
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.166
I can't believe I'm here

96
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.378
at this hour.

97
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.089
This isn't some place abroad.

98
00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.299
Why couldn't you?

99
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.509
Exactly.

100
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.972
It wasn't as if I didn't
have the money or the time.

101
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.558
So I wonder why.

102
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.227
At least you're here now.

103
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.021
How was the bike ride?

104
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.610
It was the first time
riding one in my life.

105
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.280
It was…

106
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.740
truly amazing.

107
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.243
It's hard to explain.

108
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.453
But it was incredible.

109
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.163
You don't need to explain.

110
00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.125
It feels great…

111
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.752
to be alive.

112
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.547
It feels great that I can feel

113
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.799
freedom,

114
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.010
hunger,

115
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.304
and exhaustion.

116
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:58.556
I love it all.

117
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:01.350
So why does it feel like…

118
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.564
a burning rock is
weighing down on my chest?

119
00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:11.527
Dr. Kim.

120
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.737
Yes?

121
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.406
Thank you for bearing with me

122
00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:17.617
today.

123
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.000
You don't need to thank me.

124
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.878
Let's say I was building rapport.

125
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.088
A bond between a doctor

126
00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:32.923
and his patient.

127
00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.051
"Building rapport"?

128
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.013
I like that.

129
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.851
But you know one too many
humiliating things about me

130
00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:45.436
for us to have rapport.

131
00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.273
You must think I'm frustrating, right?

132
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.525
I can't deny that.

133
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.862
Why do you continue to live with him?

134
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.864
From what I see,

135
00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.450
you seem like a great person to be around.

136
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.870
Is that so?

137
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.415
But you know what?

138
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.335
There are worse husbands than mine.

139
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.672
He wasn't always that cold.

140
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.882
It's just that…

141
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:18.386
we've been living together
for a while now.

142
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.597
His love for me became weaker,

143
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.850
and he's become less grateful now.

144
00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:27.561
It's just like that.

145
00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.605
That's just how life is.

146
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.568
A married couple can't
love each other passionately forever.

147
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:37.279
Even if that's the case,

148
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.991
he should at least respect you.

149
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.624
I was out of line.

150
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.711
Should we go?

151
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.047
We have work tomorrow.

152
00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.228
What does your husband do?

153
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.814
My husband? He's dead.

154
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.190
He's dead.

155
00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.316
Professor!

156
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.651
Which way are you going?

157
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.194
Could you give me a ride?

158
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.408
She must be out of her mind.

159
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.368
She must be.

160
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.194
TO MY DAUGHTER

161
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.452
I-rang.

162
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.205
You must be surprised to find this letter.

163
00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.336
I'm sure you're having a tough time

164
00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:00.965
because I'm so busy nowadays.

165
00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:04.218
But if you think about it,

166
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.514
you'll have to experience this eventually

167
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.977
<c.bg_transparent><i>since there will come a day
when I won't be around anymore.</i></c.bg_transparent>

168
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.854
That is exactly why

169
00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:20.568
I'd like to live for myself just once.

170
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:26.282
<c.bg_transparent><i>But that won't change the fact
that I'll always be your mom.</i></c.bg_transparent>

171
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.161
<c.bg_transparent><i>Just like how
I always root for you and your dreams,</i></c.bg_transparent>

172
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.622
just this once,

173
00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.208
I hope you can do the same for me too.

174
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.545
What I need the most right now

175
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:42.339
is your encouragement and support.

176
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.634
I love you, my daughter.

177
00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.887
From Mom.

178
00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.654
-Jung-min.
-Good morning.

179
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.449
Eat this before the others come.

180
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.826
-What is it?
-Here.

181
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.078
It's 

182
00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:16.206
It looks good. What about you?

183
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.583
I'm okay.

184
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:18.876
Thanks, Mom.

185
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.795
It's so good.

186
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:24.882
Hello.

187
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.010
You're having 

188
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.887
Carbs are the best hangover food.

189
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.139
Where did you get it?

190
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.602
I bought it.

191
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:37.811
Really?

192
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.064
I can have some, right? Thanks.

193
00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.861
This is really good.

194
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:49.239
Would you like some too?

195
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.034
Did you already eat?

196
00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:56.038
That's Dr. Seo's.

197
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.585
What do you mean?
We share everything here.

198
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.879
-Right?
-Sorry? Yes.

199
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:06.799
Dr. Seo.

200
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:08.092
You should eat.

201
00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:10.094
Or she'll eat it all.

202
00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:12.012
This is good.

203
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.973
Where did you buy this?

204
00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:16.934
-Stop it.
-You know what?

205
00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:19.395
It's good, but the rice is too mushy.

206
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.105
-It's too mushy?
-Yes.

207
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.941
<c.bg_transparent><i>-Ma'am.
-Yes?</i></c.bg_transparent>

208
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:24.984
Look.

209
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.406
-It's about how you clean the bathroom.
-Okay.

210
00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:33.367
I know it's more convenient
to use a lot of products,

211
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.952
but that leaves behind a strong smell.

212
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:36.745
Then what should I use instead?

213
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.581
My daughter-in-law used stale cola

214
00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.875
or old shampoo.

215
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.544
-Okay.
-One more thing.

216
00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:47.131
The ratio of the ingredients
for the detox juice is important.

217
00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.716
You added too little fruit

218
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.884
and it tastes too tart.

219
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.845
I made it exactly as you told me to.

220
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.807
Then I guess
you're just not good at making food.

221
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.646
How did you make the juice before?

222
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.108
My daughter-in-law made them taste great
even with the same recipe.

223
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:09.486
She must've slaved away.

224
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.696
Look.

225
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:13.824
I can't do this anymore.

226
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:16.160
Just ask your daughter-in-law
to do it for you.

227
00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.328
You'll never find a helper

228
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.205
who'll suit your taste.

229
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.457
Goodness.

230
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.375
Jeez.

231
00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.753
Wait.

232
00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:27.713
Ma'am.

233
00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:30.299
We have the prescription ready
for Ms. Jung Seong-a in Room 810

234
00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:31.759
and I've checked the results.

235
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.386
Okay.

236
00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:38.432
Hello, ma'am.

237
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:41.310
I can't work for your family anymore.

238
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.479
She nitpicks every single thing,

239
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.397
and it stresses me out so much.

240
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.523
I'm quitting today,

241
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.025
-so that's that.
-Ma'am, but--

242
00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:04.666
What on earth--

243
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:09.880
How could you prescribe
eight ampoules of digoxin?

244
00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:11.632
Did you want the patient to die?

245
00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:14.885
I understand maybe
you were too ignorant to notice,

246
00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:17.638
but didn't it seem weird
to prescribe eight ampoules?

247
00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.683
The Cardiology Department
said to prescribe 2mg of digoxin so…

248
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.894
They told you to give 2mg in an IV drip?

249
00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:26.188
Don't you mean "two ampoules"?

250
00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.610
Are you so clueless you can't tell
what's fine and what isn't?

251
00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:33.612
-Thankfully, I spotted it beforehand.
-I got a call.

252
00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.491
Do you know what would've happened
if you administered that much?

253
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.579
You're forbidden from prescribing
on your own without asking someone first.

254
00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.540
Make sure to ask
before making proper prescriptions.

255
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.125
Understood?

256
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:47.584
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:50.337
I'll ask before I make a prescription.

258
00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.816
Don't be so harsh
on a first-year resident.

259
00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:12.484
She's still recovering.
Don't you feel bad?

260
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.653
Then she shouldn't have come here.

261
00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:17.489
It's better for her to quit
than to inconvenience others.

262
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:18.991
Hold on.

263
00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:20.701
She patted your bottom last time, right?

264
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.786
Isn't that sexual harassment?

265
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.455
I should report her
to the disciplinary committee.

266
00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.208
She just did that
because I was like a son to her.

267
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.960
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.503
Hey.

269
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.547
That's one of the excuses

270
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.300
old men use
after sexually harassing young girls.

271
00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:38.135
Don't be ludicrous.

272
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:39.845
I get it.

273
00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:41.471
At least talk nicely.

274
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.473
Imagine what she'll think of you.

275
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:44.600
Who cares--

276
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:46.768
Look at you.

277
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.438
You never talked back to me.

278
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.316
I mean, it'll taint
our department's reputation.

279
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:53.650
And I don't like seeing you

280
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.196
acting so cold toward someone
who's old enough to be your mother.

281
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.530
Then she should do better.

282
00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:00.616
Then I'll be nice.

283
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:01.658
And if she doesn't?

284
00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:02.743
Then I'll be ruthless.

285
00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.454
No one is good from the start.

286
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.538
I was.

287
00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.101
Mom.

288
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.239
Don't be too upset.

289
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.909
She never shows mercy to anyone.

290
00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:48.413
I get it.

291
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:52.960
I deserved to be scolded for my mistake.

292
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.712
I understand why she was mad.

293
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:59.132
I get that she's merciless, but still.

294
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:02.052
How could she be so harsh to someone
who's old enough to be her mother?

295
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.597
She called me ignorant. My goodness.

296
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.267
Jeez.

297
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.728
With that personality of hers,
she'll never become a great doctor.

298
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:13.981
Don't get too close to her.

299
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.984
Even though I'm sure you won't.

300
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.068
Right.

301
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.530
How dare she eat all your 

302
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.078
Jung-min, my neck is killing me.

303
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.706
Can you massage it?

304
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.791
Where?

305
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.461
-Where?
-Your grandmother is just…

306
00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.922
It hurts. Here.

307
00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.717
-Here?
-Yes.

308
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:44.219
Don't feel too hurt.

309
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:48.640
Will this raise
the area around my eyes too much?

310
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.767
I'm skilled at what I do, ma'am.

311
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.021
I'll only add a bit, so it'll be fine.

312
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.481
I'll put some between your eyebrows too.

313
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.649
Okay.

314
00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:08.118
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

315
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.246
Hello, Ms. Oh.

316
00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.790
Goodness, hello.

317
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.167
What brings you here?

318
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.918
Hello, ma'am.

319
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.503
Hey, it's been a while.

320
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.131
I'm a regular here.

321
00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:22.174
I see.

322
00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.801
I guess you're here for some botox.

323
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.055
I thought you preferred
maintaining your natural beauty.

324
00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:30.682
I guess you had a change of heart.

325
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.560
Goodness.

326
00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:35.645
I guess you didn't hear.

327
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.148
Jung-min, my eldest grandson,

328
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:41.902
said he'd pay for botox shots
as my birthday gift.

329
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.154
I refused out of embarrassment,

330
00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:47.908
but I had no choice
because he had already made a reservation.

331
00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:48.950
Right.

332
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:52.662
Jung-min is quite considerate.

333
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.290
I'll leave you to it then.

334
00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:56.374
Okay.

335
00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:58.210
-See you later, ma'am.
- Okay.

336
00:23:01.838 --> 00:23:03.131
Hey.

337
00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.842
How could you book me
around the same time as her?

338
00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:09.012
The nurses don't know that you're in-laws.

339
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.556
This is unbelievable.

340
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.726
Ms. Oh, that was some quick thinking.

341
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.396
How did you instantly
come up with such a lie?

342
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.941
Jeong-suk is smart all thanks to me.

343
00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:23.944
By the way,

344
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.612
Mi-hee.

345
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.824
I want to ask you something.

346
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.538
Jung-min, that brat.

347
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:39.584
All he did on my birthday was pass me
the money Jeong-suk had given him.

348
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:41.837
It's true they're never grateful
for your babysitting.

349
00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:43.380
Hello.

350
00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:46.508
-Hello.
-I'll be treating you today.

351
00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.592
Okay.

352
00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.935
It does look suspicious.

353
00:23:57.018 --> 00:24:00.438
I only knew about it after someone
at the bathhouse pointed it out.

354
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:03.733
It neither looked like
an age spot nor a mole.

355
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:06.611
I was worried, so I came here.

356
00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:08.280
Ms. Oh.

357
00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:11.241
I'll write you a referral

358
00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:14.744
so you should go
and get a biopsy done at a hospital.

359
00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:16.663
What's wrong?

360
00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:19.291
Do you think it's skin cancer?

361
00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:20.333
Of course not.

362
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.336
That's very unlikely.

363
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.464
But it's always better to be sure
and check just in case.

364
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:29.217
Right.

365
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.261
Keep this a secret from Jeong-suk.

366
00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:33.805
She already has a lot on her plate.

367
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:35.390
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:38.727
But promise me
you'll get that checked out.

369
00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.188
Jeez.

370
00:24:52.532 --> 00:24:55.076
Why is she saying
I should go to a hospital?

371
00:24:56.953 --> 00:24:58.413
-You're a bit late.
-Yes, I am.

372
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.165
Please get in.

373
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:07.339
What's going on between those two?

374
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.263
Are they dating?

375
00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:20.977
What's all this?

376
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:24.022
It's a small token of my gratitude
for the amazing ride last night.

377
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.109
It's nothing. I was just going
to put it here and leave.

378
00:25:30.237 --> 00:25:31.947
We should share this.

379
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.531
How about we go
and eat this at the cafeteria?

380
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:37.285
I could eat right now.

381
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.413
I just need to remove the catheter
from one of the patients.

382
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:42.040
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

383
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:05.855
Your food is safe.

384
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:07.691
Thank you.

385
00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:19.995
He's the new chief of the Hepatobiliary
and Pancreas Department.

386
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:21.663
-Is that so?
-Yes.

387
00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:24.249
I thought he was a celebrity at first.

388
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:25.834
He's from the US.

389
00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.585
I heard he's single.

390
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:30.797
He may be single,
but I bet he's doing plenty of mingling.

391
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:32.549
Exactly.

392
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:39.097
-I'm sorry for being late.
-That's okay.

393
00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:42.642
It looks delicious.

394
00:26:43.226 --> 00:26:44.602
I can't guarantee the taste.

395
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:46.187
I'm sure it'll be good.

396
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.023
Let me open that for you.

397
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.489
-I added vegetables so it'll be healthier.
-Is that so?

398
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:57.699
Please enjoy your food.

399
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.119
Professor?

400
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:05.874
I've been feeling unwell today.

401
00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.000
You can eat without me.

402
00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:19.596
What the heck am I doing right now?

403
00:27:20.722 --> 00:27:22.015
It'll be quick.

404
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:27.187
Gosh.

405
00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:28.855
One minute.

406
00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:32.817
You can wrap it up from here.

407
00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:34.694
-Hello?
-Hey, Jung-min.

408
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:36.446
Can you help me remove the PCD?

409
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:38.114
Can I just take it out?

410
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.788
-Good work.
-Thank you.

411
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.582
-Hey, Mom.
-Jung-min.

412
00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.084
Can you help me insert the central line?

413
00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.543
I've never done it before.

414
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:52.587
Hello?

415
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.214
How do I explain the surgery?

416
00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:56.674
It's a LAR. What was it again?

417
00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:58.843
Hello?

418
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:02.097
The doctor told me to insert
a silastic drain into the wound.

419
00:28:04.265 --> 00:28:06.309
How do I do it?

420
00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.770
Hello?

421
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:11.439
-Hello?
-Jung-min.

422
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.857
Jung-min. I can't remember.

423
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.150
Tell me. Come here quickly.

424
00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.652
-Hello?
-Gosh.

425
00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.153
And you call yourself a doctor?

426
00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:19.322
Why aren't you sending her
to the operating room?

427
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.658
-Sir.
-The patient needs surgery now!

428
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:22.826
-Look--
-When are you going to operate?

429
00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:27.872
Gosh, my neck.

430
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:32.710
Hi, Jung-min.

431
00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:36.548
Enough is enough.
You've really crossed the line.

432
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:38.717
What?

433
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.927
I thought you were smart
back in med school.

434
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.762
You scored 49 points
on the resident exams.

435
00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.223
So how do you not know anything?

436
00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:48.935
Come on. I had a long break in between.

437
00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:50.562
If you had a long break,

438
00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:53.148
you should've studied
by watching online videos in the meantime.

439
00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:56.317
I'm always scolded
for not knowing any better.

440
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.403
I don't need you bothering me too.

441
00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:02.240
Why did you have
to come to our department?

442
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.034
Hey!

443
00:29:05.785 --> 00:29:06.870
I can't believe you.

444
00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:10.373
I carried you in my womb for ten months

445
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:11.958
and put my life on the line
to give birth to you.

446
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:13.334
I cleaned after you.

447
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:17.630
I taught you how to talk and count,
and raised you until now.

448
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:19.674
So how dare you complain
and look down on me

449
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.718
just because I asked you for some help?

450
00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:22.886
How could you?

451
00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.597
Look, Mom.

452
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.056
That's not what I meant. I was--

453
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.600
"Mom"?

454
00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:29.642
"Mom"?

455
00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:31.978
I thought you wanted
to keep that a secret?

456
00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:35.774
You can take
my night duty tonight, you jerk.

457
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.318
I'm already on night duty tonight.

458
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:39.736
I don't want to hear it!

459
00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:41.362
Darn it.

460
00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.198
Mom.

461
00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:50.705
That wasn't what I meant.

462
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:03.092
MY SON

463
00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:09.265
MOM, CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO

464
00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.812
TIP 2. POSITIVE PRESSURE
I WILL DEMONSTRATE WITH A DISTAL LUMEN

465
00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.188
My gosh.

466
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.650
TO SHOW YOU HOW
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WORKS

467
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:21.778
This is a whole new world.

468
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.740
He should've sent this to me sooner.

469
00:30:37.877 --> 00:30:39.838
A 68-year-old female patient.

470
00:30:40.713 --> 00:30:42.757
<c.bg_transparent><i>The primary cancer
is in her ascending colon,</i></c.bg_transparent>

471
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.092
and it's quite large.

472
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:48.555
The cancer cells have metastasized
to her liver as well.

473
00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:51.099
The lung CT scan shows that
they've metastasized

474
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.351
to two areas on the right lung
and one area on the left lung.

475
00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:57.814
They've also metastasized to her spine,
so surgery won't be an option.

476
00:30:57.897 --> 00:31:01.818
She should receive chemotherapy
as soon as possible.

477
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.986
-Chief Resident Hwang.
-Yes, sir.

478
00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:05.363
Contact the Oncology Department
for a consultation.

479
00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:06.531
Yes, sir.

480
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:12.245
-But what crime did she commit?
-Murder, sir.

481
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:15.915
She received a life sentence
for poisoning her husband.

482
00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:19.502
Who's in charge of her?

483
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.714
It's me, sir.

484
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.305
I heard she's refusing treatment.
Can you persuade her?

485
00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.598
I'll do my best.

486
00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:34.434
That's a given.

487
00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.477
What's important is the result.

488
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:44.527
Ma'am.

489
00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:49.032
Your will to live matters the most
when it comes to receiving treatment.

490
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:52.160
If you continue to refuse treatment,

491
00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:55.580
the pain will gradually worsen.

492
00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.751
And you won't be able to live as long.

493
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.671
I understand that you feel hopeless.

494
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:08.635
But there have been patients
who survived even worse conditions

495
00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:11.638
and lived for years.

496
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:22.148
This is the VIP ward.
The patient is very agitated.

497
00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:23.650
-Call the director!
-Please hurry.

498
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:26.027
What is this?

499
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.404
-Jeez!
-It's a complete mess here.

500
00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:29.614
Can you still not reach them?

501
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:30.949
-No, I can't.
-Darn it!

502
00:32:33.242 --> 00:32:34.410
Darn it!

503
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.790
Yes, I'm glad you're here.

504
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:41.918
I should've known
how lousy this hospital was

505
00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:44.379
the moment they sent
this rookie resident over.

506
00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:49.384
One of your professors
told me something ludicrous today.

507
00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.843
A colostomy?

508
00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:53.596
I was told I'll have to live
with a bag attached to me from now on.

509
00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:57.058
That's correct.
We'll have to do the surgery to be sure,

510
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.352
-but it's highly likely that--
-Darn it!

511
00:33:01.688 --> 00:33:05.191
Are you telling me
to carry around a poop bag?

512
00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:07.318
Do you have any idea how much money
I've spent on this hospital?

513
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:09.112
How dare you say that?

514
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:10.488
Get out!

515
00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:12.824
Bring me the director of this hospital
this instant!

516
00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:15.201
Please calm down--

517
00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:19.122
Shut up! How dare you order me around?

518
00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:22.250
Bring me the director this instant!

519
00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.668
Sir.

520
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:26.004
This isn't an issue you can solve
by calling the director over.

521
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:27.547
You can't--

522
00:33:41.477 --> 00:33:42.562
Darn it.

523
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:57.493
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.674
PATIENT: OH CHANG-GYU

525
00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.223
This is Cha Jeong-suk.

526
00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:22.143
Me?

527
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.980
I've never done it before, but…

528
00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:31.486
Okay. I'll do it.

529
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.346
Please bring me the portable X-ray.

530
00:34:58.429 --> 00:34:59.347
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.312
Hello, Doctor.

532
00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:08.856
I'm Dr. Cha Jeong-suk who's on night duty.

533
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.443
I inserted a C-line,

534
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:15.238
and the X-ray shows a pneumothorax.

535
00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:17.281
I think we need to insert a chest tube,

536
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.450
but I have no experience with it yet.

537
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:20.660
DOCTOR IM SEON-U

538
00:35:20.743 --> 00:35:23.287
Hello, is this Dr. Im Seon-u
of the CS Department?

539
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:25.998
I see. You're doing emergency surgery.

540
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:27.208
Darn it.

541
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.508
-Sir, are you a second-year resident?
-Yes.

542
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:38.177
I inserted a C-line and took an X-ray.

543
00:35:38.261 --> 00:35:39.846
I confirmed a pneumothorax.

544
00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:43.307
Could you insert a chest tube for me?

545
00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:46.477
I'm sorry, but I don't have
much experience with that yet.

546
00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:49.939
Why did you do it instead of asking
someone more experienced to handle it?

547
00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:52.358
All of them were busy.

548
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.569
No one from the CS Department
is available.

549
00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:55.486
What should I do?

550
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.321
I--

551
00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:12.879
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

552
00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:20.511
What is it?

553
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:23.055
I'm at the ER right now.

554
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:24.432
Can you come here?

555
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.185
What happened?

556
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:30.229
I don't know how to insert a chest tube.

557
00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:35.359
Is that why you called me?

558
00:36:35.943 --> 00:36:38.779
It's not even worth answering,
so I'm hanging up.

559
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.534
You shamelessly lied
that your husband is dead,

560
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:44.994
yet you want a favor?

561
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:47.580
You should call a more experienced
resident for something like this.

562
00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:49.790
I did, but no one--

563
00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.502
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

564
00:36:57.798 --> 00:37:00.134
RESIDENT CHA JEONG-SUK

565
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.928
Hello?

566
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:06.015
Dr. Jeon, this is Cha Jeong-suk.
I need your help with something.

567
00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:07.808
Don't you know I just clocked out?

568
00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.352
I know. I'm really sorry.

569
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:12.688
<c.bg_transparent><i>It's just that I don't know
how to insert a chest tube.</i></c.bg_transparent>

570
00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:13.689
Hold on.

571
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:15.274
I spotted a pneumothorax--

572
00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:16.984
I'll be there, so wait!

573
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.239
Thank you.

574
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:50.518
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

575
00:37:57.483 --> 00:37:58.317
What is it now?

576
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.403
Honey.

577
00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:06.909
I mean, hello?

578
00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:09.370
-Hello?
-What is it?

579
00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.542
I'm afraid you'll have to come.

580
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.544
The patient's condition is worsening.

581
00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:18.504
Are you insane?

582
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.757
What would the others think
if I showed up there

583
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:23.884
just because you called?

584
00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:33.728
Who cares about that
when the patient can't breathe?

585
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.021
If you don't come,

586
00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:39.358
I will expose our relationship
to everyone in the hospital.

587
00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:41.819
How ridiculous.

588
00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:43.779
What did you say?

589
00:38:44.947 --> 00:38:46.615
Dr. Seo, over here.

590
00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:47.908
Hurry!

591
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.411
Hurry!

592
00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:56.250
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

593
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.176
Is it not working?

594
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.138
You can't do it?

595
00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:12.016
-Why isn't it working?
-Be quiet already!

596
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.311
I don't know if it's in or not.

597
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.563
It's about 3cm in, right?

598
00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:21.275
Why are you having trouble with this?
You're a professor.

599
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.693
It's been ten years!

600
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:26.405
I'm not someone
who has time to do things like this.

601
00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:33.496
Dr. Jeon!

602
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:36.916
Professor?

603
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.377
Why are you here?

604
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:45.257
-Let me.
-No.

605
00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:47.551
I'm almost done.

606
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:51.555
All right.

607
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:54.225
Let me see how good you are.

608
00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.815
Wrap it up.

609
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.483
Yes, sir.

610
00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:19.166
Please prepare the suture.

611
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.384
-Connect the chest drainage bottle.
-Yes, ma'am.

612
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:33.431
Sir.

613
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:35.182
Can you hear me?

614
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.600
Can you try to cough?

615
00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.396
Well done.

616
00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:45.651
Now that he's okay, I should get going.

617
00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:47.611
Dress him well.

618
00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:49.405
I'll leave you to it.

619
00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:53.951
Thank you, sir.

620
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.911
My pleasure.

621
00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:00.875
-Get the dressing ready.
-Okay.

622
00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:10.509
He came here
because of that first-year resident.

623
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.011
What's gotten into him?

624
00:41:12.094 --> 00:41:15.222
When that resident was
speaking to him on the phone,

625
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.141
she said, "Honey."

626
00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:20.603
I heard them talking as I passed by,
and they were talking casually.

627
00:41:20.686 --> 00:41:22.938
But I heard she's a widow.
Is something going on between them?

628
00:42:09.818 --> 00:42:10.653
Aren't you…

629
00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:14.448
scared of me?

630
00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:22.122
I'm sure you heard
about what crime I committed.

631
00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:23.624
Yes.

632
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.584
I'm aware.

633
00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:29.755
Then you should tend
to other patients instead.

634
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:32.591
I want to stay here quietly

635
00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:34.843
and just vanish into thin air.

636
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:38.639
So use your valuable skills

637
00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:42.268
on those who deserve to live.

638
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.234
Yes. I'm sorry.

639
00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:52.736
We tried to dissuade him but…

640
00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:57.533
Okay. I'm sorry.

641
00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:14.758
Chairman Oh, I see you're having
a late-night snack.

642
00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:16.385
Isn't it obvious?

643
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.186
I guess you've made up your mind, right?

644
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.523
Then when should we schedule your surgery?

645
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:32.318
Surgery, my foot.

646
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:34.612
Are you not going to get it?

647
00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:37.906
Do you expect me to get it
after what you guys told me?

648
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.367
How dare you incompetent people
tell me what to do?

649
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.620
I'm going to rest here for a few days

650
00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:46.081
then get treated at the biggest hospital
in the US at all costs!

651
00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:51.545
Chairman Oh.

652
00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:56.133
Our hospital is among the world's best
when it comes to this department.

653
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:57.635
There's no guarantee

654
00:43:57.718 --> 00:44:01.055
that the hospitals there
will give you better treatment.

655
00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.098
I don't want to hear it, so leave.

656
00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:04.683
Raise the volume.

657
00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:05.726
Yes, sir.

658
00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:26.246
Hello, Professor.

659
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.915
-Hello.
-You're still here.

660
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.334
I'm checking on my patients.

661
00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:31.919
Aren't you off work tomorrow?

662
00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.420
-Yes.
-What do you have in mind?

663
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.089
Spending time with my family.

664
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.174
I've been neglecting them these days.

665
00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.969
What will you be up to tomorrow?

666
00:44:41.553 --> 00:44:43.889
I'm going to look for someone.

667
00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:45.474
Who?

668
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:48.185
Me.

669
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:53.899
How's work?

670
00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:59.780
Some of my patients refuse
to receive treatment.

671
00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:03.283
They all have different reasons.

672
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:06.912
Even the most competent doctors won't be
able to do anything in such a situation.

673
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:11.667
So I have absolutely no idea
how to persuade them.

674
00:45:14.503 --> 00:45:16.296
Others may not be able to do it,

675
00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.924
but maybe you can.

676
00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:22.886
Persuasion is
about striking a chord with them.

677
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.722
And I think that's your forte

678
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.600
when compared with other doctors.

679
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.771
How would you know?

680
00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:34.731
Find out for yourself

681
00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.067
by talking to them.

682
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.584
DREAM VILLAGE ANGEL HAVEN

683
00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.354
Here it is.

684
00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:20.277
CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION CARD
NAME: KIM U-HYEON

685
00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.539
SMALLER THAN OTHERS HIS AGE,
BUT NOT SHORT

686
00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.584
Was I abandoned?

687
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.420
No one knows the answer to that question.

688
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:41.048
But I hope that's not the case.

689
00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:44.426
That's why we record these

690
00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.721
as "found," not "abandoned."

691
00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.599
"Found."

692
00:46:50.682 --> 00:46:51.642
Right.

693
00:46:51.725 --> 00:46:54.394
Have you registered your DNA
at the police station?

694
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.285
Your wife must be close

695
00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:12.496
to the new chief of the Hepatobiliary
and Pancreas Department?

696
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.374
He's the doctor
who carried out her liver transplant.

697
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:17.209
I see.

698
00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:18.961
But how did you know they were close?

699
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:21.046
They were eating together
at the cafeteria.

700
00:47:21.129 --> 00:47:22.673
Everyone is talking

701
00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:24.800
about how he's rich, handsome, and single.

702
00:47:25.884 --> 00:47:29.596
Do women seriously think
that he's handsome?

703
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.556
Are you joking?

704
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:33.642
Objectively, he's far from ugly.

705
00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.399
You'll have to add a penalty stroke.

706
00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:43.860
Is this cracked?
Why are things so off recently?

707
00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.501
What are you up to?

708
00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:01.003
There's nothing much to see.

709
00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.087
Let's eat.

710
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.171
Okay.

711
00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:06.008
Enjoy.

712
00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:07.843
I can't guarantee the taste.

713
00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:10.220
Don't worry. It's good.

714
00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:12.723
Lucky you.
You get to eat her food every day.

715
00:48:12.806 --> 00:48:15.350
That's not true.
She hasn't cooked for me in ages.

716
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.269
She's so busy nowadays.

717
00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:18.812
Right.

718
00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:21.231
Mom, her mom is a doctor too.

719
00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:23.859
Really? Which department?

720
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.403
Family Medicine.

721
00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.864
Goodness. No way.

722
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:31.116
That's so fascinating.

723
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.952
I'm currently being trained
in that department too.

724
00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.788
So tell me. Where does she work?

725
00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:39.041
Did she open her own practice?

726
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.335
Mom.

727
00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.462
Enough with the interrogation.

728
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:45.714
Where's Dad?

729
00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:47.299
Indoor golfing.

730
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:50.344
I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.

731
00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:53.305
Hey, what are you talking about?

732
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:55.307
Just eat.

733
00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:57.392
This is so good.

734
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:59.436
I'm glad. Eat up.

735
00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:00.437
Eat up.

736
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.647
Okay.

737
00:49:14.701 --> 00:49:16.703
DO NOT LET GO OF THE CATHETER
UNTIL THE PROCEDURE IS DONE

738
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.914
Thank you for the meal.

739
00:49:18.997 --> 00:49:20.999
-Thank you for the meal.
-Okay. You can go upstairs.

740
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.712
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

741
00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.734
Let's go.

742
00:49:58.078 --> 00:49:59.496
Where are you going? Go up.

743
00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.338
Hello, sir. Are you off today?

744
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.424
-The surgery was canceled.
-I see.

745
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:18.682
Why would they come
all the way here to golf?

746
00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.809
We're here, aren't we?

747
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.603
How long must we do this in hiding?

748
00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.272
I'm sick and tired of this.

749
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:27.357
Wait…

750
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.057
A bracelet?

751
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:03.226
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

752
00:51:04.644 --> 00:51:06.563
And it was 5,820,000 won?

753
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.194
This is a designer brand.

754
00:51:16.448 --> 00:51:17.783
-Mother.
-Yes?

755
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:21.536
Did you recently purchase a bracelet?

756
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:24.331
Gosh, no.

757
00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.249
I didn't.

758
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.251
I see.

759
00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:35.884
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

760
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.844
It's pretty.

761
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:42.140
But why did he buy this?

762
00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:02.118
-Did you just come home?
-Yes.

763
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:04.162
How was golf?

764
00:52:04.663 --> 00:52:05.789
It was so-so.

765
00:52:06.706 --> 00:52:07.916
Honey,

766
00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:10.377
did you buy a bracelet?

767
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:15.924
A bracelet?

768
00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:17.801
Why are you so surprised?

769
00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:22.055
I found this in your pocket.

770
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:25.350
It was pretty expensive.
Why did you buy it?

771
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:31.439
It's strange…

772
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.733
how you're not answering me.

773
00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:37.279
Why would you look inside my pockets?

774
00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:40.866
I checked them before taking the clothes
to the dry cleaners.

775
00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:49.124
You really are a buzzkill, you know that?

776
00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:52.419
It's your birthday soon.

777
00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:53.837
My birthday?

778
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:56.548
It'll be in two months.

779
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:59.259
I was going to brag
about getting your gift early.

780
00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.303
Gosh, you ruined everything.

781
00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:03.597
Seriously?

782
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.557
Then did you think it was for me?

783
00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:08.894
Well…

784
00:53:09.811 --> 00:53:12.731
You've never bought me such things.

785
00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:14.441
I know you like luxury items.

786
00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:17.736
Did you forget how much you spent recently
at the department store?

787
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:21.114
It was just that one time.

788
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:23.617
If that's the case,

789
00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:25.410
where is it?

790
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:30.040
Since I found out about it anyway,
can I just have it now?

791
00:53:30.123 --> 00:53:31.249
No!

792
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.251
It's in my office.

793
00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:35.170
Really?

794
00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:39.132
I wanted to see it right now.
What a shame.

795
00:53:40.842 --> 00:53:42.010
Honey.

796
00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:46.139
You must be exhausted
after golfing, right?

797
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.350
Yes, I need to rest.

798
00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:49.351
-Really?
-Yes.

799
00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:51.353
Should I massage your shoulders?

800
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:53.772
They're so stiff.

801
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.023
That feels good.

802
00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.399
This part.

803
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:58.401
It's okay. I just need to rest.

804
00:53:58.485 --> 00:53:59.986
Shall I fill the bathtub?

805
00:54:01.446 --> 00:54:02.280
I'd love that.

806
00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.033
Okay. Come out in ten minutes.

807
00:54:05.116 --> 00:54:06.117
Okay.

808
00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:32.644
Can I come in?

809
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:34.729
You're already in.

810
00:54:42.862 --> 00:54:45.490
It's been a while since you had wine
in the bathtub, right?

811
00:54:46.032 --> 00:54:48.159
What's gotten into you
with all this treatment?

812
00:54:48.243 --> 00:54:49.828
That's the power of gifts.

813
00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:59.421
Drink slowly.

814
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.968
Do you think…

815
00:55:06.594 --> 00:55:09.180
it's that easy for someone to change?

816
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:11.725
What do you mean?

817
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:13.643
You see,

818
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:18.189
I'm a dedicated mother
and wife to the bone.

819
00:55:18.273 --> 00:55:19.983
You know me.

820
00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:22.819
I'm the icon of selflessness and devotion.

821
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:24.529
Right.

822
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.034
I know I've changed
due to certain situations.

823
00:55:30.702 --> 00:55:32.954
But my family is my top priority.

824
00:55:34.622 --> 00:55:36.249
That'll never change.

825
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:43.631
Honey.

826
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.384
Why didn't you tell me about Seung-hi?

827
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.102
I knew you'd ask.

828
00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:59.189
It's nothing good,
so I didn't bother to tell you.

829
00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:01.608
Have you spoken with her?

830
00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:03.860
We've just greeted each other.

831
00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.154
Is she married?

832
00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:07.363
Beats me.

833
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:14.329
Do you think she still hates me?

834
00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.624
I doubt she loves you.

835
00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:22.796
She's still as beautiful as she was then.

836
00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:28.259
She looks so elegant
that she'd turn heads.

837
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:34.140
It feels like
I'm the only one who has aged.

838
00:56:40.313 --> 00:56:41.898
You don't look too bad either.

839
00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.276
Really?

840
00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:46.861
Sure.

841
00:56:50.323 --> 00:56:51.324
You're right.

842
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:55.203
I still got the body.

843
00:56:57.413 --> 00:57:00.708
Don't stay in there for too long.

844
00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:01.793
Okay.

845
00:57:21.896 --> 00:57:23.898
Do you not like it, sir?

846
00:57:23.982 --> 00:57:25.692
Would you like to see something else?

847
00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:26.609
It's okay.

848
00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:29.779
I'll take it.

849
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:32.157
How would you like to pay?

850
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.700
Twelve-month installments, please.

851
00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:34.951
Yes, sir.

852
00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:49.299
What brings you here?

853
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:53.761
I came to talk to you
about a personal matter.

854
00:57:55.513 --> 00:57:58.433
So let me speak casually
to you for a moment.

855
00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:02.103
What do you want?

856
00:58:07.692 --> 00:58:09.235
I don't know…

857
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.197
how to begin.

858
00:58:14.073 --> 00:58:15.116
To be honest,

859
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.076
I don't think

860
00:58:18.077 --> 00:58:19.829
I've ever apologized to you.

861
00:58:21.956 --> 00:58:23.374
I know it happened ages ago,

862
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:27.212
so bringing it up now…

863
00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:30.757
may feel odd.

864
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.176
But still,

865
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:35.678
I'd like to apologize.

866
00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:41.017
I won't justify my actions
and say I was immature back then.

867
00:58:42.268 --> 00:58:43.228
I…

868
00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:45.396
hurt you

869
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:48.566
very deeply.

870
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:50.818
I'm sorry.

871
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.364
I'm truly sorry.

872
00:58:55.573 --> 00:58:56.574
I mean it.

873
00:58:58.576 --> 00:59:01.704
I wanted to ask you
for forgiveness back then.

874
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.375
But I was a coward.

875
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.461
To be honest,

876
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:12.549
you were so amazing
and successful in my eyes

877
00:59:14.259 --> 00:59:17.178
that I thought you'd just brush it off.

878
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:20.807
That was thoughtless of me.

879
00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:23.726
How could you have forgiven me?

880
00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:25.979
I'm sure…

881
00:59:26.854 --> 00:59:28.064
you've had

882
00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:30.775
your share of painful moments.

883
00:59:39.534 --> 00:59:41.786
I don't even know how to respond to this.

884
00:59:43.204 --> 00:59:44.998
That was ages ago.

885
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:45.999
I moved on.

886
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.709
There's no need to feel guilty.

887
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:51.879
If apologizing made
you feel better, I'm glad.

888
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:53.631
Really?

889
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.051
I'm relieved.

890
00:59:57.802 --> 00:59:59.178
How have you been?

891
01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:01.014
Are you married?

892
01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:07.145
It's a bit absurd to hear you
trying to be friendly and ask questions.

893
01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.898
Just because I don't
make an issue out of our past

894
01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.526
doesn't mean we can be friends.

895
01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:33.046
CHOI SEUNG-HI

896
01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:35.840
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

897
01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.217
-Did you page me?
-Yes.

898
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.053
It's about Mr. Oh Chang-gyu, our VIP.

899
01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:42.847
He got discharged
and was about to get in his car

900
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.223
when he suddenly collapsed.

901
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.767
-He's here in the ER.
-What?

902
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.311
They're carrying out CPR in the ICU.

903
01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.526
-Administer 1ml of epinephrine.
-Yes, ma'am.

904
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.653
Chairman Oh.

905
01:00:59.864 --> 01:01:01.240
What are you doing?
Prepare the defibrillator.

906
01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.367
Yes, ma'am.

907
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:11.876
Let me check his readings.

908
01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.254
I'm seeing V-fib. Let's shock him now.

909
01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.464
Charge it to 150J.

910
01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:21.552
150J, charged.

911
01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.138
Stand clear.

912
01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.682
One, two, administering shock.

913
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:33.064
Once more. 150J.

914
01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.484
I charged it to 150J.

915
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:38.945
Stand clear.
One, two, administering shock.

916
01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:47.036
Administer 300ml of amiodarone.

917
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.705
-Yes, ma'am.
-Charge it to 200J.

918
01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.373
One, two, administering shock.

919
01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.219
-Did you administer the amiodarone?
-Yes, I did.

920
01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.940
No.

921
01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:51.642
Charge it to 200J.

922
01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:53.811
Charge it to 200J.

923
01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.063
-I'll take over.
-Okay.

924
01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.318
I charged it to 200J.

925
01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.363
Move. One…

926
01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:09.368
Two…

927
01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:11.913
Administering shock.

928
01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:34.352
Dr. Cha.

929
01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:36.687
Dr. Cha!

930
01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:38.564
Open your eyes!

931
01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.607
Dr. Cha!

932
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.991
DOCTOR CHA

933
01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.765
<c.bg_transparent><i>Does that lady have some kind
of irresistible charm I don't know about?</i></c.bg_transparent>

934
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.433
Why do men swarm around her?

935
01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.977
You didn't hear?

936
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.230
<c.bg_transparent><i>They say Dr. Cha and GS Professor Seo
are seeing each other.</i></c.bg_transparent>

937
01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:20.773
Honestly, this is driving me crazy too!

938
01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:23.901
Ms. Jang Hae-nam disappeared.

939
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:24.819
Are you out of your mind?

940
01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.488
<c.bg_transparent><i>How dare an incompetent resident
like you humiliate our hospital?</i></c.bg_transparent>

941
01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.407
Do you think you can continue to work?

942
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:33.661
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm afraid I'll have to quit
working at the hospital.</i></c.bg_transparent>
