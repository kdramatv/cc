﻿1
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.103
How pathetic.

3
00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.313
Mom's here.

4
00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.732
Mom.

5
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.859
-Mom.
-Hey, Jeong-suk.

6
00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.879
I saw a woman standing right over there

7
00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.715
and I kept staring at her
because she was so stunning.

8
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.427
It turned out to be
none other than my daughter-in-law.

9
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.888
It was my daughter-in-law.

10
00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.142
You really dressed up today.

11
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.145
You look like a totally different person.

12
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.772
You don't look like my mom.

13
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.359
More like someone I want to
be friends with?

14
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.279
Mom, you look amazing today.

15
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.366
The cake is here.

16
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:43.621
Oh, my. Take a look at that.
In-ho prepared a lot today.

17
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.582
TO MY BELOVED WIFE
CHA JEONG-SUK

18
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.086
I'm not sure if you'll like it.
Please light the candles.

19
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.973
What are you waiting for?
Let's all sing happy birthday to her.

20
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.943
Jung-min, take a video.

21
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.207
I'll blow them out.

22
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.005
Let's make a toast.

23
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:36.466
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

24
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.852
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

25
00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.398
MY DAUGHTER EUN-SEO

26
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.654
Look over here.

27
00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.030
One, two, three.

28
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.407
Got it.

29
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.538
MOM, HURRY UP AND COME HOME,
I'M GOING TO ORDER FRIED CHICKEN

30
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.422
Go on and open them.

31
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.175
It's polite to open gifts on the spot.

32
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.385
Later.

33
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.220
Once we get home.

34
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.848
It's going to take a while
for the food to come out, so open them.

35
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.350
Yes, right.

36
00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.772
That's from me.

37
00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.358
You can wear them when you're working.

38
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.904
They're so pretty. Thank you.

39
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.284
Mom, it seemed
like you didn't have any perfume.

40
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.959
It smells so nice.

41
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:54.585
Thank you, Jung-min.

42
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.213
That's from me.

43
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.842
You know that's a designer brand, right?

44
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.135
Of course.

45
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.219
Mother, thank you.

46
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.060
Thank you.

47
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.147
In-ho, do you not have a gift?

48
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.852
I'll give you these instead
since I already gave you your gift.

49
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:55.646
Happy birthday.

50
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:04.781
Thank you.

51
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.160
I can't believe I got flowers from you.

52
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.455
I never thought
a day like this would come.

53
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.710
We can have
more days like this from now on.

54
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.971
Shall we have some cake
before the food comes out?

55
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.348
-Sounds good.
-All right.

56
00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.017
There.

57
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.771
"To my beloved wife, Cha Jeong-suk."
This is for you.

58
00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:41.984
All right.

59
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.821
I'm a little hungry. Can you cut the cake?

60
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.866
I think cutting it three times
would be sufficient.

61
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:28.239
This is hilarious.

62
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:33.202
Honey, consider this my birthday gift too.

63
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.621
I've wanted to do this for so long.

64
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.875
Now I get why people do this.

65
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.293
How should I put it?

66
00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:43.129
It feels cathartic.

67
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.593
Sorry, I must have startled you.

68
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.226
Are you okay?

69
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.570
-Does it taste good?
-I'm okay.

70
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.281
You seem shocked.

71
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.782
Not at all.

72
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.751
Goodness, this song brings back memories.

73
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.462
Didn't you like this song in college?

74
00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.800
You must mean
your ex-girlfriend did, not me.

75
00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:23.145
Sorry.

76
00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.856
I did like it too.

77
00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.193
You liked it too, right?

78
00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.945
See.

79
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.573
My memory isn't that bad.

80
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.157
How amazing.

81
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.159
It's not something to be amazed about.

82
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.786
It's not that.

83
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.664
Your ex-girlfriend

84
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.542
had similar tastes to mine.

85
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.335
From songs…

86
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.296
to men.

87
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:55.553
I'm curious if that woman
married a man like you.

88
00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.932
You're curious about the oddest things.

89
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.851
What matters is our family, right?

90
00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:06.439
Isn't your wedding anniversary next month?

91
00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.276
-Right.
-Let's have a meal at another hotel then.

92
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.278
Sounds good. It'll be my treat.

93
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.529
Gosh, thank you.

94
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.531
Mom, tell us about your wedding.

95
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.951
I heard it was hilarious
thanks to Auntie Mi-hee's awful singing.

96
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.786
-You're right.
-That's right.

97
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.955
And Dad, I heard you had
the wrong tuxedo delivered,

98
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.041
but you wore it anyway to the wedding.

99
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.375
You're right.

100
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.464
Yes.

101
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.593
It was a complete mess.

102
00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:43.684
I'll love you forever

103
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:48.481
I will love you like this very moment

104
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:53.694
I will love you

105
00:10:56.572 --> 00:11:00.201
More than anyone else in this world

106
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:06.749
I'll arouse your curiosity

107
00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:11.712
With difficult stories

108
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.423
I can pass this whole night away

109
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:19.887
With that game that everybody plays

110
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.225
But I…

111
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.060
Have a long-lasting marriage!

112
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:32.191
I was so upset that day.

113
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.569
Jeez, there wasn't a single thing I liked.

114
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.614
After that wedding,
I couldn't go to the class reunion

115
00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.409
because everything
was an absolute disgrace--

116
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.100
Let me out.

117
00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:07.309
I don't feel well.

118
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:09.895
Okay.

119
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.612
-Jeong-suk.
-Mom, are you okay?

120
00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.240
-Jung-min, follow her out.
-Come on.

121
00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:24.368
-Mom's leaving.
-No, this way.

122
00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.037
-Wait, there's a car behind us.
-There's a car coming.

123
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.414
I'll get going for now.

124
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.210
Hey.

125
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:34.920
Do you think she caught on?

126
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:37.965
Did you see her face when she smashed
In-ho's face into the cake?

127
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:39.675
It didn't look like she was joking at all.

128
00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.595
No way. She was laughing
like it was a joke.

129
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.764
And if she found out,
why would she play dumb and not get mad?

130
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.642
She might be holding back
until she gets concrete evidence.

131
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:49.810
That can't be.

132
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.022
No woman can stay calm after finding out
about her husband's affair.

133
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.690
They usually go ballistic.

134
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.276
I thought I was hallucinating earlier.

135
00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:58.944
I know the times have changed

136
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:01.780
but how can she do that
in front of her mother-in-law?

137
00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.700
I knew this was something
that will blow up one day,

138
00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:05.743
but my only wish

139
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.330
is for it to happen after I'm gone.
Dear Lord…

140
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.414
Mom!

141
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.731
Mom, what are you doing?

142
00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:19.650
Nothing.

143
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:22.945
Did something happen?

144
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:26.490
Nothing happened.

145
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.909
I'll sleep here tonight.

146
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.990
HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR

147
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.493
WIFE DISAPPEARS AFTER TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF HUSBAND'S AFFAIR

148
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:55.287
DIVORCE CONSULTATION
AFTER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR

149
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:58.290
I WANT TO DIVORCE MY CHEATING HUSBAND,
I NEED YOUR ADVICE

150
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.292
COLLECT EVIDENCE ONLY YOU HAVE,
VIDEOS ARE BETTER THAN PHOTOS

151
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.670
SINCE YOUR HUSBAND IS AT FAULT,
LOOK INTO THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY AS WELL

152
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.797
SOME POSTED THE VERDICT TO
THE HUSBAND'S AND ADULTERESS' COMPANY PAGE

153
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.257
DON'T LET THESE COMMENTS SWAY YOU,
GET A CONSULTATION FROM A LAW FIRM

154
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.611
Honey.

155
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.532
Do you know where my black tie is?

156
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:37.871
Who's funeral is it?

157
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.334
My high school teacher's wife.

158
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.797
He was my math teacher
and he was really good to me.

159
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.426
I wonder how he'll get by alone
at that age.

160
00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.055
When will you die?

161
00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.394
I just asked you when you will die.

162
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.229
I'm not sure.

163
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.066
Would you be happy
if I had an answer for that?

164
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.777
I just hope you die before me.

165
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.239
That way you'll avoid
becoming a sad widower

166
00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:15.325
who has to get by all alone at an old age
like your teacher.

167
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:19.163
Right, thank you for your concern.

168
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:24.752
So you have been training for a marathon
so you can outlive me.

169
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.670
Let's say that's the reason.

170
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.841
Come home early today.
I have something to tell you.

171
00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.854
First, you have to gather evidence.

172
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.648
Getting a photo of them
in the act is best.

173
00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.777
A photo of them
going in or out of a motel.

174
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.739
The most indisputable evidence
would be a picture of them having sex,

175
00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.240
But those are hard to capture.

176
00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:59.453
Once you begin divorce proceedings,
you'll see your husband at his worst.

177
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:01.580
Simply put, it's a dirty fight.

178
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:04.625
What if…

179
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.962
I just want a clean divorce?

180
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.048
There is no such thing as a clean divorce.

181
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.111
DIVORCE SPECIALIST, LAW FIRM

182
00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:51.356
Why aren't you running?

183
00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:53.650
Everything…

184
00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:56.653
just seems useless.

185
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:01.700
What's the point of running?

186
00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.203
What's the point of eating?

187
00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.247
What's the point of breathing?

188
00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:10.125
It all seems pointless

189
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.212
and makes me feel empty.

190
00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.839
Did something happen?

191
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.599
I think I've fallen in love
with marathons.

192
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.854
Where did they go?

193
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.564
They left me out!

194
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:37.277
We're almost there.

195
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.112
-You've got this!
-I've got this.

196
00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:43.742
Nothing is without reason.

197
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.120
Every effect has a cause.

198
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.715
Dr. Cha, do you want
to be a medical volunteer?

199
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:03.679
A medical volunteer?

200
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:07.349
Our hospital regularly provides
free medical services to communities.

201
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.476
I'm going to participate.

202
00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:11.478
You should join me.

203
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.404
She wants to talk?

204
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.489
What does she want to talk about with us?

205
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:23.865
I don't know.

206
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.409
Jung-min, do you know anything?

207
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.120
How do you expect me to know
something you don't

208
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:29.705
when you're the one who caused this mess?

209
00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:32.416
I-rang, you didn't tell your mom, did you?

210
00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:33.625
Do you think I'm crazy?

211
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.460
Jeez, then what on earth is it?

212
00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:50.642
I am…

213
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:54.604
going to leave this house.

214
00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.111
"Leave this house"?

215
00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.821
I mean,

216
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:05.657
what are you saying all of a sudden?

217
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.410
I'm planning to stay
in the resident dorms.

218
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.747
I'm busy with work as is
and commuting takes up too much time.

219
00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:15.250
I-rang, I hope you can understand.

220
00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:18.503
Does Mother's or my opinion not matter?

221
00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:21.715
You're going to leave
if I-rang is okay with it?

222
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:23.133
Yes.

223
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:26.928
I'll be fine,
so do whatever's comfortable for you.

224
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:28.597
Oh, my.

225
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.432
Then who will do the household chores?

226
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.436
Listen. I can't look after this house
all by myself.

227
00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.397
And I'm not satisfied
with any of the housekeepers!

228
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.107
Mother, I'm also exhausted.

229
00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:45.906
Either find a housekeeper that you like
or lower your standards.

230
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.457
But you'll still come
on the weekends, right?

231

<c.bg_transparent><i>Dr. Cha, do you want
to be a medical volunteer?</i></c.bg_transparent>

233
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:36.164
Aren't you going to the dorms next week?

234
00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.374
I'll be volunteering.

235
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.585
I'll be busy,
so I thought I'd leave early.

236
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.504
You're going to be a medical volunteer?

237
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.048
-Why all of a sudden?
-Just because.

238
00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:48.301
I wanted to get out
of the hospital for a bit.

239
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.724
Are you moving abroad or what?
Why are you packing so much stuff?

240
00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:56.560
How do you expect to move all of this?

241
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.605
-Do you want me to help?
-No, I called a taxi.

242
00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.999
-Let me carry that for you.
-It's fine.

243
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.378
Goodbye, Mother.

244
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:27.841
Please look after I-rang for me.

245
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:29.843
She's all grown up.
There's not much for me to do for her.

246
00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.597
I'll get going now.

247
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.891
-Bye.
-Okay.

248
00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.569
Something feels so off.

249
00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:48.987
What is it?

250
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.241
I have a feeling
she will never come back here.

251
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:54.701
What?

252
00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:15.180
What are you doing?

253
00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:18.516
I haven't gotten off work on time
in a while, so I'm reading comics.

254
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.935
What's up?

255
00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:22.771
I'm free right now.
Do you want to grab coffee together?

256
00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:25.148
We saw each other all day at work today.

257
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:26.274
You like me that much?

258
00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:28.526
You just realized that?

259
00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:33.698
If you put it like that, I can't say no.

260
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.492
Hurry up and come out. I miss you.

261
00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.994
-Okay, I'm hanging up.
-

262
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.504
Dr. Cha, why are you coming out of there?

263
00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:50.924
Is there a reason why I can't?

264
00:25:51.841 --> 00:25:55.053
I'm only coming out of this resident dorm
as a resident like you.

265
00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:56.805
I mean, I…

266
00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:59.891
I live far, so I'm staying here
for the time being.

267
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.519
It seems we live across from each other.

268
00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.814
I look forward
to being neighbors with you.

269
00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:07.983
Sure.

270
00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:31.256
You must be going to the cafe.

271
00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:32.924
Yes.

272
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.010
Are you going to the cafe?

273
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.512
Yes, I have something to buy.

274
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.435
-Jung-min, keep up the good work.
-Okay, bye.

275
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:45.687
-Hey.
-Hey.

276
00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:59.034
I see they arranged to meet here.

277
00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:02.996
Hello, Dr. Cha.

278
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.664
Hello.

279
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.208
Did you choose my coffee?

280
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.463
Right, a cup of Americano.

281
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:13.298
Hey, I said I wanted something sweet.

282
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.591
What?

283
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:17.677
Right, then a dolce latte?

284
00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:19.346
What? Dolce?

285
00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:20.680
Forget it.

286
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.098
-I'll--
-Just drink it, will you?

287
00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:31.399
Did you say that to me?

288
00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:35.695
Hey.

289
00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:36.821
Hey!

290
00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:42.619
Honey, where's my luggage…

291
00:27:51.628 --> 00:27:53.463
-These are the masks, right?
-Yes, 100 of them.

292
00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:55.173
-What about the IV drips?
-Those…

293
00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:56.257
Hurry up and come.

294
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.717
-Hurry.
-We need to check the quantity.

295
00:27:57.801 --> 00:27:59.469
We received 100 masks.

296
00:27:59.552 --> 00:28:00.637
-Write that down.
-I did!

298
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:06.267
I'll get that.

299
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.144
Thank you.

300
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.897
-The masks? You can put them in.
-I'll do that.

301
00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:20.198
Hello, Director.

302
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:22.117
You're here.

303
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.244
The talented people of this hospital

304
00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.246
have come together for a good cause.

305
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.665
I should be here
to see you off as the director.

306
00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:32.001
Even though I'm staying behind,
I shall be with you in spirit.

307
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:33.378
Your spirit can stay behind too.

308
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:39.676
Okay, everyone be careful
and I'll see you when you get back.

309
00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.219
Okay.

310
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.850
Mom, where are you?

311
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:50.145
I'm going to pick some mugwort
with Ms. Ji from church.

312
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:54.232
Jeez, why are you going to pick mugwort
when you have a bad shoulder?

313
00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:57.026
I have to keep moving it
for it to get better.

314
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.363
Right, you're not
at the hospital today, right?

315
00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:02.824
Yes, I'm going elsewhere
for volunteer work.

316
00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:06.661
Since you're going to go do a good thing,
have a good time and return safely.

317
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:08.955
You be careful too, okay?

318
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:11.207
Okay, I'll see you when you get back.

319
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.208
Okay.

320
00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:16.921
-Ms. Oh Deok-rye.
-Yes.

321
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.590
-Please come this way.
-Okay.

GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

323
00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:27.265
-What time is it right now?
-I'm not sure.

324
00:29:27.348 --> 00:29:29.309
-We'll arrive around three or four.
-You said you have it.

325
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:30.935
-Seriously.
-Sit in the front.

326
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:32.479
-Are you okay?
-I was confused.

327
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:33.772
-We bought our own.
-What?

328
00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:54.667
-Are you checking everything?
-I'm doing it right now.

329
00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.546
-Professor Seo, can I sit here?
-Can I sit here?

330
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:06.471
-Chief Lim, you sit here.
-You sit.

331
00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.683
-What is this?
-What?

332
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:11.643
-What's what?
-What is?

333
00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:13.853
-Why are you blocking me?
-You blocked yourself.

334
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:15.271
-Why are you picking a fight?
-Who is?

335
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.190
-Let's not talk.
-But we already did.

336
00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:20.652
Jeez, honestly.

337
00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:40.338
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:42.549
-Hello.
-Come on in.

339
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:43.967
Hello.

340
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.142
Hello.

341
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.189
When can we leave?

342
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.693
I think our department is all here.

343
00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:04.821
You're late.

344
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:07.740
I unintentionally overslept.

345
00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:09.576
Is everyone here?

346
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:12.120
It takes about two hours to get there,

347
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.746
so you should get some sleep.

348
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:14.831
I think I'll do that.

349
00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:17.208
Then we'll get going now.

350
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.918
-Okay!
-Okay.

351
00:31:33.933 --> 00:31:36.519
We're here. Everyone can get off now.

352
00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:38.438
I'm hungry. What's for dinner?

353
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:40.440
Dinner should be pork belly.

354
00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:42.692
Sir, you didn't have
to come out to greet us.

355
00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:44.569
-Thank you for coming again this year.
-Thank you.

356
00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:46.321
We'll work hard this year as well.

357
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.405
Thank you.

358
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:52.285
Thank you.

359
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:54.370
Sir, thank you.

363
00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:12.639
We will work hard to protect
the health of the elderly.

364
00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:13.806
Thank you so much.

365
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:17.393
Can you organize these and these?

366
00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:20.355
Then I'll bring over everything
organized by each department.

367
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.153
The blood samples are here.

368
00:32:27.236 --> 00:32:29.364
-Put it up here, please.
-Thank you.

369
00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:31.532
-Shall I take these out?
-Yes.

370
00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.450
Thank you.

371
00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:39.123
-Hyun-seok, they're calling you there.
-Okay.

372
00:32:44.337 --> 00:32:45.296
All right.

373
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.882
All the medical staff
going on house calls,

374
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.467
please gather in front
of the main building!

375
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:51.094
I'll go!

376
00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:55.139
I didn't register for that.

377
00:32:58.101 --> 00:32:59.060
What?

378
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.396
Please talk into my ear.

379
00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:06.067
Ma'am, I heard that your knees hurt a lot.

380
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.487
That's just because death
is right around the corner for me.

381
00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:12.949
Still, I want to make you feel less pain.

382
00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:14.200
Thank you.

383
00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:16.911
Ma'am,

384
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:22.959
we're going to give you this shot.
It'll help lessen the pain.

385
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:26.462
If it comes out to 350
2 hours after you've had lunch,

386
00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:28.423
then it means it's not regulating well.

387
00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:33.553
Sir, things have gotten worse
than before, right?

388
00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:36.305
They say it's because of my diabetes,
but it keeps growing black.

389
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.100
Sir, you take insulin, right?

390
00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.018
Yes.

391
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:42.770
-Where do you store it?
-One moment, where did I put it?

392
00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.816
There it is, over there.

393
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.943
Yes, that one.

394
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:55.408
Sir, you have to store insulin
in the fridge.

395
00:33:55.908 --> 00:33:57.285
Are you taking your medicine on time?

396
00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:01.873
Well, there's no one here to remind me,
so I forget from time to time.

397
00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:06.794
Where is she going?

398
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.465
What's all this?

399
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.718
-What?
-Sir, I'll clean your foot for you.

400
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:14.844
It's fine.

401
00:34:14.927 --> 00:34:16.095
It's okay. Please stay still.

402
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.513
Gosh, I feel so bad.

403
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.390
This is what we came here for.

404
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:22.226
Goodness, okay.

405
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.770
Gosh.

406
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:26.564
Gosh, I'm sorry for making you do this.

407
00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:27.732
It's nothing.

408
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.735
It's fine. You can stop.

409
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:37.241
-Thank you.
-No problem.

410
00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:38.284
Thank you.

411
00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:41.496
Sir, I put your insulin pen in the fridge.

412
00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.206
Make sure to get the shots on time.

413
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.793
I also organized your medication here,

414
00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:49.796
so please make sure
you take them after your meals.

415
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.005
Okay.

416
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.299
Sir, please show me your foot again.

417
00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:54.550
My foot, what for?

418
00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:57.178
I want to compare it the next time I come.

419
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:01.390
I mean,

420
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:04.435
are you really going to come here again?

421
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.317
Gosh, it's fine if you don't come.

422
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:14.028
I'll come.

423
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.365
Sir, I'll come back no matter what.

424
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:22.370
Sir, do you have your meals on time?

425
00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:25.248
Meals? I just…

426
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.972
Sir, please make sure to eat dinner.

427
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:41.931
Stay healthy.

428
00:35:42.014 --> 00:35:43.141
I'll come again.

429
00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:44.058
Goodbye.

430
00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:50.148
Dr. Cha, you're really amazing.

431
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.110
I didn't even think of washing his foot.

432
00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:59.574
I feel like doctors
who lack skills like me

433
00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:03.494
can still be useful around here.

434
00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:06.706
What a relief, isn't it?

435
00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.505
What seems to be bothering you?

436
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.549
-My knee aches.
-Let's check it.

437
00:36:16.632 --> 00:36:19.260
-I hurt it while working.
-Put your leg up here.

438
00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:21.554
-Lift it slowly.
-Okay.

439
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.681
What about your knee?

440
00:36:23.764 --> 00:36:26.392
-It aches.
-Yes, and it makes your heart ache too.

441
00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:28.144
MEDICAL VOLUNTEER EVENT
WITH GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

442
00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:29.145
It's piles.

443
00:36:29.228 --> 00:36:30.271
What are piles?

444
00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:32.940
Simply put, they're hemorrhoids.

445
00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:36.569
But you can only make a full recovery
from hemorrhoids through surgery.

446
00:36:36.652 --> 00:36:39.780
-What?
-But your case is not that serious, sir.

447
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.240
Then what do I do?

448
00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:43.492
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

449
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:46.245
Drink a lot of water
and eat a lot of vegetables.

450
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.914
-Ye-seo.
-Yes?

451
00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:51.125
I'm going to prescribe a suppository,
so please teach him how to insert it.

452
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:54.212
SURGICAL DEPARTMENT

453
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:58.633
Ma'am, you'll have to refrain
from spicy and greasy foods for a while.

454
00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:01.719
-Okay.
-I'll prescribe medicine for diarrhea.

455
00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:03.888
While you're here,
you can get a nutrition injection.

456
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:11.395
Doctor, you are just
as handsome as an actor.

457
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:15.733
It'd be so nice to introduce you
to my youngest daughter.

458
00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:18.361
How old is your youngest daughter?

459
00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.447
Yes, she's 52.

460
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.117
She lost her husband two years ago,
but it would be difficult, right?

461
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:27.578
Yes, it would be kind of difficult.

462
00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:46.180
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

463
00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:54.772
<c.bg_transparent><i>Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to voicemail…</i></c.bg_transparent>

464
00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:57.858
Oh, my. Hello.

465
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:04.115
I received a checkup from you last time.

466
00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:09.787
I had that black mole on my back
and you did a biopsy.

467
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.664
Right, hello.

468
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:12.748
Hello.

469
00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:14.292
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

470
00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:20.798
One or two months ago,
my shoulder started hurting badly,

471
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.259
so I came
to the Orthopedic Department here.

472
00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:26.262
Going to neighborhood clinics
didn't seem to help at all.

473
00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:29.265
I see, but you came alone?

474
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:33.227
I thought my daughter would worry too much
if she knew, so I came in secret.

475
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.771
You seem very close with your daughter.

476
00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:38.524
It's always like that
between a mother and daughter.

477
00:38:38.607 --> 00:38:39.483
I'm jealous.

478
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.403
My mother passed away early.

479
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.156
She passed away when I was in high school.

480
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.490
After giving birth to my own child,

481
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:51.329
I now understand how hard it must've been
for my mother to leave me.

482
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:53.205
Goodness, I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:59.545
I'm sure she watched over you
as you grew up

484
00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.423
to be this beautiful and talented.

485
00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:07.178
Even after they die, mothers never leave
their children's side.

486
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.141
Your daughter is lucky.

487
00:39:12.224 --> 00:39:13.934
That's not true.

488
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:17.021
Well…

489
00:39:17.104 --> 00:39:18.606
to be honest,

490
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:21.442
my daughter is a doctor too.

491
00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:22.902
Goodness, really?

492
00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:25.988
She is doing her residency
in Family Medicine.

493
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:29.492
Which hospital?
Is she working for our hospital?

494
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:34.288
No. At another hospital.

495
00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:39.418
Make sure to receive
treatment for your shoulder.

496
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:42.546
If it doesn't get better,
you can have it checked by our department.

497
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.840
Thank you, Professor.

498
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.232
-Professor Choi Seung-hi?
-Yes, who are you?

499
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:07.196
I'm Professor Seo In-ho's mother.

500
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:10.574
Do you remember me?

501
00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:17.164
You sure have guts.

502
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.291
Why did you do it?

503
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:23.421
Even with the support of your parents,
siblings, and husband,

504
00:40:23.504 --> 00:40:24.755
it's hard to raise a child.

505
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:28.217
But you have spent the best years
of your life raising a child.

506
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:33.431
It's embarrassing to interfere like this
given that my son is almost 50.

507
00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:36.600
But please end this now.

508
00:40:37.893 --> 00:40:40.146
-Mother.
-Don't call me that.

509
00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:41.522
Whether I like it or not,

510
00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.858
Jeong-suk is my one and only
daughter-in-law.

511
00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:46.569
Wait.

512
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:56.412
She's beautiful.

513
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.330
You raised her well.

514
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:00.541
You worked hard.

515
00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:02.835
But still,

516
00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.421
I'll pretend I didn't see that photo.

517
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.955
Your abdomen is very tight
and filled with gas.

518
00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:42.208
I think you threw up due to indigestion.

519
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.544
I'll give you digestive pills
and please refrain from eating today.

520
00:41:45.628 --> 00:41:46.712
Okay, thank you.

521
00:41:46.795 --> 00:41:50.216
It's an emergency!

522
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:51.675
Isn't that the village head?

523
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.593
-What's going on?
-Doctors!

524
00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:55.804
Please save my father!

525
00:41:56.972 --> 00:41:58.349
-It's an emergency!
-Goodness.

526
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:02.895
It's been about three months.
His face is sallow.

527
00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:05.314
It sounds like it'll be a tough job.

528
00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:07.608
Professor Seo, I think you should…

529
00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:10.819
Professor Seo, you'll have to go.

530
00:42:13.822 --> 00:42:15.866
-Me?
-The patient's condition

531
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.117
is your specialty.

532
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.827
-That's right.
-Of course.

533
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:22.164
I mean, where did all the residents
from our department go?

534
00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:25.125
Doctor! Please save my father.

535
00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.460
-I beg you!
-Please get up.

536
00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.463
Professor Seo, you're perfect for this.

537
00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:32.424
-It's your specialty.
-Aren't we in the same department?

538
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:33.801
You specialize in the anus.

539
00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.303
-We're in the same department, Chief.
-I'm the person in charge here.

540
00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:38.764
-Thank you!
-What is there to oversee here?

541
00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:40.140
There's nothing to oversee here.

542
00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.142
-Hang on. Don't push me.
-Go on then.

543
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:16.218
Are we here? It must be here.

544
00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:19.013
No, we have to walk from here
because there's no path.

545
00:43:21.348 --> 00:43:24.143
-What?
-I feel bad for putting you through this.

546
00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:26.353
It's fine.

547
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.564
Which way is it? Down there?

548
00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:30.774
No, it's just a short hike up there.

549
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:31.734
Follow me.

550
00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.580
This place is pretty nice, right?

551
00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:45.623
-Yes!
-Doctor, here.

552
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:46.624
Okay.

553
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.921
Doctor, please help an old man out.

554
00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.591
Father will die at this rate.

555
00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:57.509
How long has it been?

556
00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.138
Father, how long has it been
since you had a bowel movement?

557
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:04.683
I stopped counting after eight days.

558
00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:07.019
We tried everything in the pharmacy,

559
00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:08.228
but nothing worked.

560
00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.230
Doctor, what should we do?

561
00:44:13.108 --> 00:44:15.527
Do you have petroleum jelly at home?

562
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.156
All I wanted was to poop.
Why are you making me take a sitz bath?

563
00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.616
I don't even have hemorrhoids.

564
00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:23.994
He said if your muscles relax,
you might be able to poop.

565
00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.164
He says to come out because he's ready.

566
00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:37.424
Sir, lay on top of the newspaper
and bring your knees to your chest.

567
00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:38.967
How?

568
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.101
This position. Just like a shrimp.

569
00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.785
Sir, brace yourself.
It will be a little uncomfortable.

570
00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:07.746
Uncomfortable?
It can't be worse than now, right?

571
00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:14.211
It'll be very uncomfortable.
Hang in there.

572
00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:16.588
I feel so bad for you. I'm sorry.

573
00:45:17.172 --> 00:45:18.048
It's fine.

574
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.009
It's very hard.

575
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:22.803
Is something coming out?

576
00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:23.887
I'm digging it out.

577
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:26.140
It's coming out.

578
00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:38.735
Father, do you feel refreshed?

579
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:42.406
I feel so light. I feel as if I could fly.

580
00:45:44.116 --> 00:45:47.202
Doctor, the way
you twirled your fingers around

581
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:49.705
must have stimulated his butthole.

582
00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:53.041
He was able to feel refreshed
all thanks to you.

583
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:57.337
-It was nothing.
-This is the happiest I've been lately.

584
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.381
Thank you, Doctor.

585
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.758
Yes, I'm grateful that I was able to help.

586
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:04.011
Doctor, you worked so hard.
Please have a drink.

587
00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:06.513
The work hours will be over anyway
by the time you go down.

588
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:13.061
Shall I?

589
00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:24.281
Please check Mr. Jung Seung-ho's IV drip
and shots one more time.

590
00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:25.282
Yes, ma'am.

591
00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:35.792
Enjoy.

592
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.544
-You worked hard.
-Thank you.

593
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:39.838
-Dr. Dong-keun.
-Yes.

594
00:46:53.393 --> 00:46:54.394
That's hot!

595
00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:57.981
I was lost in thought.

596
00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.326
What were you thinking about?

597
00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:10.827
What?

598
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.413
You seemed to be preoccupied
with something for a while.

599
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.583
Was I?

600
00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.836
You can tell me if things are tough.

601
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:21.797
Don't bottle it up.

602
00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:25.676
What do you think you're doing right now?

603
00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:31.390
I'm fine now. Thank you.

604
00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.109
You little…

605
00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:44.486
I'm sorry.

606
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:50.576
-What is his deal?
-Goodness.

607
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:53.662
-So many things need garlic.
-Just do it!

608
00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:55.080
What is this smell?

609
00:47:55.163 --> 00:47:56.039
-Hey.
-Yes?

610
00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:57.374
Did you fart?

611
00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:58.500
I didn't!

612
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:29.823
I don't smell anything.

613
00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:35.579
Have I become too used
to the smell of poop?

614
00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:45.422
EUN-SEO

615
00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:46.381
119 AMBULANCE

616
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:48.008
Okay. Please come up.

DAD

619
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.768
Get in quickly.

620
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.025
Don't put that on me.

621
00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:07.569
It's not a cardiac problem.

622
00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:08.737
It's gastric cramps.

623
00:49:09.696 --> 00:49:10.530
I'm a doctor, so I know.

624
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.115
We'll go to Gusan University Hospital.

625
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:13.283
No!

626
00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:16.536
Take me to a different hospital.

627
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.580
Mom, are you okay?

628
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:20.749
Yes.

629
00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:23.627
Professor, try this.

630
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:26.755
How is it?

631
00:49:27.714 --> 00:49:30.133
-I think you can add more soybean paste.
-Right?

632
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.393
Can you taste it again for me?

633
00:49:44.022 --> 00:49:44.856
It's perfect.

634
00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:02.082
I guess you learned
how to cook professionally.

635
00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.083
It's a survival skill.

636
00:50:03.792 --> 00:50:05.252
If you're a healthy adult,

637
00:50:05.919 --> 00:50:08.130
you should know how to cook your own food.

638
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:16.638
You must be very close to Dr. Cha.
You even sat next to her on the bus.

639
00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:21.393
My wife is very sociable, isn't she?

640
00:50:22.477 --> 00:50:24.438
Are you going to reveal the truth?

641
00:50:24.938 --> 00:50:25.897
About you and her?

642
00:50:32.654 --> 00:50:33.572
I guess not.

643
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.992
Of course not.

644
00:50:39.244 --> 00:50:41.580
-I'll take care of it myself.
-I'm sure you will.

645
00:50:42.998 --> 00:50:47.169
If you are free, can you make some sauce
for the meat with that soybean paste?

646
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:49.921
-Sauce?
-You do know how to make it, right?

647
00:50:53.842 --> 00:50:55.177
Of course.

648
00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.220
That's a piece of cake.

649
00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:06.062
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

650
00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:10.358
What a waste!

651
00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:12.611
What do we do?

652
00:51:12.694 --> 00:51:14.905
My mother-in-law fermented
that paste for three years!

653
00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.615
Your clothes are ruined.

654
00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:19.868
Why did you butt in
when you don't even know how to make it?

655
00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:24.372
-Darn, I didn't bring extra clothes.
-I'll give you clothes.

656
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:25.415
Ones that are pretty.

657
00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:27.083
Give me that! Goodness.

658
00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:28.919
What a waste.

659
00:51:29.002 --> 00:51:30.879
We can't even put this back in!

660
00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:32.506
-Unbelievable.
-Such a waste.

661
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.673
But it tastes good.

662
00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.092
It's such a waste. What do we do?

663
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:37.677
Clean this up!

664
00:51:40.847 --> 00:51:42.015
With my hands?

665
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.608
All right!

666
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:54.277
Doctors, since you've worked
so hard today,

667
00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:57.239
as the village head,
I shall supply you with drinks.

668
00:51:57.322 --> 00:51:58.865
Our village head is the best!

669
00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:01.827
-Sir, what is that?
-

670
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.495
Have you never seen this before?

671
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.212
-Gosh.
-Sir, thank you.

672
00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:13.129
It's nothing.

673
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.715
Professor Seo. I mean, Ma'am.

674
00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.133
I'll pour you one.

675
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.805
I'm fine.

676
00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:24.808
I drank a lot at the village head's house.

677
00:52:25.433 --> 00:52:28.937
You know it's my principle
not to get wasted.

678
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.147
That's my principle…

679
00:52:31.231 --> 00:52:33.525
How can you decline a drink
at a party like this?

680
00:52:33.608 --> 00:52:37.112
Don't you think you are hurting
this

681
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:39.072
You don't have surgery tomorrow.
Just drink.

682
00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:41.491
You have no self-control.

683
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:44.119
How on earth
did you practice medicine in such a state?

684
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.580
What did you just say?

685
00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.540
Did you not hear me?
Do you want me to repeat myself?

686
00:52:48.623 --> 00:52:50.500
I didn't hear you.
Repeat it five times for me.

687
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:51.668
Please pour me a drink.

688
00:52:52.377 --> 00:52:54.004
I'm a heavy drinker.

689
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:56.506
You should always accept
your senior's drink.

690
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.425
That lousy principle of yours.

691
00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.303
My principle is to drink
all the alcohol there is.

692
00:53:05.557 --> 00:53:06.516
Give me a drink.

693
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.518
That's more like it. Here you go, Ma'am.

694
00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:10.061
Come on, seriously?

695
00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:12.355
He said he doesn't want to drink. Stop it!

696
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:16.443
Don't yell at me when I'm this close.
I can hear you!

697
00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:22.657
But why is there bad blood
between our chief

698
00:53:22.741 --> 00:53:24.993
and the chief of the surgical department?

699
00:53:26.244 --> 00:53:28.622
Apparently, they were
super close during college.

700
00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.207
They were so close
that the chief of Family Medicine

701
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:34.127
introduced his younger sister
to the chief of the surgical department.

702
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.086
And?

703
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.089
You punk, I knew the moment
you betrayed my little sister

704
00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:41.259
and married the daughter of a rich family.

705
00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:43.595
-You'll get your comeuppance someday.
-"You'll get your comeuppance someday."

706
00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:45.263
I'm so sick of hearing that line.

707
00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:48.099
Is it my fault that Bong-suk
grew old all alone?

708
00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:52.479
You and I will be 60 soon.
That's 21,900 days old.

709
00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.814
-Aren't you ashamed?
-What, you punk?

710
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:57.609
Don't call me a punk.
I'm too old to be called that.

711
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.989
-What's with you?
-They're basically the same.

712
00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.908
Both of their wives divorced them.

713
00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:06.618
Forget it. Let's drink.

714
00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:08.703
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

715
00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:11.456
-Great work today, everyone.
-You drink.

716
00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:15.293
Imagine how happy this
to be loved like this?

717
00:54:15.877 --> 00:54:17.671
That's it. Imagine how happy it would be.

718
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.926
-That's the spirit, Professor Seo.
-Have another.

719
00:54:23.009 --> 00:54:24.177
Yes, sir.

720
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.387
Here's another one.

721
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.432
There you go.

722
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:32.852
That's it.

723
00:54:35.146 --> 00:54:36.231
You'll reach your goal.

724
00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:41.027
Alcohol got the best of you.

725
00:54:41.903 --> 00:54:44.155
Why did you drink so much?

726
00:54:54.207 --> 00:54:56.126
-I'm going to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

727
00:54:58.169 --> 00:54:59.421
I'm getting a call.

728
00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:01.047
Hello, Mom?

729
00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:02.882
What did you say?

730
00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:04.342
Right now, I'm…

731
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.886
-Yes.
-He's holding his phone upside down.

732
00:55:19.566 --> 00:55:22.152
Those little…

733
00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:23.820
What?

734
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:28.658
-My legs are all cramped, gosh.
-That quiet person

735
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:33.747
Who kept moving farther away

736
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.040
I guess there's a karaoke machine.

737
00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:39.044
Even if we cannot meet

738
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.212
Don't forget about me

739
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:42.881
-Don't forget about me!
-Don't forget about me!

740
00:55:43.548 --> 00:55:47.177
I loved you

741
00:55:48.053 --> 00:55:50.513
Chief Yoon, you're so good-looking.
You're the best.

742
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:52.640
Chief Yoon, you're so cute.
Thank you so much.

743
00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.351
Everyone, come on out here.

744
00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:57.896
We should dance and sing
with the people here.

745
00:55:57.979 --> 00:55:59.314
Professor Seo, come on!

746
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:03.193
Rohan Kimberley.
I mean, Roy Kimberley, come here!

747
00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:09.199
On the last train…

748
00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.742
Are you okay?

749
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.204
Do you want to lie down inside?

750
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:15.955
Shall I take you there?

751
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:19.292
Do you want to throw up?

752
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:22.837
And my tears fall as well…

753
00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:23.797
It's 89168…

754
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.006
What?

755
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.716
89168…

756
00:56:27.592 --> 00:56:28.551
What did you say?

757
00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:32.138
Within my

758
00:56:32.931 --> 00:56:37.519
-Vague memory
-It's 89168!

759
00:56:39.437 --> 00:56:41.856
My lover I met there

760
00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:45.276
My wordless lover

761
00:56:46.653 --> 00:56:50.698
She keeps going further away from me

762
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:59.165
-Number 89168!
-Do not forget me though we cannot meet…

763
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:05.004
I can actually see the stars.

764
00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:06.923
I know.

765
00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:10.385
I finally don't have
to look at the hospital ceiling.

766
00:57:10.885 --> 00:57:12.095
It's making me emotional.

767
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:14.222
You said you didn't want to come.

768
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:15.807
But it's nice, right?

769
00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:18.143
Whatever.

770
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:21.521
Didn't you say you took a video
of a Whipple procedure you went into?

771
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.064
Show it to me.

772
00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:24.566
I just don't understand.

773
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.693
Do you want to watch that here?

774
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.903
Yes, I do.

775
00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:31.197
Come on. Show me.

776
00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:35.326
-Here.
-Okay.

777
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:37.120
Thank you.

778
00:57:41.374 --> 00:57:43.001
So this is how you do it?

779
00:57:43.084 --> 00:57:44.669
Did I drink too much

780
00:57:44.752 --> 00:57:46.254
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

781
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:48.131
Come back soon.

782
00:57:52.677 --> 00:57:54.012
He should have the other video too.

783
00:57:56.181 --> 00:58:00.185

Hey.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.834
Honey!

794
00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:19.222
What? Who is he calling "honey"?

795
00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:20.932
"Honey" as in his love?

796
00:59:28.773 --> 00:59:32.277
Honey! Come here.

797
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.028
Sing a song

798
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.448
with me!

799
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.902
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk is your mother?

800
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.946
Is it true? She's your wife?

801
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.031
Why aren't you doing anything?
