DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.175
To be honest, given your age,

4
00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.551
it won't be easy to maintain

5
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.803
a good relationship with your colleagues.

6
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.138
To be even more honest,

7
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.600
you already know
that others will dislike you.

8
00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.733
I am ashamed to admit that,

9
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.778
even after the day I started
and graduated from medical school,

10
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.947
and after completing my internship,
I had never thought of

11
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.700
what kind of doctor I wanted to be.

12
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.036
I went to med school
because I had good grades.

13
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.871
All I wanted to do was become a doctor

14
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.873
and a proud daughter

15
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:25.084
who would build up our family's fortune.

16
00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.003
As funny as it may sound,

17
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.464
only after raising two children

18
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.341
as a housewife for 20 years

19
00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.469
and experiencing
a major liver transplant surgery

20
00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:38.348
did I finally begin to harbor a desire
to become a really good doctor.

21
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.183
I am also confident

22
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.520
that such experiences will provide
a great foundation as a doctor.

23
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.105
However, all of my hopes can come true

24
00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.400
only after I pass this interview.

25
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.944
All right.

26
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.403
You may leave.

27
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:53.822
Thank you.

2022 RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

29
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.627
I commend her courage.

30
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.254
And she seems like a good doctor.

31
00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.547
What does the FM Department think?

32
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.631
Do you feel skeptical?

33
00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:14.175
Try to put yourself in our shoes.

34
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.635
Would you choose her?

35
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.762
Maybe, maybe not.

36
00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.142
Please go inside.

37
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.435
Jung-min, how did your interview go?

38
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.026
2022 GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

39
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.196
Does Father know?

40
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.156
No.

41
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.366
If he knew, would he have let me come?

42
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.077
Mom, you can't be a resident.

43
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.412
Listen to yourself.

44
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.539
I'll have you know
I'm a med school graduate.

45
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.211
You might have forgotten this
because I'm always at home,

46
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.463
but I had pretty good grades
back in school.

47
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.050
I scored 49 on the resident exams.

48
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.468
You scored 49?

49
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.806
I only scored 45.

50
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.182
Hey.

51
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.560
You studied during your internship,

52
00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.103
but I went all in.

53
00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.646
Right.

54
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.982
So?

55
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.567
You're going to work here if you get in?

56
00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.527
What about Father?

57
00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:16.821
I'll start working first.

58
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.615
Well.

59
00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.409
If he finds out, I'll deal with it then.

60
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.038
Mom, how can you be so reckless?

61
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.040
Father isn't the main issue.

62
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.042
What if you catch an infection here?

63
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.921
You just got out of surgery.

64
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.256
How are you
going to manage this tough job?

65
00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:40.720
Jung-min.

66
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.058
Please worry about me
after I pass the interview.

67
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:46.643
Okay?

68
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.770
I appreciate your concern.

69
00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.690
Did you get the day off
for your interview??

70
00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.277
There's a place I have to stop by.

71
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.198
Keep your chin up!

72
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.910
Did you meet your wife?

73
00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.625
Come in.

74
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.006
It is you.

75
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.680
Do you remember me?

76
00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:26.891
I was a Gusan University
School of Medicine freshman in '95,

77
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.393
Cha Jeong-suk.

78
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.104
I do remember.

79
00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.147
Have a seat.

80
00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.780
I'm so relieved.

81
00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.490
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

82
00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.118
It's been so long.

83
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.372
It's been over 20 years,
but you haven't aged a day.

84
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.041
That's not true.

85
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.420
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

86
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.422
I wasn't sure if you heard,

87
00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.216
but I applied to be a resident
of Family Medicine.

88
00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:04.345
I saw you on the website
before I turned in my application.

89
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.056
-I see.
-I'm not sure

90
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.976
if I'll get hired or not at this point.

91
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.437
But if I do get hired,

92
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.397
I'll do my best.

93
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.734
I'll do my best not to make
the other residents uncomfortable,

94
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.027
so please help me out.

95
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.823
I'm not sure if that can happen
just by your effort alone.

96
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.329
Right.

97
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.955
Anyway, it was nice to see you.

98
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.040
I hope you make it.

99
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.792
Yes, thank you.

100
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.420
By the way,

101
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.089
does your husband know

102
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.341
that you applied here?

103
00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.218
Right.

104
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.095
About that…

105
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.475
can you keep it a secret

106
00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.810
if you run into him?

107
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.190
Why? A married couple will be
working at the same hospital.

108
00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.149
Shouldn't he know?

109
00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.942
My husband

110
00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:03.780
also didn't tell me you worked here.

111
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.473
I don't think they'll hire her.

112
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.683
Does it seem so?

113
00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.893
Of course.

114
00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:35.394
Why would anyone choose

115
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.522
an older applicant
over young, spirited ones?

116
00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.816
On top of that, she's not in good health.

117
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.819
I was wondering because she had
high scores on her resident exams.

118
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.987
Where were you
while she was doing all this?

119
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.240
You should've stopped her
before things came to this point.

120
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.699
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.201
She wanted to be a resident,

122
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.537
but I didn't think she would
actually take the exam.

123
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.331
On top of that,
who knew she'd apply to this hospital?

124
00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.003
I'm taking two days off next week.

125
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:04.173
I have to go see my father on Jeju Island.

126
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.508
Your father?

127
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.678
-He called?
-Yes.

128
00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.640
He was diagnosed
with stage four pancreatic cancer.

129
00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:14.392
Goodness.

130
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.894
I guess it finally made him think of
the daughter he abandoned.

131
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.772
It's all my fault.

132
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.246
Yes, hello?

133
00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.458
Yes, this is Cha Jeong-suk.

134
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:43.754
Excuse me.

135
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:46.174
If you don't mind,

136
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:51.012
could I know the reason I was rejected?

137
00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.096
Was it

138
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.557
because of my age?

139
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.894
Yes, okay.

140
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.068
So what did they say?

141
00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:09.155
They told me to look for other hospitals
before it's too late.

142
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.199
Then you should apply
to a smaller hospital.

143
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.327
You can just go somewhere else.
Why are you so down?

144
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.872
Failure is always painful.

145
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.501
Welcome.

146
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.710
Hello.

147
00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.420
What happened to your face?

148
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.798
What about it?

149
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:28.966
You don't look well.

150
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.176
Really?

151
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.720
I feel fine.

152
00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:33.888
Then that's a relief.

153
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.476
Right, why don't you go on a vacation?

154
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.229
You're probably mentally
exhausted after the surgery.

155
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.649
Don't you think it'd be good for you
to go somewhere nice?

156
00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:47.044
PASSENGER TERMINAL
THIS WAY

157
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.926
I have no idea
why I am going on a trip right now.

158
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.387
You know what they say.

159
00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:01.225
When humans face a crisis in life,
they must leave for somewhere.

160
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:06.731
It's human nature to discover
a breakthrough in life by leaving.

161
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.234
The breakthrough in my life was…

162
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:15.072
supposed to be
starting a new life as a doctor,

163
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.783
not a trip to Boracay.

164
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.577
Unbelievable.

165
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.163
Your last trip abroad was ages ago.

166
00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.664
Can you be a bit cheerful?

167
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.082
At any rate,

168
00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.336
you have a knack
for making your own life troublesome.

169
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.631
I'm just disappointed, that's all.

170
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.965
That's enough.

171
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.550
So what about my age?

172
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.427
Are older people not allowed
to have dreams?

173
00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.554
I'm not asking for much.

174
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.558
You'll get wrinkles
if you keep stressing out like that.

175
00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:45.645
Here. Make sure to apply this every day.

176
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.439
I know what this is.

177
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.733
You use it like this, right?

178
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.151
Yes.

179
00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:53.402
Good, that's it.

180
00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:55.655
Your neck too.

181
00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:57.615
Good.

182
00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.241
Much better.

183
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.743
-Really?
-Yes.

184
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.580
If that hospital doesn't hire you,
you can find another one.

185
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:05.998
You applied, right?

186
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.543
Yes, I have another interview next week.

187
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:13.923
Family medicine is a department
with a humane touch,

188
00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.927
so I'm sure there's a hospital somewhere
willing to take you.

189
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.678
Don't obsess over
Gusan University Hospital.

190
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:20.721
Why there of all places?

191
00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.723
Your husband works there.
It'll be uncomfortable.

192
00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.893
Choi Seung-hi.

193
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.062
Choi Seung-hi?

194
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.731
Your husband's first love?
That Choi Seung-hi?

195
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.024
Yes.

196
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:34.485
That Choi Seung-hi…

197
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.197
works at Gusan University Hospital.

198
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:41.659
-What?
-She's a professor

199
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:43.160
of family medicine there.

200
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.081
He's not going to come? Why not?

201
00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:50.292
His girlfriend dumped him,
so he enlisted in the army in shock.

202
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.378
What kind of an idiot is that?

203
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.838
What should we do, Professor?

204
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.965
Then we only have that old applicant left?

205
00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.217
-Yes.
-Good grief.

206
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.260
Should I call her?

207
00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:00.594
I don't know. Do what you will.

208
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.767
Really?

209
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.979
Wait, so did you run into her
at the interview?

210
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.106
No, I didn't see her at the interview.

211
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.900
I already knew before I went.

212
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.819
You may say that I'm silly,

213
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.446
but oddly…

214
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.739
it felt offensive.

215
00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.784
I would call you crazy
if you were happy to see her.

216
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.328
Your husband hid the fact that
he worked in the same place

217
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:29.331
as his first love,
whom he was madly in love with.

218
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.332
How can you feel--

219
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.002
I see.

220
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:37.798
Is that why you insisted on
working at Gusan University Hospital?

221
00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.467
To keep an eye on them?

222
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.386
No! Come on!

223
00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.348
It's my alma mater too.

224
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.976
It's a great hospital,
so I thought I'd learn more

225
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:50.978
if I worked as a resident there.

226
00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.522
That's why I want to go there. As if!

227
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.692
I'm too old to do something that immature.

228
00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:59.236
You also know what you said

229
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:01.614
is a lousy excuse, right?

230
00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:14.710
All right.

231
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.756
Who is this?

232
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.633
Hello?

233
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.220
Yes, I'm Cha Jeong-suk.

234
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.016
Gusan University Hospital?

235
00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.146
Yes.

236
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:37.483
Okay.

237
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.948
What is it? What did the hospital say?

238
00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.033
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:48.494
I can't go on this trip.

240
00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:49.912
They want you?

241
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.790
They want me.

242
00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.756
Get over here!

243
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:05.844
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

244
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.308
-Hello.
-Hello.

245
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.271
-Hello, Professor!
-Hello, Professor.

246
00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.523
I'm not a professor.

247
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.486
I'm a resident here.

248
00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.036
-Hello.
-Hello.

249
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:33.664
Hello.

250
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.707
-Hello.
-Hello.

251
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.834
My name is Lee Do-gyeom.

252
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.879
I'm Moon Chea-yoon. I was born in 1995.

253
00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.380
My name is Cha Jeong-suk.

254
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:42.756
I'm also a 1995…

255
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.010
A freshman in 1995.

256
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:51.765
I'll do my best not to be a nuisance
to my seniors and juniors.

257
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.726
I hope you don't feel awkward

258
00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:56.395
and treat me as you would
any other resident.

259
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:57.479
Of course we will.

260
00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:01.692
I hate those who want special treatment
just because they're older.

261
00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:04.194
Of course, I totally understand.

262
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.159
We work almost 80 hours a week.

263
00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.493
Is that all right?

264
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.497
Our shifts are that short these days?

265
00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:20.085
Gosh, back in my day,
we'd work 100 hours a week,

266
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:21.795
then do night shifts for two weeks,

267
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:22.796
and first-year…

268
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.300
You know, where you get banned
from going out for 100 days.

269
00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:27.301
-The 100-day shifts.
-The 100-day shifts.

270
00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:30.596
Yes, the 100-night shifts.
We had those traditions.

271
00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.680
Those are long…

272
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:32.723
Long gone.

273
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.350
Long gone, right?

274
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.647
That was a vibe killer.

275
00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:44.151
People would use "vibe killer"
for situations like this, right?

276
00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:45.694
Yes, it was a vibe killer.

277
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:48.489
Or would you say "that was cringe"?

278
00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:02.002
Professor Choi, you must not have known
because you were taking days off.

279
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.880
After twists and turns,
she joined our department.

280
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.924
This is Dr. Cha Jeong-suk. Please say hi.

281
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.343
Hello, Professor.

282
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:26.568
Even though test methods have advanced,
you can't miss that point.

283
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.903
-Yes.
-Yes, okay.

284
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.279
Yes, okay.

285
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:49.717
BOOK CAFE LOUNGE

286
00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.360
Excuse me.

287
00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:11.447
I'm not feeling well. I need an IV drip.

288
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.531
An IV drip?

289
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:14.825
Have you made your payment?

290
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.494
-Payment?
-Please come back

291
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.247
after taking a number ticket
at the registration and making a payment.

292
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.416
It's not that. It's an emergency.

293
00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.417
Don't you know me?

294
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.502
Professor Seo, why are you here?

295
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:26.837
Ms. Lee.

296
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.758
I'm in bad condition right now,
so I'd like an IV drip.

297
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:33.761
But she just told me
to go make the payment first.

298
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:36.805
It's her first day,
so she has no idea what's going on.

299
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.932
I'll give you the IV drip.

300
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.350
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

301
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:43.062
Goodness, what happened?

302
00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:47.274
This is what it feels like…

303
00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.903
to lose years off of my life.

304
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.036
SEUNG-HI:
I NEED TO SEE YOU NOW

305
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.872
Jeez.

306
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.837
I couldn't believe it
even after you texted me.

307
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:09.755
I was shocked,

308
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:12.091
as if I was struck by lightning--

309
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:13.258
More shocked than me?

310
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.885
Were you more stunned than me?

311
00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:18.347
I came to work in the morning
and saw your wife right in front of me.

312
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.890
I almost fainted.

313
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.058
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:22.893
Being sorry won't solve this issue.

315
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.770
How are you treated at home?

316
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.189
What does your wife take you for?

317
00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.942
How could she make such a big decision
without asking you even once?

318
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.276
That's what I'm saying!

319
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:34.696
What will you do now?

320
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.533
How will you deal with this mess?

321
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.369
Should I go to a new hospital?
Should I resign?

322
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.456
Seung-hi, let's not get worked up.
We need to calm down.

323
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.125
Give me some time to think.

324
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.584
I can't wait long.

Come in.

336
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.559
Hello.

337
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.061
Hello.

338
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:50.105
-Ms. Cha's--
-Goodness.

339
00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:53.817
I stopped by to greet
the new doctor who will be working here.

340
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:55.444
I see you're here too, Chief.

341
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.738
I believe this is
the first time we've met.

342
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.617
My name is Seo In-ho.

343
00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:07.331
How do you do?

344
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:08.290
I'm Roy Kimberley.

345
00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.209
Please call me Roy.

346
00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:13.128
Yes.

347
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.089
Please have a seat.

348
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.218
I was just on my way out.
You two should have a chat.

349
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:21.720
It's reassuring to have
two great doctors here,

350
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:22.679
with a dragon on my right,

351
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:24.681
and a tiger on my left.

352
00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:28.518
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

353
00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:43.200
How did you end up coming here?

354
00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.286
Did you sleep well?

355
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.913
How's your stomachache?

356
00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:49.831
My stomachache is fine,

357
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.583
but what's in this IV drip?

358
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.876
It better not be glucose.

359
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.129
It's only made of healthy protein
to increase your muscle mass.

360
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:59.383
And we'd like to refer you
to our Psychiatry Department

361
00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.510
for a counseling session.

362
00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:02.511
How does that sound?

363
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.180
The Psychiatry Department?
Why should I go there?

364
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:09.434
Just consider it an opportunity
to share your worries and thoughts.

365
00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.353
That way, you can be discharged sooner.

366
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:13.855
Fine.

367
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.691
Refer her to Psychiatry,

368
00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.985
and get another reading for her AP CT.

369
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.529
Also contact Surgery to see
if she can get surgery

370
00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.656
if her abdominal pain continues.

371
00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:27.035
Excuse me, could you say that again? AP…

372
00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:29.997
AP CT.

373
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.749
Abdomen and pelvis CT.

374
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.501
Yes.

375
00:21:48.932 --> 00:21:54.646
So can you scare my wife
and make her give up on her residency?

376
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.814
There are many excuses.

377
00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:57.733
Infections, relapses, et cetera.

378
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.653
People may not listen
to those who are close to them,

379
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:04.197
but they tend to listen
to someone who is not as close.

380
00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:08.285
But I'm not sure.

381
00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:10.412
It will be difficult,

382
00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:15.000
but I personally wish
to show support for her choice.

383
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.295
It sounds like she found her spirit.

384
00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:24.176
Are you saying
you'll just stand by and watch

385
00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:26.845
as a patient whom you operated on
endangers her life?

386
00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:28.305
"Stand by and watch"?

387
00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:31.641
I'll check her condition
every now and then.

388
00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:37.314
Yes, in that case,

389
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:38.899
I understand.

390
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.568
I have one more favor to ask.

391
00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.779
I'll be honest,

392
00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:46.865
while my relationship with my son is
known at work,

393
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.534
no one knows about me and her.

394
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.161
And we don't want people to know.

395
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.038
Why not?

396
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.044
<c.bg_transparent><i>"Why not?" You're pissing me off
with every word.</i></c.bg_transparent>

397
00:23:00.962 --> 00:23:05.008
She can easily become a target of hatred
given her circumstances,

398
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.427
so if people find out she's my wife,

399
00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.430
her peers will find her
even more uncomfortable.

400
00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.599
But if people find out she's your wife,

401
00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:14.643
they won't bully her.

402
00:23:15.977 --> 00:23:17.813
She's the one who'll want this the most.

403
00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:22.692
I understand.

404
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.445
It's wonderful to see

405
00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.364
a family of doctors.

406
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.116
Yes, sure.

407
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.076
My father was a surgeon too.

408
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.869
He was a pioneer in the field

409
00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:35.497
who first introduced
laparoscopic surgery in Korea.

410
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.665
I see.

411
00:23:37.874 --> 00:23:40.460
It's not rare to have three generations
of doctors in one family.

412
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:44.714
If I may, what does your father do?

413
00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.342
In Korea,

414
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.303
isn't asking about
someone's dad's job considered

415
00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:52.305
old-fashioned?

416
00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:53.807
Sorry?

417
00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:00.188
I was joking. A joke.

418
00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:03.024
You little…

419
00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.861
My father is
in the real estate business in New York.

420
00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:09.364
He also invests
in promising companies and hotels.

421
00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:15.704
I see.

422
00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:16.830
Yes.

423
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:30.886
PATIENT: OH CHANG-GYU

424
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.607
Hello.

425
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:46.526
I came to brief you
on the exams you'll take today

426
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.069
and have your consent forms signed.

427
00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:51.072
It does make it feel
like my money was well spent,

428
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.200
given that they assigned a professor
to brief me directly.

429
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.410
I'm not a professor.

430
00:24:56.453 --> 00:24:57.913
I'm a first-year resident.

431
00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.539
Then why are you so old?

432
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:00.999
Right.

433
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:04.878
I took a long time off
after graduating from medical school.

434
00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:07.130
What's the point
of hearing a rookie brief me?

435
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.131
Darn it.

436
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:16.973
You're about to receive
a gastroscopy and enteroscopy.

437
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:20.352
If polyps are found
during the examination,

438
00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:24.606
they can progress into cancer,
so we plan on removing those.

439
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:27.692
And right here.
As it is with all procedures,

440
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:31.404
there is a possibility
of bleeding, infection,

441
00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.615
and other complications
during the endoscopy.

442
00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:37.285
Also, if you are allergic
to the anesthetic used,

443
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:41.831
there's a small chance of going
into shock or losing consciousness.

444
00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.626
Mr. Oh, did you fast?

445
00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:50.423
He goes by "Chairman Oh," actually.

446
00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:55.887
Goodness, I apologize for my mistake.

447
00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:59.432
Chairman Oh, have you fasted
since midnight?

448
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:00.558
I have.

449
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:04.104
I UNDERSTAND AND PERMIT
THE ABOVE PROCEDURE

450
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:09.442
So does endoscopy hurt a lot?

451
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:10.860
Usually,

452
00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:12.570
yes.

453
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:15.198
But in your case, mister,
you'll be sedated,

454
00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.992
so you won't feel any pain.

455
00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:19.494
But once you wake up,

456
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:22.831
you may feel some discomfort inside.

457
00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:25.208
-Hey.
-Yes, Chairman Oh?

458
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.545
Nothing.

459
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:30.213
In that case,

460
00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:32.966
I'll escort you
to the endoscopy room in 30 minutes.

461
00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:36.553
Please have a great examination,
Chairman Oh.

462
00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:45.145
Good grief.

463
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:46.896
Is he here?

464
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:50.275
He's so handsome. My gosh.

465
00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:52.819
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

466
00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.529
Look at him. He's so handsome.

467
00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:55.613
Hello.

468
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:10.295
He's really good-looking.

469
00:27:10.378 --> 00:27:11.880
-He's so dreamy!
-He is!

470
00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:12.797
Look at him.

471
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.894
Chief, I'm the advisor.

472
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.146
How could you hire her
without notifying me?

473
00:27:28.229 --> 00:27:31.232
As you know, the law has changed.

474
00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.442
We'll face problems

475
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:35.111
if we do not accept all applicants
if we have an opening.

476
00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.530
I couldn't drag back that kid
who went to the army,

477
00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:40.367
and I couldn't steal applicants
from another hospital.

478
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.370
But still, how can you accept a resident
who'll be 50 soon?

479
00:27:43.953 --> 00:27:44.954
Don't be so harsh.

480
00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:46.581
We're all growing old.

481
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:47.999
We're all…

482
00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:50.627
Chief Lim!

483
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.130
What is it?

484
00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:56.341
Well, there's a problem.

485
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.218
What now?

486
00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.970
Why are we facing so many problems lately?

487
00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:02.639
It's second-year resident,
Dr. Baek I-yeon,

488
00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:04.516
-who went to work with Surgery.
-Yes.

489
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.393
She's pregnant.

490
00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:08.520
Good for her. Wait.

491
00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.439
-And?
-She's quitting.

492
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:13.900
She says the hospital
isn't good for her baby.

493
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.153
Goodness gracious.

494
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:19.697
Everyone is quitting
over the army and babies.

495
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:22.784
We're facing so much trouble from day one.

496
00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:26.704
Chief Lim.

497
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:30.917
CHA JEONG-SUK

498
00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:37.799
She's the replacement
for the second-year who quit.

499
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:41.636
The Family Medicine Department
also said that they are very sorry.

500
00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:43.638
I see.

501
00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:45.473
Well…

502
00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:49.310
We're fine.

503
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.896
-Right?
-Sorry?

504
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:56.443
Yes, right.

505
00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:03.450
But our department can
always use another hand.

506
00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:04.993
I'll keep her under control.

507
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.247
Nice to meet you, Professor.

508
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:10.707
Hello.

509
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.422
Sure.

510
00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:21.301
Then let's go that way.

511
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:45.909
Does that feel all right?

512
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:55.084
-That hurts.
-I haven't touched the wound yet.

513
00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:56.211
Be gentle, will you?

514
00:29:57.086 --> 00:29:58.129
Yes.

515
00:29:58.213 --> 00:30:01.216
Wait, let's begin on the count of three.

516
00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.509
One.

517
00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:04.010
Two.

518
00:30:04.093 --> 00:30:05.220
Three.

519
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.367
Please get

520
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.744
epinephrine and tubes ready,

521
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:32.330
-then page the surgeon on duty.
-Okay.

522
00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:34.707
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

523
00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:43.883
That hurts. What are you doing?

524
00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.593
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

525
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.845
What are you doing?

526
00:30:46.928 --> 00:30:47.971
Can't you tell?

527
00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:49.639
I'm working.

528
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:53.017
How can you do this without telling me?
You came to my department out of--

529
00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:55.395
Even if I talked to you,
you would've stopped me.

530
00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:57.939
Exactly, why did you do such a thing
if you knew that would happen?

531
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.986
I mean, do you have to do this residency?

532
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.363
You can always live a new life

533
00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:08.867
depending on what you make of it
as a faithful housewife.

534
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.368
Einstein said,

535
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:13.246
“The definition of insanity
is doing the same thing over and over

536
00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:15.081
and expecting different results."

537
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.000
Are you calling me insane?

538
00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:19.586
You're so ignorant.

539
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:21.671
Can't you read between the lines?

540
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:25.925
I'm saying I'm making an effort
to build a different future.

541
00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:28.636
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

542
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.683
And what if someone sees us?

543
00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:36.728
Are you okay with everyone finding out
that I'm your wife?

544
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.700
You scared me.

545
00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:55.204
I feel like
I'm seeing things at the hospital.

546
00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:57.624
You should get used to that feeling.

547
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.962
What is this?
You need to eat a balanced meal.

548
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:05.924
Excuse me, you cannot do this here.

549
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.009
We aren't at home.

550
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.969
Yes, Dr. Seo.

551
00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:12.096
May I eat with you?

552
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.264
No.

553
00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:16.976
Ignoring everything else,

554
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.312
what if you collapse at work?

555
00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:21.272
It's wearying even for me.

556
00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:24.525
You may have physical strength,
but I have a strong mentality.

557
00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.819
No matter how determined you are,

558
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.321
your body is at work.

559
00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:31.074
-If you have a weak body--
-Jung-min.

560
00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:32.784
Listen carefully.

561
00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:36.162
I'm stronger
than I've ever been in my life.

562
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:38.581
Don't worry.

563
00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:42.585
Eat up.

564
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.381
The bean sprouts are good.

565
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.096
It's not that I'm opposed to your dream.

566
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.014
I was just worried about you.

567
00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:57.266
<c.bg_transparent><i>You can call me
any time you're in trouble.</i></c.bg_transparent>

568
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.769
MY SON

569
00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.771
Thank you, Jung-min.

570
00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:03.189
I love you!

571
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:14.117
We finally met.

572
00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.160
Goodness, Professor.

573
00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:18.830
Why are you here?

574
00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:21.874
Today was also my first day
at this hospital.

575
00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:28.297
Come to think of it,

576
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:31.843
I need to ask you for a favor.

577
00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.763
The people at the hospital don't know

578
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.349
that they're my son and husband.

579
00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:39.767
I know.

580
00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:43.563
Your husband came
and asked me not to tell.

581
00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:44.981
I see.

582
00:33:46.607 --> 00:33:48.693
You already met my husband.

583
00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:50.111
Yes.

584
00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:51.696
But when are you going to get a divorce?

585
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.618
-Sorry?
-I thought you would leave him

586
00:33:58.244 --> 00:33:59.370
once you have recovered.

587
00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:00.580
Dr. Kim.

588
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:04.250
That was too harsh, even for a joke.

589
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:05.918
Was it really?

590
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:07.795
And getting a divorce isn't that easy.

591
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.465
You aren't married, are you?

592
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.633
-No.
-Why not?

593
00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:15.970
I didn't feel confident.

594
00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.014
I didn't think I could love one

595
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:20.725
and stay devoted to our family.

596
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:22.143
Divorcing takes

597
00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:25.813
a hundred times more courage
compared to getting married.

598
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:28.524
Anyway, you're very patient.

599
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.444
Are all Koreans like that?

600
00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:34.947
You're saying it as
if you aren't Korean yourself.

601
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.449
I'm not Korean.

602
00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:39.911
I'm American.

603
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:45.958
I was

604
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:47.919
adopted as a child.

605
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.759
That's the line
that always gets the ladies.

606
00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:57.595
Almost fell for it, didn't you?

607
00:34:59.013 --> 00:34:59.972
No way!

608
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:04.644
A mother and a woman are
like two completely different species.

609
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.690
Anyway, when you said you were adopted…

610
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:12.819
Were you lying about it or not?

611
00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:13.903
Not telling.

612
00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:17.365
I'm going to leave you hanging
and not tell you.

613
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:22.411
You should go home. Your eyes look tired.

614
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:25.289
Yes.

615
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.625
I'm so tired right now.

616
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:29.460
I could sleep anywhere if I lie down.

617
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.712
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes, I'll be off.

618
00:35:34.423 --> 00:35:36.801
-Goodbye.
-Yes, goodbye.

619
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:55.653
<c.bg_transparent><i>So? How was the first day
as a first-year at your age?</i></c.bg_transparent>

620
00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:56.946
Was it doable?

621
00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:59.073
What do you think?

622
00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:02.326
The day felt like a year.

623
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:05.705
I had completely forgotten

624
00:36:05.788 --> 00:36:11.085
about the weary
and exhausting life of a resident.

625
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.754
I knew you couldn't be stopped,

626
00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.089
so I didn't bother.

627
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:17.175
But it will be really tough.

628
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.343
Don't try to save your face,

629
00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:23.055
-
-Okay.

630
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:24.682
And eat well too.

631
00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.934
Take every healthy food you can
from red ginseng

632
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.644
to any nutritional supplements.

633
00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:31.189
<c.bg_transparent><i>You have to eat everything
until you feel full.</i></c.bg_transparent>

634
00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:34.066
<c.bg_transparent><i>That's how you're
going to survive, got it?</i></c.bg_transparent>

635
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.236
So just take everything
until you feel full.

636
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.362
Okay?

637
00:36:39.488 --> 00:36:40.323
Jeong-suk?

638
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.908
Jeong-suk?

639
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:44.035
Jeong-suk.

640
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:45.536
Cha Jeong-suk.

641
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.829
Are you asleep?

642
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.373
You're doing well. Good.

643
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.750
Good work, Jeong-suk.

644
00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.460
You got this!

645
00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.306
You're late.

646
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:07.016
Yes, Mother.

647
00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:08.809
Let's talk for a moment.

648
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.819
Above all, your health should come first.

649
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.490
And think of In-ho and Jung-min,
who are both working at the hospital.

650
00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.701
It'll be very uncomfortable for them
to see you roaming about there.

651
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:28.621
And I-rang too.
Did you forget that she's in 12th grade?

652
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.042
Look what happened today.

653
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.752
You weren't home when she came,

654
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:37.129
so she took a taxi home
and ate takeout food.

655
00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:38.506
Did you hear me?

656
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.968
Mother, you could help her instead…

657
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.803
Do I have to do chores at my age?

658
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:45.304
I can't do it.

659
00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:47.473
She's your child, so you look after her.

660
00:37:50.184 --> 00:37:51.143
Hey.

661
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.195
-Mom.
-Yes?

662
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.780
Why are you treating Jung-min
and me differently?

663
00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:07.159
-What?
-You didn't neglect Jung-min

664
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.245
when he was in 12th grade
like you're doing now.

665
00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:11.664
In case you've forgotten,
I'm in 12th grade now.

666
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:14.458
Other moms even quit their jobs
to support their kids in 12th grade.

667
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.168
What do you think you're doing?

668
00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:17.920
Do you want me to go to college or not?

669
00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:22.967
So?

670
00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:25.303
You're the one in 12th grade, not me.

671
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:29.390
Why do you take my sacrifice for granted
when you're the one going to college?

672
00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.225
You're going to college for your sake.

673
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.727
Are you doing that for me?

674
00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:37.398
Yes, I once believed that to be true.

675
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.858
But I have changed my mind.

676
00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:41.569
I already did my best
to raise your brother and you,

677
00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:45.364
and I believe it's about time
you made your own way without my help.

678
00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:52.830
I'll always give you

679
00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:55.374
my love and support.

680
00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.336
And I'll do the best I can for you.

681
00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:00.671
-I-rang--
-By "best,"

682
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.506
you just mean doing whatever you want!

683
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.485
My mom won't give me rides anymore.

684
00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:24.737
I have to take a taxi. So annoying.

685
00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:28.991
<c.bg_transparent><i>Me too. That's been my life
ever since I came to Korea.</i></c.bg_transparent>

686
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.076
Eun-seo.

687
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.994
You're home early.

688
00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:33.496
Who are you texting?

689
00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:34.830
A friend from the academy.

690
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:36.874
She's annoyed that her mom is working now.

691
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.335
But my daughter is so considerate.

692
00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:41.670
How was work?

693
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:42.797
Work?

694
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:46.801
It was fine. It's always the same.

695
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.552
That's a relief.

696
00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:50.471
Come out for a snack.

697
00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.556
I got your favorite, carrot cake.

698
00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.814
Way to paint yourself as a caring mother.

699
00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:16.038
Will you please just let it go today?

700
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:19.458
The hospital isn't where privileged wives
come to fulfill their dreams.

701
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:21.043
That's not the case.

702
00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:22.420
First off,

703
00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:24.422
I'm nothing of that sort.

704
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.717
I have always wanted
to become a good doctor.

705
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.803
But after I had Jung-min,

706
00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:33.347
I just chose to be a mother
over being a doctor.

707
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:36.142
And I've lived enough years as a mom.

708
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:37.351
After I fell ill,

709
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:40.563
I realized how noble it was
to work as a doctor.

710
00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:45.443
I finally remembered how desperately
I wanted to become a good doctor.

711
00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:46.861
I really want to do this!

712
00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:49.071
I'm confident enough
to face any hardships.

713
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:51.866
This isn't a job you can do
with confidence alone!

714
00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.576
But why are you adamantly against this?

715
00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:57.705
Is there another reason
why you're stopping me?

716
00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:00.833
Another reason?

717
00:41:02.209 --> 00:41:03.335
What reason?

718
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:04.795
I wouldn't know.

719
00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:07.882
Only you would.

720
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:12.428
Fine.

721
00:41:14.388 --> 00:41:15.723
If you so insist, go ahead.

722
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:19.226
I won't stop you, so do your best.

723
00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.520
-Really?
-Yes.

724
00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:24.064
Do what you want,
since it's your decision.

725
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.484
Just pretend we don't
know each other at work.

726
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:29.945
Don't even dream of whining
or complaining about your tough work.

727
00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:31.363
Do not ask me for help.

728
00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.948
Do not expect to receive

729
00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:35.534
any special treatment
just because I'm there.

730
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:38.913
We will be complete strangers
at the hospital.

731
00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:42.875
I will only treat you
as a rookie resident, do you understand?

732
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:44.502
That's exactly what I want!

733
00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:46.253
Thank you, honey.

734
00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:48.923
Hey, you know…

735
00:41:58.516 --> 00:41:59.350
Never mind.

736
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:04.688
Don't be late tomorrow.

737
00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:07.233
Okay.

738
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.698
At least he said I can do this.

739
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:47.565
Hello, Professor.

740
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:52.653
Well, this sucks.

741
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.762
Honey, can you drop me off?

742
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:20.180
No, I can't.

743
00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:23.100
You can drop me off somewhere far away.

744
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:25.603
People at the hospital can be there too.

745
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.397
You should hurry.

746
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.774
You might end up arriving after me.

747
00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:34.695
Unbelievable.

748
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.206
Here.

749
00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:48.459
Thank you.

750
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.045
Goodbye.

751
00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:09.271
Wait!

752
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:15.944
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

753
00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:21.241
Good morning.

754
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.920
<c.bg_transparent><i>Judging by how she's not surprised,
they must have met already.</i></c.bg_transparent>

755
00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.589
<c.bg_transparent><i>I saw you press the button
to close the door.</i></c.bg_transparent>

756
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.217
Dr. Cha.

757
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.636
-Your check-up is soon, right?
-Yes.

758
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:42.429
Stop by whenever you can.

759
00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:45.140
It's quite convenient to have your doctor

760
00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:46.642
at the same hospital.

761
00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:48.644
You're completely right.

762
00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:51.188
That's how lucky I am.

763
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.817
What's she laughing for?

764
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.829
Have you had breakfast?

765
00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:21.677
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

766
00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:30.644
Professor, I'll brief you on the patient
we were asked to consult on yesterday.

767
00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.312
It's a 53-year-old female patient

768
00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.648
with a history of diabetes
and high blood pressure.

769
00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.358
She had a colonoscopy
as a result of hematochezia

770
00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:38.444
and was diagnosed
with mid to upper-rectal cancer.

771
00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:41.029
A consultation was requested
for her surgical treatment.

772
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:43.365
Is that so? No obstructions?

773
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.451
Nothing unusual was found
in the abdominal images,

774
00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:48.579
and no signs of metastasis
in her abdominal or chest CT scans.

775
00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:50.789
Was an MRI performed? What about the CRM?

776
00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:52.499
Right.

777
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:55.836
I don't think

778
00:45:56.336 --> 00:45:58.547
an abdominal MRI was taken…

779
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:01.675
One second.

780
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:03.969
Well.

781
00:46:04.052 --> 00:46:06.930
An abdominal MRI

782
00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:08.432
was not necessary, it was not taken.

783
00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:10.267
And the CRM…

784
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.644
It's rectal cancer,
so I'm asking for a rectal MRI.

785
00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:14.188
Why would I need an abdominal MRI?

786
00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:17.399
Was no rectal MRI taken?

787
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:23.489
One second.

788
00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:24.865
Well…

789
00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:28.327
Yes, she did get a rectal MRI.

790
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.828
What about the CRM?

791
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:32.581
Right, the CRM.

792
00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:37.920
Her file says it's considered positive.

793
00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:38.921
What's CRM?

794
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.924
-Sorry?
-What does CRM stand for?

795
00:46:43.926 --> 00:46:45.886
CRM is…

796
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:48.680
Circumferential.

797
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.599
Circumferential…

798
00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:52.643
C…

799
00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:58.649
I do not know.

800
00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:04.988
CRM is the resection margin
you must consider during surgery.

801
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.448
So what do we do now?

802
00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.827
Well…

803
00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.332
I'm sorry.

804
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:19.878
How can you decide on a treatment plan
for a patient when you know so little?

805
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:22.256
You can't even pretend
to be a doctor at this rate.

806
00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:40.107
I can't believe you slept
before today's round was ready.

807
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:43.235
You spent a year being an intern.

808
00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:45.362
You still can't tell the difference
between abdominal and rectal MRI?

809
00:47:45.445 --> 00:47:47.239
If you're stupid, at least be diligent!

810
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.367
I'm sorry.

811
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.120
I always tell you
not to do anything to be sorry for.

812
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.705
You.

813
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.626
If you stutter or speak nonsense
before tomorrow's round,

814
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.919
you're dead meat.

815
00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:03.380
-Understood?
-Yes.

816
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.767
Jung-min, look at me.

817
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:17.644
It's okay. You're doing well.

818
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:18.770
-Hey!
-You can do it!

819
00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:20.272
What if someone sees you?

820
00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:25.027
That woman…

821
00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.906
Is she out of her mind?

822
00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:39.374
Why did you do that at work?

823
00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:41.043
I'm sorry.

824
00:48:49.801 --> 00:48:50.844
"That woman"?

825
00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:53.764
I know she was angry,
but that's no way to address someone.

826
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:57.601
I mean, you're a woman too, aren't you?

827
00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.603
Who's going to marry a girl like her?

828
00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:03.732
I'll keep my eyes peeled
and see where she ends up.

829
00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:06.568
You told her to do it?

830
00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:07.903
Are you crazy?

831
00:49:07.986 --> 00:49:10.238
I insisted on sending her
to your department,

832
00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:13.492
but she'll return in three months.
Plus, I'll be her advisor!

833
00:49:13.575 --> 00:49:16.411
-We'll have to make her quit before then.
-How?

834
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:20.040
This is a tough job to bear
both physically and mentally.

835
00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.792
She can't do this for three years.

836
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:24.211
It sounds like you're worried about her.

837
00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:26.129
She's been at home for 20 years.

838
00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:29.925
She's already bad at her job,
so everyone will be hard on her.

839
00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:33.303
It's only a matter of time
before she falls into despair.

840
00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:36.556
Then are you telling me to wait
until she quits?

841
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.269
If you want it to happen sooner,
you can give her a push.

842
00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:42.187
A push?

843
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.897
How?

844
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.108
Do whatever you can in your position

845
00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:47.984
as her advisor.

846
00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:53.031
I can't believe I have to do this.

847
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.078
It's the chief.

848
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:00.789
I have to go.

849
00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.339
A group dinner?

850
00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:11.967
We have a new professor, Dr. Kim,
and new residents.

851
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.093
It's all for teamwork.

852
00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:17.222
Let's drink up the entire stock
in the restaurant.

853
00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:18.724
Can you two make it?

854
00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:19.975
I can.

855
00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:21.059
Good.

856
00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:23.687
I…

857
00:50:30.485 --> 00:50:31.945
Professor Seo, are you okay?

858
00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:33.822
Sorry?

859
00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.074
You don't look too well.

860
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:37.242
I see.

861
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:45.208
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

862
00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:50.213
Why won't you pick up?

863
00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:51.882
Everyone is in the lobby.

864
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.685
-Over here.
-Hello.

865
00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:05.270
Come quickly.

866
00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:09.691
-Come on.
-Drinking requires stamina.

867
00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:13.862
-A thousand?
-Around two thousand after I drink.

868
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.530
-Try it.
-Professor Seo!

869
00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:18.200
Hurry up and join us.

870
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:19.284
Welcome.

871
00:51:19.367 --> 00:51:21.119
Now we're losing our precious time.

872
00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:23.789
Let's head over and drink
in high spirits. Let's go!

873
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:24.706
-Let's go.
-Go!

874
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:37.761
Keep it together.

875
00:51:41.848 --> 00:51:46.353
I thought of making a reservation
at my favorite Italian restaurant,

876
00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:48.396
but I played safe to fit your taste,

877
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:50.148
so Korean cuisine it is.

878
00:51:50.232 --> 00:51:52.234
I enjoy pasta too.

879
00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:56.863
I always eat Korean food,
and I prefer to make it myself.

880
00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:00.951
I didn't know that.
I'll invite you there next time.

881
00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:02.327
Do as you like.

882
00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.121
You seem like such a lady
when you dress up like that.

883
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:07.624
I always had good looks.

884
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:11.586
I don't get botox shots like others,
so I have some wrinkles,

885
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:15.590
but that also adds to my natural beauty.

886
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:25.851
I made gravely misspoke to you
right before Jeong-suk's surgery.

887
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:29.062
I must have hurt

888
00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:32.023
Jeong-suk and you quite deeply.

889
00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:33.567
I thought…

890
00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:38.113
I would never forget
the disappointment I felt

891
00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:40.490
in In-ho or you.

892
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:44.244
But it does make me feel better

893
00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.705
to hear your apology.

894
00:52:46.788 --> 00:52:49.875
Well, anyway.

895
00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:54.170
You do know that Jeong-suk has
returned to work at the hospital, right?

896
00:52:57.215 --> 00:52:59.050
So this is why she called.

897
00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:02.012
The pride of the Surgery Department,

898
00:53:02.095 --> 00:53:05.640
the soju bomb expert, will show us
how to mix the drinks!

899
00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:07.767
-Give it up!
-All right!

900
00:53:13.481 --> 00:53:14.691
Hurry up and come over.

901
00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:22.908
Dr. Jeon has shown impressive growth.

902
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:26.119
-That's so fresh.
-Look at that pure alcohol.

903
00:53:30.665 --> 00:53:31.750
She's a national treasure.

904
00:53:38.006 --> 00:53:40.383
She's quite the drinker.

905
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:47.557
Allow me to make a toast.

906
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:49.851
When I say "soju bombs,"
you say "will be the death of me!"

907
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:54.981
To Professor Kim from Hollywood
and the new residents,

908
00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.066
Soju bombs!

909
00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:58.151
-Will be the death of me!
-Will be the death of me!

910
00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.116
You drink very well.

911
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:10.622
Actually, I was quite the drinker,

912
00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:12.499
but I had held myself back.

913
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:15.794
A drink after work after such a long time

914
00:54:16.378 --> 00:54:18.797
taste so much sweeter and more delicious.

915
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.799
But still, you can't drink a lot.

916
00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:22.175
Of course I know.

917
00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:26.846
But I can feel the alcohol already
from drinking after a rough day.

918
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.098
This is bad.

919
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:31.226
Well, I guess this is why we drink.

920
00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:40.944
I also thought,

921
00:54:41.027 --> 00:54:44.239
"Right, her children are old enough."

922
00:54:44.322 --> 00:54:45.782
"So if she wants to work,

923
00:54:45.865 --> 00:54:49.369
she can work at a small clinic
and get paid for an easy job."

924
00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:51.496
But a residency?

925
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:53.665
How will she live

926
00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:56.543
through three years of hardships
with her fragile body?

927
00:54:57.419 --> 00:55:01.006
I can hardly eat or sleep
with these worries plaguing my mind.

928
00:55:04.676 --> 00:55:06.636
-Ms. Kwak.
-Yes?

929
00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:08.638
You should

930
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.683
try to live honestly.

931
00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:15.687
-What?
-You are very disingenuous.

932
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.940
You aren't worried about my daughter.

933
00:55:19.607 --> 00:55:22.318
She's working at In-ho's hospital,

934
00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:24.779
so you're worried
she might cause him trouble.

935
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:27.449
You're concealing your true feelings
with those words, aren't you?

936
00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.582
Yes, you understand very well.

937
00:55:36.207 --> 00:55:39.711
My son isn't going to be just a professor
at a university hospital.

938
00:55:39.794 --> 00:55:42.756
His recent paper was published in…

939
00:55:43.923 --> 00:55:45.717
What was it called? It was famous.

940
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.926
Nature

941
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.261
Yes,

942
00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:53.391
They chose it as the best paper,
and it became the cover.

943
00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:55.185
In-ho is capable

944
00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:59.522
of becoming the director of the hospital
and rising to much greater power.

945
00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:00.732
So how can his wife

946
00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:03.568
step in and ruin his bright future?

947
00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.196
-Ms. Kwak.
-Yes?

948
00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:07.614
Actually,

949
00:56:08.239 --> 00:56:11.034
my daughter had better grades
than your son did.

950
00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:16.122
If your son cooperated more
in their marriage,

951
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:18.666
the best paper in

952
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.710
wouldn't have been written by your son,

953
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.629
but by my daughter.

954
00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:25.965
So this time,

955
00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:28.468
do not say a word,

956
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.220
do not meddle with her business,

957
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:32.305
and do not do anything.

958
00:56:32.931 --> 00:56:34.057
Do nothing at all.

959
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:42.482
-Excuse me, four more bottles of beer.
-Sure.

960
00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.025
Professor Seo, let me pour one.

961
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:46.444
It's okay. I've had enough.

962
00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:50.198
I don't think I've ever seen you drunk.

963
00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:52.617
My principle is to drink adequately.

964
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.664
My principle is to drink
until there is nothing left.

965
00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.915
How embarrassing of me.

966
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:02.544
If all husbands were half as good as you,

967
00:57:02.627 --> 00:57:04.796
the divorce rate would drop by half.

968
00:57:04.879 --> 00:57:08.967
In that aspect,
you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.

969
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.635
Cut it out.

970
00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:13.513
The Nobel Peace Prize?

971
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:16.724
Yes, when his wife was sick,
he gave her his liver.

972
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.686
No, you tried to. Isn't that right?

973
00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:23.773
Well.

974
00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:25.900
It was an inevitable situation.

975
00:57:26.568 --> 00:57:30.363
I'm so jealous.
Your wife must be very happy.

976
00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:41.332
My stomach hurts.

977
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.256
-What was so funny?
-My stomach.

978
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:52.969
She's a unique one.

979
00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:58.224
I'm sorry.

980
00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:00.685
I haven't had a drink in a while,

981
00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:02.937
so I couldn't contain myself.

982
00:58:03.605 --> 00:58:04.439
I'm sorry.

983
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:07.984
Excuse me!
Two more bottles of beer, please.

984
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:09.736
Okay

985
00:58:10.278 --> 00:58:12.071
Professor Seo, we have lots of beer.

986
00:58:16.242 --> 00:58:17.827
I suddenly want to get drunk.

987
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.296
Jung-min, we need to talk.

988
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.219
Send your mother home now.

989
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.681
Why?

990
00:58:40.558 --> 00:58:41.434
Don't you see it?

991
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:43.478
She's completely wasted!

992
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:45.647
She's sitting there
flirting with the new professor!

993
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:49.526
Then she suddenly broke out in laughter
like she's gone crazy

994
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:51.236
and killed everyone's vibe!

995
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:56.783
Do you still need a reason
even after seeing all that?

996
00:58:58.076 --> 00:59:00.119
She had a liver transplant.

997
00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.580
The residency is taking a toll on her.

998
00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:05.708
What if her liver is ruined again
after drinking like this?

999
00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:07.752
She seems very happy

1000
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.380
since she hasn't been
to places like this in a while.

1001
00:59:13.841 --> 00:59:14.926
She seems tipsy.

1002
00:59:15.009 --> 00:59:16.928
Look after her and prevent any mishaps.

1003
00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:18.304
Okay.

1004
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.889
Please excuse me.

1005
00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:40.868
Jung-min.

1006
00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:44.622
How about a drink?

1007
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:46.291
Have some water.

1008
00:59:46.374 --> 00:59:48.126
Thank you.

1009
00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.795
Drink lots of water

1010
00:59:51.379 --> 00:59:52.964
and please pull yourself together.

1011
00:59:53.047 --> 00:59:54.465
Pull myself together?

1012
00:59:55.008 --> 00:59:55.925
I'm fine.

1013
00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.302
You're drunk.

1014
00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.845
I'm not drunk.

1015
00:59:58.928 --> 00:59:59.929
Stop drinking.

1016
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:00.972
Hey, Jung-min.

1017
01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:02.640
Yes?

1018
01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:03.725
The grill is empty.

1019
01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.436
Come and grill more meat.

1020
01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:10.565
Sure.

1021
01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:13.901
Dr. Jeon.

1022
01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:18.031
If you want more meat,
you can grill it yourself.

1023
01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:21.242
-Why are you asking my--
-Hold on! I got it!

1024
01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:24.370
Let me grill the meat. It's fine.

1025
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.331
I'll grill the meat.

1026
01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:28.833
It's okay. I'm good at grilling.

1027
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.337
Excuse me!

1028
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.089
We'll take four more servings
of pork belly.

1029
01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:42.263
Dr. Cha, were you a housewife
while you weren't working?

1030
01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.140
Yes.

1031
01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:45.725
Your family must be well-off.

1032
01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:48.269
What does your husband do?

1033
01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.480
My husband?

1034
01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.106
Your husband.

1035
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.621
He's dead.

1036
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.592
-Ow!
-Jung-min!

1037
01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.696
DOCTOR CHA

1038
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.093
My husband? He's dead.

1039
01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:04.846
He's been dead for a long time.

1040
01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:06.514
She must be out of her mind.

1041
01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:07.765
Honey.

1042
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.184
<c.bg_transparent><i>You shamelessly lied
that your husband is dead,</i></c.bg_transparent>

1043
01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.519
yet you want a favor?

1044
01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.564
<c.bg_transparent><i>I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.</i></c.bg_transparent>

1045
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:17.150
Honey, did you buy a bracelet?

1046
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.944
<c.bg_transparent><i>Just because I don't
make an issue out of our past</i></c.bg_transparent>

1047
01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:21.654
doesn't mean we can be friends.
