ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

BEAUTIFUL DERMATOLOGY

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.245
Hello.

5
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.247
Hello.

6
00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.670
BEAUTIFUL DERMATOLOGY
DIRECTOR

7
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.800
What are you doing?

8
00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.304
-Good morning.
-At this rate, you might put it on me.

9
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.557
Coats these days look so refined.

10
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.559
-What color is this?
-Give that to me. I'll wear it myself.

11
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.895
Goodness, I'll put it on for you.

12
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.563
Gosh, jeez.

13
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.150
Filming finished late,
so I barely made it here on time.

14
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.735
Gosh, you're so cool.

15
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.988
You go to broadcasting stations
and get filmed.

16
00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.365
Why are you all dressed up?

17
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.909
Are you going on a blind date
or something?

18
00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:00.662
I use days like this
as an excuse to dress up.

19
00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.163
How do you like it? It's brand new.

20
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.125
Regardless, the face is
what completes a look.

21
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.085
What happened to your face?

22
00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.172
What do you mean?
I really worked hard on my makeup today.

23
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.590
Let's go. Let's drink coffee.

24
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.592
Jeez, that cold-hearted woman.

25
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.803
I look pretty.

26
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.181
Gosh.

27
00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:24.227
My friend, I keep telling you to come
to get treatments before it gets worse.

28
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.395
Why won't you listen?

29
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.856
It doesn't look good
to get free treatments for being a friend.

30
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.150
Then you can just pay for it.

31
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.652
Your mother-in-law is over 70,

32
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.238
and she comes here
more often than to the grocery store.

33
00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.200
Hey, my mother-in-law
has always lived that kind of lifestyle.

34
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.786
Hey, do I look that awful?

35
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.997
Yes. Are you not eating well?

36
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.875
I mean, your face seems yellowish.

37
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.752
-What?
-And your eyes look a little jaundiced.

38
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.004
What?

39
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.841
I'm just tired.

40
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.968
I haven't been feeling well
the past few days.

41
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.094
Jeez.

42
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.140
Hey, that's that.
Do you have any good news these days?

43
00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.392
-What good news?
-You have everything

44
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:05.518
but marriage.

45
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.271
Marriage, my foot. That's so ridiculous.

46
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.357
-Stop trying to be funny.
-You'll be a virgin forever at this rate.

47
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.695
Honestly, on that subject,
aren't you purer than me?

48
00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:16.905
It's been over ten years

49
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.949
since you and your husband
started sleeping in separate rooms.

50
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.744
Doesn't that practically make you
a born-again virgin?

51
00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:24.621
You little…

52
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.832
Listen, the love between a married couple

53
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.336
isn't always maintained
through physical aspects.

54
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.671
It's a world of complexities
and subtleties

55
00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.049
that a spinster like you
wouldn't know about.

56
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.051
Fine, you can spend the rest of your life

57
00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.512
having your heart flutter
at even the sight of your husband.

58
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.098
You'll be like that little girl Candy
from that romantic series.

59
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.395
Hey, let's tackle those freckles first.

60
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.442
You're such a mess.
It's hard to know where to start.

61
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.072
Let's go, Ms. Cha Candy.

62
00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.240
Come on.

63
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.867
Most people throw a fit
because they couldn't become a doctor,

64
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.787
so why did you choose
to become a full-time housewife?

65
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.456
Don't you think it's a waste
of your medical license? I'm done.

66
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.003
I don't think it's a waste at all.

67
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.840
While you were diligently looking after
your patients and starting this clinic,

68
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.093
do you think I was just relaxing at home?

69
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.680
I gave birth to two kids and raised them
into proper human beings.

70
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.849
You've worked hard to study medicine

71
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.185
and used it to work
to create a great life for yourself.

72
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.938
But isn't raising
two human beings like I did

73
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:35.441
future-oriented and a contribution
to the development of this country?

74
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.819
Candy's leaving.

75
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:38.736
Hey, are you mad?

76
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:43.074
-I'm fine.
-You are mad. Jeong-suk…

Goodness. Young man, are you okay?

85
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.927
Try to breathe. Someone help!

86
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.930
Someone help! Is there a doctor here?

87
00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:49.807
Are there no doctors here?

88
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.809
There's no doctor?

89
00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.396
I'm a doctor…

90
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.066
Here! This person said she's a doctor!

91
00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:59.817
There's a doctor!

92
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.360
-Save him.
-No.

93
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.154
What I meant was…

94
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.281
Gosh.

95
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.250
Give me this. Lift your head.

96
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.674
Sir, hang in there.

97
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:37.814
Intubation.

98
00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.530
Call 911!

99
00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.950
Come on, wake up, sir!

100
00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:50.910
We need an ambulance!

101
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.204
Driver, stop!

102
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.379
We're going to transfer him
to a nearby hospital.

103
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.421
You may not be his guardian,

104
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.590
but we heard you're a doctor.
Could you come with us?

105
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.969
Isn't that lady a little weird?

106
00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:10.263
Right? She said she was a doctor,

107
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.890
but did you see her hands tremble
in front of the guy?

108
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.642
We have to get going quickly.

109
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:16.310
Yes, I'll go.

SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DOCTOR ROY KIM

111
00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:30.074
I'm a surgeon. I'll go with you too.

112
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.084
The LMA won't go in
because of his swollen airway.

113
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.252
What should we do?

114
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:43.337
Please help me. What should we do?

115
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:45.256
Doctor.

116
00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.382
Step aside.

117
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:48.926
Sir.

118
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.139
He has a pulse.
We need to do a tracheotomy.

119
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.140
Okay.

120
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.104
Please give me an antiseptic.

121
00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:11.991
Bag, please.

122
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.464
Sir, are you awake?

123
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.258
If you can hear my voice,
please move your hand.

124
00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.185
My goodness, Doctor! It worked!

125
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.274
God, thank you so much!
You did so great, Doctor!

126
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:49.237
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

127
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.447
Excuse me,
but what line of work are you in?

128
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:52.907
Sorry?

129
00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.867
I heard you said you were a doctor.

130
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.162
Yes.

131
00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.288
You shouldn't do that.

132
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:02.959
It's illegal for non-medical personnel
to practice medicine.

133
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:03.876
Well,

134
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.879
I know you may not believe this,

135
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.258
but I am a doctor.

136
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.136
The thing is,
I haven't practiced for over 20 years,

137
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.432
so my mind went blank
when I came upon that situation.

138
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.643
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:25.231
Today is such a great day

140
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.568
since that patient met you.

141
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.029
You were really impressive.

142
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.617
Then I'll get going first.

143
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.213
What's the topic
for this week's conference?

144
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.549
It's robotic surgery
for low rectal cancer.

145
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.595
Professor, what should we do
for the patient, Na Tae-gyeong?

146
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:56.679
Monitor the Hemovac

147
00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.848
and ask the psychiatric department
about his depression.

148
00:09:58.931 --> 00:09:59.890
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.729
Professor, for tomorrow's conference,

150
00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.856
should the first case be Jeon Sang-hyeok?

151
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.109
No, put Kim Jae-hui's surgery
as the first case.

152
00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.527
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.328
-You can go first.
-Okay.

154
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.928
I get shocked every time I see Jung-min

155
00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.931
because he looks so much like you
when you were young.

156
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.059
I think I looked better, no?

157
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.603
I think we should be more discreet.

158
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:48.064
It'll be bad if your son finds out,
don't you think?

159
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.776
-Should we have dinner together?
-I can't. I have plans.

160
00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:55.279
-What kind of plans?
-Why? Do you think it's a date with a man?

161
00:10:56.864 --> 00:11:00.368
-I'm not going to tell you.
-Fine.

162
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.828
I'll go now.

163
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.385
ALARM, GANGNAM SEMINAR
7:00 P.M.

164
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:33.651
Come on, wake up, sir!

165
00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:34.735
We need an ambulance!

166
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.488
Excuse me,
but what line of work are you in?

167
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.950
-Sorry?
-I heard you said you were a doctor.

168
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.327
-Yes.
-You shouldn't do that.

169
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:46.831
It's illegal for non-medical personnel
to practice medicine.

170
00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:54.004
Mother, are you getting back
from exercising?

171
00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:56.841
-Yes. You must have just gotten back too.
-Yes.

172
00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:00.010
-Will you make me a glass of detox juice?
-Sure.

173
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.721
I made some earlier and put it
in the fridge. I'll get you a glass.

174
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:06.725
Jeez, the key to juice is its freshness.
You have to make it fresh on the spot.

175
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:07.726
I'm sorry, Mother.

176
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.187
I made it in advance
because I had to go out today.

177
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.148
Could you drink it just for today?

178
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.024
-By the way, Mother.
-What?

179
00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.610
Thank you for lending me
your clothes and bag today.

180
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.529
-I'll dry-clean the clothes.
-Sure.

181
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:21.115
I have dinner plans tonight,
so don't worry about making dinner for me.

182
00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:22.408
Okay.

183
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.416
Is Director Baek doing well?

184
00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.459
Very well.

185
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.961
-Mother, she treated my freckles today.
-That's good.

186
00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:37.590
The new clinic is two times bigger
than the last one,

187
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.176
and the interior
was designed incredibly well.

188
00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:44.889
So were you incredibly jealous?

189
00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:47.641
Of course, I was jealous.
She even appears on TV.

190
00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.684
She's so impressive.

191
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.020
Even if a woman is skilled
and attains fame and prestige,

192
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.772
it means nothing
if she doesn't have a healthy family.

193
00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.733
Dr. Baek goes on a vacation
abroad every season, right?

194
00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:59.195
But how can you call that a vacation?
She has no husband and no kids.

195
00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:03.365
She rides on planes and wanders around
the world because she's empty inside.

196
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.577
To put it nicely,
she's a successful career woman,

197
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.412
but just wait ten years.

198
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.039
She'll look sad and pitiful.

199
00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:13.417
You're a hundred times better off.
You have a son and a daughter.

200
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.419
Why are you jealous of her? Goodness.

201
00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.431
Rice cooking will now begin.

202
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:59.213
-Mom.
-Welcome home.

203
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.006
You must be tired.

204
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.093
You didn't even send the fees
for my art academy?

205
00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:06.011
-Right.
-The teacher was pressuring me for them.

206
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.846
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

207
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.432
I forgot because
I was all out of sorts today.

208
00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:13.852
-Tomorrow's the competition, right?
-Yes.

209
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:16.313
If I win an award this time,

210
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.148
I can apply for Hanguk
and Hongin University.

211
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.025
Goodness, really?

212
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:21.652
I'm home.

213
00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:23.445
You're home late.

214
00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:26.240
Yes, Father.

215
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.785
Welcome home.
Jung-min, hurry up and come here.

216
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:30.953
Okay.

217
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.500
I-rang, when is your next mock exam?

218
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.253
It's next Tuesday.

219
00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.171
To get into a med school,

220
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.173
you need to be at least
in the top 500 in Korea.

221
00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.593
-Okay.
-Gosh.

222
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:49.305
Mom, you're doing this all by yourself?
You're going to work yourself sick.

223
00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.848
It's okay. I can get it done.

224
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:53.601
You should've taken off the doors
during the day.

225
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.144
I couldn't sleep because of the drilling.

226
00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.271
Sorry. I'll finish it up today.

227
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:58.689
This looks good.

228
00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:01.191
Let's eat.

229
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.444
Jung-min.

230
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.573
Yes, Father.

231
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:09.533
Doctors have to deal with people.

232
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.329
I know being an intern is hard,
but always maintain a neat look.

233
00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.580
That's part of being professional.

234
00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.249
Okay.

235
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.543
Have you decided on your specialty?

236
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.964
Yes, it's surgery, of course.

237
00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:33.223
You still have a lot of time.
Think it over before you decide.

238
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:37.144
No, that way of talking
just makes the kids soft.

239
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.607
People can be a little soft,
and they can be strong too.

240
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.526
They can't all be the same. Eat up.

241
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.196
Only other people's kids can be soft.

242
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:50.574
They say that you should treat
your kids like you would treat others.

243
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.410
-Why is the soup like this?
-What?

244
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:00.501
Why does it taste like this? Oh, no.

245
00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:03.671
I forgot to put any salt in it.

246
00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:06.632
I'll hurry up and season it. Sorry.

247
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.635
Where has your mind wandered off to?
Are you already getting old?

248
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:13.931
I guess I am.

249
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.811
Did you change the coffee beans?
The taste was weird.

250
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.771
Why? I thought it was good.

251
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:26.026
I mean, there's a thing called preference.
Not everything can be nice and tasty.

252
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:42.459
Okay, I'll buy a whole bunch
of the coffee beans you like.

253
00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:03.022
Assemblyman, please get home safely.

254
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.733
Would you like to go in now?

255
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.031
It's very strange, isn't it?

256
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.199
Though the times have changed,

257
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:18.287
women with a lot of talent and abilities
strangely have no luck with men.

258
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.955
Is that what I'm like?

259
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.081
If you were born a man,

260
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:24.334
your talent would have been great enough
to take you to the very top.

261
00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:28.422
But unfortunately, you were born a woman.

262
00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:33.635
I'm sorry, but you have
the fortune of a mistress.

263
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.891
Marriage has no meaning
for people with this kind of fate.

264
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.770
It's a shame this fate never lets you go.

265
00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:44.646
I see.

266
00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:48.067
Do you really have
to live with that person?

267
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.737
I want to show them, you see.

268
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.824
People may say it's such a waste for me
to cling to a married man.

269
00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.537
But being this foolish and immature
is what makes us human, is it not?

270
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.540
Since you've waited this long,

271
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:07.377
let's wait a bit more.

272
00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.173
A single opportunity may come.

273
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:14.843
And it will come soon.

274
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:21.767
I know you don't wear sunglasses
because they bother you.

275
00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:25.729
But the sun is really strong in Europe,
so you have to wear them.

276
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.191
-Okay?
-Okay.

277
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.110
But these are so old.

278
00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.195
You need a new pair.

279
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.826
-Honey.
-What is it?

280
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.036
How about sleeping…

281
00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.747
in the main bedroom from now on?

282
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:52.256
You slept in this room
when you'd come home late after surgery,

283
00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.300
but that just turned into us
sleeping in separate rooms.

284
00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:01.181
It's not like we don't have needs.

285
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:05.269
So sleeping in separate rooms
when we're still young doesn't seem right.

286
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:16.196
Jeez, that's a bit too out of the blue.

287
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.658
Is it?

288
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:21.201
This is too abrupt.

289
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:31.253
Right, I got my freckles treated today.
At Mi-hee's clinic.

290
00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.006
-My face is still red, right? Look.
-It's really red.

291
00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:42.973
I feel so lethargic these days.

292
00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:45.601
It feels like chronic fatigue.

293
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.561
Then lay down for a bit.

294
00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.648
Even a dog would laugh
if it heard someone as lucky as you

295
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.108
say they have chronic fatigue.

296
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.401
It's menopause. Start working out.

297
00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:59.031
Would it kill you to speak nicely to me?

298
00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:00.866
I'm just telling you the facts.

299
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.915
I don't care
whether you wear sunglasses or not.

300
00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:09.958
They're your eyes, not mine.

301
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.613
This style is very popular this season.

302
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:06.074
I'm looking for a pair for my husband.

303
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.493
I see. In that case,
please wait one moment.

304
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.622
What do you think of these?

305
00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:16.626
Middle-aged men
prefer this kind of style a lot.

306
00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:20.797
-They're nice. I'll take these.
-Okay.

307
00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:34.978
Here you go.

308
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.774
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you okay?

309
00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:41.193
You don't look well.

310
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.199
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

311
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:07.219
Ma'am! Are you all right?

312
00:23:07.302 --> 00:23:09.596
Hurry up and call 911!

313
00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.431
Ma'am, are you all right?

314
00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.313
-Try these on.
-What?

315
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:24.402
-They look good. Look in the mirror.
-I already know what they look like.

316
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.988
-You look like a singer.
-I do.

317
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.449
-I'll buy these for you.
-No need. Forget it.

318
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.618
Just say yes before I change my mind.

319
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.663
Honestly. I said it's fine.

320
00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:37.833
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

321
00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:41.670
I'll go pay for these.

322
00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:42.838
Okay.

323
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:50.220
-Hello?
-

324
00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:52.430
What do you think? Waiting for my flight.

325
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.683
Honey, guess where I am right now.

326
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.477
-What?
-I'm in the emergency room.

327
00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.104
Why?

328
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:00.981
I fainted in the department store.

329
00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:02.149
Who did?

330
00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:03.984
What do you mean "who"?

331
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:06.153
Me. Your wife.

332
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:10.323
-Why did you suddenly faint?
-I don't know.

333
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:14.828
<c.bg_transparent><i>I fainted, and when I woke up,
I was in the emergency room.</i></c.bg_transparent>

334
00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:18.748
The resident here says
my eyes look jaundiced,

335
00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:20.542
so they're running a liver panel.

336
00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:22.711
They just took my blood.

337
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.463
-They told me to contact a guardian.
-One moment.

338
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.176
Jung-min is probably preoccupied
with his internship,

339
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.970
your mother went to a class reunion today,

340
00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:33.346
and you're at the airport.

341
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:34.890
What should I do?

342
00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.309
How do you feel?

343
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:41.146
I feel a little better after resting.

344
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.859
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

345
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.575
The test results aren't even back yet,
so you don't have to do that.

346
00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:54.993
We'll wait for the results,

347
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.746
and my mother or your mother can come.

348
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.791
Sure, okay.

349
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:05.629
-Let me know when the results are out.
-

350
00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:09.674
It looks like I'm just making you worry
when you're going so far away.

351
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:11.760
No, it's fine.

352
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:13.595
Get some rest.

353
00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:35.909
Ma'am, I'm going
to take your blood one more time.

354
00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:40.330
-Why?
-Your levels are abnormally high.

355
00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:47.587
What's up?

356
00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:51.633
-Who is it?
-Her name is Cha Jeong-suk.

357
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:57.180
What is this? The results are the same.

358
00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:59.975
The GOT and GPT levels
both came out to over 3,000.

359
00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:02.894
Jeez, it wasn't an issue with the sample.

360
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.522
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

361
00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:06.523
Hello.

362
00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:09.025
Normal liver panel levels
come out to under 40,

363
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:11.319
but right now yours
are coming out as over 3,000.

364
00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:15.282
Does that mean it's acute hepatitis?

365
00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:16.283
You're well aware.

366
00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:20.036
Do I need to be admitted?

367
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.080
Yes. Have you called your guardian?

368
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:23.623
Do I…

369
00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:26.334
really need a guardian to come?

370
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.295
SEHWA WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
'70 FRESHMEN REUNION

371
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:30.130
Goodness, walking on eggshells?

372
00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:33.842
I'm the matriarch of the family.
They should walk on eggshells around me.

373
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:39.556
My daughter-in-law still prepares
a lavish meal for me every morning.

374
00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:42.684
Your daughter-in-law deserves an award
for that kind of filial love.

375
00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:45.270
No daughter-in-law
is like that these days.

376
00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:48.398
Smart girls know how to manage a family
when they put their minds to it.

377
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:52.360
Maybe it's because she went to
medical school, but she's really clever.

378
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.988
She's great with the kids' education
and managing the house.

379
00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:57.574
She didn't use a tutor
and taught her kids herself.

380
00:26:57.657 --> 00:27:00.160
And the oldest went to medical school.

381
00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:04.873
Isn't it a waste that such a capable woman
only does housework?

382
00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:08.626
Only a struggling household would make
their doctor daughter-in-law work.

383
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.254
Being as well-off as we are,
why send her to work?

384
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:13.006
When she'd only earn a small amount?

385
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:18.636
It looks like you've saved more money
by not sending her off to work.

386
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.264
Most families spend hundreds of millions

387
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:23.683
to send their kids to med school.

388
00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:30.273
Hello?

389
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.150
Hello?

390
00:27:33.234 --> 00:27:34.527
It's such a relief

391
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.613
to not be that pretentious woman's in-law.

392
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:38.865
It's the daughter-in-law I feel bad for.

393
00:27:38.948 --> 00:27:40.492
If I were her daughter-in-law,

394
00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:43.661
I would have probably already come down
with a serious illness.

395
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:46.039
Emergency room?

396
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:50.377
I have a spa reservation later too.

397
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:53.088
Is it something serious?

398
00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.058
MOM

399
00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:10.897
Please give me some salt too.

400
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.898
Mom?

401
00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:13.191
Is everything okay?

402
00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:15.193
Yes. Where are you?

403
00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:16.736
I'm at the mill.

404
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.988
I was going to make
rice cakes with mugwort.

405
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.782
You like mugwort rice cakes.

406
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:24.911
Jeez, why make rice cakes?
You can just buy them.

407
00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:26.413
Handmade ones are much better.

408
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.792
The rice cakes in stores have spinach
mixed in to make them seem green.

409
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.294
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

410
00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:37.424
But why does your voice sound so down
when you said you've already eaten?

411
00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:40.510
Mom, then I guess you're off today.

412
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.220
I'm off until tomorrow.

413
00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:44.639
Why? Is something wrong?

414
00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:53.523
If you're that worried,
then just go to the hospital.

415
00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:54.858
What?

416
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.360
It's fine. It's not like she's a kid.

417
00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.446
But you feel uneasy.

418
00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:03.616
I have a sense of decency, you know.
How could I just leave you here and go?

419
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:09.748
But what if it's serious?

420
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.041
Wouldn't it make you
feel better to just go?

421
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:14.335
What? No, don't worry about it.

422
00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.338
But you are worrying about it.

423
00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:20.341
Well, it's hard not to worry
when someone fainted.

424
00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:24.971
But it's probably not a big deal,
so let's stop talking about this.

425
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.224
What is this?

426
00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:32.854
I was going to give it to you
on the plane later at night,

427
00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.607
but you can just open it.

428
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.366
I'll help you put it on.

429
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:58.880
Okay, let's be on our way.

430
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.050
Doctor, this patient says

431
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:05.470
-their neck hurts a lot, but I said…
-Yes.

432
00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:06.679
Tell them they can go home.

433
00:30:06.763 --> 00:30:08.473
Okay, thank you.

434
00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:09.641
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

435
00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:15.313
Yes?

436
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.900
A TA patient came in.
Can you please check her status?

437
00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:19.818
Okay.

438
00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:24.489
INTERN CHA JEONG-SUK

439
00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:33.248
Hello.

440
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.624
Hello.

441
00:30:34.707 --> 00:30:35.875
Are you feeling okay?

442
00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:37.585
No, my leg hurts so much.

443
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.922
If you get treated and take medication,
you'll get better in no time.

444
00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:42.757
Thank you.

445
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:45.385
<c.bg_transparent><i>If you need anything else,
please let me know.</i></c.bg_transparent>

446
00:30:45.468 --> 00:30:46.302
Okay.

447
00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:50.557
Gosh.

448
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:53.601
I'm hungry.

449
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:54.811
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

450
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.564
Your IV drip is done.
I'll take it out for you.

451
00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:58.481
Thank you.

452
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:00.900
Excuse me, where is the convenience store?

453
00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:03.069
-It is on the fifth floor.
-Okay.

454
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.210
Why is the convenience store
on the fifth floor?

455
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:20.920
I'm hungry.

456
00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:27.260
-Does it hurt?
-Yes, it hurts.

457
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.474
It'll be over soon.

458
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.559
Be more gentle.

459
00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:38.146
-It hurts, gosh.
-Hold on just a little longer.

460
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.650
Excuse me!

461
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.944
You shouldn't do that here.
She's a minor at that!

462
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.035
Oh, my.

463
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.664
Thank you!

464
00:31:58.791 --> 00:32:00.084
You're handsome!

465
00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:02.837
She was riding a motorcycle
with older kids in the neighborhood

466
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.422
and got into an accident.

467
00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:05.798
She tried to leave,
saying she had no money,

468
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:07.342
but I insisted on treating her.

469
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.303
What did you think I was doing?

470
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:13.389
I misunderstood the situation…

471
00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:15.516
I'm really sorry.

472
00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:21.272
I guess you can't just walk by
a patient in need.

473
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:24.233
It was like that time
when you got into the ambulance

474
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:25.360
and today too.

475
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:28.446
You see, I'm a decent doctor.

476
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.448
But anyway,

477
00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:33.952
we don't know each other well enough
to say that it's nice to see you again.

478
00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.411
What brings you to this hospital?

479
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:40.208
I was brought into the emergency room

480
00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:42.794
after fainting at a department store.

481
00:32:43.503 --> 00:32:45.463
Are you okay now?

482
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:47.799
I'm sure I'll be okay.

483
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:50.635
All right, I have to see outpatients now.

484
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:52.053
I wish you good luck.

485
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:54.180
Yes, Doctor. Goodbye.

486
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.650
We run into each other often.

487
00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:07.735
I guess so.

488
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.697
I didn't realize
we'd meet again like this…

489
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.283
We can talk about
this special connection next time.

490
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:15.994
Is your guardian here?

491
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:19.122
The thing is, my husband is just so busy…

492
00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:21.332
He should come no matter how busy he is.

493
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:22.834
The situation isn't good right now.

494
00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:25.670
Is it really bad?

495
00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.505
I know you got out of med school long ago,

496
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:30.883
but you must know how serious it is
when liver panel results are 3,600, right?

497
00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:34.012
Your jaundice level is really high too.

498
00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:35.847
If this leads to liver failure,

499
00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:37.890
then there's no going back.

500
00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.144
Call your guardian immediately.

501
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:44.981
NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK

502
00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.616
Gosh, what in the world?

503
00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.161
What happened?

504
00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.204
Mom.

505
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:06.627
I just have to stay at the hospital
for a couple of days and rest.

506
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:08.087
You don't have to worry.

507
00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.631
But you have to be admitted,
no matter what?

508
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:13.801
Yes, they need to confirm
that my liver panel results

509
00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.219
and jaundice levels decrease.

510
00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:19.891
I see. You're a doctor,
so do what you think is best.

511
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.518
I'm not a doctor.

512
00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:26.606
Mom, if I haven't practiced
in over 20 years, then I'm not a doctor.

513
00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:28.941
It's like having a driver's license
you never use.

514
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:33.154
Hey, if a baker can't sell any bread,
does that mean he's not a baker?

515
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.990
How is that the same thing?

516
00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:40.495
But your husband is a doctor
at a university hospital.

517
00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:41.871
Why are you staying here?

518
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:45.541
He went to a conference in Europe today.

519
00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:46.626
Jung-min is an intern.

520
00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.253
If I ask him to make time for me,
it'll put him in a tight spot.

521
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.631
If I stay at the hospital,

522
00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.675
I won't be able to go home
for a couple of days.

523
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.968
What should I do?

524
00:34:56.052 --> 00:35:00.890
They need me there
since it'll be I-rang's midterms soon,

525
00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:03.935
and Jung-min needs to prepare
for his resident exam.

526
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:08.439
This is bad. There's no one
to prepare food for the kids.

527
00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:09.941
They aren't babies.

528
00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:13.319
Studying is up to them,
and they can feed themselves.

529
00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:17.115
Ever since you were a third grader,
you made your own food and studied alone

530
00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:19.575
and still managed to get good grades.

531
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:22.286
Gosh, Mom. That was ages ago.

532
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.747
The times are different, Mom.

533
00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:29.961
By the way,

534
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:33.089
where did you get
that medicine you gave me?

535
00:35:33.172 --> 00:35:34.757
From the medicine shop at the market--

536
00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.300
Why?

537
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.052
Was that the issue?

538
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.054
Yes, it seems like it.

539
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.473
Sometimes if you eat something
that doesn't sit well with you,

540
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:43.850
it can result in acute hepatitis.

541
00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:47.353
These terrible hacks.

542
00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:50.106
How dare they mess around
with something like that?

543
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:52.150
I should've taken you
to a proper Korean medical clinic

544
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:53.901
to have the medicine made for you.

545
00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:56.612
I just trusted that medicine shop
because I heard they were good.

546
00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:59.157
I must've lost my mind.

547
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.492
Don't blame yourself.

548
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.536
I'll be back on my feet in a few days.

549
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:06.873
Don't go there
and take out your anger on them.

550
00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:11.460
-You're really going to get better, right?
-Gosh, of course.

551
00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:13.004
It's not a big deal.

552
00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:23.723
It's okay, Ms. Oh.

553
00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:33.482
1 DAY LATER

554
00:36:33.566 --> 00:36:35.234
SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

555
00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:38.863
30 DAYS LATER

556
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.286
Hello.

557
00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.038
-Please sit over here.
-Sit here.

558
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:47.955
Okay.

559
00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:57.340
The donor compatibility results
for a liver transplant came out.

560
00:36:57.924 --> 00:37:01.886
Your son's blood type doesn't match,
your daughter is still a minor,

561
00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:04.263
and your mother
and mother-in-law are elderly.

562
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:07.099
But thankfully, the results
of your husband's test look good.

563
00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:10.686
He has taken great care of his body,
so he doesn't have a fatty liver.

564
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.814
Goodness. Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.360
The most important thing
is your husband's consent as the donor.

566
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:20.821
Are you saying my son
has to give his liver to her?

567
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:24.867
I'm not saying that he must.
I'm just saying that it is possible.

568
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:25.993
That can't happen.

569
00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.663
Cutting open a perfectly healthy person
to give away part of his liver?

570
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:31.082
He can't take the risk
of going under the knife.

571
00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:33.334
Please don't recommend
that surgery to my son.

572
00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.378
-I'll never allow it.
-Mother.

573
00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:37.588
Please stop.

574
00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:38.923
Stop what?

575
00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:42.885
Even if you say yes, I'm against it.

576
00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:44.512
Get out of the way.

577
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.103
Jeong-suk, it's not like
you're on the brink of death,

578
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:55.314
so let's just wait
for a brain-dead donor, okay?

579
00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.693
Gosh, my head. I'm so dizzy.

580
00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.528
-Grandma.
-Mother!

581
00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.406
-Mother, are you all right?
-Why do I feel like this?

582
00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:05.574
Come this way.

583
00:38:05.658 --> 00:38:07.952
-Why do I feel like this?
-Here, sit here.

584
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:09.829
-Careful.
-What's wrong with me?

585
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:12.873
-Look at me, Mother.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

586
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.875
Can you see me? Are you going to throw up?

587
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.379
Are you okay?
How sick do you feel, Mother?

588
00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.422
No, wait.

589
00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:21.215
-Hold on.
-My gosh.

590
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.718
You don't have a fever.
Mother, look at me.

591
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:34.895
Ms. Kwak. Are you awake?

592
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.147
Please open your eyes.

593
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.443
Just keep your eyes closed then.

594
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:42.611
Of course, I understand
how a mother would feel

595
00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:45.781
at the thought of their perfectly
healthy child going under the knife.

596
00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:49.160
But no matter how bad you felt,

597
00:38:49.243 --> 00:38:52.455
you shouldn't have said those things
in front of a person that's sick.

598
00:38:52.538 --> 00:38:54.373
If it was In-ho that was sick,

599
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.917
my daughter would've given him
all her organs.

600
00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:00.421
Ms. Oh! Talking in hypotheticals is wrong.

601
00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.214
Right now, the healthy person

602
00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:05.843
that has to give up their liver is my son,
not that daughter of yours.

603
00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:08.012
The word "if" doesn't fit this situation.

604
00:39:08.095 --> 00:39:11.474
Did you just say "that daughter of yours"?

605
00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:14.060
When things were good,
she was your daughter-in-law,

606
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.936
but now she's "that daughter of yours"?

607
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.105
Don't change the subject like that.

608
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:21.192
To be honest, aren't you
the person to blame for all this?

609
00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:23.027
It's all because of that cheap medicine!

610
00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:26.989
And while we're on the topic,
Jung-min got into that car accident

611
00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:30.076
while you were watching him
when he was seven.

612
00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:34.080
This whole time, you've been going on
about how Jeong-suk quit her practice.

613
00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:36.624
But don't feel upset
about her giving up her practice.

614
00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.167
Frankly speaking,

615
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.253
it's that accident that made her
a full-time housewife.

616
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.090
Gosh, I'm so furious.

617
00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:46.884
My goodness.

618
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.412
You were more injured
than Jung-min was back then.

619
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:17.540
You still have that herniated disc
in your back from that accident.

620
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:21.544
How could she talk
about that accident like that?

621
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:28.300
I don't care whether your mother-in-law
thinks like that or not.

622
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:33.514
Rather than that,
I feel like In-ho is just so cold-hearted.

623
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:38.436
It always made me uncomfortable
that my son-in-law was so cold and fussy.

624
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:41.522
But given his upbringing,
I just accepted it.

625
00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:45.192
But when his own mother
talked like that in front of the kids,

626
00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.111
he barely did anything to stop her.

627
00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:50.823
His wife is in this condition,
and even if it was just empty words,

628
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.702
he didn't even say
he'd go through with the surgery.

629
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.998
Even if we're family,

630
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.210
going under the knife isn't easy, Mom.

631
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.421
In this day and age,

632
00:41:05.504 --> 00:41:07.715
someone as educated and smart as you

633
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:10.259
spent your entire youth
taking care of your ailing father-in-law

634
00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:12.344
and putting up with your mother-in-law.

635
00:41:12.428 --> 00:41:14.638
So how could they do this to you?

636
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:15.723
Mom.

637
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:17.600
Mom, look at me.

638
00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:20.769
Mom, don't beg.

639
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.481
Then who will?

640
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.318
Who will beg for your life?

641
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:30.446
Risking her life for her child
is what a mother does.

642
00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:32.198
So begging for your life is nothing.

643
00:41:34.408 --> 00:41:39.163
If you can just live,
I'd get down on my knees and beg.

644
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.585
Mom.

645
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:47.713
I'm sorry.

646
00:41:51.884 --> 00:41:54.303
I'm sorry, Mom.

647
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:03.103
What is this mess?
Why on earth are you doing this?

648
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.355
You bunch of hacks.

649
00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:07.316
How could you trick people
by using such lousy ingredients?

650
00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:11.487
My daughter ate this garbage,
and now she might die.

651
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.199
-What are you going to do about that?
-My goodness, these are expensive!

652
00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:16.575
What are you going to do?

653
00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:18.953
Can't you just use your words?

654
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.124
Jong-su,

655
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.545
you're the best candidate for the surgery.

656
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.755
But her husband can do it.

657
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:31.340
So why are you doing this to me?

658
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:35.844
I wouldn't be asking you a favor like this
if I wasn't this desperate.

659
00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:39.139
Here. Take this.

660
00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:41.517
This is everything I have.

661
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.394
It's not a small amount.

662
00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:47.648
I'll give all of this to you.
Just please save my daughter.

663
00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:51.569
When my mother died young,
I will never forget how you took us in

664
00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:54.238
and raised us as if we were your children.

665
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:57.783
And the fact I can live as a proper adult
like this is all thanks to you.

666
00:42:57.866 --> 00:42:59.034
But you doing this

667
00:42:59.118 --> 00:43:01.620
feels like you're pressuring me
to pay back the debt.

668
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:02.621
It's agonizing.

669
00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:07.251
Jong-su, you're the only one
I can cling to.

670
00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.840
<c.bg_transparent><i>I heard Professor Seo's wife's condition
is pretty serious.</i></c.bg_transparent>

671
00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:15.509
I mean, how did he let it
get to that point?

672
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:17.720
I heard Professor Seo was a match.

673
00:43:17.803 --> 00:43:19.054
I know, right?

674
00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:22.099
It's going to be hard
if they still can't find a donor.

675
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.562
Professor Seo was in the same class
as you in medical school, right?

676
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.940
-Yes, he was.
-Then do you know his wife too?

677
00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.195
I don't. I wasn't close
with Professor Seo back then.

678
00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:37.990
But why is he having his wife

679
00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:40.993
treated at a different hospital
and not this one?

680
00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:43.787
His wife said being at this hospital
would be uncomfortable.

681
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.040
His son is an intern here.

682
00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:50.252
Professor Seo must be
all out of sorts right now.

683
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.467
-That's what I heard.
-It must be so nice for you.

684
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.928
-We should eat something delicious.
-What do you want to eat for lunch?

685
00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:01.013
I'm hungry.

686
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.643
Patient Kim Yeon-suk from Ward 151…

687
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:07.936
-Doctor.
-What are you doing here?

688
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.440
Just observing people.

689
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:18.614
When you're at a hospital,
you see all kinds of things.

690
00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:25.162
There are more cases than you think
of donors suddenly changing their minds.

691
00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:28.874
It isn't an easy decision
to donate your organ,

692
00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:31.460
even if it's to your family.

693
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:35.839
I just feel so bad…

694
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.885
putting this pressure on my family.

695
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:43.347
Even if something happens to me,

696
00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:48.560
I hope they don't live
their lives feeling guilty.

697
00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:50.479
Don't think about that.

698
00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.399
Just get better.

699
00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:55.484
When I was an intern,

700
00:44:57.194 --> 00:45:00.614
I saw mothers
who were just in their early thirties

701
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.869
develop cancer and die several times.

702
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:10.249
Maybe it's because of that,
but once I reached my forties,

703
00:45:10.332 --> 00:45:12.793
I thought even if I came down
with a terminal illness,

704
00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:15.379
there wouldn't be anything
to be bitter about.

705
00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:18.382
Even though I always worried that

706
00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:24.596
something terrible might happen
to my husband or kids if I was gone,

707
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:28.225
I would have those kinds
of thoughts from time to time.

708
00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:36.358
Doctor, I'm so jealous of you.

709
00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:41.196
When I was an intern,
I wanted to become a surgeon.

710
00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:44.491
When I was doing my training,

711
00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:49.329
the first surgery
I observed was a liver transplant.

712
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:53.292
I had no idea I'd end up
needing to receive one.

713
00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.379
Now that I think about it,

714
00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:00.215
I really miss the operating room.

715
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.177
Then…

716
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.763
would you like to visit one?

717
00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:11.602
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
PEDIATRIC OPERATING ROOM

718
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.355
Doctor.

719
00:46:17.065 --> 00:46:18.567
A photo to commemorate the event.

720
00:46:19.234 --> 00:46:21.695
You should take a selfie in those clothes.

721
00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.030
Gosh, no.

722
00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:33.957
Thank you.

723
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:39.379
Doctor, but isn't this not allowed?

724
00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:43.091
Just for today, you're a colleague
who has come to observe a surgery.

725
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.760
A colleague?

726
00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:47.346
Yes, you have
a medical license, don't you?

727
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.139
-I do.
-Then you're a colleague.

728
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.452
It's a 40-year-old man
suffering from Crohn's disease.

729
00:47:10.536 --> 00:47:12.287
He has an intestinal obstruction
and an abscess,

730
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:14.665
so we will be performing
a bowel resection surgery.

731
00:47:26.718 --> 00:47:27.678
Scalpel.

732
00:47:40.899 --> 00:47:43.277
-Do I have to feel guilty?
-Why?

733
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.488
You went on a trip with me
on the day your wife went to the ER.

734
00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:48.907
It would've happened
even if I had gone to the hospital.

735
00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:52.202
But it's a relief that a donor was found.

736
00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:54.079
Her cousin, right?

737
00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.163
Yes.

738
00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:58.000
It's times like this
that I envy your wife.

739
00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.879
When I'm sick,
will you be able to stay by my side?

740
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.009
Will I die all alone in my later years?

741
00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:09.761
-I think about these things.
-Choi Seung-hi.

742
00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:13.390
Sometimes I have to nag like this
so I can relieve my stress too.

743
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:16.143
The three of us have
a maze-like complicated relationship.

744
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.938
There are no answers and there is no end.

745
00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.524
I have nothing I can say to you.

746
00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:25.235
I don't know if there will ever
be answers or an end,

747
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.862
but I can promise you this.

748
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.162
I won't leave you to be all alone.

749
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.254
Hello.

750
00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:05.359
Where is Jong-su?

751
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.694
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

752
00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:10.280
What do you mean, sorry?

753
00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:21.792
EMERGENCY BELL

754
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:24.044
We can't accept this.

755
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:29.216
Ms. Oh, I don't want him
to get the surgery either.

756
00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:34.096
Our child is still so young,
and I'm scared.

757
00:49:34.888 --> 00:49:39.184
He couldn't bring himself to tell you,
so I came here to tell you instead.

758
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.728
But the surgery is booked for tomorrow.

759
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.397
I'm so sorry.

760
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:49.778
Cold blue. Room 306, code blue.

761
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.708
-Ma'am, you can't go in right now.
-That's my daughter…

762
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.842
My daughter suddenly slipped into a coma

763
00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:13.885
and went into the intensive care unit.

764
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:15.762
I can't even see her face for a moment?

765
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:18.807
She's in a critical state right now,
so you can't visit her.

766
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:29.151
Jeong-suk…

767
00:50:43.165 --> 00:50:45.083
-Mom.
-Mom.

768
00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:48.795
Mom, are you okay?

769
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:50.922
Mom.

770
00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.361
Dad.

771
00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.907
Can't you just donate your liver?

772
00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:22.204
It's not that simple.

773
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:25.874
This is a much more dangerous surgery
than you think…

774
00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:27.209
As long as it's fine with you,

775
00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:29.878
I also think it'd be great
if you could donate your liver.

776
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.297
There's no other alternative, Father.

777
00:51:41.473 --> 00:51:44.768
Mother, I think I have
to go through with the surgery.

778
00:51:45.811 --> 00:51:47.604
We have to save the children's mother.

779
00:51:47.687 --> 00:51:50.065
Her condition is too critical
to wait for a donor.

780
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:52.901
Please give me permission, Mother!

781
00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:55.695
If I don't give you permission,
will you not do the surgery?

782
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:00.909
Get up.

783
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.537
Why are you on your knees?

784
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.289
You did nothing wrong.
Why are you on your knees?

785
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:07.833
I'm sorry.

786
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:10.627
This is why I told you
not to get into a marriage like this.

787
00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:13.129
I was against it from the get-go.

788
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.882
How could someone so smart
be so daft at the same time?

789
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.551
To leave that perfect girl, Seung-hi…

790
00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:22.138
I never forgot her name
because it was such a waste.

791
00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:25.767
You kicked your own luck away like that

792
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.727
and got a good-for-nothing girl pregnant.

793
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.188
Gosh, men are unbelievable.

794
00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:31.940
Get out, you bastard.

795
00:52:32.023 --> 00:52:33.817
Get out!

796
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.987
-Get out!
-I'm leaving.

797
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.408
I'm so furious. Gosh…

798
00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:45.161
Goodness! Filthy little bastards!

799
00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.331
SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

800
00:52:51.042 --> 00:52:52.043
In-ho,

801
00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:55.338
thank you for making
such a difficult decision.

802
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:59.259
I'll never forget this.

803
00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:00.760
No. I…

804
00:53:02.262 --> 00:53:04.931
should've said yes
from the beginning. I'm sorry.

805
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.017
Gosh, don't say that.

806
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.478
It isn't easy to decide
to donate your liver to someone.

807
00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:15.066
Let me go get some water.

808
00:53:25.785 --> 00:53:26.620
Honey.

809
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:31.499
I know you made a difficult decision.

810
00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:36.671
This might just be an excuse,
but if I think of Mom and the kids,

811
00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:41.968
I want to live a little bit longer.

812
00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:49.309
It'd be a lie to say there has
never been a time when I hated you.

813
00:53:50.143 --> 00:53:53.939
Every time you made me think

814
00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:56.441
that you'd be okay
whether or not I was here,

815
00:53:57.192 --> 00:53:59.986
I wanted to confirm that wasn't true.

816
00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:04.032
<c.bg_transparent><i>And it made me become
even more engrossed in household work.</i></c.bg_transparent>

817
00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:10.664
But still, there was a part of me
that held feelings of hate

818
00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.583
and resentment toward you.

819
00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:16.962
But after falling ill like this…

820
00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.883
it turns out my husband
is the one who will save my life.

821
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:32.102
I'll never stop being grateful to you
for the rest of my life.

822
00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:34.229
I mean it.

823
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:36.940
Thank you.

824
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:39.901
And…

825
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:45.824
I'm so sorry.

826
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:52.747
I'm sorry.

827
00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:58.378
-Is this really the only option?
-It is.

828
00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:00.839
Will you donate your liver to me too
if I get sick?

829
00:55:00.922 --> 00:55:01.881
I will.

830
00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.926
Then give me your liver,
your kidney, and your heart!

831
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:05.927
Give me everything!

832
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:07.470
All of it!

833
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:10.974
Then I'll die.

834
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:16.855
-Seung-hi.
-What?

835
00:55:16.938 --> 00:55:18.732
I'll call you when the surgery is over.

836
00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:27.073
Until then, be brave and well,
just like you always are.

837
00:55:41.796 --> 00:55:42.922
Actually…

838
00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:48.303
I went to Gusan University
School of Medicine in 1995.

839
00:55:49.095 --> 00:55:51.806
May I ask which university you went to?

840
00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:56.811
I was raised in the US.
I did my undergrad at Stanford

841
00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:59.230
and then went to Harvard Medical School.

842
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:03.777
Well, I've heard all the rumors
about what a talented doctor you are,

843
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.861
but as a fellow surgeon,

844
00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:08.490
I need to be able to continue to perform
long surgeries, don't you think?

845
00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:13.703
If there are any aftereffects
I should be aware of,

846
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.580
please tell me everything honestly.

847
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.292
Not to your wife, but to you?

848
00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:21.211
Yes.

849
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:27.592
You'll have a scar.

850
00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.053
A scar?

851
00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:31.429
Yes.

852
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:34.933
You could suffer from jaundice
or a high fever,

853
00:56:35.016 --> 00:56:36.434
but if you take good care of yourself,

854
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:37.852
there's nothing to worry about.

855
00:56:37.936 --> 00:56:40.021
I'm not sitting here
to hear obvious answers.

856
00:56:40.105 --> 00:56:41.981
Could you let me know
how many liver transplants

857
00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:43.650
you've performed and their success rate?

858
00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:49.030
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes?

859
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.323
You're a surgeon,

860
00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:53.243
so I'm sure you know
the surgery process and the aftereffects.

861
00:56:53.326 --> 00:56:56.496
But if you find yourself
hesitating about the surgery,

862
00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.706
you can give it more thought
before deciding.

863
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:01.376
That's not what I meant.

864
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.719
SURGERY, ANESTHESIA,
BLOOD TRANSFUSION CONSENT FORM

865
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.772
CONSENTING PARTY'S SIGNATURE OR SEAL

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.959

Scalpel.

Mom, are you okay?

881
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:12.650
Mom.

882
01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.369
-Honey.
-Yes?

883
01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:28.041
Yes, tell me. What is it?

884
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:30.877
What?

885
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.048
What did you say?

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.137
You…

887
01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:42.930
little…

888
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.017
bastard.

889
01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:06.621
Excuse me, the patient here has woken up!

890
01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.849
DOCTOR CHA

891
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.791
<c.bg_transparent><i>After coming back from the brink of death,
it turns out all of that was meaningless.</i></c.bg_transparent>

892
01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.126
Has she lost her mind?

893
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.336
<c.bg_transparent><i>You said I didn't have to worry
about the household chores anymore.</i></c.bg_transparent>

894
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.213
-Is my juice not ready yet?
-You can make it yourself.

895
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.424
Maybe it's because I escaped death.

896
01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:02.009
<c.bg_transparent><i>I wanted to start doing things
I hadn't done before.</i></c.bg_transparent>

897
01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:06.597
<c.bg_transparent><i>Did the big surgery
mess with her head or something?</i></c.bg_transparent>

898
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.599
Why are you suddenly acting weird?

899
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.768
<c.bg_transparent><i>I spent the last 20 years
not doing stuff like this.</i></c.bg_transparent>

900
01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.814
I'm going to live
however I please from now on.
