00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.605
Professor.

3
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.858
You don't run at full speed in a marathon.

4
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.944
Do you think you actually
are Hany or something?

5
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.864
What brings you here?

6
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.455
I have something to tell you.

7
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.500
Something to tell me?

8
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:25.752
What do you--

9
00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.879
It's something very important.

10
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.131
If I don't tell you today,

11
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.467
I might never be able to.

12
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.097
-The reason I came here today…
-Excuse me, who are you?

13
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.432
EPISODE 7

14
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.350
Mother.

15
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.977
This is my mother-in-law.

16
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.945
What could be urgent enough to warrant
holding onto my daughter-in-law

17
00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.655
this late at night?

18
00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.864
It's not like that.

19
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.575
He's a professor from the hospital.

20
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.620
He's the one
who performed my liver transplant.

21
00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.205
Do you not remember?

22
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.958
You are that doctor.

23
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.835
Hello.

24
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.587
Yes, hello.

25
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.966
But what brings you here?

26
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.511
I live nearby as well.

27
00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.889
I ran into her while I was out on a walk.

28
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.685
I should get going.

29
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.478
Dr. Cha, see you tomorrow.

30
00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.397
Yes, get home safely.

31
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.906
I know you're not that type,

32
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.702
but even if the hospital
doesn't know about you and In-ho,

33
00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.912
you still always have
to watch your behavior.

34
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.499
You can't do anything that'll bring
disgrace to him, don't you think?

35
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.417
Right.

36
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.628
Mother, you're late today.

37
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.006
-Did you stop by somewhere?
-Yes.

38
00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.468
This month's maintenance bill is so high.

39
00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.721
Why is the maintenance bill so high?

40
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.389
Let's go.

41
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.563
Gosh.

42
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.398
What is all of this?

43
00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.526
Why are you kneeling?

44
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.154
Mother, you should head to your room.
Jeong-suk, sit with me.

45
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.906
Goodness, fine.

46
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.366
I think you guys will have
to solve this on your own.

47
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.868
Gosh, my head.

48
00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.762
Did you know that
I-rang was preparing for art school?

49
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.099
-That…
-I'm sure you didn't just know.

50
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.060
You were probably helping her.

51
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.604
Honey, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

52
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:50.772
How long has this been going on?

53
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.233
When she was in tenth grade,

54
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.027
she said she wanted to go to art school
but changed her mind.

55
00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.529
Were both of you putting on an act?

56
00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:01.407
-That's not true.
-Then when did this start?

57
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.160
When did you all start
preparing for art school

58
00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:07.247
while lying to your whole family?

59
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.251
Do you know how much I pour
into her education every month?

60
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.503
Have you been using that money
to buy this junk?

61
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.296
It hasn't been long.

62
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.423
I-rang really wants to do this.

63
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.092
She wants to pursue art.

64
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.011
Seo I-rang, cat got your tongue?

65
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.805
You'll be an adult next year.

66
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.224
What do you have to say
about your college admissions?

67
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.726
I've told you more than enough before

68
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.771
that I want to go to art school.

69
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.607
But to you, my future was set in stone.

70
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.153
That's right.

71
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.989
It is set in stone.

72
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.200
Bring me a trash bag.

73
00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.494
Honey.

74
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.208
Honey, don't do this!

75
00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.170
Honey, please.

76
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.048
Mother, please help me.

77
00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:03.678
-Please just stop!
-Goodness, stop it!

78
00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.556
-I-rang, what are you doing?
-Stop it!

79
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.475
Apologize to your father
and tell him you'll study hard.

80
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.643
Gosh, what's with him?

81
00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.312
-Please don't be like this.
-Stop!

82
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.190
-Honey, don't be like this.
-In-ho, stop.

83
00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:18.609
Hey, enough!

84
00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.778
Why are you being so stubborn?

85
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.281
-Honey, don't be like this.
-In-ho, stop this.

86
00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:26.784
Stop! Stop already!

87
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.994
Hey!

88
00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:29.037
My goodness.

89
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.621
Stop this now.

90
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:31.873
Goodness.

91
00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.126
Gosh!

92
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.878
Why won't you listen?

93
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.564
Do you have to go that far?

94
00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:59.984
Your child wants
to do something so passionately.

95
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.403
If you can't be supportive,
at least leave her be.

96
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.530
Is a doctor the only job
that's acceptable for you?

97
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.366
If you want to send I-rang to art school,

98
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.160
you should quit working at the hospital.

99
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.663
What?

100
00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.999
Did you think you could
have everything your way?

101
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.876
I'm the head of the family.

102
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.463
If you gain something,
you should be prepared to lose something.

103
00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.092
What kind of ridiculous logic is that?

104
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.260
Why would I quit the hospital?

105
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.056
I'm going to send her to art school

106
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.184
and continue to work at the hospital.
Don't order me around.

107
00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.227
Is that so?

108
00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:38.189
Then handle everything from her tuition
to her art school entrance prep.

109
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.400
You have a job now.
You're more than capable of doing that.

110
00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:45.279
Fine. Since you have fed, sheltered,
and clothed us until now,

111
00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.405
I'll handle it from now on.

112
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.619
Thank you so much
for feeding me this whole time.

113
00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:10.138
You can use this
and leave it here after you're done.

114
00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.850
Thank you.

115
00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.002
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
WINNING WORK

116
00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:07.528
What?

117
00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:09.572
If you have something to say, say it.

118
00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:21.292
Seung-hi's daughter.

119
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.295
She's I-rang's friend.

120
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.841
To tell you the truth,

121
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.636
ever since I found out
Seung-hi worked at the hospital,

122
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.096
I felt uncomfortable.

123
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.727
What's more, I-rang's friend turned out
to be Seung-hi's daughter.

124
00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.146
I ran into them at the hospital.

125
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.983
How should I interpret all of this?

126
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.785
I can't do anything about you
feeling uncomfortable.

127
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.288
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Seung-hi working at our hospital.

128
00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.001
But I already explained
why I didn't tell you.

129
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:07.463
And I also just learned that I-rang
and Seung-hi's daughter are friends.

130
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.633
But they're grown-up kids.
I can't stop them from being friends.

131
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:14.554
What about the bracelet?

132
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:21.477
What about it?

133
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:24.689
Never mind.

134
00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:26.774
If you're going to continue
to be like this,

135
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.236
we can't work at the same hospital.

136
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.193
Dad treated my art like trash.

137
00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.113
I-rang.

138
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.241
I'll make sure you can study art.

139
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:23.080
I'm going to keep my promise
and stay by your side until the end.

140
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.751
I should've told your dad
from the beginning,

141
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.502
but I was foolish.

142
00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:32.632
I'm sorry for making you
hide your dream all this time.

143
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.800
Mom, you're so naive.

144
00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.970
How will you send me to art school?

145
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.349
The summer college admissions lecture
for art school is 12 million won.

146
00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.809
If you add the consulting
and the art project report edits,

147
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:44.977
it'll be 20 to 30 million won.

148
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.395
Do you have that much money?

149
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.607
It's that expensive?

150
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.618
What brings you here at this hour?

151
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.913
Eun-seo knows I-rang?
I heard they're friends.

152
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.956
I found out only recently too.

153
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.541
You should have told me!

154
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.293
How did they become friends?

155
00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:10.628
Was it really a coincidence?

156
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.546
Don't talk to me
like you're interrogating me.

157
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.090
We created this situation together.

158
00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.425
Why should I always be the one at fault?

159
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.427
That's not what I meant.

160
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.222
Do I have to be
your family's peacekeeper too?

161
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:23.933
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:25.559
I…

163
00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.687
I was just shocked
when I heard the news from my wife.

164
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.232
What on earth should we do
about those two?

165
00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:33.692
We can't tell two grown kids
not to be friends.

166
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.779
It's just because they go
to the same academy now.

167
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.698
They'll grow apart
once they get into different universities.

168
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.995
But is that why you came
all the way here at this hour?

169
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.176
We can give you 5.5 million won for this.

170
00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.345
Can you buy it at a higher price?

171
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.638
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.223
Do you want to reconsider?

173
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.104
No, I will accept that price.

174
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.606
And this…

175
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.238
Please appraise this as well.

176
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.169
What kind of room did you reserve?

177
00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:35.421
Sorry?

178
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:36.839
My hospital room.

179
00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.215
I'll be admitted the day after tomorrow.

180
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.634
What kind of room did you reserve?

181
00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:45.639
Mother, I'll reserve
a private room for you.

182
00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:49.518
You'd be uncomfortable sharing
the same space with strangers.

183
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:52.271
But Mother…

184
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.524
-do you have money--
-How could you?

185
00:12:56.025 --> 00:13:00.154
Not a single soul in this family
is even worried about me.

186
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.242
Mother, I'm sorry.

187
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:20.216

194
00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.582
Right, you haven't sent the minutes
for the morning meeting yet.

195
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.084
Right.

196
00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.669
I haven't finished organizing them.

197
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.255
I'll send them before noon.

198
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.344
Dr. Choi.

199
00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.223
I'm sorry to ask,

200
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:11.850
but could you tell me…

201
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.853
where you bought that bracelet?

202
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.815
Why do you have to be sorry
for asking me that?

203
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:22.111
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

204
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.030
Husband…

205
00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:28.075
I see, your husband bought it for you.

206
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.876
She has

207
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:38.502
a husband.

208
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:58.314
Did I commit such an unforgivable sin
by being a single mother

209
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.232
giving birth to and raising you abroad?

210
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.651
Yes, having me was a sin.

211
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.529
Do you remember the girl you saw
when you came to pick me up?

212
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.947
Do you know who she is?

213
00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.325
She's my sister.

214
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.745
-What?
-She's Seo In-ho's daughter.

215
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:14.413
I became friends with her.

216
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:16.415
I even went to their house.

217
00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.251
I saw how Dad was living with that woman.

218
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.629
Are you crazy?

219
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.172
What do you think you're doing?

220
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.632
It's better than what you did!

221
00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:28.052
You seduced a married man,
had an affair, and had a kid with him!

222
00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:30.512
That's why we lived in the US
for 15 years!

223
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.931
I didn't want you to be hurt,

224
00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.475
so I lied to you
that your father and I were divorced!

225
00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:38.520
I tried my hardest to raise you
so you didn't have to endure that pain.

226
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.730
Too bad.

227
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.316
All that effort was for nothing.

228
00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:44.860
I've become an extremely twisted person.

229
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.989
You don't know the full story.

230
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.285
I was first.

231
00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:58.707
Your father and I liked each other
before all of this happened.

232
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.919
You and Dad liked each other first?

233
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.382
Then why are you living like this?

234
00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.649
I take back…

235
00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:26.735
what I said before.

236
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.570
I was being too harsh.

237
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.615
I'm sorry I doubted you.

238
00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.827
Let's not talk about Seung-hi anymore.

239
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.205
What about I-rang?

240
00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:42.167
I-rang was so unhappy
when she gave up on art.

241
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:46.338
But consulting you would have turned
the entire household upside down.

242
00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.758
So I chose the easy option.

243
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.011
In the end, you did what you wanted

244
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.054
for something that was important.

245
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.598
Jung-min became a doctor
just as you wanted,

246
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.143
so you should be able
to cut I-rang some slack.

247
00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:03.772
Just let her go to art school
like she prepared.

248
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.025
Art is done by geniuses
with exceptional talent.

249
00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:08.068
Do you think I-rang
is one of those people?

250
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.238
She's our daughter.
She's smart but not artistic.

251
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:12.823
I know she's our kid, but please…

252
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.161
Be more objective.

253
00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.788
Then what about her dream?

254
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.881
Dreams aren't meant to be achieved.

255
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.718
Tell her to keep it as a hobby.

256
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.142
I heard you have to keep
drinking cold beverages

257
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.061
after having surgery for thyroid cancer.

258
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.898
I was just about to get tired
of drinking ice water.

259
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:47.691
My goodness,

260
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:52.279
you must have worked so hard
to make all of this.

261
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.615
Just think this is on behalf
of your busy daughter-in-law.

262
00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.242
My cooking isn't so bad,

263
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.870
so what I prepared should be better
than the hospital food.

264
00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.371
Make sure you eat the porridge.

265
00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:04.166
I'll put the rice punch
and cinnamon punch in the fridge.

266
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.584
Drink them whenever you can.

267
00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:07.503
Thank you.

268
00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:09.463
I'll be sure to enjoy them.

269
00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:14.468
Don't you resent my mother-in-law?

270
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:16.970
I do.

271
00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.808
How could I not resent her
after what she did

272
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.643
when you had your surgery?

273
00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:26.063
I don't think
I'd be able to do it if I were you.

274
00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:30.400
I did this because I thought
it'd bring you some good karma.

275
00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:31.944
And…

276
00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:37.157
you made the right decision
to keep working at the hospital.

277
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.368
Women need to have work too.

278
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.245
Oh, my.

279
00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.622
You said I was making
the right decision to quit.

280
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.583
You're my daughter,

281
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:49.503
so I have no choice
but to support you and your decisions.

282
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.679
Where is In-ho?

283
00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:00.305
I don't see Jung-min either.

284
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.307
Excuse me.

285
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:04.309
Where is Professor Seo right now?

286
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.270
Why?

287
00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.566
Yes, hello?

288
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.026
Yes, ma'am.

289
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.488
I know today
is I-rang's admissions counseling,

290
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:20.033
but I was suddenly put on night duty.

291
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.327
Yes, I'm so sorry.

292
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.745
Thank you.

293
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:26.665
Dr. Cha.

294
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:28.208
Professor.

295
00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:31.295
You can clock out. I'll stay on duty.

296
00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.672
I can't let you do that.

297
00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:36.341
What kind of professor would
take a resident's night duty?

298
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.718
I'll be all right.

299
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.428
I think I'd be of more use

300
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.972
than a first-year resident.

301
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.016
That is true but…

302
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:45.893
You should go.

303
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:51.732
It's a bit shameless of me,
but I'll ask you this favor just once.

304
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:53.984
Professor, thank you so much.

305
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.655
Right. When you showed up
in front of my house that night,

306
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.033
didn't you say you had
something to tell me?

307
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.369
Right, that.

308
00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.125
What should I do? I forgot what it was.

309
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:12.544
I see.

310
00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.297
Okay.

311
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.382
I'll be right back then. Thank you.

312
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:26.808
Hello, Professor.

313
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.936
Yes, hello.

314
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.272
We saw each other
in front of my house recently.

315
00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.441
I'm Professor Seo In-ho's mother.

316
00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:36.401
Yes, I'm aware.

317
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.905
But were you admitted to the hospital?

318
00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:42.199
Yes. For my thyroid surgery.

319
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.202
But…

320
00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:49.998
are you close to my daughter-in-law?

321
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:56.797
She'll be quite clumsy
since she started working at an older age.

322
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.550
Even if she makes mistakes to some degree,
please be generous and forgive her.

323
00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.513
She's doing well,
so you don't have to worry.

324
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.556
Then that's a relief.

325
00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.141
If you'll excuse me.

326
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.820
That is ridiculous.
What are you even saying…

327
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.156
Why would that young professor
like a mother of two?

328
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.658
Who said anything…

329
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:27.869
Who said he likes her now?

330
00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.123
I'm saying working close together
may lead to it.

331
00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.338
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

332
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.300
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

333
00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.720
It greatly irks me
to try and turn a blind eye

334
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.471
to what is happening.

335
00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.850
It's not because of that.

336
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:54.271
Anyway, even if they are close,
it won't happen.

337
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:57.357
You don't know he came to see her
in front of our house, do you?

338
00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:58.275
Our house?

339
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.110
He did say that he lives nearby,

340
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:02.070
and they ran into each other in passing.

341
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.197
But that could be an excuse.

342
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:07.784
They were talking to each other
in the hallway earlier too.

343
00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.329
They seemed to be on great terms.

344
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.968
You must have an emergency surgery.

345
00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:27.471
Why did you show up in front of our house?

346
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.391
I find it unpleasant.

347
00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:38.940
Are you worried
I might expose your affair?

348
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.948
Don't worry. I didn't say anything.

349
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.291
Do you think I don't have

350
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.835
other topics to talk to her about?

351
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.839
Then what more do you have to tell her?

352
00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.217
You're so full of yourself.

353
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:14.893
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

354
00:23:15.685 --> 00:23:18.355
You're still at work at this hour
because of me.

355
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:21.316
I'm aware of your difficulties.

356
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:23.193
But…

357
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:24.903
I'm a working mom too.

358
00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.656
This is about
your child's college admissions.

359
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.742
You should keep this kind
of appointment no matter what.

360
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:33.328
Right.

361
00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:43.421
I-rang.

362
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:48.927
Sorry.

363
00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:52.305
-I came so late, right?
-I had low expectations anyway.

364
00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:54.724
What about the money?

365
00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:56.601
Did you get it?

366
00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:02.023
Let's go.

367
00:24:07.487 --> 00:24:08.780
I said let's go.

368
00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:18.206
You're hungry, right?

369
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.166
I'm starving.

370
00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.626
I haven't eaten anything
since I was waiting for you.

371
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.752
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:24.087
Did you eat?

373
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.755
I haven't eaten either.

374
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:31.011
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

375
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:33.805
I'm sure you heard from the colon
and rectal surgery professor.

376
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.850
The liver metastasis is worsening
due to hematogenous metastasis

377
00:24:37.767 --> 00:24:39.477
since the treatment has been delayed.

378
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:44.816
Thankfully, the cancer cells are
only on the surface and can be removed.

379
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.860
But if the treatment
is delayed any longer,

380
00:24:46.943 --> 00:24:49.196
the cancer might invade
major liver blood vessels

381
00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.031
and may make it difficult to operate on.

382
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.158
I know this is difficult,

383
00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:54.743
but as of now,

384
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.914
the best option is to terminate
the pregnancy, perform surgery,

385
00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.208
and receive chemotherapy.

386
00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:10.675
What will you do?

387
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:13.428
What do you mean?
I told you I'm having this baby.

388
00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:16.181
How can the baby be important
when your life is at stake?

389
00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:18.391
Mom.

390
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:23.355
Just as I'm precious to you,
this baby is precious to me.

391
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.650
-I'm going to have this baby.
-But you have to live!

392
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.903
Why are you so obsessed
over a child that's not even born yet?

393
00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:30.987
Stop it.

394
00:25:57.472 --> 00:25:58.723
Is he the baby's father?

395
00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:00.934
This person is an actor.

396
00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:02.435
Right?

397
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:06.815
No.

398
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:08.733
He's not the baby's father.

399
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:17.409
CHA JEONG-SUK
ORDINARY ACCOUNT

400
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.591
-Hello.
-Hello.

401
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:35.176
Your car is nice.

402
00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:37.220
I just got it.

403
00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:38.847
It looks expensive.

404
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.599
-I got it on an OD.
-OD?

405
00:26:43.226 --> 00:26:45.228
-An overdraft account?
-Yes.

406
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.901
Gosh, look how irresponsible she is.

407
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:53.570
An OD?

408
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.447
Dr. Jeon!

409
00:26:57.699 --> 00:27:00.910
Can I get an overdraft account too?

410
00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:04.080
-Unless you have bad credit, then yes.
-Up to how much?

411
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.125
It's about 100 million won
for interns and residents.

412
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.919
It depends on the bank,
so you should check.

413
00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:11.838
Okay.

414
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:13.548
Thank you!

415
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.472
You said you had
no loans in your name, right?

416
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:21.473
Yes.

417
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.683
But you have a loan
against your real estate.

418
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.685
For 450 million won.

419
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:26.603
What?

420
00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:31.316
How is that possible
when I don't own any real estate?

421
00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:34.569
You have a building
under your name in Gyeonggi-do.

422
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:42.243
Mother, are you going out?

423
00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.287
-Yes, Jeong-suk.
-Yes?

424
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.333
Go to the district office today
and make a seal.

425
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.419
A seal?

426
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.130
Yes, you need a seal
to buy and sell things.

427
00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:57.550
You may need one when taking care
of things for the household.

428
00:27:58.134 --> 00:27:59.803
You should make one just in case.

429
00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:02.889
And when you do, leave it with me, okay?

430
00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:08.895
Should I issue a loan
using this building as collateral?

431
00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:15.777
No, just make it a credit loan.

432
00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.195
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:19.864
Excuse me.

434
00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:22.951
The building under my name.

435
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:25.578
Can I get the address to it?

436
00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:38.675
She always said she didn't have any money.

437
00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:41.970
The special lecture fee?

438
00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:43.763
Yes.

439
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.849
I paid the academy.

440
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.935
Where did you get the money?
There's no way Dad helped.

441
00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:51.521
You don't need to know that.

442
00:28:52.313 --> 00:28:55.650
Don't worry about money and work hard
on getting into that art school.

443
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:58.528
Pursuing art will sour things
with your dad,

444
00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:01.489
so you have to take responsibility
for your actions, okay?

445
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.785
Come on, how did you get the money?

446
00:29:07.203 --> 00:29:09.456
I have a job now.

447
00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.791
I got a credit loan for workers.

448
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:15.420
I know you don't like that I work,
but you do at times like this, right?

449
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:16.963
I know you do.

450
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.550
I know you love it.
It makes you want to laugh.

451
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.303
Mom, thank you.

452
00:29:24.304 --> 00:29:27.348
<c.bg_transparent><i>This is a 32-year-old male patient
suffering from Crohn's disease</i></c.bg_transparent>

453
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.810
<c.bg_transparent><i>and it looks like he had been suffering
from diverticulitis in his sigmoid colon.</i></c.bg_transparent>

454
00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:34.314
The inflammation in that area worsened,
and on April 22nd in Busan,

455
00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:37.609
he received Hartmann's procedure
after being diagnosed with panperitonitis.

456
00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:39.068
Since he's still young,

457
00:29:39.152 --> 00:29:41.070
he wants to be able to defecate
through the anus.

458
00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:44.282
He visited the outpatient clinic of
our Colon and Rectal Surgery Department

459
00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:45.825
for a stoma reversal surgery.

460
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:48.119
I'm presenting this case to discuss
when to pursue the reversal surgery

461
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:50.538
and the current level
of Crohn's disease activity.

462
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.169
-Have you met the Hartmann patient?
-Yes, I have.

463
00:29:56.252 --> 00:29:57.253
How is he?

464
00:29:57.337 --> 00:30:00.840
He's stabilized mentally,
so I don't think it will be an issue…

465
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:02.842
-Hey, Seo Jung-min.
-Yes?

466
00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:05.386
Sorry, but can you get me my phone
from my dorm room?

467
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:08.181
-Okay.
-Wait!

468
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.099
I'll get it for you.

469
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:15.021
I could just go get it…

470
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.873
Jeez, she must think Jung-min
is her lackey or something.

471
00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:36.125
She always bosses him around.

472
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.089
What's with her passcode?

473
00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.307
My goodness.

474
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:53.768
Look at all this.

475
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.521
Gosh.

476
00:30:56.604 --> 00:31:00.358
There's no place to step
with all this mess.

477
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.070
Is this men's underwear?

478
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.365
She has a boyfriend?

479
00:31:07.949 --> 00:31:09.409
Goodness.

480
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.620
Whoever that poor soul is,

481
00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.581
I feel so bad for him.

482
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.751
Do you really want
to do 

483
00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:23.423
How youthful.

484
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.643
What am I doing right now?

485
00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:37.687
It's not like this is my daughter's room.

486
00:31:39.022 --> 00:31:39.939
Her cell phone!

487
00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:59.167
TO MY SON WHOM I LOVE, JUNG-MIN

488
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:14.515
This is Jung-min's underwear.

489
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:16.809
My son…

490
00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.663
No way.

491
00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:39.874
They're not thinking
of marriage, are they?

492
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.127
Thank you for the meal.

493
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.045
So-ra.

494
00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:46.464
-What about the dishes?
-Mother.

495
00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:49.008
Everyone here knows
how to wash the dishes.

496
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.969
If you and I prepared the meal,

497
00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.639
then other people should clean it up.

498
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.314
Mother, I can't cut fruit well.

499
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:06.609
Wouldn't it be more efficient
for an expert to cut it

500
00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:08.277
rather than have me mess it up?

501
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.241
Mother, these materials are for my paper,

502
00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.493
so you should write them
according to the SOAP.

503
00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.829
Do you want people to criticize
these poorly-written charts?

504
00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:26.379
What's worse is that
everything she says is right.

505
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:35.972
Jung-min.

506
00:33:36.806 --> 00:33:37.682
Yes.

507
00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:38.599
Okay.

508
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:40.601
But you don't…

509
00:33:41.477 --> 00:33:44.564
have a girlfriend, do you?

510
00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:46.441
I don't.

511
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.360
I said I don't.

512
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:53.823
I'm telling you the truth.

513
00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:56.451
Let's talk later.

514
00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.536
Okay.

515
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.877
What were you talking about?

516
00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:08.421
Is someone asking you for money?

517
00:34:09.797 --> 00:34:12.300
Yes, I told them I don't have any money.

518
00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:14.594
Good job.

519
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:17.889
But what is your mother like?

520
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:22.977
Why do you ask?

521
00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:26.981
I was wondering if she gets along
with Professor Seo.

522
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:31.569
Is this about that rumor
about Dr. Cha and my father?

523
00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.032
There's nothing going on between them.

524
00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:45.249
I'm not asking because of that, you punk.

525
00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:47.752
"You punk"?

526
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:50.296
You keep trying to rile me up.

527
00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:54.258
How can you call your boyfriend "punk"?

528
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.928
I can do what I want, you punk.

529
00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:03.643
Wait for me.

530
00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:20.451
Thank you for bringing my phone.

531
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:22.703
Do you have something to say?

532
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.414
Dr. Jeon.

533
00:35:26.582 --> 00:35:28.918
Do you have a boyfriend?

534
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:30.002
Yes.

535
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:31.754
I do, why?

536
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.215
Who is it?

537
00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:38.219
Why does it feel
like I'm being interrogated here?

538
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.637
Goodness.

539
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:43.307
I'm not interrogating.
I was just being curious, that's all.

540
00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:45.977
Who's your boyfriend?

541
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:47.728
Is it someone I know?

542
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:52.483
I'm not going to tell you.

543
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:54.610
I don't care that you're curious.

544
00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:57.280
I have no reason
to answer questions like that.

545
00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:10.877
You!

546
00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:15.715
Are you really dating that rude girl?

547
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:17.425
What?

548
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.553
He's pretending not to have a girlfriend.

549
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:22.722
What's the point of confirming the truth?

550
00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:25.641
<c.bg_transparent><i>It'll just make
all three of us uncomfortable.</i></c.bg_transparent>

551
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:31.105
Dr. Seo.

552
00:36:32.732 --> 00:36:34.025
I don't see your watch.

553
00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:36.527
You always wear it.

554
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:41.324
Right, I forgot to wear it.

555
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.159
I took it off while showering.

556
00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.204
At a friend's house.

557
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:48.915
I knew it.

558
00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:52.668
<c.bg_transparent><i>They've already gone
as far as they can go.</i></c.bg_transparent>

559
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.507
That punk takes after me.

560
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.108
I know things
are uncomfortable between us,

561
00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:18.402
but let's talk when we eat together.

562
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.780
Sorry, it's not like that.

563
00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:23.699
There aren't many famous art academies
in that neighborhood.

564
00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:26.202
Your wife will just think of it like that
and move on.

565
00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:30.706
That's not the full issue.

566
00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:37.171
The new guy in my department,
Roy or whatever.

567
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.547
Sure, I know him.

568
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.342
He's the one who performed
your wife's liver transplant.

569
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.094
That punk knows.

570
00:37:43.886 --> 00:37:44.804
About us.

571
00:37:46.138 --> 00:37:46.973
How?

572
00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:49.350
I don't know how he found out,
but he knows.

573
00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:53.437
He's acting all high and mighty
because he thinks he knows my weakness.

574
00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:56.232
It pisses me off.

575
00:37:58.818 --> 00:37:59.986
What are you going to do?

576
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:03.197
What can that punk do?

577
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:06.867
It's none of his business.

578
00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:23.718
May I sit down?

579
00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:25.594
Of course.

580
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:37.273
Do you have something to say?

581
00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:41.110
I have no intention of breaking up
with Professor Seo.

582
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.157
That's interesting.

583
00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.701
Why are you making that confession to me?

584
00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:50.619
Because I have no one else to tell.

585
00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:53.080
Then you should try
talking to a wall instead.

586
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.251
If you want
to tell her about us, go ahead.

587
00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:00.296
To Dr. Cha.

588
00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:04.342
Are you asking me
to break up a family for you?

589
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:06.886
I don't care what you think.

590
00:39:06.969 --> 00:39:08.846
For whose benefit would I do that?

591
00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:11.724
Don't try to use me.

592
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.895
I thought you were a bit better
than Professor Seo.

593
00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:18.105
I'm greatly disappointed.

594
00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:29.575
Professor.

595
00:39:35.748 --> 00:39:37.375
Do you need to speak to me
about something?

596
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:38.834
Don't smile.

597
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.963
You have something in your teeth.

598
00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:04.652
I'm stressed.

599
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.614
Over here.

600
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:10.866
Gosh, Ms. Kwak.

601
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.076
You got here before me.

602
00:40:12.618 --> 00:40:15.413
Yes. I left early
because it's been a while

603
00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:17.748
since I've been out.

604
00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:20.418
Since I was late,
I should give you this first.

605
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:21.836
Open it.

606
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.838
Oh, my, this is a designer brand.

607
00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:36.725
Goodness, it's a scarf.

608
00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:40.563
You seemed to be always bothered
by that scar on your neck.

609
00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:43.190
You can cover it with this pretty scarf.

610
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.819
Once the seasons change,
I'll get you one in a different color.

611
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:48.279
My goodness.

612
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:50.614
Try it on.

613
00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:53.868
I think it will suit you well
since you have such fair skin.

614
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.371
Thank you.

615
00:40:58.372 --> 00:41:01.250
I've been feeling so weak these days.

616
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.254
I'm so touched by this.

617
00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:09.091
-I'll try it on.
-Okay.

618
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.554
It's pretty.

619
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.014
Does it cover it up well?

620
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.559
-I feel so reinvigorated.
-Yes.

621
00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.478
I'm in such a good mood.

622
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.992
Professor, you can't look at the camera.

623
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:36.494
Okay.

624
00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:48.589
Ma'am, how is your pain?

625
00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.799
It's slowly getting better.

626
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.301
But it still hurts.

627
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.094
You will get better in time.

628
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.097
It'll improve slowly. Are you eating well?

629
00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:00.267
I'm managing to eat, but I can't seem
to have a bowel movement.

630
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.185
Goodness.

631
00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:03.938
It'd be great if you'd give me
some constipation medicine.

632
00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:06.148
I'll let the doctor in charge of you know.

633
00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:08.275
Is everything else fine?

634
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.527
Yes.

635
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.321
Professor, you're very friendly today.

636
00:42:12.404 --> 00:42:15.282
You don't know how frustrated I've been

637
00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:18.911
because you'd always rush out of here
before I could ask you anything.

638
00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.749
Is that so?

639
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.011
It's just that I have a lot of patients.

640
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.727
The adhesion is worse than I thought.

641
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:45.729
Connecting it won't be easy.

642
00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:49.650
I'm worried the sigmoid colon
might not come down far enough.

643
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.986
Can we get the splenic flexure further?

644
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.112
It's at its limit.

645
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:57.157
His pelvis is narrow,
and the length is barely making it.

646
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.286
-Move it down. Let's try to connect it.
-Yes, sir.

647
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:03.539
-I'm inserting the body.
-Slowly.

648
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.332
Yes, good.

649
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.500
Go forward with the spike.

650
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.544
Yes, going forward with the spike.

651
00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:09.795
Go all the way in.

652
00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:11.255
Okay.

653
00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:13.382
I'm going to staple it now. Fire.

654
00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:14.675
Firing.

655
00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.135
Please pass me the water.

656
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:20.472
Put it all in.

657
00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.767
Shoot it in again.

658
00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.648
It's slightly leaking.

659
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.368
Let's reinforce it. Do we have glue?

660
00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.162
-Let's apply some first.
-Okay.

661
00:43:43.245 --> 00:43:45.664
It can't be helped.
We'll have to go with a diversion.

662
00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.958
-There's no way around it.
-Okay.

663
00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:54.131
Professor, are you all right?

664
00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:55.883
My arm.

665
00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:57.676
I can't move it.

666
00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:03.557
We pulled the stoma
and put in the Hemovac drain.

667
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:05.934
All we need to do is close the stomach
and maturate the stoma.

668
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.394
Call in a fellow now.

669
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.700
We tried to perform the stoma reversal.

670
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.453
But the tissue
wasn't as healthy as we thought,

671
00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:26.455
and the length wasn't long enough either.

672
00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:29.958
For now, we have constructed
a temporary ileostomy

673
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:33.420
so that no feces pass
through the anastomosis area.

674
00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:37.966
Then can you really remove
the stoma next time?

675
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.386
Let's monitor your progress.

676
00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:42.721
Gosh, if I knew your arm was that bad,

677
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:45.391
I wouldn't have asked you
for such a cumbersome favor.

678
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:46.975
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.978
I didn't want to inconvenience
the department.

680
00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:52.856
I apologize for the trouble, Chief.

681
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.108
There's no need for that.

682
00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.402
You were the perfect man
for the broadcast.

683
00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:58.237
Who will I recommend now?

684
00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:25.264
Why does he look so cool?

685
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:28.308
Isn't this the patient
that took aspirin as heart medication?

686
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.275
Did this patient stop taking aspirin?

687
00:45:36.942 --> 00:45:37.943
How long has it been?

688
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:41.530
I didn't check.

689
00:45:43.282 --> 00:45:44.116
Well…

690
00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.828
The patient stopped taking it
after being admitted yesterday.

691
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:49.663
I'm sorry.

692
00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.790
Why do you fail to check
important things on time?

693
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.626
If I hadn't asked,
you wouldn't have checked,

694
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.087
and the patient would've taken aspirin
until it was time for the surgery!

695
00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:05.220
Where are you going?

696
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:08.015
Well, I…

697
00:46:09.057 --> 00:46:12.644
was going to go watch…

698
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.454
My shoulder.

699
00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:01.109
Are you going to stay stubborn?

700
00:47:01.193 --> 00:47:03.070
Why do something you'll obviously regret?

701
00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.738
It's my life. I'll be the judge of that.

702
00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.783
Did you make that life on your own?

703
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.036
Jung-min listened to you,
went to med school, and became a doctor.

704
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:13.497
Do you think he's satisfied
and happy with his life?

705
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:18.794
Jung-min wanted to major in communications
and become a variety show producer.

706
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:20.963
You didn't know that, did you?

707
00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:24.258
He didn't even mention it
because he knew you'd laugh.

708
00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:27.010
Jung-min listened to you so well,

709
00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.807
but he seems to be
awfully regretting it now.

710
00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:37.145
That little punk.

711
00:47:49.658 --> 00:47:52.536
-You weren't in the surgery room?
-It finished early.

712
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.753
Where are you going?

713
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.301
I have to go push for an examination.

714
00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:09.845
Give me a kiss before you go.

715
00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:11.430
A kiss?

716
00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.189
What are you doing here?

717
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:24.234
Doctor, what should we do
about my husband?

718
00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.486
What's wrong?

719
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:30.198
He keeps saying he doesn't want to live
and that he wants to die.

720
00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:33.785
I'm scared that something might happen.

721
00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:39.708
It's not uncommon to feel that way
after a failed surgery.

722
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:42.502
But his biggest source of strength
right now is his family.

723
00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.338
Please try your best to comfort him.

724
00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.965
Will he really be okay?

725
00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.554
I'm back to where I started.

726
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:55.932
With two holes on each side of me.

727
00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.478
When your condition improves,

728
00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:03.023
you'll be able to undergo
the surgery again.

729
00:49:04.399 --> 00:49:06.526
Right, have you exercised?

730
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.906
You have to keep moving
to stimulate your intestines.

731
00:49:13.158 --> 00:49:15.118
I went up to the roof before.

732
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.454
Why the roof?

733
00:49:17.537 --> 00:49:20.248
I wondered if I would feel at peace
if I died there.

734
00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:24.378
It would have been better if this was
something I'd die of in a few months.

735
00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.297
But the thought of having
to live like this forever

736
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:29.716
makes me feel so hopeless.

737
00:49:31.009 --> 00:49:34.096
Goodness, you shouldn't say
things like that.

738
00:49:34.846 --> 00:49:38.558
You're only saying that because
you don't know how hopeless it really is

739
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.977
to have death staring at you in the face.

740
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.149
You've never experienced
what I have either.

741
00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:49.528
I don't know if I'll be able
to work again,

742
00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:52.739
if I can maintain my marriage,
or if I should have kids.

743
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:55.784
I have no certainty

744
00:49:56.576 --> 00:49:58.120
as to how I should live.

745
00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:13.760
Dr. Jeon.

746
00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:16.263
The patient, Hwang Seon-gyu.

747
00:50:16.763 --> 00:50:19.141
I think he's suffering
from severe depression.

748
00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:20.892
I'm aware.

749
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:23.270
His wife seemed very worried.

750
00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:26.273
Shouldn't we consult
the Psychiatry Department?

751
00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.859
More than half of Crohn's patients
are in their twenties and thirties.

752
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.695
So it's natural that they feel hopeless.

753
00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:34.114
It's even more so for him
since it's post-surgery.

754
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.074
But he'll be better soon.

755
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:37.951
If so, that's a relief.

756
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.455
I just feel for him.

757
00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:44.875
He's at a similar age as my son.

758
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.961
You have a son?

759
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:53.008
I do.

760
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:56.386
My son is very precious to me.

761
00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:00.724
You must have raised him
with great love and care.

762
00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.059
I did.

763
00:51:03.643 --> 00:51:05.854
<c.bg_transparent><i>But in the end,
all that effort was in vain.</i></c.bg_transparent>

764
00:51:05.937 --> 00:51:06.980
Goodness.

765
00:51:10.484 --> 00:51:14.863
Anyway, I think we should do what we can.

766
00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.449
Could you please talk
to the professor about this?

767
00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:18.950
Okay.

768
00:51:26.541 --> 00:51:28.627
-Bring in the camera more.
-Okay.

769
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.966
But didn't this patient want
her uterine fibroids removed too?

770
00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:39.513
I was going to ask her a final time,
but I never got around to it.

771
00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.931
I asked her.

772
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.975
She wants to observe it first.

773
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:46.645
Really? Good job.

774
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.909
You normally don't even glance at me.

775
00:52:00.992 --> 00:52:02.035
What's gotten into you?

776
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:04.412
Did you change your hairstyle?

777
00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:08.458
What is with you?

778
00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:11.711
You never noticed things about me,
even if I were to shave my head.

779
00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.547
Why do you have to be so extreme?

780
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.257
I know I may be indifferent,

781
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.552
but how would I not realize
if you shaved your head?

782
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.428
I'm just saying.

783
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:24.808
Anyway, even though it's unlike you,
thanks for noticing.

784
00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:30.063
Have you received cosmetic treatments too?

785
00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:33.942
You've been exercising
and putting effort into your appearance.

786
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.904
My skin has always been good, okay?

787
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:51.042
Why do you look so pretty today?
You look great.

788
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.296
Just let Choi Seung-hi have Seo In-ho.

789
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:56.256
I will do that later.

790
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:59.175
It's so funny watching them snoop around.

791
00:53:06.224 --> 00:53:07.350
Am I going crazy?

792
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.036
Mom, Dad, why did you come
without telling us?

793
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.663
We should come
since our son-in-law is sick.

794
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:30.999
Father, Mother.

795
00:53:31.082 --> 00:53:33.835
You go out and buy us
some juice or something.

796
00:53:34.419 --> 00:53:35.587
I'm dying of thirst.

797
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:39.341
Okay.

798
00:53:44.262 --> 00:53:46.473
I'm ashamed to face both of you.

799
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:51.811
Goodness.

800
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:55.649
How could you hide this horrific disease
and marry our daughter?

801
00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:58.985
How dare you ruin my daughter's life?
What on earth is this?

802
00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:01.196
I'm sorry.

803
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:02.364
Seon-gyu.

804
00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:04.407
I heard this disease is genetic.

805
00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.869
Please give up on this marriage.

806
00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:12.332
Even if my daughter says it's okay,
you should have given up on this marriage.

807
00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:15.835
I wasn't hoping
you'd give my daughter a life of comfort.

808
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:18.588
But I can't bear seeing her
care for her sick husband

809
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.798
from the very beginning!

810
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:24.344
We are begging you. Please.

811
00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:35.522
Seon-gyu.

812
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:37.524
Where are Mom and Dad?

813
00:54:39.401 --> 00:54:41.820
Something urgent came up, so they left.

814
00:54:41.903 --> 00:54:43.947
What? Without saying goodbye to me?

815
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:47.325
Did they say something to you?

816
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.494
No.

817
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:52.872
They told me not to worry
and to take care of myself.

818
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:54.541
What a relief.

819
00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:58.753
Hey.

820
00:54:58.837 --> 00:54:59.754
Yes?

821
00:55:00.588 --> 00:55:02.966
You remember that 
in Yangpyeong?

822
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:04.050
Yes.

823
00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.553
I'm craving their 

824
00:55:07.095 --> 00:55:08.430
Could you go buy some for me?

825
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.189
Hello…

826
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.588
SEO-YEON, I'M SORRY
FOR MAKING THIS DECISION

827
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.757
BUT THE REST OF MY LIFE
SEEMS LIKE AN ENDLESS TUNNEL…

828
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:51.014
Hello? Is this 911?

829
00:55:51.097 --> 00:55:53.141
I'm calling from the new wing
of Gusan University Hospital.

830
00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:55.435
There's a patient
who's trying to commit suicide.

831
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.686
Please come quickly!

832
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.750
Mr. Hwang Seon-gyu.

833
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.132
Mr. Hwang Seon-gyu.

834
00:56:31.137 --> 00:56:32.472
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:07.423
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

836
00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.342
What is going on here?

837
00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:11.386
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

838
00:57:12.387 --> 00:57:14.931
What is all this commotion?
Is there a fire?

839
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:17.684
Judging by the air mats,
that doesn't seem to be the case.

840
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.019
It seems like someone is trying to jump.

841
00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.856
It's the Crohn's disease patient
whose stoma reversal failed.

842
00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:25.900
He wrote a suicide note
and went to the roof.

843
00:57:25.984 --> 00:57:26.985
Isn't that my patient?

844
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.780
He's still so young.
Why would he make such a drastic choice?

845
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:31.865
It could be more hopeless

846
00:57:32.657 --> 00:57:33.700
because he's young.

847
00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:34.868
What?

848
00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:37.537
Dr. Cha went to dissuade him

849
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:40.123
because she's his doctor.

850
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:50.758
Let's go down.

851
00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:52.635
Your wife is waiting.

852
00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:56.222
I can't live, and I can't die.

853
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.142
This is honestly so embarrassing.

854
00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:01.311
There's no need to feel that way.

855
00:58:07.066 --> 00:58:08.818
Are you okay?

856
00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:10.862
I'll persuade him, so come over here.

857
00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:13.198
He's my patient, so I'll persuade him!
He'll listen to me!

858
00:58:14.532 --> 00:58:16.034
All right.

859
00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:23.124
Let's go.

860
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.084
Let's go.

861
00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:27.629
Okay?

862
00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:45.813
Oh, no!

863
00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:17.387
What a relief.

864
00:59:18.012 --> 00:59:19.847
It's such a relief.

865
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.641
It's okay.

866
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:45.248
Sir, are you all right?

867
00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:48.126
-Make preparations. We're bringing him in.
-He fell by accident.

868
00:59:48.209 --> 00:59:49.085
We'll take it from here.

869
00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:57.969
Are you crazy? Why would you go up there?

870
00:59:58.052 --> 00:59:59.637
You almost died!

871
01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.309
Are you okay?

872
01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.864
I'm glad you're safe.

873
01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.737
<c.bg_transparent><i>What could this be?
Maybe they are in a love triangle!</i></c.bg_transparent>

874
01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.113
But how did you two become friends?

875
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.866
<c.bg_transparent><i>I think it's a little too late
for you to be asking me that.</i></c.bg_transparent>

876
01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:04.702
You crazy bastard! A love child?

877
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:05.703
Does Mom know too?

878
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.664
Your mom doesn't know,
