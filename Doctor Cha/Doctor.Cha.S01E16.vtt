00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:21.748
Make your choice.

3
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:25.335
Between the two of us,
whose liver will you accept?

4
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.129
Decide right here, right now!

5
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.590
Make your decision, Dr. Cha.

6
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.471
I'm not sure.

7
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.267
Whose liver should I accept?

8
00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:08.670
I choose…

9
00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:35.905
I want to ride this one.

10
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.408
Would that be all right?

11
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.451
Yes.

12
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.536
Of course.

13
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.204
Are you joking right now?

14
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.290
Also, I'm not going to accept…

15
00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.127
either of your livers.

16
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.213
I'm not going to accept anyone's liver.

17
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.592
I'll figure this out on my own,
so both of you should stop now.

18
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:56.759
Okay?

19
00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.470
And you can leave.

20
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.181
You want me to go now?

21
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:04.976
-Then what will you do?
-Me?

22
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.604
Can't you tell?

23
00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.652
Then shall we go?

24
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.112
Yes, let's go.

25
00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:25.872
Hold on to him tight!

26
00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.206
What am I saying?

27
00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.888
Next time, you should be the driver.

28
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:42.889
Me?

29
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.480
I do wonder
what it'd be like to drive this.

30
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.608
I'm going to go fast. Hold on tight!

31
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:54.984
Okay!

32
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.743
FINALE

33
00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.329
CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

34
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.840
<c.bg_transparent><i>Hanseong Medical Corporation said
they're willing to take over.</i></c.bg_transparent>

35
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.885
<c.bg_transparent><i>The amount they proposed is decent,
but it's still a shame.</i></c.bg_transparent>

36
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.179
The facilities and equipment here

37
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.556
<c.bg_transparent><i>are better than other hospitals
of a similar scale.</i></c.bg_transparent>

38
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.476
<c.bg_transparent><i>Above all else, the medical staff here
are earnest and devoted.</i></c.bg_transparent>

39
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.229
Hello.

40
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.273
Hello.

41
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.691
You've done great.

42
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.734
It's so nice.

43
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.529
What kinds of patients
generally come here?

44
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.949
Some people come here
after cancer surgery before going home.

45
00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.576
This place also acts as a hospice

46
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.413
for terminal cancer patients
in managing their pain.

47
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:52.166
Maybe it's because your father,
the chairman, also suffered from cancer,

48
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.795
but he took special care
in establishing this hospital.

49
00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.799
He invested generously in the facilities
and the personnel.

50
00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.969
Should I proceed with the contract?

51
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.892
Why don't I take over this hospital?

52
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.729
I have a feeling I'd do a good job.

53
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.940
I want to give it a shot.

54
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.443
You might have already suspected this,

55
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.071
but the steroid pulse therapy
isn't having much of an effect.

56
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.115
I think

57
00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.951
it's proceeding to acute liver failure.

58
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.413
You'll need another liver transplant.

59
00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:34.167
A deceased liver donor
may show up in time,

60
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.628
but otherwise,
you'll need to receive the liver

61
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.922
of a living donor as fast as possible.

62
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.383
I guess so.

63
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.012
This isn't some stranger's business.

64
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.558
I can't help but laugh.

65
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.144
Honestly,

66
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.980
it feels like a dream
that something like this…

67
00:05:58.608 --> 00:05:59.567
to happen again.

68
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.153
I'm telling you this again,

69
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:04.781
but all of my immunological tests
including my blood type

70
00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.199
show that I'm a good match.

71
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:10.078
When I ran a simulation, the liver volume
that I can donate was good,

72
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:14.415
and there was no anatomical variation,
so there won't be any problem.

73
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.958
Not this again.

74
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:18.294
Professor Kim,

75
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:19.962
you're quite stubborn.

76
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.256
I am, so please change your mind.

77
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.508
Please give me

78
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.135
the chance to save your life.

79
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:30.932
Professor Kim,

80
00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.017
I have a favor to ask.

81
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.978
Can I…

82
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:38.981
leave the hospital just for today?

83
00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.915
It's nice to see you here,
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

84
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.134
I have to go back to the hospital.

85
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:10.096
I was allowed to leave the hospital
for a little bit today.

86
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.016
Do I look really bad?

87
00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:15.435
What do you mean?

88
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.478
You look perfectly fine
with that makeup on.

89
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:21.232
So you need…

90
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.359
another liver transplant?

91
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:25.736
Yes.

92
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.532
But I'm not sure
if that's the right thing to do.

93
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.034
What do you mean?
You have to do it to live.

94
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.828
Even if I do get another transplant,

95
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.831
who's to say this won't happen again?

96
00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.710
I'm scared I'll be causing
unnecessary suffering for someone

97
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.088
because of me.

98
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.427
How is your mother?

99
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.345
She's really worried, right?

100
00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.890
"Really worried" doesn't cut it.

101
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.434
She says she should be the one dying,

102
00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.269
but somehow things got reversed.

103
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:06.235
I think she thinks that
I got sick because she got better.

104
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.364
That she took away all my luck.

105
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:12.909
That's ridiculous!

106
00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.243
It is ridiculous.

107
00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.204
It's ridiculous.

108
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.207
No matter how many times
I say it's not true,

109
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.918
she can't seem to get that thought
out of her head.

110
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.962
She rarely comes to the hospital.

111
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:30.426
I guess it's too difficult for her
to see me sick.

112
00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:41.729
Smile.

113
00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.413
SCOOP OUT THE AVOCADO
AND PUT IT IN A LARGE BOWL

114
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:43.035
TO JUNG-MIN AND I-RANG,
WHOM I LOVE THE MOST IN THE WORLD

115
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:45.830
Dear Jung-min

116
00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:47.706
and I-rang.

117
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:51.335
<c.bg_transparent><i>You're not shocked
that I wrote a letter like this, right?</i></c.bg_transparent>

118
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.384
I looked at your baby photos today.

119
00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:04.598
<c.bg_transparent><i>You were so small and pretty that
I was so scared to hold you in my arms.</i></c.bg_transparent>

120
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.767
When did you two grow to be this big?

121
00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:17.445
I hope that both of you become wise people

122
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:20.906
<c.bg_transparent><i>who know how to find happiness
in everyday life.</i></c.bg_transparent>

123
00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:26.162
<c.bg_transparent><i>I hope that you eat what you want
and do the things you want to do,</i></c.bg_transparent>

124
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.291
<c.bg_transparent><i>then fall asleep happy
and wake up refreshed.</i></c.bg_transparent>

125
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.002
Jung-min,

126
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.296
I-rang,

127
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:37.965
Even though

128
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.594
I may not be by your side one day,

129
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:45.890
I'll always protect you.

130
00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:47.975
And…

131
00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:52.563
thank you for being my son and daughter.

132
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:55.065
I LOVE YOU

133
00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:57.151
<c.bg_transparent><i>I love you so much
that it can't be expressed</i></c.bg_transparent>

134
00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:59.570
in words.

135
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:02.490
Love, your mom.

136
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.727
Mom!

137
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.229
What? I-rang.

138
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.731
What happened? What are you doing here?

139
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.026
I was able to leave for a bit,
but I have to go back soon.

140
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.198
I wish you could always
be home like before.

141
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.075
I know.

142
00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.286
Jeong-suk, what are you doing here?

143
00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.122
Why are you here and not at the hospital?

144
00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:54.416
Mother, have you been well?

145
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.584
Yes.

146
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.671
She came out for a bit
but has to go back to the hospital.

147
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.137
I heard you went to see Eun-seo's mom.

148
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.897
She said you should go
to the school you want.

149
00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:21.026
And that you should live
without that guilt.

150
00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:23.571
-Really?
-Yes.

151
00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:28.742
I know you did it because you were angry.

152
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.870
But I-rang,

153
00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:32.329
I'm not…

154
00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:35.457
as unhappy as you think I am.

155
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.586
Getting married to your dad

156
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.589
and raising you and Jung-min

157
00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.382
has given me

158
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:45.968
many more happy memories than sad ones.

159
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.055
I know you've had a hard time too.

160
00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:52.850
But I hope…

161
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:57.938
that what's happened
doesn't hurt you anymore.

162
00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:02.318
-Okay?
-Okay.

163
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:39.730
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

164
00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:43.233
HUSBAND: SEO IN-HO

165
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.826
Mother, I'll get going now.

166
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.954
Is your treatment going well?

167
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:56.747
It's all right.

168
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.499
Don't think about anything else

169
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.167
and focus on getting better.

170
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:01.877
Okay, Mother.

171
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.672
I hope you stay well too.

172
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.927
I really don't understand you.

173
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.472
You should've led an easygoing life
after you had gotten a liver transplant.

174
00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:16.517
Why would you mess with your fate
and get sick again?

175
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:20.813
If your husband begs for forgiveness,

176
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:23.774
you should accept it.

177
00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:27.611
Do you think getting a divorce
will make things better?

178
00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.322
I'm sorry, Mother,

179
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.410
that I couldn't be
a good daughter-in-law to the very end.

180
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.127
Mother, I'll be back
after talking to Jeong-suk.

181
00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:52.094
Goodbye, Mother. Stay well.

182
00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:02.146
Why would she come home
after leaving this house?

183
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.941
How stubborn. She doesn't know
how good it is to have a husband.

184
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:26.086
She insists on making people cry
to the very end.

185
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:35.471
Didn't the real estate agent call you?

186
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.890
I heard someone came to look.

187
00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:39.183
I said I wasn't going to sell it.

188
00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.102
Just keep it.

189
00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:43.937
You…

190
00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.190
have the right to keep it.

191
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.780
You said your mother had debt.

192
00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.031
Forget about it.

193
00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:55.574
I'll figure it out,

194
00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:56.992
so don't bring it up again.

195
00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:02.498
It's the divorce papers.

196
00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.168
You don't want to accept my liver

197
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.921
because you don't want to be
at a disadvantage to me.

198
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.590
If I go through with the surgery

199
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.593
and then pathetically
beg you to forgive me,

200
00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.054
then you won't be able to reject me

201
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.473
since you're so soft-hearted.

202
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.352
That's why I brought this.

203
00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:28.023
I'll let you go through with the divorce
and I won't pathetically cling to you.

204
00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:29.608
So get the surgery.

205
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:31.944
And live.

206
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.072
Allow me to repent

207
00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.699
for my sins through this.

208
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.202
I'm scared…

209
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.872
that I'll never be able

210
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:46.834
to see you again.

211
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.337
Even if we break up,

212
00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:53.048
I still want to see you sometimes…

213
00:18:58.387 --> 00:18:59.763
as the mother of my children.

214
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.205
I heard you're getting the surgery.

215
00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:28.458
Yes.

216
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:30.669
You made the right choice.

217
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.756
I'm quitting the hospital.

218
00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:38.969
Are you going to the US?

219
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:39.928
No.

220
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.389
I'm going to run a hospital.

221
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.933
I think I'll do a good job.

222
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:48.979
And it just seems like where I should be.

223
00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.565
So that's what I decided to do.

224
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.150
Okay.

225
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.069
That's great. You'll do a great job.

226
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.238
Have a good surgery.

227
00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:01.533
I hope that both of you stay healthy.

228
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:05.871
We're…

229
00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.498
breaking up, right?

230
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.292
Yes.

231
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.251
Let's meet

232
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.003
sometimes.

233
00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:14.630
We have Eun-seo.

234
00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.463
You're Eun-seo, right?

235
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.090
Yes.

236
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.472
I came to meet my mom.
Today is her last day.

237
00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:07.140
I see.

238
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:08.850
How's your arm?

239
00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:10.644
Is it fully healed?

240
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:12.479
Almost.

241
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.816
But are you sick?

242
00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:16.775
Yes.

243
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.443
A little.

244
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:22.656
I sat here
because I have something to tell you.

245
00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.075
Do you have a moment?

246
00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:30.414
I don't know when you found out,

247
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.584
but all of us adults are to blame

248
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:37.504
for every single situation
you've found yourself in.

249
00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:41.008
None of it was ever your fault.

250
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:43.176
Just remember that.

251
00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:47.264
So put the bad things behind you
and enjoy life.

252
00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:50.809
Don't walk on eggshells around anyone
or feel discouraged.

253
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.603
And…

254
00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:55.814
don't hate your mom too much.

255
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:01.028
Okay?

256
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.496
RESIDENT MOON CHEA-YOON

257
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.499
<c.bg_transparent><i>Professor, please come
to the medical office now!</i></c.bg_transparent>

258
00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:18.045
What's wrong?

259
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.466
Thank you for everything.

260
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:23.508
Professor Choi.

261
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:26.511
You all must be busy. You shouldn't have.

262
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:27.763
We heard you're quitting.

263
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:31.391
I'm hurt that you were just going to leave
without saying goodbye.

264
00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:32.517
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:34.603
Thank you, Professor Choi.

266
00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:39.149
-Thank you for everything.
-Thank you for everything.

267
00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:41.359
-We're going to miss you.
-Thank you, Professor Choi.

268
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:42.778
Please don't go.

269
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.114
We don't want you to.

270
00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:49.451
Professor Roy doesn't have some kind
of get-together today, right?

271
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.703
It'd be disrespectful if he drinks

272
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.539
the night before operating on
a special VIP patient like me.

273
00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:58.543
He's been going on frequent business trips
for conferences and whatnot lately.

274
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.587
But a surgeon should focus
on his surgeries

275
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.631
and not waste his energy
on trivial things.

276
00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:03.840
Are you going to keep eating that?

277
00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:07.010
No. I'm sorry.

278
00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.098
He doesn't have any conferences
or other plans today.

279
00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.602
You prepared the stapler and thread

280
00:23:15.685 --> 00:23:17.145
-that Professor Roy uses a lot, right?
-Yes.

281
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.649
We can't have him blame the instruments
if the surgery goes wrong.

282
00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.485
So tell all the vendors to be
on standby with their products.

283
00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:26.071
And film my surgery from start to end.

284
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:28.532
-I'm going to check it afterward.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:29.866
Who's coming into the surgery?

286
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.618
-Chief Resident Hwang, will you be there?
-Yes.

287
00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:34.246
Do a once-over of your textbook
before you come in, okay?

288
00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.290
Dr. Jeon, since you're good at suturing,
you should come too.

289
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:39.292
We're doing a laparoscopy, right?

290
00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:42.170
Professor Seo, don't worry so much.

291
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.047
You already told us all of this yesterday.

292
00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:46.466
All the best residents will be going in.

293
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.927
We've already done
multiple liver volume renderings,

294
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.471
so we're familiar with your liver anatomy.

295
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.890
We also checked the right side
of your liver that'll be extracted.

296
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:57.018
Just in case it hurts a lot
after the surgery,

297
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.896
we've prepared
a hypodermic injection device as well.

298
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:03.608
Good job.

299
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:07.404
This is her second surgery,
so there'll be a lot of adhesions.

300
00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:11.074
Since there was a transplant rejection,
detaching the liver won't be easy.

301
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.118
There won't be an issue, right?

302
00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.620
The team in charge
ran multiple simulations.

303
00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.832
All the relevant departments
have double-checked,

304
00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:21.168
so the teamwork will be top-notch.

305
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.169
Okay.

306
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.051
I trust you'll do well

307
00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:32.470
on my surgery today, Professor.

308
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:37.225
My life is once again in your hands.

309
00:24:38.518 --> 00:24:40.437
I put too much pressure on you, didn't I?

310
00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:45.609
I'll do my very best.

311
00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:47.652
It's a cliché thing to say,

312
00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:51.364
but I can't think of anything better.

313
00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:54.117
I'll do a good job.

314
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.827
So don't worry too much.

315
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.746
Okay.

316
00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:22.771
Hello, Professor Seo.

317
00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.147
-Hello, Professor Seo.
-Hello, Professor Seo.

318
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.148
Hello.

319
00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:28.443
Hey, Jung-man, Dong-u,
Hye-min, and Ye-seo.

320
00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.611
Let's do a good job.

321
00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.321
-Yes, Professor Seo.
-Okay.

322
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.199
Chief Resident Hwang.

323
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.452
-Mi-la, I'm counting on you.
-Don't worry, Professor.

324
00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:44.167
A little more.

325
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.211
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.

326
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:50.465
-You're nervous, right?
-Well…

327
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:52.634
A little.

328
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:55.595
You should relax
and put your mind at ease.

329
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:57.430
Okay.

330
00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.432
When you're doing the surgery,

331
00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:03.353
remove the biggest piece
of my liver that you can

332
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.981
and give it to my wife.

333
00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.524
I was already planning to do that.

334
00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:13.530
But you don't have to be
so determined and remove a lot, right?

335
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:14.906
Let's get started.

336
00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.369
Administering the anesthesia.

337
00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.791
I know you'll remove it well,

338
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.627
but consider the safety of the donor…

339
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:40.557
I'm just going to remove
the damaged liver,

340
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.727
and the rest of the transplant
will be handled by Professor Roy.

341
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.853
You're aware of this, right?

342
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.730
Yes, of course.

343
00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:48.231
You must be well aware of this,

344
00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:51.568
but this is your second transplant
and the adhesions will be severe,

345
00:26:51.651 --> 00:26:54.779
so the surgery time will be long,
and there can be a lot of bleeding.

346
00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:59.242
But the country's best transplant team
will be working on this,

347
00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:03.079
so relax and leave everything to us.

348
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:04.956
Yes, I will.

349
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.416
You've got this.

350
00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:09.669
Then I will administer the anesthesia now.

351
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.008
Relax and take a slow, deep breath in.

352
00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:16.676
The medicine is going in.

353
00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:47.791
Let's do a time-out.

354
00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:50.960
Patient number 769865, Mr. Seo In-ho.

355
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:54.547
He is a liver donor undergoing
a right hemihepatectomy surgery.

356
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:56.841
Let's begin.

357
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.192
You must be feeling very upset.

358
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.027
It goes beyond that.

359
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:17.821
I'm in agony.

360
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:19.614
It's not just agony.

361
00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:22.450
I feel like I'm dying.

362
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.495
He should've just given the liver
from the get-go.

363
00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:28.915
But I never knew my son
would be a guy crazy enough

364
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.084
to give his liver

365
00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.294
to the wife he's divorcing.

366
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.131
Don't be too upset.

367
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:41.010
She's still the mother of his children,
and she was a good daughter-in-law.

368
00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:43.430
I know.

369
00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:45.557
Ms. Oh,

370
00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:49.185
is Jeong-suk really going to go through
with the divorce?

371
00:29:15.962 --> 00:29:16.880
Suture, please.

372
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:28.850
Professor.

373
00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.326
OPERATING ROOM 1

374
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:48.536
PATIENT NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK
SURGEON: ROY KIM

375
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:51.331
Mr. Seo In-ho.

376
00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:53.291
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

377
00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.126
Are you both present?

378
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.753
Yes.

379
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:58.296
Yes.

380
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:01.966
Is it true that you both intend
to get a divorce?

381
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.301
Yes.

382
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.846
PRESIDING JUDGE

383
00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:10.016
PARTY

384
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:11.768
Yes.

385
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:15.730
You've both agreed to child custody rights
and division of assets, correct?

386
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:16.689
Yes.

387
00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:17.607
Yes.

388
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:25.156
That was anticlimactic.

389
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:27.367
Right?

390
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:31.996
I heard some people throw
rowdy divorce ceremonies.

391
00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:35.041
Now that I think about it…

392
00:30:37.126 --> 00:30:38.461
I think I understand why.

393
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.131
You didn't eat lunch, right?

394
00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:45.927
No.

395
00:30:48.054 --> 00:30:49.472
Let's eat something here.

396
00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:06.948
How long has it been
since just the two of us ate together?

397
00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:12.495
Was it around when Jung-min
graduated middle school?

398
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:15.164
You know, when your uncle passed away

399
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:17.542
and we had beef short-rib soup
on the way back from Cheongju.

400
00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:20.211
Was that the last time?

401
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.089
That's ridiculous. That was ages ago.

402
00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:25.049
I'm telling you.

403
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:28.761
I don't have a memory of just us two
eating out after that.

404
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.559
Come on, that's not right.

405
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.185
I'm telling you, I'm right.

406
00:31:37.186 --> 00:31:40.148
What's the point
when things ended up like this?

407
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:42.317
Memories of us

408
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:45.486
eating together as two close people

409
00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:47.906
are so far in the past.

410
00:31:49.532 --> 00:31:51.159
It's only after we broke up

411
00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:53.828
that we're having a meal,
just the two of us.

412
00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:02.170
That reminds me.

413
00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:03.963
I heard you became the hospital director!

414
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:05.924
Congratulations.

415
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.302
Your mother must be thrilled, right?

416
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:14.265
Well, they say I'm the youngest director
in the hospital's history.

417
00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:18.603
It's tiring because people
keep giving me unpleasant looks,

418
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.314
but I'll still try my best
in my new position.

419
00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:36.079
Thank you for the lunch.

420
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:36.996
It's nothing.

421
00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:40.375
-Will you return to the hospital?
-Yes.

422
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:42.627
Thankfully, they said
they'll take me back.

423
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:47.215
But I'm not going to push myself too hard
and I will start again after getting rest.

424
00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:49.008
If you hadn't met me,

425
00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:53.096
you would've settled into your career
so much faster.

426
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.223
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:58.184
And thank you for everything.

428
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.688
You were perfect as both my wife

429
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:05.358
and the mother of my children.

430
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:09.320
Not…

431
00:33:10.863 --> 00:33:12.782
all of it was bad for me.

432
00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:16.911
I have a lot of good memories.

433
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:20.873
I wish you the best.

434
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:22.750
Should we…

435
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:24.585
shake hands?

436
00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.716
THE YOUNGEST HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

437
00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:19.932
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
SEO IN-HO

438
00:34:33.654 --> 00:34:34.864
This place is huge!

439
00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:36.532
Look at this place!

440
00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:37.867
I've never been to a place like this.

441
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.703
Honey! Kids, your dad has made it!

442
00:34:42.288 --> 00:34:43.873
Honey, you're so amazing!

443
00:34:43.956 --> 00:34:45.917
Does this mean
I'll get a bigger allowance?

444
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.085
Awesome.

445
00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:50.379
-Dad, pass this down to me.
-Give it to me too.

446
00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:53.382
-Honey, congratulations.
-Dad.

447
00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.635
-You're the best!
-Amazing!

448
00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.354
-So amazing.
-Dad is the best.

449
00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.022
You're really amazing.

450
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.190
I respect you, Father.

451
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:49.188
It's been a while.

452
00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:50.898
I heard you got into a school.

453
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.317
A friend at the academy told me.

454
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:54.944
Yes.

455
00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:56.863
I'm preparing for regular admissions.

456
00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:58.990
If I fail, I can go study abroad.

457
00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.409
I'm sorry about last time.

458
00:36:04.203 --> 00:36:06.414
I approached you
knowing you were my dad's daughter.

459
00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:09.125
I'm the one who started things.

460
00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:11.169
I'm going to go.

461
00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.423
My mom and dad…

462
00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.425
got divorced.

463
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.947
Undersecretary, let me show you
the Surgery Department

464
00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:41.449
of Gusan University Hospital.

465
00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.951
Our Surgery Department
is the first in the country

466
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.369
to have the latest robotic surgical--

467
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.996
Director.

468
00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:50.416
The undersecretary came for
the specialized infectious disease ward.

469
00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:52.001
You should show him
to Internal Medicine first.

470
00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:56.339
-Not to the Surgical Department.
-Of course, please.

471
00:36:58.466 --> 00:36:59.508
This way.

472
00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:00.426
Let's go.

473
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.436
Hey, Eun-seo.

474
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.562
How are you?

475
00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:13.606
I've been just okay.

476
00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:15.483
Are you busy?

477
00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:19.695
I have an important guest right now…

478
00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:21.739
But it's fine. You can talk.

479
00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:23.491
Do you have time today?

480
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:24.909
Today?

481
00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:34.752
I'm sorry I haven't
contacted you at all lately.

482
00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.129
My mind was all over the place.

483
00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:39.840
I know.

484
00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:40.800
I see.

485
00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:44.387
Eun-seo, I…

486
00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:48.182
No.

487
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:49.517
As your dad…

488
00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:52.728
I'm lacking in many ways.

489
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:55.856
It won't be easy, but going forward,

490
00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:57.858
I'll try to be…

491
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:01.362
a good dad to you.

492
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.490
Can you wait for me one more time?

493
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.033
Okay.

494
00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:08.327
Okay, thank you.

495
00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:10.496
Thank you.

496
00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:17.920
Is there something on my face?

497
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:22.216
You must have
some irresistible charm that I can't see.

498
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.175
What?

499
00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:25.636
It's just that my mom and that lady

500
00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.597
seem a bit too good for you.

501
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.477
I guess I did an exceptionally good deed
in my past life.

502
00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:35.688
I heard you got divorced.

503
00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:38.190
How did you know?

504
00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.443
What are you going to do about Mom?

505
00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:44.947
Your mom and I…

506
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.244
already decided to end things as well.

507
00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.163
You shouldn't let her go.

508
00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:54.957
Sorry.

509
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:57.585
It would be too shameless to do that.

510
00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.462
You've done worse things, so why not?

511
00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:02.298
You have to try
and cling to Mom at least once

512
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:04.133
to make things fair.

513
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:23.444
-What is that?
-The promotional video for the hospital.

514
00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.653
Is the hospital doing well?

515
00:39:25.488 --> 00:39:27.490
Rather than saying it's doing well,

516
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:30.159
it's more like I'm doing a good job.

517
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.210
Dad got divorced.

518
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:40.711
What?

519
00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:07.780
It's been a while.

520
00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:10.616
It has.

521
00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.204
How's your hospital doing?

522
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.956
It's going well.

523
00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:18.582
How have you been?

524
00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.668
It's always the same for me.

525
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.129
How are you feeling?

526
00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.883
I'm almost fully recovered.
My liver has almost fully regrown.

527
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.552
That's a relief.

528
00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:36.100
I came to see
if we can sign an MOU with this hospital

529
00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:37.560
to become an affiliated hospital.

530
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.479
Sure, that would be needed.

531
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.985
Jeong-suk and I got a divorce.

532
00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:49.697
You must feel terrible.

533
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.907
But just like you said,
I did everything I can,

534
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:53.284
so I just have to accept it.

535
00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:56.162
Honestly, I deserve to be divorced.

536
00:40:56.745 --> 00:40:59.165
I contributed to your divorce too.

537
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.587
You have to try
and cling to Mom at least once

538
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.297
to make things fair.

539
00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:16.557
You saved my life twice.

540
00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:20.144
I'll really take care
of my health this time

541
00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:23.355
and make sure we never meet
in an operating room again.

542
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.357
I'm happy to hear that.

543
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:27.401
What happened…

544
00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.570
with your father?

545
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:31.780
I donated my bone marrow.

546
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.909
Not as his son, but as a doctor.

547
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:37.620
If it's a decision
you won't come to regret,

548
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:39.955
then that's enough.

549
00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.709
I now think of my parents in the US,

550
00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:47.171
who raised me unconditionally,
as my true parents.

551
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.674
I realized it so late like a fool.

552
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:53.552
Professor Kim.

553
00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.971
Thank you so much.

554
00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:59.350
For performing surgery on me so well,

555
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:02.520
and for offering
to donate your liver to me.

556
00:42:03.437 --> 00:42:04.480
I'll never forget that

557
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:07.733
for the rest of my life.

558
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.986
You'll really never forget?

559
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.238
Of course.

560
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.615
There is one way you'll never forget.

561
00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:18.160
You can have me by your side forever.

562
00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:22.581
Actually,

563
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:26.043
I like you, Dr. Cha.

564
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:29.797
I've wanted to say this for a long time,

565
00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:31.882
but I'm only managing to now.

566
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:39.974
Thank you.

567
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.727
Those words are like…

568
00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.274
a beautifully bright ray

569
00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:50.734
of spring sunshine.

570
00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:53.195
But…

571
00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.115
as for me,

572
00:42:57.032 --> 00:42:59.326
I think I'm too tired now to live my life

573
00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:01.829
only relying on that ray of sunshine.

574
00:43:03.372 --> 00:43:06.125
What's precious to me now

575
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.502
is mundane, everyday life.

576
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:15.551
Rather than someone like me,

577
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.679
I think that you should meet someone

578
00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.390
who is well suited for you
in every single way.

579
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:23.517
You should get married,

580
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.686
enjoy newlywed life…

581
00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:29.857
have a kid or two,

582
00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:32.192
and live a busy life…

583
00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:38.574
as you grow old together.

584
00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:42.536
You…

585
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.165
may think I'm old-fashioned,

586
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.501
but that's how I feel.

587
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.868
The freesias are so pretty, right?

588
00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.120
I like them a lot.

589
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:27.623
They're quite popular
as they have a good meaning behind them.

590
00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:30.125
"I support your new beginning."

591
00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:34.630
I didn't know
that was the meaning behind freesias.

592
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:37.466
That's why they're popular for graduations
and entrance ceremonies.

593
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.344
I'll buy some freesias.

594
00:44:57.903 --> 00:44:59.738
-Hello.
-How can I help you?

595
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:02.616
Can I have a pregnancy test?

596
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.118
One moment.

597

You passed.

601
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:38.569
And I thought you had zero motor skills!

602
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.446
But you're quite amazing.

603
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:43.615
What are you talking about?
I have amazing spatial perception.

604
00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:46.994
Don't you have to leave?

605
00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.204
I do. It's a busy time.

606
00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:55.586
-Hello.
-Hi.

607
00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:05.804
Hello.

608
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:07.931
Yeong-ho, I'll do that
so you take the orders.

609
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:09.099
Hello.

610
00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:10.934
NEW ORDER

611
00:46:28.076 --> 00:46:31.038
Here is your blueberry chicory salad.

612
00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:36.960
Chicory has a lot of dietary fiber that
prevents your blood sugar from spiking.

613
00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:40.589
It also reduces the absorption of glucose,
so it's very good for diabetes.

614
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:43.175
Enjoy and stay healthy.

615
00:46:43.258 --> 00:46:44.301
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

616
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:45.385
Let's eat.

617
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.599
Dr. Cha, it's time for you
to see patients.

618
00:46:50.682 --> 00:46:51.892
-Okay, I'll go.
-Okay.

Thoracic outlet syndrome?

624
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:26.468
Yes, there's a triangular space
in our body that's formed by our ribs,

625
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:30.180
collarbone, and shoulder blades.

626
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:35.102
Pain can form when the nerves
and blood vessels here are pushed down.

627
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:41.275
Degenerative conditions can form
in our neck or shoulders as we get older,

628
00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.527
which also cause pain
like what you're going through.

629
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.071
You're right.
It hurts everywhere now that I'm old.

630
00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:49.658
First, let's take an X-ray
and see what the issue is.

631
00:47:50.158 --> 00:47:53.161
If your daily life is still difficult
even after taking medicine,

632
00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:54.913
then you should go to a bigger hospital

633
00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:57.124
and get a thorough medical checkup.

634
00:47:57.916 --> 00:48:00.961
But I think it'd be good to always sit
with the correct posture.

635
00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:03.130
-Straighten out your shoulders.
-Yes.

636
00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:06.091
You have to make a constant effort
to sit up straight.

637
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.885
And don't look
at your cell phone too often.

638
00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:10.596
You should never lift heavy things.

639
00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:11.638
This is bad.

640
00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.931
I have to make kimchi tomorrow.

641
00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:14.808
Goodness, no.

642
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:17.519
Tell your husband and kids
to lift the heavy things for you.

643
00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.895
Gosh, I should do that.

644
00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:19.980
-Yes.
-I should.

645
00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:23.734
This place sells healthy salads

646
00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:26.903
and you listen
to all your patients with such care.

647
00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.572
I'm so thrilled that a place like this

648
00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:30.949
-opened up in the neighborhood.
-Really?

649
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:35.245
And I even found a magazine article
that said this is a unique clinic.

650
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:36.955
You saw that?
Did my picture come out great?

651
00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:41.168
-Gosh, you're our neighborhood star.
-Me?

652
00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:55.432
-Mom.
-Hey.

653
00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.144
Did you pass?

654
00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:02.189
Of course, I passed.

655
00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:03.565
I'm your daughter, after all.

656
00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:08.445
It'd be nice if you didn't ride
a motorcycle given how dangerous it is.

657
00:49:08.528 --> 00:49:11.948
Come on, I just got the license.
I don't know if I'll ride one or not.

658
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.492
Sure, think thoroughly about it.

659
00:49:13.575 --> 00:49:17.746
I'm already getting anxious
at the thought of you riding motorcycles.

660
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:23.001
But Mom, as I was coming in
and saw you taking care of the garden,

661
00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:26.713
I thought all of this was so picturesque.

662
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:27.714
This is wonderful.

663
00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:33.804
I feel like I'm living in a dream too.

664
00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:37.307
When you received your second surgery,

665
00:49:37.891 --> 00:49:39.226
I really felt like dying.

666
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:44.064
It's a miracle for someone to come back
from the brink of death twice.

667
00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:46.066
So for me,

668
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:50.904
I don't hate In-ho or his mother
at all anymore.

669
00:49:51.738 --> 00:49:52.906
I'm grateful for everything.

670
00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.866
Of course, I'm grateful too.

671
00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:58.704
They still gave us this building,
though it has some loans on it.

672
00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:03.291
Do I seem too materialistic
if I'm like this?

673
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.919
Yes, just a little.

674
00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:14.219
Mom, the bok choy grew so well.

675
00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:16.555
They're growing so well.

676
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:19.015
Everything here tastes so good.

678
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:24.730
-Great work, Doctor.
-Great work.

679
00:50:32.112 --> 00:50:33.363
Right, it's not this way.

680
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:43.498
How did it go?

681
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.793
That woman's colon really was quite long.

682
00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:49.045
She must've had trouble
with her bowel movement.

683
00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:52.591
The surgery went well.
She'll be a lot better now.

684
00:50:52.674 --> 00:50:54.551
What a relief. Good job.

685
00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.512
Do you have time on a weekday next week?

686
00:50:57.596 --> 00:51:00.599
There's an 80-year-old man
in the hospice ward of my hospital.

687
00:51:00.682 --> 00:51:03.602
He's had a hernia for a while,
so he'll need surgery.

688
00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:06.855
Do you think I'm some kind of superhuman?

689
00:51:06.938 --> 00:51:09.649
I'm busy with both the hospital
and your surgery favors.

690
00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:12.778
I'm busier now than I was
when I was a first-year resident.

691
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:14.279
I need to rest too, you know?

692
00:51:14.362 --> 00:51:17.240
He's a poor, elderly man
with no family or friends.

693
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.493
You can't expect to sit back

694
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.286
and do a good deed at the same time.

695
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:24.790
Forget it if you don't want to.

696
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.251
Who said I didn't want to?

697
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:33.632
I'll do it.

Hey.

700
00:51:46.728 --> 00:51:50.440
I forgot to tell you something.

701
00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.275
Do you remember Roy?

702
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:53.819
Professor Kim? What about him?

703
00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:55.529
I think he's seeing someone.

704
00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:57.364
And it's serious.

705
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:02.202

-I know.
-You do?

710
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:19.803
I go to him for regular checkups
every two months even now.

711
00:52:20.512 --> 00:52:22.264
He spoke about her a couple of times.

712
00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:24.766
Don't you think it's a shame?

713
00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.101
It's a shame for sure.

714
00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:31.314
But from the very beginning,

715
00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.900
I couldn't see the two of us together.

716
00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:36.069
Goodness.

717
00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:39.948
Then did you see you and In-ho together?

718
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:41.032
Hey!

719
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:46.413
Jeong-suk, you said you were
going to Gangwon-do today, right?

720
00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.873
To be a medical volunteer.

721
00:52:47.956 --> 00:52:49.541
Yes, do you want to come too?

722
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.626
I love you.

723
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:55.672
How is it?

724
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:57.966
Your numbers.

725
00:52:58.049 --> 00:53:00.677
Your numbers are all back to normal.

726
00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.262
Amazing!

727
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:06.349
You did so well.
You must have worked really hard.

728
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:11.396
This is all thanks to you
since you visited often and helped me.

729
00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.982
I was a bit of help, wasn't I?

730
00:53:14.065 --> 00:53:15.692
Of course!

731
00:53:15.775 --> 00:53:17.611
Do you think it's easy to come here

732
00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.238
all the way from Seoul
as regularly as you have?

733
00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:23.575
I told you the first time we met

734
00:53:23.658 --> 00:53:25.535
that I'll come back no matter what.

735
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.954
Thank you.

736
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.373
I'm the one who's grateful.
You did such a good job.

737
00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:41.468
SEOPGYO-RI REST AREA

738
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:45.513
Why did she ask me to come here?
I have bad memories of this place.

739
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:48.183
-Father, you're here.
-Hey.

740
00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:49.434
Hello.

741
00:53:49.517 --> 00:53:50.477
You got here quickly.

742
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.561
Go ahead and play.

743
00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:56.399
There was no traffic.

744
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:57.651
Man, I'm tired.

745
00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.570
All I want is to go to a sauna
and sweat things out.

746
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:02.739
Really? That's great.

747
00:54:02.822 --> 00:54:05.241
Then head into town
and go to the bathhouse.

748
00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:07.285
You can go with those men over there.

749
00:54:07.369 --> 00:54:09.371
The bathhouse? And not treat any patients?

750
00:54:12.207 --> 00:54:13.750
Didn't you call me to treat patients?

751
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:16.628
No, I called you here
because I needed a hand.

752
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.131
The bathhouse volunteers
hadn't been able to come

753
00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:22.676
so the elders
couldn't take proper baths for a while.

754
00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:27.138
-So?
-So I want you to help.

755
00:54:29.474 --> 00:54:30.725
Me?

756
00:54:31.726 --> 00:54:32.811
This feels so good.

757
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:34.896
You're good at this.

758
00:54:35.397 --> 00:54:36.564
All done!

759
00:54:36.648 --> 00:54:38.817
-Thank you.
-Yes, you can go this way.

760
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.777
Okay, next!

761
00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:42.821
Sir, you can go that way.

762
00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.031
Jung-min.

763
00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.366
Lather him up.

764
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.119
-I'll finish things up for you later.
-Okay.

765
00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:51.121
Okay, come this way.

766
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.723
I guess he's really tired.

767
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:12.559
Father.

768
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:14.686
Father.

769
00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:17.647
Father!

770
00:55:21.276 --> 00:55:22.694
He was tired.

771
00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:23.778
He must be tired.

772
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:25.030
You have to go now.

773
00:55:27.365 --> 00:55:28.908
Great job, Father.

774
00:55:31.745 --> 00:55:33.038
Thanks for the coffee.

775
00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:35.540
Drink it and shake off your sleepiness.

776
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:37.667
I'm really tired.

777
00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:40.503
You did a great job.

778
00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:43.882
The elders loved it so much.

779
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:46.926
I put every last bit of energy
I had into it.

780
00:55:48.428 --> 00:55:50.680
Right, be good to your mother.

781
00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.349
She called me a couple of days ago.

782
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.644
I heard you nagged her
about the dishes too.

783
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:04.527
Mother, you shouldn't clean them
so roughly like that.

784
00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:07.447
You should clean them with chemicals,
not physical strength.

785
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.999
Then you do it.

786
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.417
You're all talk.

787
00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:30.220
-Did I say anything wrong?
-Jeez.

788
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:32.430
-Mother is just being sensitive.
-Gosh.

789
00:56:33.014 --> 00:56:34.474
Do you think I don't know you?

790
00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.560
Even if it's the truth, say it nicely.

791
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.187
Nicely.

792
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.271
-Nicely.
-Okay.

793
00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:42.899
That snow was unexpected.

794
00:56:43.608 --> 00:56:45.860
It was amazing before. So pretty.

795
00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:49.614
Will you go back to the Surgery Department

796
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.866
once you're done
serving as an army doctor?

797
00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:56.121
I think I hated the Surgery Department
more out of rebellion.

798
00:56:57.288 --> 00:57:01.000
But now that time has passed,
I want to go back into the surgery room.

799
00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:03.044
That's a relief.

800
00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:04.504
But when you return,

801
00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:07.173
you'll have to call me "professor,"

802
00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:09.759
even though I'm just
a clinical assistant professor.

803
00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:12.720
You rank so much higher than me now.

804
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:19.477
I actually took a pregnancy test recently.

805
00:57:22.397 --> 00:57:24.149
What?

806
00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.484
Don't worry. It was negative.

807
00:57:27.986 --> 00:57:28.820
But the thing is,

808
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.572
I thought about

809
00:57:31.322 --> 00:57:33.074
what it'd be like if it was positive.

810
00:57:34.367 --> 00:57:35.869
In that short moment,

811
00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:38.496
I imagined us getting married
and having a kid.

812
00:57:40.498 --> 00:57:43.168
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

813
00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:52.719
I'm just saying!
Do you have anything to say about that?

814
00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.846
Like, "I want to spend
the rest of my life with…"

815
00:57:58.183 --> 00:57:59.100
Jeez.

816
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:02.061
I mean, I…

817
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:04.022
Just now…

818
00:58:04.939 --> 00:58:06.608
For a split second,

819
00:58:07.108 --> 00:58:09.194
I thought you were going to say
you were pregnant.

820
00:58:10.528 --> 00:58:11.404
And…

821
00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:14.282
at that moment,

822
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.159
I was feeling giddy.

823
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.244
What?

824
00:58:19.954 --> 00:58:21.039
You seem disappointed.

825
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:26.211
Our kid came and left in an instant.

826
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.088
I want to see you, kiddo!

827
00:58:29.964 --> 00:58:32.967
Hey, why are you speaking so loudly?
People will hear you.

828
00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:33.885
Come here.

829
00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:37.222
Kids, what's taking so long?
You should pack your things.

830
00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:39.390
Let's go.

831
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.485
It'd be nice if we went too.

832
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:52.487
Will you be okay alone?

833
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.531
You have to take a boat
since it's a submerged area.

834
00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:56.950
No, I can go alone.

835
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.536
There's a nurse and a social worker too.

836
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:03.831
You should hurry and go
before you get stuck in traffic.

837
00:59:04.624 --> 00:59:05.583
Go.

838
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:06.501
Go.

839
00:59:06.584 --> 00:59:07.919
Then we'll get going.

840
00:59:10.755 --> 00:59:11.631
Mom, me too.

841
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:14.092
Message me often, Jung-min.

842
00:59:17.136 --> 00:59:18.221
What? Hurry up and go.

843
00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:20.098
Okay then. Bye.

844
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.685
-Bye.
-You drive. I really can't right now.

845
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:26.312
Jung-min, drive safely.

846
00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.939
-I'll call you.
-Call me.

847
00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:50.420
Hello.

848
00:59:50.503 --> 00:59:51.379
Hello.

849
00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:54.007
What's with the weather today?

850
00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:55.800
I'm a little late, aren't I?

851
00:59:55.883 --> 00:59:57.510
No, we just got here too.

852
00:59:57.594 --> 00:59:58.428
Let's go.

853
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.346
-How many places are we visiting today?
-Three places.

854
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:27.373
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm grateful for everything
I'm able to see because I'm alive.</i></c.bg_transparent>

855
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.054
So I believe that

856
01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:42.764
I'm happy

857
01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.725
at this moment, as it is.

858
01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:10.852
