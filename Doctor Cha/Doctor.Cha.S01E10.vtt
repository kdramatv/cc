So…

7
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.536
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk

8
00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.208
is Professor Seo In-ho's wife
and your mother?

9
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.377
-That's…
-Your face says it all.

10
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.630
-I mean, it's not that--
-Forget it.

11
00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.925
I need to be alone, so get lost.

12
00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.893
Honey!

13
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.073
What? Who is he calling "honey"?

14
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.783
"Honey" as in his love?

15
00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:05.291
Honey! Come here.

16
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.043
Sing a song

17
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.588
with me!

18
00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.888
SEOPGYO-RI REST AREA

19
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:22.851
Come on.

20
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.604
-Professor Seo, what's wrong with you?
-Let go.

21
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.773
Jeong-suk, hurry up and come.

22
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.899
"Jeong-suk, hurry up and come"?

23
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.901
Cha Jeong-suk!

24
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.070
Come on up already!

25
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.071
Professor Seo.

26
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.032
She never listens to me.

27
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.542
Go away.

28
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.294
I said go away.

29
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.254
-Stay right there.
-Don't come close.

30
00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.089
-Go away.
-Stay right there.

31
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.842
Put this down.

32
00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.052
No.

33
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:00.889
Put it here.

34
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.308
Go.

35
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.061
Is this true?

36
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.401
This person is my wife.

37
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.069
She sings…

38
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.948
super well.

39
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:25.914
Honey, sing one song for me.

40
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.176
See? I told you, didn't I?

41
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.931
This is unbelievable.

42
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.896
Dr. Cha, why are you playing along?

43
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.814
What's done is done.

44
00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.364
I'm Cha Jeong-suk,
whose husband was just revealed!

45
00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:03.743
Ladies and gentlemen of this village,
please stand up and sing along!

46
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.628
Come on!

47
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.800
When we first fell in love

48
00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.886
He was a dashing man

49
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.890
He reassured and promised me

50
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.226
The moon and the stars in the night sky

51
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.103
This punk.

52
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.897
Now he has changed

53
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.982
Is it true?

54
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.609
-He tells me to do everything for him
-Yes.

55
00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:37.610
She's your wife?

56
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.780
My love has become a child

57
00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:44.075
I really hate you so much

58
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.830
Men

59
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.709
Really

60
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.129
-Bother
-Drive them mad!

61
00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.132
-Drive them mad--
-

62
00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.928
Men

63
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.682
Really

64
00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:13.646
Bother women

65
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.860
-You need to go.
-Professor Kim.

66
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.111
I love you.

67
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.950
Good job trying to hide everything.

68
00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:30.538
-What?
-No wonder you were so caring to her.

69
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.958
You look alike.

70
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.252
Dr. Seo.

71
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.005
-Seo Jung-min, come here.
-Come here.

72
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.424
Yes?

73
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.177
You need to tell the truth right now.

74
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.347
Is Dr. Cha your mother
and Professor Seo your father?

75
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.059
I'm asking you again.

76
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.602
Did Dr. Cha give birth to you

77
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.896
and did Professor Seo take part
in making that happen?

78
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:55.897
Well…

79
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.150
Judging by how you're speechless,
it must be true.

80
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.444
Your whole family is made up of surgeons.

81
00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.072
How did you find out?

82
00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.449
Professor Seo
just revealed it to everyone.

83
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.492
My father did?

84
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.369
You should've given us a heads-up!
You completely fooled us.

85
00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.747
Why is the Surgery Department so…

86
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.457
No round two tonight.

87
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.292
-The end.
-Professor.

88
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.293
The end.

89
00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.920
I'll take him in.

90
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.506
What complete chaos.

91
00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.351
What happened?

92
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.604
It was only a matter of time.

93
00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:38.898
All secrets are bound to be revealed.

94
00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.192
What will you do now?

95
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.737
I'll just be thick-skinned
and act normal like usual.

96
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.657
People who are uncomfortable
can stay that way.

97
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.326
The same goes
for the people who feel troubled.

98
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.327
Not much I can do.

99
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.872
Anyway, can you deal with your dad?

100
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.017
Did you want the patient to die?

101
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.103
I understand maybe
you were too ignorant to notice,

102
00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:19.897
but didn't it seem weird
to prescribe eight ampoules?

103
00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:24.444
You're forbidden from prescribing
on your own without asking someone first.

104
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.404
Make sure to ask
before making proper prescriptions.

105
00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.198
-Understood?
-Yes, ma'am.

106
00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.700
Dr. Jeon.

107
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.203
Do you have a boyfriend?

108
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.496
I do, why?

109
00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.624
-Who is it?
-I'm not going to tell you.

110
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.751
I don't care that you're curious.

111
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:43.421
I have no reason
to answer questions like that.

112
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.674
Why did you just touch
someone else's things without asking?

113
00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:50.720
It was my mistake
to touch your things without asking.

114
00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.221
Don't touch my things from now on.

115
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.974
It's unpleasant.

116
00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.193
Father.

117
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.618
-There's a doctor here, right?
-What's wrong?

118
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.044
There's no obstetrician
among the doctors who came here today.

119
00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:26.005
It'd be best to call an ambulance
and go to the nearest OB-GYN.

120
00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:27.632
That would take over an hour.

121
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.093
Hurry up and go wake people up.

122
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.179
Bring the doctors
who haven't been drinking, okay?

123
00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:34.430
-Okay.
-Hurry up and go.

124
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.225
-Please take your wife and follow him.
-Okay.

125
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.728
Honey.

126
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.317
We're almost there.

127
00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:48.778
Hang in there.

128
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.446
-Wake up.
-Hang in there, honey.

129
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.326
Wake up!

130
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.578
My ear hurts.

131
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.666
Pull yourself together
and get ready to deliver a baby.

132
00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:02.750
Hurry!

133
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:04.502
A baby?

134
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.297
Please lie down here.

135
00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:10.800
What about the doctor?

136
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.927
I'll bring them right now.

137
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.430
Deep breaths.

138
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.482
Wait. What department are you in?

139
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.277
I'm in rehabilitation medicine.

140
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.987
I'm in ophthalmology.

141
00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:32.989
I'm in…

142
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:34.949
dentistry.

143
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.620
You told me to bring the people
who hadn't been drinking.

144
00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.832
When you were working on the Chuja Islands
as a public health doctor,

145
00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.542
you delivered a baby on a boat, right?

146
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.420
That was over 20 years ago.

147
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:51.048
I have no memory whatsoever
of when I delivered that baby.

148
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.510
Don't you think you'd know better than me?

149
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.887
You're the only one here
that's given birth.

150
00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:01.851
I had a C-section both times.

151
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.269
You're the father.
Shouldn't you know that?

152
00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:05.855
Really?

153
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.900
Excuse me, this isn't
the best time to fight.

154
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.404
First,

155
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.240
we'll need to cut the umbilical cord.

156
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:17.742
So did we…

157
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.285
Did we…

158
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:20.745
Did we bring a suture set?

159
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.121
Yes, we did.

160
00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.205
What else should we get?

161
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:24.540
What else?

162
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.963
Boil some water.

163
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.217
By the way,

164
00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.220
why do we have to boil water
before a baby's birth?

165
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:46.312
I do have a feeling
that hot water will be needed somehow.

166
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.149
Yes.

167
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.653
Ma'am, how long are the intervals
between your contractions?

168
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.447
I don't know.
The baby is about to come out!

169
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.157
She's been saying that for a while.

170
00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.246
I'll take a look.

171
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.919
I'll look.

172
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:14.882
-I see its head!
-Don't panic. Stay calm.

173
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.259
Ma'am, what's your name?

174
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.553
Baek I-yeon.

175
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.014
Ms. Baek, I'll help you.

176
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.935
Don't worry.
Take a deep breath and then push.

177
00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.311
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

178
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.687
Push.

179
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.649
-You're doing well.
-There are maneuvers.

180
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:34.527
The Ritgen's maneuver,
the McRoberts maneuver…

181
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.987
Be quiet, it's already hectic as it is.
Let me focus.

182
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:38.948
Push again.

183
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.825
Okay, a deep breath in.

184
00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:42.201
-Inhale.
-Inhale.

185
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:44.995
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

186
00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:46.414
You're doing well.

187
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.749
The head is coming out.

188
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.962
Honey, I don't feel so great…

189
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.213
No, don't go!

190
00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.589
You're doing great.

191
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:00.219
I'll be right back.

192
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:03.806
Okay, ma'am.

193
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.391
You're doing great.
The head is coming out.

194
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.160
It's 2:20 a.m. on the 17th.

195
00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:28.539
We have a healthy and brave little prince.

196
00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:29.582
Thank you.

197
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.754
Thank you, Doctor.

198
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:36.839
You did well.

199
00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:38.507
-You did really well.
-Hello.

200
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.967
You did well.

201
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.093
He's beautiful.

202
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.762
Dr. Cha, you did well.

203
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.518
We need to wait
until the placenta comes out.

204
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.645
So hold onto the umbilical cord.

205
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:52.563
Okay.

206
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.274
Doctor, something is about to come out.

207
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.943
Yes, let's push one more time.

208
00:12:58.819 --> 00:12:59.695
Professor Seo.

209
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.780
What about the hot water?

210
00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:07.912
Use it to clean the baby.

211
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:13.375
What did he say?

212
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.060
Gosh.

213
00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.437
I'm finally sobering up.

214
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.065
You must have had a lot of 

215
00:13:38.108 --> 00:13:38.943
Yes.

216
00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:43.072
Right, I heard back at the lodgings
that you did something amazing.

217
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:46.909
I feel like

218
00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.704
I went through many valuable experiences
after coming here.

219
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:56.460
Professor, thank you for asking me
to come along with you here.

220
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.758
Are you okay?

221
00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.512
Everyone found out
that you're married to Professor Seo.

222
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.766
On one hand, I do feel relieved.

223
00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.354
I'm sure you've heard about the rumor.

224
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.068
Yes, about you and Professor Seo
having an affair

225
00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:22.862
and being in a love triangle with me.

226
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.241
-I don't care about any of that.
-You'll have to now.

227
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:32.580
Since everyone knows about me
and my husband.

228
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:37.084
If people keep talking about you
because of me,

229
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.338
it can become embarrassing.

230
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.096
Why aren't you doing anything?

231
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.349
-What?
-About Professor Seo.

232
00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:56.854
Why do you stay silent
despite knowing everything?

233
00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:58.689
Why are you holding back?

234
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.400
How do you know…

235
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:03.903
about that, Professor?

236
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.489
I don't want to tell you.

237
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.533
Please don't speak lightly

238
00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.619
of someone else's family matters.

239
00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:13.287
I'm not speaking lightly of it.

240
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.540
I wanted to tell you several times
but I held back.

241
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.083
But I couldn't stand it anymore.

242
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.674
I'm a mother.

243
00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:30.429
My son works
in the same hospital as his parents.

244
00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:33.349
And my daughter is in high school.

245
00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.560
They are facing crucial moments

246
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:40.898
and I'm choosing to keep the peace
in the family for them.

247
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:42.816
So…

248
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.235
don't look at me

249
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.280
like I'm some pathetic woman.

250
00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:55.829
It's true that you're pathetic.

251
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.917
Your kids are all grown up.
Please stop sacrificing yourself for them

252
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.127
and choose what makes you happy instead.

253
00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.304
It tastes good.

254
00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:57.975
You made it well.

255
00:16:58.058 --> 00:16:59.935
What made you so sick like that?

256
00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.439
You only get gastric cramps
when you get stressed.

257
00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.321
Eun-seo.

258
00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:18.912
I wanted to create a complete family
where a father would be there for you.

259
00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.498
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.625
Mom.

261
00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:26.503
Let's be honest.

262
00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:30.591
It's not that I needed a father.
You needed a husband.

263
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.552
Mom…

264
00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.804
I'm done letting off steam.

265
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.640
I don't need anything from Dad anymore.

266
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.977
But you still do,
and that's why you're sick.

267
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.480
When will you come to your senses?

268
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.073
Will you really be okay?

269
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:57.910
It'll be just the two of us
in this big world.

270
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.329
Aren't you sad?

271
00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:02.706
There are times when I'm sad.

272
00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.875
But…

273
00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:06.543
I'm not unhappy.

274
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.671
I hope you can feel that way too.

275
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.884
I will.

276
00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.136
I think I'll be able to.

277
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:24.645
Everyone, attention please.

278
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:28.982
I apologize for ruining
the team spirit here.

279
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:33.737
But I think we should get down
to the actual truth before moving on.

280
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:36.448
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk and Professor Seo In-ho.

281
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.326
Are you two a happily married couple

282
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:43.038
who are living happily together now
and will continue to do so in the future?

283
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:55.592
Yes, it's true.

284
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.179
I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell you
this whole time.

285
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.681
This is really crazy.

286
00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:02.224
I told you.

287
00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.561
-I'd like to apologize
-What will I do?

288
00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.020
to everyone else as well.

289
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.564
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:16.530
Everyone, be quiet!

291
00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:18.240
She admitted to the fact.

292
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.199
So they're married.

293
00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:21.285
It is what it is.

294
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:24.580
If things can't be undone,
let's forget about it and move on.

295
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.373
It's the wisest thing we can do
in these modern times.

296
00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:29.126
We're eating seaweed soup
because a new life has been born.

297
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:31.962
And a new married couple has been born
in our department…

298
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:34.047
It can count
as a couple being born, right?

299
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.675
I sincerely hope that the two of you
will have a lasting marriage.

300
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:40.846
And I sincerely hope that everyone here
will join in on my applause.

301
00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:48.061
Eat up.

302
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:54.610
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENED!

303
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:55.944
PROFESSOR SEO AND DR. CHA ARE MARRIED!

304
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.029
SO THEY WERE ACTING ALL ALONG?

305
00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:58.405
SO THEY WERE A THING
NO SECRET LASTS FOREVER

306
00:19:58.488 --> 00:19:59.948
I KNEW IT WAS ODD WHEN DR. CHA COLLAPSED

307
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.742
You're going to sell them all?

308
00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.202
Yes.

309
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.787
As fast as you can.

310
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.957
The real estate that your late father
bequeathed to you is quite big,

311
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.250
so it'll take some time.

312
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.587
What are you planning to do after?

313
00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.758
I'm going to return to the US.

314
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:24.640
You drank all that 

315
00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:27.017
-Are you okay?
-Dr. Hwang, you're tired, right?

316
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.353
-That was crazy.
-You look really tired.

317
00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.689
-You worked hard.
-This is serious. What do I do?

318
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.692
MISSED CALL
EUN-SEO

319
00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.207
Sir, one moment!

320
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.292
-Please stop the bus!
-Why?

321
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:04.638
It's fine.

322
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.139
Gosh.

323
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.353
Slowly.

324
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.273
Gosh. How…

325
00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:17.901
This is garlic that we forgot
to give you yesterday.

326
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:18.902
Goodness.

327
00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.070
And this.

328
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:23.991
These are potatoes grown
in red clay soil from our field.

329
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.619
The land here is so rich
anything you plant grows to be delicious.

330
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.538
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

331
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.000
Thank you so much.

332
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.836
Come on, it's nothing. Thank you so much.

333
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.004
Wait.

334
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:40.465
Why are you walking around?
You gave birth yesterday.

335
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:43.844
We're on our way
to the postnatal care center downtown.

336
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.762
Thank you, Doctor.

337
00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.807
It's thanks to you
that I was able to give birth.

338
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.600
You did such a good job.

339
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.480
It's not much, but this is a gift for you.

340
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.734
The flowers on the handkerchief
are apricot blossoms.

341
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.277
They symbolize our wish
for your happiness.

342
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.280
Thank you so much again, Doctor.

343
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.497
Thank you.

344
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.919
Everyone, a round of applause.

345
00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:32.142
We're at the rest stop.
We'll take off again in 30 minutes!

346
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.423
Are you angry at me?

347
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.387
If you were me, wouldn't you feel angry?

348
00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:14.559
I would've been flustered too.

349
00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:19.272
But I would make an effort to understand
why you hid the truth from me.

350
00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.736
Are you saying
I'm narrow-minded, unlike you?

351
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.114
Why do you have to twist everything?

352
00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.282
Do you expect me to be nice to you then?

353
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:33.370
It's not that. I'm just asking you
to see things from my perspective.

354
00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.455
If I had told you,
you would've been so uncomfortable--

355
00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.916
Forget it. I don't want
to hear your excuses.

356
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.335
I just…

357
00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:47.676
Jeez, where did she go?

358
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.053
What is he doing over there?

359
00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:01.356
Dr. Cha.

360
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.193
Thank you.

361
00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:08.530
These rest stops are so nice.

362
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.740
They even have a park like this.

363
00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:12.742
I know.

364
00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.995
This park is beautiful,

365
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.622
and the weather is so nice.

366
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:21.918
But all of that feels unfair

367
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.715
when it feels like I'm going through hell.

368
00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.137
Dr. Kim.

369
00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:34.723
Thank you for the coffee.

370
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:38.935
But I think I'll walk on my own for a bit.

371
00:24:57.662 --> 00:25:00.165
Why is this rest stop so big?

372
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:01.958
I've been looking everywhere for you.

373
00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:04.961
Aren't you hungry?

374
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:06.713
Have some of this.

375
00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:10.258
Do you not want any?

376
00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.016
Why did you do that?

377
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.651
Why did you do it?

378
00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:35.533
I was so drunk that all my reason
went right out the window.

379
00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.452
I had no idea what I was saying.

380
00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:41.873
It was for the best.
It was tough to keep the secret.

381
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.501
I wouldn't have been able to say it sober.

382
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:47.420
Will you really be okay?

383
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.757
If we go around
acknowledging that we're married,

384
00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:54.135
will you really be okay with that?

385
00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.180
Well…

386
00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:00.475
what can I do when everyone already knows?

387
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:03.311
Is that so?

388
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.440
That reminds me.

389
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:11.111
I'm going to work
in Family Medicine starting tomorrow.

390
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.364
I see.

391
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:35.760
Come in.

392
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:41.891
I came to say hello.

393
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.185
I'll be working
in Family Medicine starting tomorrow.

394
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.104
I thought you were going to Pediatrics.

395
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.398
Didn't you switch with Dr. Moon?

396
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:51.401
I was going to, but I changed my mind.

397
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.611
Did you hear?

398
00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:56.323
Everyone in the hospital now knows

399
00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.992
that I'm married to In-ho.

400
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:00.869
He told everyone himself.

401
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:02.537
I heard.

402
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.039
I look forward to working with you.

403
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:07.959
Don't concern yourself too much
over the fact that I'm In-ho's wife.

404
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.595
Why did you choose here out of all places?

405
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.222
I heard you came here
on your wife's birthday.

406
00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:23.183
You said you'd come here with me too.

407
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:25.894
Right.

408
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:30.732
I overdrank yesterday
so I couldn't pick up Eun-seo's call.

409
00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.942
I called her again but she didn't pick up.
Did something happen?

410
00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:34.361
It was nothing.

411
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:39.532
I heard you revealed
you two are married while you were drunk.

412
00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:42.077
Word gets around fast.

413
00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:45.914
Right, starting tomorrow, my wife--

414
00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.040
I know.

415
00:27:47.123 --> 00:27:48.291
She's coming to my department.

416
00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:50.210
Right.

417
00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:55.382
Do you intend…

418
00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.551
to get a divorce?

419
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.892
Would you be willing to divorce your wife?

420
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:09.270
Well…

421
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:12.941
That's…

422
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.530
You can't do it?

423
00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:19.447
Seung-hi.

424
00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:23.410
Jeong-suk hasn't done anything wrong.

425
00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:27.831
I may be a jerk,
but how can I ask her for a divorce?

426
00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:45.640
I think the time is coming for us
to make a decision.

427
00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:50.395
-Why are you suddenly being like this?
-We can't keep doing this.

428
00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:53.606
This isn't right for everyone involved.

429
00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:57.026
Let's each take some time to think.

430
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:02.574
That coward.

431
00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.042
Hello.

432
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:13.960
-Hello.
-Yes.

433
00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:16.087
You're doing well. How is your walking?

434
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.964
-It's okay.
-You have to keep moving.

435
00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:19.340
-Okay.
-You must work hard,

436
00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.967
that way you'll recover quickly.

437
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.552
-Yes.
-It's better than yesterday, right?

438
00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:24.179
Yes, it seems a little better.

439
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.431
You're doing well. Did you eat?

440
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.730
First-year resident,
have you seen liver surgery before?

441
00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:36.483
Yes, this is my second one.

442
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.067
If you're resecting the right side,

443
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.819
how much of the posterior
should be detached?

444
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:41.029
Up to the IVC.

445
00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:42.614
Behind the IVC,

446
00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:46.075
there's a firm fibrous structure
holding the liver and IVC in place.

447
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.577
What is it called?

448
00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:51.790
I think it's the ligamentum venosum.

449
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:53.833
I guess you studied
before you came in here.

450
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.503
But you're wrong.

451
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.756
The correct answer is the IVC ligament.

452
00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:04.052
When you're detaching the IVC,
you need to perform a ligation on this

453
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.095
so that it detaches safely
without bleeding.

454
00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:08.473
"IVC ligament."

455
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:10.809
Thank you, Professor.

456
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.101
I'll work hard.

457
00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:18.399
Professor.

458
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:22.070
I have something to ask you.

459
00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.071
What is it?

460
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.240
Well…

461
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:28.952
Ask away. It's fine.

462
00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:31.746
Are you close with Dr. Cha,

463
00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:34.415
I mean, my mother?

464
00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:39.963
I know this may be out of line,
but what's your relationship with her?

465
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:43.424
I'm curious about

466
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.844
what you think of my mother.

467
00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:49.764
It's a hard question.

468
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.939
Let's just say she's a friend.

469
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:10.994
Jung-min, what are you doing here?

470
00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:15.498
Father, you have to try harder.

471
00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:16.916
What?

472
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.503
You can't compete.

473
00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:23.756
You're so not on par with him.

474
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:30.805
Can't compete?

475
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:33.182
Can't compete?

476
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:36.728
What on earth is he saying?

477
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:38.938
Fine, do what you want.

478
00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:44.485
Doesn't this square of land look great?

479
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.238
You can't think of it
as a regular convalescent hospital.

480
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:48.948
The best private retirement complex

481
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:51.242
and Korean medical clinic
will be built here too.

482
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:54.871
We'll bring in famous doctors
in both Korean and Western medicine

483
00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:57.165
and build a luxurious medical town.

484
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:02.629
The city of Jugyeong will invest
25 billion won into this facility.

485
00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:06.507
Ms. Kwak, I know
you said you'd invest in this,

486
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.928
but you should let me know
if you have changed your mind.

487
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:11.512
You have to decide quickly

488
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.641
because there are others waiting in line
who want to invest in this.

489
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:19.771
The thing is, the building
that I was going to use to take out a loan

490
00:32:19.854 --> 00:32:22.815
is under my daughter-in-law's name.

491
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.735
So I have to consult with my kids.

492
00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:29.572
I doubt they will oppose it given that
this project has such positive prospects.

493
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:34.369
Things like this
need to be taken care of quietly.

494
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:38.373
The kids won't have anything good to say
when their old folks try to do something.

495
00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:42.669
Is that so?

496
00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:46.798
Don't worry about money
and grill as much meat as you want.

497
00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:48.216
-Okay!
-Okay!

498
00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:54.806
Everyone.

499
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:58.226
I know this is a farewell party,
but I'd like to say a word.

500
00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:01.396
I'm sorry to all the residents,

501
00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:05.525
and I would like to apologize again
to Chief Yoon and my fellow professors,

502
00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.193
who must have been shocked.

503
00:33:19.288 --> 00:33:20.373
I'm very sorry.

504
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:24.335
I hid it because I thought
it would make everyone uncomfortable,

505
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:26.754
but I ended up causing you trouble anyway.

506
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.134
Though my dispatch has ended
and I'll be returning to Family Medicine,

507
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:34.262
I hope you can treat me
as you all did before.

508
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:35.888
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:37.932
Okay, let's eat.

510
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:39.600
Eat up.

511
00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:40.852
That's easier said than done.

512
00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:46.274
But why did you two
sit separately like strangers?

513
00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.776
-You should sit together now.
-No, it's fine.

514
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.111
-No.
-It's fine.

515
00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:51.446
Just eat comfortably.

516
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.322
Married couples don't
always have to sit together.

517
00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:00.872
I shall say a word too.

518
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.331
Imagine how much these two

519
00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:04.167
-would want to sit next to each other.
-Exactly.

520
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.502
But they are displaying
self-control and patience.

521
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:09.964
Everyone knows
you're a family man, Professor Seo.

522
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.758
Even all the patients know.

523
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:15.011
Dr. Cha, you're also an excellent
resident, a good wife, and a wise mother.

524
00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:17.346
It's your last day in our department.

525
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:20.516
So for today, you should sit
next to each other and be lovey-dovey.

526
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.603
Make it undeniably obvious
you're a married couple.

527
00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:25.063
Come, sit next to each other.

528
00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:29.859
Come on, stop it.

529
00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:31.277
Go on.

530
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.071
-You should go.
-I will.

531
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:34.155
I'll be back soon.

532
00:34:41.662 --> 00:34:42.747
Professor Roy,

533
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.708
Please let me pass by.

534
00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.214
Professor Seo, come this way.

535
00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:53.257
-Gosh, there?
-Yes.

536
00:34:54.675 --> 00:34:55.551
Thank you.

537
00:34:57.845 --> 00:35:00.556
-I'll pour you a drink.
-You two look like newlyweds.

538
00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.851
Two spicy cold noodles, please!

539
00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.187
I'm not paying for the noodles.

540
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.647
Let's order some more!

541
00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:09.607
Professor Seo, you should buy them.

542
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.402
Two more servings of sirloin, please.

543
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.334
Do you have anything to say to me?

544
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.337
What could I say?

545
00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:35.758
I doubt anything I say now
will change the way you think about me.

546
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.641
So I just decided to be
as I've always been.

547
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.060
That's a good choice.

548
00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:48.688
I'll do that too.

549
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:15.798
You don't look like you're in a good mood.

550
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:17.800
You're right.

551
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:19.802
I'm not in a good mood.

552
00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:23.222
I feel bad

553
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:26.809
because it feels like I caused that.

554
00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:29.937
Why would you feel bad?

555
00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:33.149
The reason I'm not in a good mood

556
00:36:34.483 --> 00:36:36.402
is because of the patient, Yoo Ji-seon.

557
00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:40.907
Her condition has gotten worse recently.

558
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:42.950
I see.

559
00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:45.328
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:47.246
I'm the one who should be sorry.

561
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.082
I went way too far that day, didn't I?

562
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.920
-Let's drink together.
-Please go ahead.

563
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:55.755
I'm fine.

564
00:36:57.173 --> 00:36:59.634
-How much alcohol is left?
-Shall I eat it?

565
00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:06.265
Have you eaten some of the meat?

566
00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:08.226
Shall I give you some soju?

567
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:15.024
Professor Seo, you've grown a lot
seeing as you're pouring your own drink.

568
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:17.401
Let's have another drink. Give him more.

569
00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:20.988
Let's eat all the food and alcohol
this place has to offer.

570
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.742
I just thought you were too good
to be treated like that.

571
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:28.412
Professor Seo doesn't deserve you.

572
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.749
I'm flattered that you think
so highly of me.

573
00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:40.049
But I'll find the path
that leads to my happiness on my own.

574
00:37:42.843 --> 00:37:48.557
It might be completely different
from what you had in mind,

575
00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:52.228
but there will definitely
be a reason for my choice.

576
00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.438
Right now,

577
00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:57.149
all I want to do…

578
00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.569
is finish my residency well

579
00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:04.907
and safely overcome these obstacles
that are being thrown at me.

580
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:09.954
In return, don't forget
that I'm your friend.

581
00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:14.375
If you need someone to lean on,
I'll come running.

582
00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.461
No matter where you are.

583
00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.220
Once you overcome those obstacles,

584
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.474
an opportunity might come to me too.

585
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:39.900
Number forty-five.

586
00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:43.487
Professor Seo gets drunk often these days.

587
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:45.364
He passed out at the medical volunteer…

588
00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:49.201
Jung-min, call a designated driver
and take your father home.

589
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:51.620
-Okay.
-Wait.

590
00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:55.124
He can go home with Dr. Cha.
Stay together until the very end.

591
00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:56.751
You don't have to go straight home.

592
00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.169
No round two tonight.

593
00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:59.420
We'll end things here.

594
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:04.258
It's great that you live together
in situations like these.

595
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:07.887
-Don't you think?
-Jung-min, get him up.

596
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.680
His wallet.

597
00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.808
-Go with me to the parking lot.
-Okay.

598
00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:14.310
-One, two.
-Three.

599
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.480
Father, please.

600
00:39:21.984 --> 00:39:23.694
How long are you going to stay mad at me?

601
00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:27.573
Can't you just stop?

602
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.283
In the bathroom earlier,

603
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.286
your mom asked
if I had anything to say to her.

604
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:33.704
My mom?

605
00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.874
Yes, she probably meant
if I had anything to say

606
00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:39.043
about how rude
I was to her this whole time.

607
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.545
No way. I doubt it.

608
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.006
That's why I told you
to watch what you say.

609
00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.176
Why do I have to hear that from you?

610
00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:48.844
Honestly, don't you regret it?

611
00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.972
Being so hard on Dr. Cha, I mean, my mom?

612
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.308
Why do I have to look good
in front of your mom?

613
00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:56.227
Did I ever say I wanted to marry you?

614
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.188
That's true.
You never said anything about marriage.

615
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:03.692
Our relationship doesn't have to conclude
with a marriage like some fairy tale.

616
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:04.735
But you…

617
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:08.155
Have you ever once thought
about a future with me?

618
00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.074
I don't have time for those thoughts.

619
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.954
It's not just you.
Everyone in the hospital has busy lives.

620
00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:18.040
But that doesn't mean
they disregard everything around them.

621
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.792
-Hey.
-I wish

622
00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:25.714
you could sometimes look around you
and be kind and compassionate

623
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.300
to those who aren't
as competent as you are.

624
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.556
-Sir, please stop the car.
-What are you doing?

625
00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:36.100
You are a poor judge of character.

626
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:37.893
You should know

627
00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.104
that I'm not that kind of person.

628
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:54.076
Should we wait for her?

629
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:56.620
Please just go.

630
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.346
Jeez, why did he drink himself
to senselessness like this?

631
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.224
He never overdrank as he thought
walking drunk was disgraceful.

632
00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.226
What on earth happened?

633
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.566
Excuse me, Mother.

634
00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:28.360
I'm sorry,
but can you get me a glass of water?

635
00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:29.612
Sure.

636
00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:56.931
I'm sorry, Seung-hi.

637
00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:04.146
I'm sorry, Jeong-suk.

638
00:42:05.814 --> 00:42:08.067
I'm a jerk.

639
00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:12.446
I'm a jerk.

640
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.535
I deserve to die.

641
00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:25.834
It hurts.

642
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.886
Thank you, Mother.

643
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.973
Jeez, why are you acting like a guest?

644
00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.349
I-rang isn't home, right?

645
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:43.686
She called and said she was going
to stay up in the study room.

646
00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:45.688
Yes, she's working really hard lately.

647
00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:47.523
I'll get going.

648
00:42:47.606 --> 00:42:49.108
It's late. You should sleep here.

649
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.652
No, I have to work early tomorrow.

650
00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:53.445
Okay.

651
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.698
I guess it can't be helped.

652
00:42:56.448 --> 00:42:57.908
-Bye.
-Okay.

653
00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:16.760
CHOI_SEUNGHI

654
00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.976
TO MEET, TO KNOW, TO LOVE, AND TO PART
IS A SAD TALE OF MANY A HEART

655
00:43:41.493 --> 00:43:43.287
Who could it be at this hour?

656
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:45.414
Who is it?

657
00:43:46.332 --> 00:43:47.499
Mom, it's me.

658
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:48.542
What?

659
00:43:50.252 --> 00:43:52.338
-Oh, my.
-Ta-da. Mom, surprise!

660
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:54.673
Why are you here at this hour?

661
00:43:55.257 --> 00:43:56.759
It's past eleven right now.

662
00:43:56.842 --> 00:43:59.219
What about you?
What were you doing up so late?

663
00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:02.056
Gosh, it's so nice.

664
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.224
Home is the best.

665
00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:06.935
MEDICATED PAIN RELIEF PATCH

666
00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:09.938
Mom, does your shoulder still hurt?

667
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:13.275
No, it's fine. It's all better.

668
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.610
What do you mean it's fine?

669
00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:15.527
Hey.

670
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.029
I mean it.

671
00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.115
Why are you here at this hour
out of the blue?

672
00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:21.450
Is something wrong?

673
00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:22.993
What could be wrong?

674
00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:26.497
I just came to sleep over.

675
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:29.041
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

676
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.585
I'm telling you, nothing's wrong.

677
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.922
I came here after the group dinner
because I missed you so much.

678
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:37.216
Goodness.

679
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.969
This takes us back, right?

680
00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:43.722
Yes.

681
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:47.393
You slept like this all the time
before you got married.

682
00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:49.353
Mom.

683
00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:51.397
Yes?

684
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:54.149
Did you not…

685
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:56.944
hate Dad?

686
00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.448
It's not like he made a lot of money

687
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:05.035
or treated you really well.

688
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.081
What was so good about him
that you treated him so well

689
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:10.999
while preparing all his meals for him?

690
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.043
If it were me,

691
00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.213
I wouldn't have lived with him.

692
00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:24.596
Not many women in my generation
lived with their husbands out of love.

693
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.224
We just did it because they were
the fathers of our children.

694
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.271
I could endure the talk
about me being a widow,

695
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:36.024
but it was such a devastating thought

696
00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:40.070
to see my child grow up without a father.

697
00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:45.909
Your husband isn't important
because he's your husband.

698
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:49.329
He is important
because he's the father of your children.

699
00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:55.419
I…

700
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.506
would've been okay even if I only had you.

701
00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:05.345
You have a big heart.

702
00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:08.432
Even if In-ho does something wrong,

703
00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:12.144
just find it in your heart
to accept it and live with it.

704
00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:17.816
He'll come to appreciate it one day,
when he comes to his senses.

705
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:22.613
Well, if he doesn't,
there's nothing that can be done.

706
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.096
Why are you here this early?

707
00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:52.017
Did you sleep somewhere else last night?

708
00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.228
I slept at my mother's place.

709
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.688
I asked why you are here.

710
00:46:58.565 --> 00:47:01.443
I brought a coffee machine for you.
You like coffee.

711
00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.321
I brought a lot of capsules too. Here.

712
00:47:11.203 --> 00:47:12.162
Are you eating well?

713
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:15.374
I'll take care of myself.

714
00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.795
Why are you acting like you care
all of a sudden?

715
00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:25.676
It feels weird that you're not home.

716
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.514
Come back home
once you get used to your job

717
00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:33.559
since it's okay for us
to commute together now.

718
00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:39.356
Can I come in for a moment?

719
00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:42.651
-No.
-I'll go then.

720
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:28.280
I will end my presentation
on the conference case for osteomyelitis.

721
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.032
Are there any questions?

722
00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:32.659
What needs to be used
if it's shown to be an MRSA?

723
00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:34.661
Well…

724
00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:38.206
We would need to check
the susceptibility test results…

725
00:48:38.957 --> 00:48:39.791
I mean,

726
00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:42.628
we would use vancomycin.

727
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:46.298
If needed, you could continually check
the TDM and use vancomycin

728
00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:48.592
or use teicoplanin.

729
00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:50.969
Yes.

730
00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.014
Thank you.

731
00:48:58.769 --> 00:48:59.728
We're all done here.

732
00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.272
Prepare her admittance forms

733
00:49:02.356 --> 00:49:04.316
and a consultation
with the Gastroenterology Department.

734
00:49:04.399 --> 00:49:07.569
Basic blood tests show weight loss,

735
00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:09.488
so what other tests
should be ordered for the patient?

736
00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:16.328
The formation of tumor markers
and diabetes could lead to weight loss.

737
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.206
So I'll add an hbA1c test.

738
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:22.459
Yes, it could also be
due to an organ issue.

739
00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:24.670
It's common with hyperthyroidism as well.

740
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:29.132
So run TFT, ANA, and RF
to see if she has any autoimmune diseases.

741
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.844
Okay.

742
00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:39.059
My father-in-law can't sleep,
has no appetite, and is depressed.

743
00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.644
He's lost a lot of weight too.

744
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:41.853
I see.

745
00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:43.730
In this case, what would you prescribe?

746
00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:49.111
Trazodone or zolpidem.

747
00:49:49.194 --> 00:49:53.407
In this case, if mirtazapine is taken,
the depression symptoms get better quickly

748
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.452
and it'll help him gain weight
as it'll increase his sleep and appetite.

749
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:21.059
Why are you still coming here?

750
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:22.394
I told you to move academies.

751
00:50:22.477 --> 00:50:23.812
Do I have to listen to you?

752
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:26.022
Just keep coming here too.

753
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:28.191
We're in 12th grade, so we need to focus.

754
00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:29.901
"We"?

755
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.486
Is shamelessness genetic too?

756
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.155
What'll you do for me
if I move to a different one?

757
00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:35.991
Are you going to give me

758
00:50:36.908 --> 00:50:37.784
your dad?

759
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.667
You crazy brat!

760
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.140
Don't mess with me again.

761
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.824
MY DAUGHTER
I'LL BE HAVING DINNER WITH A FRIEND, MOM

762
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.577
LET'S HAVE DINNER SOME OTHER TIME
SORRY

763
00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:24.122
-Dr. Cha.
-Director.

764
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:30.170
-Are you finding the work here manageable?
-Yes.

765
00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:33.840
Chairman Oh still calls me these days
and asks how you're doing.

766
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.011
He's checking to see if you didn't quit
and are still working here.

767
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:40.472
Please keep up the good work.

768
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:41.389
Okay.

769
00:51:41.473 --> 00:51:42.474
I'll get going now.

770
00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.136
Welcome.

771
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.014
I'm sorry,
but can you please follow that car?

772
00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:23.974
Okay.

773
00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.582
Sir, please just stop the car.

774
00:52:49.374 --> 00:52:52.335
You need to see things to the end
to be able to start anew.

775
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:29.998
What on earth happened?

776
00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:31.541
It's nothing.

777
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.501
If it's nothing, why are you in a cast?

778
00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:36.880
It's not as if you are a little kid.
How did you hurt yourself?

779
00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:39.341
Why are you staying silent?

780
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.509
Right.

781
00:53:41.593 --> 00:53:44.930
You're lucky it isn't worse.
But how did this happen?

782
00:53:45.013 --> 00:53:46.097
I'm your dad. Tell me.

783
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:48.683
If I tell you,
you'll be in a difficult position.

784
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:50.810
Will you be okay with that?

785
00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.897
Seo I-rang did this to me.

786
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.175
Aren't you going in?

787
00:55:49.137 --> 00:55:50.430
I said, aren't you going in?

788
00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:53.850
I'm not.

789
00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:57.228
Is something wrong?

790
00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.814
If I go inside,

791
00:56:01.232 --> 00:56:03.151
I don't think I'll be able to breathe.

792
00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:05.862
Still,

793
00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:08.156
you should go in.

794
00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:10.492
It's a cold night.

795
00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:52.700
Get in.

796
00:56:58.289 --> 00:57:00.500
You seem to feel suffocated.
Let's go on a drive.

797
00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.969
Do you still feel suffocated?

798
00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.179
Yes.

799
00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:25.775
What are you doing?

800
00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:29.487
I thought you said you couldn't breathe.
I bought this car for times like these.

801
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:35.785
You're right.

802
00:57:37.912 --> 00:57:39.497
I feel like I can breathe

803
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.834
with the air hitting my face like this.

804
00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:43.918
What?

805
00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:45.879
I feel like I can breathe!

806
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:52.051
Something's wrong,

807
00:57:52.844 --> 00:57:53.803
isn't it?

808
00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:56.473
Yes.

809
00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:58.683
Something's wrong

810
00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:01.102
but I can't even believe it

811
00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:03.855
because it feels too unreal.

812
00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:09.360
I think I know what it is.

813
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.321
No.

814
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:14.073
You really don't know.

815
00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:16.701
I think I know what it is!

816
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:26.044
You want to kill those two bastards.

817
00:58:43.436 --> 00:58:45.104
Professor Seo is cheating on you!

818
00:58:51.152 --> 00:58:52.028
It's raining.

819
00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.906
Hurry up and close it.

820
00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:56.866
My goodness!

821
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.826
-Why isn't it working?
-Please do something!

822
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:59.911
I'm trying!

823
00:58:59.994 --> 00:59:01.913
You can't even close
the roof of your own car?

824
00:59:01.996 --> 00:59:03.581
I opened it for the first time today!

825
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.126
What do we do?

826
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.545
It's cold!

827
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.048
My goodness!

828
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:22.892
This isn't the time to be laughing!

829
00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:26.938
It's cold!

830
00:59:37.532 --> 00:59:39.617
Come on, stop laughing!

831
01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.834
Come here right now.

832
01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:32.920
<c.bg_transparent><i>Unless you want the whole hospital
to be talking about your affair.</i></c.bg_transparent>

834
01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.341

Don't you think she'll divorce you soon?</i></c.bg_transparent>

836
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.971
I'll quit if you get a divorce.

837
01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.723
Get out of my sight.

838
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.559

Dr. Cha!

840
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.355
Open the door right now!
