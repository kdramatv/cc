00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.634
Doesn't love change?

3
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.052
It did so for you.

4
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.514
So?

5
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.975
Is that why you're hanging around my wife?

6
00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.103
So what if I am?

7
00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:03.521
What?

8
00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.733
Would you look at this ******** scumbag?

9
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.568
Hey!

10
00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.779
Don't curse at me!

11
00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.156
I called you
what you deserve to be called!

12
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.409
Hey, what are you two doing?

13
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.078
We should be the ones fighting, not you!

14
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.788
You bastard!

15
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.665
What are you doing?
This is a hospital, you two!

16
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.917
Why are you being like this?

17
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.712
Don't bite him like a coward!

18
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.798
You'll get hurt.

19
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.007
-Your nose is bleeding!
-Your nose is bleeding!

20
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.847
Aren't you guys doctors at this hospital?

21
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.517
That's dangerous. Don't do it!

22
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.020
Professor Seo.

23
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.024
-This is a hospital!
-Wait.

24
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.984
-You two must be crazy!
-Come on!

25
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:52.779
Can't you see you're in a hospital?

26
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.659
-This is all your fault.
-Do you want to get hit?

27
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:00.537
-Let go.
-Do you want to get hit?

28
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.496
-I'll hit you twice.
-Three times.

29
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.540
-Do you want to be hit four times?
-This is all your fault.

30
00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.916
This is all your fault!

31
00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.709
Let go of my hair!

32
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.003
All of you, stop!

33
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.720
My back.

34
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.644
We were fighting because of Bong-suk,
but why were you two…

35
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.992
Have you two lost it?

36
00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.077
Is this how you should act in a hospital?

37
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.290
What's with you? I thought you were
all about maintaining your image.

38
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.000
Have you completely lost your mind?

39
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.252
Dr. Kim, you too.

40
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.589
There are already rumors
about how we're in a love triangle.

41
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:56.217
Are you trying to give people more things
to gossip about?

42
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.928
How could the two of you
be so thoughtless and immature?

43
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.348
How could you lose control
of your emotions and let this happen?

44
00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.560
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.
I have no excuses to give.

45
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.398
We'll just say that we fought
because we don't get along.

46
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.734
-Are you serious? You're the one who--
-Enough!

47
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.490
But why are you sleeping
in someone else's house?

48
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.408
You should be embarrassed.

49
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.703
Why should I be embarrassed? For what?

50
00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:24.787
There are others too.

51
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.831
Dr. Jeon and Chief Resident Hwang
are there too.

52
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.459
I guess you only see indecent things.

53
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.294
What on earth are you imagining?

54
00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.630
Thanks for bringing it up.
What do you think?

55
00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.840
Put yourself in my shoes.

56
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.885
That isn't possible. I never cheated
on anyone in the first place.

57
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.804
And I don't have a secret love child.

58
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.224
Come here, you *******! Damn it!

59
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.309
For goodness' sake!

60
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.353
You dodged my blow? You little…

61
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.357
Jeez.

62
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:53.942
Gosh.

63
00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.486
Calm down.

64
00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:58.696
It hurts.

65
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.911
Come on, why are you pushing
yourself like this?

66
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.746
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

67
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.757
The baby is being discharged tomorrow.

68
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.801
Really? That's great.

69
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.137
-Did you think of a name yet?
-Li-ji.

70
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.055
"Li-ji"?

71
00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:25.390
Short for "Little Ji-seon."

72
00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.726
I heard it's a trend to use
English-sounding names.

73
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.524
-The baby is pretty, right?
-Yes, she's so pretty.

74
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.612
She already looks at me,
and sometimes she even smiles.

75
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.366
But I heard that's not a real smile,
just some kind of reflex.

76
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.784
She's so cute.

77
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.454
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

78
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.333
Yes. My stomach keeps hurting.

79
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.213
-Maybe it's time for me to die.
-Don't say things like that.

80
00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.132
Go to the ER, okay?

81
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.010
Can't you just take a look?

82
00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.178
Well, that wouldn't be right.

83
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:07.932
Then go to the Family Medicine Department
and get examined there, okay?

84
00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.935
Which professor is doing
outpatient appointments today again?

85
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.235
-Does your stomach hurt a lot?
-It's better than before.

86
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.155
It hasn't been long
since you've given birth,

87
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.033
so even a small symptom
can progress to a serious illness.

88
00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.409
I see.

89
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:31.789
And I am worried since you have
an issue with your colon as well.

90
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:34.584
I think it might be
an intestinal obstruction.

91
00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.337
I think you should be admitted
and monitored.

92
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:40.590
Admitted?

93
00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.567
Don't be so obvious.

94
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.111
Finish your job before you collapse.

95
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.248
Seo Jung-min speaking.

96
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.877
Yes, I'll go there right away.

97
00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.306
Are you okay?

98
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.524
My baby is being discharged tomorrow.
We have to go home together.

99
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.485
Then you should have said
that you didn't want to be admitted.

100
00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.573
The doctor said she should be admitted,
and she agreed to it on impulse.

101
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.660
Doctor, please let me be discharged.

102
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.079
Our professor requested a consultation
with the Surgery Department.

103
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:56.415
We'll hear what the doctor there
has to say before discharging you.

104
00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.709
He's here.

105
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.129
Dr. Seo, you came?

106
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.130
Hello.

107
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.344
Yes, it is that patient.

108
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:12.056
She came to Family Medicine
due to abdominal pain.

109
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.599
She has symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

110
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.018
It's not severe,
and she has bowel movements.

111
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:16.978
Rebound?

112
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.355
It's kind of borderline.

113
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.232
It doesn't seem like appendicitis

114
00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.151
or a symptom related to the colon.

115
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.695
And I suspect
there might be a little ileus.

116
00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:27.613
Okay.

117
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.200
Then I'll give her that explanation
and discharge her.

118
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.997
There's a condition called acute abdomen.

119
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.667
It occurs when the stomach or intestines
rupture and peritonitis occurs.

120
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.713
Your symptoms right now aren't
exactly acute abdomen symptoms,

121
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.923
but we can't rule out
the possibility either.

122
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:49.010
The professor wants you
to be admitted if possible,

123
00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:52.472
or at the very least take
a CT scan to check things.

124
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.224
There's a possibility
your abdominal symptoms will worsen

125
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.560
if you leave the hospital.

126
00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.605
If peritonitis or perforation
in your stomach or intestines occurs,

127
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:02.732
then it might be difficult
to perform surgery.

128
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:09.030
But if you insist on going home,
you should skip a few meals.

129
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:11.115
If your condition improves,
you can have food that's easy to digest.

130
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.743
And always keep your stomach warm.

131
00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.077
Okay, I'll do that.

132
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.748
It's natural that a cancer patient
feels pain sometimes.

133
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.292
-Bye.
-But, Dr. Seo,

134
00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:22.752
are you sick?

135
00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.046
You look sicker than I do.

136
00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:29.926
I'm fine.

137
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.303
Dr. Seo, do you want to see
a picture of my baby?

138
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.311
She's adorable.

139
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.190
MOCK EXAM RESULTS

140
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.775
I took all my stuff from the art academy.

141
00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.735
Get a refund on the fees for this month.

142
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.575
The rounds are done, right?
You all can go.

143
00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.451
Dr. Cha, can I have a word?

144
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.875
When will you decide?

145
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.296
-What?
-You need to decide

146
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.799
whether you'll get a divorce or not
so I can plan my next move.

147
00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:55.261
-You must have lost your mind.
-No, I'm completely fine.

148
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.346
My feelings are clearer
now than ever before.

149
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.724
I hate seeing you.

150
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.602
It's annoying
to see you at the hospital every day,

151
00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.103
to the point of driving me crazy.

152
00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.479
So hurry up and leave.

153
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.480
Choi Seung-hi.

154
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.357
Are you really
the impressive woman I used to know?

155
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.320
I'm disappointed
because I thought you'd be different.

156
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.572
Were you always this low and vulgar?

157
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.907
I'm doing this to avoid
being low and vulgar.

158
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.534
Ever since you began working here,

159
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.704
I had to live in silence like a sinner
whenever I saw you.

160
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.707
But I won't live like that anymore

161
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.710
and I won't stand my daughter
being treated like some sinner too.

162
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.422
You've got to be kidding me.

163
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.800
So this is how you act
despite being aware that you are a sinner?

164
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.636
Sure, thanks for bringing this up.

165
00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.556
During college, when I got pregnant
and married In-ho,

166
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:42.350
you…

167
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:45.061
looked at me with such loathing
until we graduated.

168
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:49.148
You disregarded me and looked at me
with such disdain that it was humiliating.

169
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.568
You didn't allow me to forget
my wrongdoing until we graduated.

170
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:57.365
But you find it unfair that you were
treated like a sinner for a few months?

171
00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:00.368
Are you that angry that your daughter
has to start college a year late?

172
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.996
This doesn't make things fair.

173
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.585
Sure, if you don't want to quit,
keep working here.

174
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.586
But in return,

175
00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.005
while I'm receiving my training,

176
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.050
you'll have a constant reminder
of what you've done

177
00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.551
every time you look at my face.

178
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.227
Then can I take back what's mine?

179
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.312
The happy family you maintained
for over 20 years,

180
00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.357
the very thing you stole from me?

181
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:34.527
You lunatic.

182
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.821
Watch what you say. I'm your advisor.

183
00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.323
-Know your place.
-How unfortunate.

184
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.159
That's all you can say to me now, right?

185
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.744
Right?

186
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:48.666
Is your goal to torture me?
Or is it Seo In-ho?

187
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.876
I don't have to explain anything to you.

188
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.338
Stop dragging this out and decide.

189
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.216
I already said this,
but I'm not quitting this hospital.

190
00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:59.093
So if anything, you quit.

191
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.846
Or expose everything
and see what will happen afterward!

192
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.402
Aren't you even curious about Eun-seo?

193
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.904
She'll probably fail
to go to college this year!

194
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.615
She can't draw and she quit her academy.

195
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.452
And they don't know how long
it'll take for her to recover!

196
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:27.955
Say something!

197
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.458
Is that why you went to Jeong-suk?

198
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.668
Yes, and I'm not quitting this hospital.

199
00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.880
If she can't take it,
she should leave instead of me.

200
00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:38.924
I'm not backing down anymore.
I'm getting back what was mine.

201
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.927
Why? Can I not?

202
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.762
Can't I just have a regular family?

203
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.764
Does Eun-seo have to live
without a father forever?

204
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.814
Seung-hi, I don't know if this is right.

205
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.733
Looking at how things turned out,

206
00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:58.027
we could be fated for each other.

207
00:12:58.652 --> 00:12:59.737
Let's talk after work.

208
00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:05.117
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

209
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.537
Excuse me, please show me
Yoo Ji-seon's CT scan.

210
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.130
Gosh.

211
00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.385
<c.bg_transparent><i>This is a report
about a patient in the ER.</i></c.bg_transparent>

212
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:27.014
She is a 21-year-old woman
with whole abdomen DT and RT.

213
00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.934
Her WBC is up to 18,000,
her hemoglobin is up to 8.5,

214
00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.019
and her CRP is up to 56
according to her labs.

215
00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:34.396
And free air has been observed
in her chest PA.

216
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.023
The CT scan shows
perforation of a gastric ulcer

217
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:39.026
<c.bg_transparent><i>and a lot of fluid buildup in
her peritoneum and bowel material soiling.</i></c.bg_transparent>

218
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.278
Shouldn't you report this to
the Gastrointestinal Surgery Department?

219
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:44.740
Most of the professors are at a conference
and thus out of office.

220
00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.825
And the ones remaining
are in the middle of surgeries.

221
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.536
You're the professor on duty today,

222
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.204
I came to you because it was so urgent.

223
00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:52.456
Her vitals?

224
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.500
Her BP is 90 over 50,
and heart rate is 105.

225
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.834
Her fever is at 38.1°.

226
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:59.129
-Is a vasopressor agent being used?
-Yes, a central line was inserted

227
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.798
to administer a low dosage of dopamine.

228
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.467
And she's been given 500cc of fluid.

229
00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.261
What's the patient's name?

230
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.388
Yoo Ji-seon.

231
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:11.392
Get an anesthesiologist, secure an OR,
and get a consent form.

232
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.978
Warn the guardians about the situation.

233
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.312
I'll go straight to the OR.

234
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.272
Okay, thank you.

235
00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:29.076
Jeez, the smell.

236
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.786
It was like this
for longer than I thought.

237
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.920
The lesions are too severe for an ulcer.

238
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.923
Isn't this perforated cancer?

239
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.426
I can feel small nodules
on her abdominal wall.

240
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.720
I think it's peritoneal seeding.

241
00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.472
Isn't this a patient with colon cancer
that metastasized to the liver?

242
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.391
Has it metastasized to the stomach?

243
00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:54.226
Rather than metastasis to the stomach,

244
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.770
it's a gastric cancer perforation
with peritoneal seeding.

245
00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.772
Then it is a double primary cancer?

246
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.983
We'll need to do a biopsy to be sure.

247
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.795
The situation is really bad,
but let's give it a shot.

248
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.714
Prepare a lot of warm saline irrigation.

249
00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:26.425
Contact the Pathology Department
for a biopsy.

250
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.801
Okay.

251
00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:44.985
Have you eaten?

252
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.779
Like you even care.

253
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:53.744
Choi Seung-hi said
I should quit and divorce you.

254
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.916
She seemed to want
to settle down with you.

255
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.834
Do you feel the same?

256
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.795
Would you two be happy if I bow out?

257
00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:05.130
What are you on about?
I have no intention of doing that.

258
00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.298
I don't care.

259
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.842
I don't care
if you two settle down or not.

260
00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.135
Just don't get on my nerves.

261
00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.430
Don't drive me crazier than I already am.

262
00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.182
Give me some time.

263
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.393
I'll end things.

264
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.899
Seung-hi, I have something to say.

265
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.819
Say it. Just don't say
that we should break up.

266
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.489
If you say that, I'm going to kill you.

267
00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.537
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:39.081
I really have no words.

269
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.125
Shut up.

270
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.127
I'll do my best for Eun-seo.

271
00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:45.796
But I need to go back…

272
00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.674
to where I belong.

273
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.720
My life went off track
because of my own mistakes,

274
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:55.222
but I think it's time to set things right.

275
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:58.726
I don't think I'll get another chance.

276
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.731
I know this is cruel to you,
and I'm so sorry.

277
00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:07.359
But this could be the best for you too.

278
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.403
Think of it like that.

279
00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:10.529
You're…

280
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.073
abandoning me again?

281
00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:16.702
You can live a better life without me.

282
00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:20.205
You're the only one
who doesn't see that like a fool.

283
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:22.249
Why are you deciding that for me?

284
00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:24.835
Do you know
how lonely I was this whole time?

285
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:28.380
Do you really not know how much Eun-seo

286
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.215
needs a father?

287
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:34.428
Even if you go back,

288
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:37.264
you won't be treated like you were before.

289
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.892
They'll be hard on you
until the day you die.

290
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:41.685
I know.

291
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.979
But you are still going back?

292
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.024
Do you love your wife?

293
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:48.567
I…

294
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.320
rely on her a lot.

295
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.323
When I think about it,

296
00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.785
I depended on her a lot
when we had the kids

297
00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.287
at such a young age

298
00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.582
and when my father was sick.

299
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.418
So I want to spend the rest of my life

300
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.879
asking for her forgiveness.

301
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:14.468
So now you're saying
you've depended on your wife?

302
00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.096
Ask for forgiveness?

303
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.432
If you had any conscience,
you wouldn't say that.

304
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.602
You don't have a right
to be saying those things.

305
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:27.981
If things end between us,
I'll be the one to end them.

306
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.109
If you say something like this again,

307
00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.403
it'll be me who exposes everything,
not your wife.

308
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.405
-Do you understand?
-Seung-hi.

309
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.575
Don't be so obstinate.

310
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.870
You horrible bastard.

311
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.373
You cowardly jerk.

312
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.834
You piece of trash.

313
00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:47.269
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

314
00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:10.209
What is it?

315
00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.260
Tell me in detail.

316
00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:32.564
Are you here for Jung-min?

317
00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.858
He's not at work
and he's not answering his phone.

318
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.528
I came here thinking he might be home.

319
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.532
-What about Mother?
-She's not here.

320
00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:44.826
I-rang isn't back from her academy.

321
00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.329
How weak of him.

322
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.332
How dare he try to hide
instead of fixing this mess?

323
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.792
This isn't the time to be saying that.

324
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.670
I'm just upset, that's all!

325
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.181
Yes, hello.

326
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.350
Hello, ma'am.

327
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.853
<c.bg_transparent><i>Did you know that
I-rang's mock exam grades have come out?</i></c.bg_transparent>

328
00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:12.771
Yes.

329
00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:16.650
But I haven't been able to check them yet.

330
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:21.154
<c.bg_transparent><i>Her national rank fell
by a lot this time around.</i></c.bg_transparent>

331
00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:23.657
And I-rang is feeling very discouraged.

332
00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:26.451
And on top of that…

333
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:29.079
Yes.

334
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.666
Yes, of course.

335
00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.130
Yes, okay.

336
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:41.633
Thank you.

337
00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:48.015
Was that I-rang's homeroom teacher?

338
00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:49.891
What did she say?

339
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.102
Her mock exam grades fell by a lot.

340
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.107
See, I knew this would happen!

341
00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.527
She slacked off
now that she's pursuing art.

342
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.613
I told you she shouldn't slack off
even if she changes her academic path!

343
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.324
Whose fault is this?

344
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:10.162
I-rang doesn't talk at school lately.

345
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.290
The teacher asked me
if something is going on at home.

346
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:16.626
Do you not understand
what caused all this?

347
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.093
There's no time for this. Get changed.

348
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:27.554
We have to go somewhere.

349
00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:56.083
I am so deeply sorry for your loss.

350
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:06.760
The doctor who neglected my daughter
is your son, is he not?

351
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:12.182
How come you two are here
instead of your son who killed my child?

352
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:18.188
You thought you could leave her to die
just because she was terminally ill?

353
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:20.899
This is medical malpractice!

354
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:23.985
I'm going to sue all of you!

355
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:27.405
I'm going to sue you
and see that you all go to jail!

356
00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:30.117
Enough, stop it.

357
00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.035
Ji-seon can hear you.

358
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.329
I'm saying it so she does hear me!

359
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:40.252
How can you discharge a sick patient
without saying a word to her guardian?

360
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:42.587
This is clearly medical malpractice.
Take responsibility!

361
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.049
Gosh, I feel so bad for our Ji-seon.
What do we do?

362
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.926
How shameless of you to come!

363
00:23:48.885 --> 00:23:50.387
Bring that doctor here right now!

364
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:54.224
Gosh, our poor Ji-seon.

365
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:57.769
How will you take responsibility
for what happened to Ji-seon?

366
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:58.979
How?

367
00:23:59.062 --> 00:24:02.149
Don't just sit there, say something!

368
00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:05.902
-What do we do for our poor Ji-seon?
-Darn it.

369
00:24:22.502 --> 00:24:24.087
SEO JUNG-MIN

370
00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:27.841
-Dr. Jeon.
-Yes?

371
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:31.094
The patient Hong Seo-hui wants to see you
because her pain is severe.

372
00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:32.929
Okay, I'll go there now.

373
00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:35.807
Dr. Jeon, I saw Dr. Seo Jung-min earlier.

374
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.059
Where?

375
00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:04.502
Family Medicine requested

376
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:07.714
a consultation with our department
regarding that patient, right?

377
00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:08.715
When was that?

378
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.801
The day she was discharged.

379
00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:13.720
Who was the doctor in charge?

380
00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:16.473
A third-year named Park Ji-yeon.
She's our chief resident.

381
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.935
-Why?
-I'm just checking the facts.

382
00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.145
We need to check
who should be held accountable.

383
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.024
Your department might've
misdiagnosed her in the first place.

384
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:29.903
Did you see the chart?

385
00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:31.363
I did.

386
00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:35.283
We asked General Surgery to take a look
before discharging her.

387
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:38.703
And Jung-min came
and said she could be discharged.

388
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.875
I know this hurts,
but Jung-min is at fault here.

389
00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:46.836
At the very least,
tests should have been run.

390
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:50.340
So why are you talking
about accountability?

391
00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:54.177
Still, we need to make it so that
this was a mistake by your department.

392
00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:58.390
So that the worst won't happen
to Jung-min.

393
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:02.978
Choi Seung-hi was in charge.

394
00:26:04.312 --> 00:26:06.314
If you keep making an issue of this,

395
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.483
Seung-hi might become
embroiled in this too.

396
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.569
I broke up with Seung-hi.

397
00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:13.530
As if.

398
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.909
To be exact,
we're in the middle of breaking up.

399
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.371
I'll resolve Jung-min's predicament,
so don't worry.

400
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.373
And if you do break up?

401
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:25.542
That makes it okay to do this to her?

402
00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.336
This is for my son.

403
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:31.548
This is hilarious.

404
00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:34.843
Why do I suddenly feel bad for Seung-hi?

405
00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:38.388
I can't just sit back and watch
Jung-min hit rock bottom.

406
00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:39.681
So don't say anything.

407
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.069
They found Jung-min.

408
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.116
I'll take care of I-rang.

409
00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:01.911
You go meet with Jung-min
and make him come to his senses.

410
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:03.413
Right now, Jung-min needs you

411
00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:05.665
more than he needs me.

412
00:27:08.418 --> 00:27:09.419
What about us?

413
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:12.505
What's going to happen to us?

414
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.135
Jeong-suk.

415
00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:19.846
Can't you forgive me?

416
00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.751
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

417
00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:56.424
THE LATE YOO JI-SEON

418
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:39.801
Before…

419
00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:43.430
I started my residency,

420
00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.975
I almost died from acute liver failure.

421
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:51.938
I was so bitter about almost dying,

422
00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:54.399
so I can't even imagine
the pain you are in…

423
00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.195
after losing your own child.

424
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:01.781
I think

425
00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:05.785
I might know why Ji-seon
wanted to give birth to her baby…

426
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.830
so badly.

427
00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:12.667
So her mom and dad wouldn't be lonely.

428
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.503
So they wouldn't give up on life.

429
00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:19.048
It was her own method

430
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:21.509
of providing her parents a way

431
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.387
to continue to live through her child.

432
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.437
Ji-seon…

433
00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:36.024
always seemed like she knew that

434
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.778
she was going to leave like this one day.

435
00:29:41.821 --> 00:29:44.991
So please understand her wishes.

436
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:52.290
Live happily with the angel
your daughter left behind.

437
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.375
And…

438
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:58.296
later on,

439
00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:00.882
you'll meet her again.

440
00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:09.182
Why…

441
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.478
aren't you asking me to forgive your son?

442
00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:19.484
I don't have the right to ask you that.

443
00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:44.717
ACCESSIBLE PARKING

444
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:12.203
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

445
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.746
<c.bg_transparent><i>Did you apply
for your disability rating yet?</i></c.bg_transparent>

446
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:15.331
Disability rating?

447
00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:21.880
But what's the point?
There aren't many benefits.

448
00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:24.883
What are you talking about?
With parking so difficult these days,

449
00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:26.843
it's great to park
in a disabled parking space.

450
00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:28.344
The spot is great too.

451
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:47.989
Jeong-suk can't come today.

452
00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:50.033
I know.

453
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:55.246
You know, and yet you keep looking around
thinking she might show up.

454
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.164
What?

455
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.295
-Well…
-If you don't have plans today,

456
00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:04.380
how about an afternoon drink
after the run?

457
00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:12.972
This is about the time
when our true selves need to come out.

458
00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:16.893
I'm all about give and take.

459
00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:21.272
With that in mind, I'll tell you a secret.

460
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.942
But can I ask you something in return?

461
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:26.235
Okay.

462
00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.487
You're good-looking.

463
00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:33.284
I've actually run a full marathon.

464
00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:36.329
I finished nine of them.
You didn't know, right?

465
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:38.915
You probably had no idea.

466
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:41.000
I acted my heart out
if I do say so myself.

467
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.380
Okay, your turn.

468
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:47.924
Do you like Jeong-suk?

469
00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:57.225
But I already knew
you completed a full marathon.

470
00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:01.896
Your posture
and breathing were too stable.

471
00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.149
Darn it.

472
00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:07.819
Then I'll tell you a different secret.

473
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:12.657
I joined this crew
because I was interested in you.

474
00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.453
But now, it's totally not like that.

475
00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:20.206
Now you're just a fellow crew member.

476
00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:24.961
Okay, now it's your turn to talk.

477
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.505
About Jeong-suk.

478
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.009
I…

479
00:33:39.308 --> 00:33:40.727
I flunked the mock exam.

480
00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:42.520
I heard.

481
00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:45.064
I really wanted to show Dad.

482
00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:50.319
That I chose art school
not because I couldn't go to med school.

483
00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:52.822
I wanted to prove that.

484
00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:54.824
I'm so annoyed.

485
00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:59.912
You should be studying for yourself.

486
00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:01.622
Not to rebel against someone.

487
00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:04.500
Mom.

488
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.794
That was so cliché.

489
00:34:08.921 --> 00:34:09.797
No way.

490
00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:15.470
I'd rather have you yell at me
for failing the exam.

491
00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:19.849
How can I yell at you guys
after giving you all that stress?

492
00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:24.771
Resolving these situations

493
00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:26.689
won't be easy.

494
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.277
But I'll resolve it
in the most peaceful way possible.

495
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:37.075
So that you two and I will suffer
the least amount of damage possible.

496
00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:42.789
I saw it on TV,

497
00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:44.957
but you raised me way too freely.

498
00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:50.004
Are you criticizing me by saying
the way I raised you was wrong?

499
00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.716
Look at you.

500
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:58.679
You're really not holding back
now that you're all grown-up, are you?

501
00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.807
Thankfully, Dad was the complete opposite,

502
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.017
so I ended up being
only moderately spoiled.

503
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.229
If not, I might've become
a complete delinquent.

504
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:07.980
A delinquent?

505
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:11.067
Jeez.

506
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:20.576
I…

507
00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:26.457
wanted my kids
to be a little immature as they grew up.

508
00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:30.878
I would always be there
when you came home,

509
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:35.675
and if you wanted something,
you'd badger me for it.

510
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.554
I never got a chance to be like that.

511
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:47.270
So simply put, the way I raised you
was totally intentional.

512
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:50.189
Then you achieved your goal.

513
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:54.152
Of course. Look, I raised you freely,

514
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:56.028
and that helped you find your own path.

515
00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.322
That is true.

516
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.369
But I still don't understand.

517
00:36:03.953 --> 00:36:07.748
I wonder who you take after
to draw so well?

518
00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:16.174
This patient was admitted to our hospital
for colon cancer surgery.

519
00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:21.095
The primary cause
we're looking at is old age.

520
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:25.725
And based on our investigation,
given the patient's old age,

521
00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:29.187
the eating habits
that had continued until now

522
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.564
were extremely lacking in dietary fiber.

523
00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:34.108
The patient also consumed a lot of foods

524
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:37.653
that were high in fat as well as a lot
of refined and processed foods.

525
00:36:37.737 --> 00:36:39.655
So we are looking at that as the cause.

526
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.040
-Where on earth--
-Don't say that!

527
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:52.460
I'm not saying you should coddle him.

528
00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:54.795
Just don't trample all over him.

529
00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:01.928
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:09.560
When I was on night duty in the ER
as a first-year,

531
00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:13.314
three patients from a car crash
came in at the same time.

532
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:18.194
All of their vitals were unstable,
and they were all gushing out blood.

533
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:23.699
It was an extremely critical situation,
but we didn't have many doctors.

534
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:28.162
I thought I would have to declare
all of them dead at that rate.

535
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.707
But thankfully two of them
received surgery in time and survived.

536
00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.001
What about the other one?

537
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.420
There were only two options in my head.

538
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.549
One was to wait for a professor
who could perform surgery.

539
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:42.051
The other was to transfer them.

540
00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.471
I decided to transfer them
to a different hospital.

541
00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:48.766
But during the transfer,

542
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:52.561
the patient went into cardiac arrest
and was pronounced DOA.

543
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.235
If I had waited, wouldn't the patient
have received surgery?

544
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:01.529
Then wouldn't the patient have lived?

545
00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:03.739
Those were some of the thoughts I had.

546
00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:06.117
That's when I realized.

547
00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:08.369
That a doctor's judgment

548
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:11.539
determines whether a patient
will live or die.

549
00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:15.835
Jung-min.

550
00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:21.424
The fact is that the patient died.
There's no denying that.

551
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.301
Yes.

552
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:27.346
If you want to be a good doctor,
you can't avoid this situation.

553
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.889
If you want to protest, then do so.

554
00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.100
If you made a mistake,
admit it and ask for forgiveness.

555
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.478
Don't forget your mistake
and learn from it.

556
00:38:35.229 --> 00:38:37.315
So that you can make the right judgments.

557
00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:40.693
So that you can help even more people.

558
00:38:43.612 --> 00:38:45.323
That's how we all become doctors.

559
00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:47.658
Okay.

560
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.329
I don't know
if you'll agree with me on this,

561
00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:53.539
but you definitely…

562
00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.377
have sides to you that are better than me.

563
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.095
Are you okay?

564
00:39:50.262 --> 00:39:51.097
No.

565
00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:52.890
If I could,

566
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.351
I want to just disappear.

567
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.186
As you already know,

568
00:39:58.854 --> 00:40:00.106
I'm not great with words.

569
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:01.732
And…

570
00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:07.071
there are no words right now
that will make you feel better.

571
00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.741
But I can promise you this.

572
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:14.245
Until you find a way
to get back on your feet,

573
00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.124
I'll stay by your side

574
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:22.253
if you allow me to.

575
00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.662
Her family is threatening to sue.

576
00:40:56.745 --> 00:40:58.747
The hospital will respond accordingly,

577
00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.250
but since Jung-min was the one
who discharged her,

578
00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:03.085
the family is finding fault with that.

579
00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:06.922
Jung-min needs to try to make an effort
to come to an agreement.

580
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:10.551
It may seem unfair in your position,
but what can be done?

581
00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:14.722
It'd be best to settle things
before this situation grows any bigger.

582
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.892
I fully understand what you are saying.

583
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:22.938
But I still think this situation needs
to be looked into more carefully.

584
00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:26.525
Professor Seo In-ho

585
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:29.653
is trying to pin this medical accident
on our department.

586
00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:32.198
Since this involves his son,

587
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.784
he's dead set on making sure
our department takes the fall for it.

588
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.498
Jeez, you didn't know?

589
00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.374
Professor Seo?

590
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:44.752
He's brazenly trying
to force a lie on everyone.

591
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:46.337
That patient

592
00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:48.714
was your patient, Professor Choi.

593
00:41:48.797 --> 00:41:49.757
Defend yourself.

594
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.593
Otherwise, you might end up
on the chopping block.

595
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.229
Professor Kim.

596
00:42:06.148 --> 00:42:07.358
Can't eat, right?

597
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:10.945
I guess not.

598
00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:14.240
You were due for a checkup, you know.

599
00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:15.157
Right.

600
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.035
I had some medication left, so I forgot.

601
00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:20.412
-I should go.
-You have some left,

602
00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:22.665
which means you forgot to take them.

603
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:24.583
That's not true.

604
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:27.503
The one thing I do for sure
is take my medication regularly.

605
00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:31.048
Are you going to keep lying?

606
00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:36.887
Actually, I forgot a couple of times
and didn't take them.

607
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.391
You're not eating
or taking your medication.

608
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:44.520
This won't do.
I'll wait until you finish your meal.

609
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.231
There's no need for that, Professor.

610
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:48.941
Dr. Cha.

611
00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:53.320
Take just half of the energy you use
on others and use it for yourself.

612
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.782
If you continue to neglect
taking care of yourself,

613
00:42:56.865 --> 00:42:58.534
something really bad may happen.

614
00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:02.913
I have the right to nag you.

615
00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:07.543
Of course. I'll take my medication
regularly starting now.

616
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.378
And I'll eat well too.

617
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:11.338
Thank you for worrying about me.

618
00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:24.768
Professor Seo.

619
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.984
I heard you were blaming our department
for the cancer patient.

620
00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:37.031
The patient was admitted
and discharged by Family Medicine,

621
00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.533
so you should take responsibility
if something occurs.

622
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.452
How is that
our department's responsibility?

623
00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:43.245
We requested a consultation,

624
00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:46.498
and your department took one look
and discharged her right away.

625
00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:49.960
We did?

626
00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:52.087
Hey, Seo In-ho!

627
00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:56.550
I know that your resident
called my resident

628
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:59.428
confirming that you gave the okay
for the patient's discharge.

629
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:01.263
Do you really not know that?

630
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:04.433
She was discharged
before the official answer was closed.

631
00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:07.770
Even if that was the case,
the official decision to discharge

632
00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:09.396
is made by the department
that admitted her.

633
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.066
Technically, isn't she a patient
from your department?

634
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.611
That's why we asked for a consultation,
so your resident looked into her,

635
00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:17.905
and you even gave the okay too.

636
00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:19.365
If the surgery department says so,

637
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.700
there's no reason for us
not to discharge her.

638
00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:24.745
My resident seems
to have made some mistakes.

639
00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:27.039
In that regard, I'll give him a warning.

640
00:44:27.122 --> 00:44:30.668
Giving him a warning
won't solve the issue here, will it?

641
00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:31.794
I'm not sure.

642
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:34.004
If the records were left in detail,

643
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.465
and he carried out
all the necessary duties,

644
00:44:36.548 --> 00:44:39.093
then that means the patient
neglected his warning and went home.

645
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:43.138
Regarding the peritonitis, we actively
and aggressively performed surgery,

646
00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:44.598
but it did not go well.

647
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.809
So it's hard to say
it's the hospital's fault.

648
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:51.980
Regardless, the fact that my department
is involved in this incident offends me.

649
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:54.316
Of course, Family Medicine is involved.

650
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.363
Medical accidents can occur regardless
of someone's intention or wrongdoing.

651
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:02.908
But someone always
has to be held accountable.

652
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.994
So we need to officially decide
who is responsible.

653
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:08.539
If my department suffers because of this--

654
00:45:08.622 --> 00:45:11.750
If the patient was admitted
after seeing Family Medicine--

655
00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.252
Regardless,

656
00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:14.920
please take back what you said

657
00:45:15.003 --> 00:45:17.631
about how Family Medicine
should be held responsible.

658
00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:21.593
-What?
-I'll take it that you'll do as I asked.

659
00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:50.664
You came again.

660
00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:52.583
Actually,

661
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:56.086
I came because
I have something to tell you both.

662
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.965
The resident who discharged her
came before too.

663
00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:01.592
He left after crying on his knees.

664
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:05.179
But doing that won't bring our child back.

665
00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:09.558
I want to explain to you
why your daughter died.

666
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:11.560
I don't want to hear it, so please leave.

667
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:28.327
Why are you here at this hour
out of the blue?

668
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.661
Is something wrong?

669
00:46:30.245 --> 00:46:31.205
What could be wrong?

670
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:34.708
I just came to sleep over.

671
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:37.252
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

672
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.671
I'm telling you, nothing's wrong.

673
00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:43.759
I came here after the group dinner
because I missed you so much.

674
00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:53.560
MS. OH DEOK-RYE

675
00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:57.898
Yes, Ms. Oh.

676
00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.399
It's been a while.

677
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:02.110
To what do I owe this pleasure?

678
00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:04.196
I just called to see how things are.

679
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.449
I was using the cosmetics you gave me,

680
00:47:08.283 --> 00:47:10.244
and I wondered if you were well,

681
00:47:11.078 --> 00:47:13.664
and how you feel after your surgery.

682
00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:15.958
I see.

683
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:21.547
Gosh, thanks to you, I'm doing so well.

684
00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.801
There's nothing wrong with In-ho
or Jeong-suk, right?

685
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:29.179
In truth, Jeong-suk

686
00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:32.599
looked so down the last time I saw her
that it's been bothering me.

687
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.394
Gosh.

688
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:38.313
The work at the hospital is hard.

689
00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:39.982
Right.

690
00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:45.070
As a matter of fact, there was a place
I wanted to go with you.

691
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:46.989
Do you have time today?

692
00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:48.448
Today?

693
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.749
This is a very famous
Korean medical clinic.

694
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.252
After taking the medicine I got here,

695
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:02.421
I regained my strength.

696
00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.008
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

697
00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:08.635
-Yes.
-Yes.

698
00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:19.313
PROFESSOR PARK HO-WON
I RECEIVED YOUR INVESTMENT

699
00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.689
MAY THERE BE A PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR US

700
00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:23.900
Your pulse is irregular.

701
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.362
Your blood density as it flows
into your blood vessels is low,

702
00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:29.156
and it doesn't flow smoothly either.

703
00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:32.200
In particular, the pulse tied
to your liver and stomach functions

704
00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:34.202
have declined a lot.

705
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:36.622
You have inflammation
inside your body as well.

706
00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:38.957
Am I that unwell?

707
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.501
You're lucky to be alive and moving.

708
00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:46.423
You probably haven't been able to sleep
and have a hard time eating.

709
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:49.468
Medicine is one thing,
but you should begin treatment right away.

710
00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:56.850
VERITY KOREAN MEDICAL CLINIC

711
00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:59.186
That doctor is supposed
to be really talented.

712
00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:01.104
How strange.

713
00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:04.066
Don't be concerned.

714
00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:05.817
It's just because I'm old.

715
00:49:05.901 --> 00:49:10.322
I'll buy you a delicious dinner too.
What would you like to eat?

716
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.909
-You want to have dinner?
-Yes.

717
00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:15.285
Ms. Kwak.

718
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.454
Do you not know what today is?

719
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:19.247
What day is it today?

720
00:49:20.248 --> 00:49:21.625
It's not my birthday…

721
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:23.168
What could it be?

722
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.754
Do you have redder apples?

723
00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:28.298
Of course. Are you preparing
for a memorial service?

724
00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:29.216
Yes.

725
00:49:29.716 --> 00:49:31.468
Who is it for?

726
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:33.804
My father-in-law.

727
00:49:33.887 --> 00:49:35.347
Goodness, in this day and age?

728
00:49:36.264 --> 00:49:38.475
You're a daughter-in-law
that's one in a million.

729
00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:40.477
Thank you.

730
00:49:57.536 --> 00:49:59.788
-Did you tell her to come?
-No.

731
00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:01.456
I'm not that shameless.

732
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.959
How can I ask her to prepare
for my father's memorial service?

733
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:05.585
If she came on her own

734
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.004
to prepare all of this
for her father-in-law,

735
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:09.715
doesn't that mean she forgives you?

736
00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:12.300
Isn't this some kind of silent message

737
00:50:12.384 --> 00:50:15.512
that she's done with what she was doing
and coming back to the family?

738
00:50:16.304 --> 00:50:17.472
That would be a relief.

739
00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:21.101
Let's go help her prepare the food today.

740
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.979
But I just got my nails done.

741
00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:25.814
Please cooperate this time too!

742
00:50:25.897 --> 00:50:28.024
In her eyes, you're an accomplice.

743
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:29.901
Why am I an accomplice?

744
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.528
You're the one who cheated, not me.

745
00:50:32.112 --> 00:50:34.030
Good job on saying something
so blasphemous

746
00:50:34.114 --> 00:50:36.074
on the anniversary of your father's death.

747
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:39.369
It'll be lucky
if your father doesn't get indigestion

748
00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:41.955
after eating the food today.

749
00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:54.551
Jeong-suk.

750
00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.304
Is there anything I can help with?

751
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:03.602
Don't cut the radish too small
for the bean sprout soup.

752
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:06.021
Cut it long like this, like a bean sprout.

753
00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:07.522
-Like this?
-Yes.

754
00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:09.983
The same goes for the chive
and scallion pancakes.

755
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:13.820
You can't cut the food
that will be offered into short pieces.

756
00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.239
Jeez, but you already know
all this so well.

757
00:51:16.823 --> 00:51:18.241
What's the point of me knowing?

758
00:51:20.118 --> 00:51:22.454
I can't do this forever.

759
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:25.457
What?

760
00:51:28.835 --> 00:51:32.506
Honey, can I make them like this?

761
00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:43.475
Watch carefully. Not in the middle,
but at the one-third point.

762
00:51:43.558 --> 00:51:46.686
So the red side of the crab meat
can be seen from the front.

763
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:47.646
Okay.

764
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:50.023
Then a yellow radish.

765
00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.149
Okay.

766
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.275
The same goes for the chives.

767
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:55.195
Make the broader side show from the front,
not the narrower side.

768
00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:56.446
-I see.
-I see.

769
00:51:57.697 --> 00:51:58.865
Mushrooms as well.

770
00:52:01.326 --> 00:52:04.704
And next goes the ham.
That way the colors are pretty like this.

771
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:09.543
And then at the end,
one last piece of red crab meat.

772
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.089
Memorial services are all about care.

773
00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:16.216
You need to do it like this
so it looks good,

774
00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:19.845
and so the egg, flour, and water
will stick properly and make it cook well.

775
00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:23.139
-Use this one as an example and follow it.
-Okay.

776
00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:26.184
It's a mere formality,
so don't put too much effort in.

777
00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.112
What are you doing?

778
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.446
What?

779
00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:26.077
I think

780
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:29.456
we should stop with the memorial service.

781
00:53:33.501 --> 00:53:36.963
We should just gather as a family
to pray and share a meal

782
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:38.798
on this day from now on.

783
00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:41.760
Why all of a sudden?

784
00:53:41.843 --> 00:53:43.428
We're Christians,

785
00:53:43.511 --> 00:53:45.513
so your father must have
passed on to heaven.

786
00:53:46.264 --> 00:53:47.724
So what is the point of this?

787
00:53:48.642 --> 00:53:52.103
And it isn't right.
It's too much work on Jeong-suk's part.

788
00:53:52.854 --> 00:53:53.980
Just look at today.

789
00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:56.650
She just stood in the kitchen all day
and worked so hard.

790
00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:00.362
You can do it next year onwards, Mother.

791
00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:04.741
As you already know, I'm a bad cook.

792
00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:08.161
Before you married into the family,
my mother-in-law took care of things.

793
00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:11.247
Ever since you came,
you took care of everything so well.

794
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:14.167
So I never had the time to learn to cook.

795
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.835
You can learn now.

796
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.546
-I can help too.
-Come on!

797
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:22.676
I'm saying
I don't want to do this anymore!

798
00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:26.763
I don't understand why you want
to stop doing Father's memorial service.

799
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.522
Grandma, do you have a boyfriend?

800
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:41.736
The thing is…

801
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:47.993
Yes, I have a person I'm seeing.

802
00:54:51.329 --> 00:54:53.873
I don't know
how things will end up with him,

803
00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.418
so continuing to hold
memorial services for your father

804
00:54:57.335 --> 00:54:58.586
does make me uncomfortable.

805
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.846
So you're saying you have a boyfriend?

806
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:10.557
Do you have marriage in mind?

807
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.474
Why?

808
00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:13.560
Is there a reason I can't?

809
00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.644
I'm single.

810
00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:20.692
To think she has a boyfriend at that age.

811
00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:22.694
This is absurd.

812
00:55:27.032 --> 00:55:28.825
I don't know if you're grasping this,

813
00:55:28.908 --> 00:55:31.953
but you're going to get yourself
a new father-in-law.

814
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.955
Head to your room. I'll do it alone.

815
00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:37.917
No, I was too inattentive with the chores.
I'll help out the best I can from now on.

816
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.796
Sure, learning this will be good for you.

817
00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:44.424
Since I won't be here anymore.

818
00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:52.891
What is that supposed to mean?

819
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.319
This is the last memorial service
I'll prepare.

820
00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:07.989
Let's…

821
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:10.075
get a divorce.

822
00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:12.619
Divorce?

823
00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:17.707
I saw your car
in the hospital parking lot.

824
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.502
You had the disability sticker I received,

825
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:24.672
and you parked your car
right in front of the hospital entrance

826
00:56:24.756 --> 00:56:26.299
where the accessible parking is.

827
00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:27.842
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

828
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:32.180
ACCESSIBLE PARKING

829
00:56:32.972 --> 00:56:36.810
You put my disability sticker on your car…

830
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.857
and drove around Seung-hi.

831
00:56:49.322 --> 00:56:50.865
The thought of that made me laugh.

832
00:56:55.995 --> 00:56:57.872
The fact that I lived my life

833
00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:01.084
<c.bg_transparent><i>caring for and putting
this lousy guy on a pedestal</i></c.bg_transparent>

834
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:06.089
made me feel so pathetic and stupid.

835
00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.424
And then suddenly,

836
00:57:09.467 --> 00:57:10.802
I had this thought.

837
00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:16.266
All of this isn't just your fault.

838
00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:20.603
<c.bg_transparent><i>Your mother failed
to teach you right from wrong.</i></c.bg_transparent>

839
00:57:21.187 --> 00:57:26.151
<c.bg_transparent><i>And I was so permissive
in every single regard.</i></c.bg_transparent>

840
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:29.654
Our responsibility in this isn't any less.

841
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:39.831
I'd like to make a report.

842
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:44.419
Someone is illegally parked
in an accessible parking spot.

843
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.965
The driver has
a disability sticker on his car.

844
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:51.468
But he's nondisabled.

845
00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:55.472
Yes.

846
00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:57.223
I've made my decision.

847
00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.602
I think the time has come

848
00:58:01.686 --> 00:58:06.274
when it'll be okay if we're just Jung-min
and I-rang's parents.

849
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:10.069
As the father of my children,
I can let things slide.

850
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.613
But…

851
00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.991
as my husband,

852
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:17.952
you no longer…

853
00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.497
hold any meaning to me.

854
00:58:22.373 --> 00:58:24.751
I don't want to hate you anymore.

855
00:58:25.543 --> 00:58:27.629
I just don't feel the need
to hate you anymore.

856
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.257
It's already over…

857
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:34.511
between the two of us.

858
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:39.474
I want to be liberated from this hell.

859
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.019
Let's split up.

860
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:48.942
Let's get a divorce.

861
00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.260
Don't put on an act.

862
00:59:16.177 --> 00:59:17.011
Get up.

863
00:59:18.012 --> 00:59:19.222
Get up!

864
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:28.898
Honey.

865
00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:30.608
Honey, open your eyes. Come on.

866
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.943
Honey.

867
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:33.528
In-ho!

868
00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:35.446
What's with you?

869
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.864
In-ho, open your eyes.

870
00:59:38.032 --> 00:59:39.033
