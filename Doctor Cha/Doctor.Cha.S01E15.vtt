ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.702
Have you been taking
your immunosuppressants?

3
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.412
Well…

4
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.083
I've been busy lately
so I did forget a couple of times,

5
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.669
but I did take them regularly.

6
00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.087
How do you feel these days?

7
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.508
I'm tired even on my days off
and I've been having indigestion.

8
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.843
Since when?

9
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.719
Since about a week…

10
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.306
before my regular checkup?

11
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.934
Actually,

12
00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:24.227
when I coughed today,

13
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.230
there was some blood.

14
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.193
That wouldn't be surprising.

15
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.113
Your CT and ultrasound readings came out,

16
00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.323
and they're worse than I thought.

17
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.452
First, you have more ascites
than I anticipated,

18
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.330
and your liver density
has decreased by a lot.

19
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.791
Your L/S ratio has decreased a lot too,

20
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.377
and edema has formed
around your portal vein as well.

21
00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:50.712
Your right lung

22
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.590
has also developed a pleural effusion.

23
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.885
Of course, we'll have to do
a biopsy to be sure,

24
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.303
but there's a possibility

25
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.388
this is a transplant rejection
or acute liver failure.

26
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:04.350
All this happened because I forgot
to take my immunosuppressants a few times?

27
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:08.062
You should be hospitalized,
have a biopsy done,

28
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.522
and receive steroid treatment.

29
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:10.982
This is…

30
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.276
just so sudden.

31
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.237
I'm still quite stunned.

32
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.200
It'll be a huge inconvenience to everyone
if one resident leaves.

33
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.244
I…

34
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.748
need some time to get things in order.

35
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.249
Do it as fast as you can.

36
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.461
Get things in order quickly
and get hospitalized.

37
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.786
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

38
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.248
Yes, patient Ms. Seok Hui-suk?

43
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.783
Yes, I'll be right up.

44
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.893
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

45
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.854
Yes.

46
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.606
Hello.

47
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.567
How are you today?

48
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.569
Does your stomach still hurt? Did you eat?

49
00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.987
You have to eat well.

50
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.916
I chugged three cups of coffee,
but I still feel sleepy.

51
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.461
I was on night duty
preparing for a conference,

52
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.920
so I only had two hours of sleep.

53
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.048
Dr. Cha, you seem fine.

54
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.425
Do I?

55
00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.261
Will it get better in our second year?

56
00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:48.681
We're dispatched anyway,
so it'll all be the same.

57
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.683
Still, I want to hurry up
and become a second-year.

58
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.226
Don't you agree?

59
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.148
Yes, I think it'll be great

60
00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.400
once we become second-years.

61
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.321
It'll be

62
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.282
really great.

63
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.047
Hello.

64
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.466
Do you remember me?

65
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.385
-Yes.
-You haven't called.

66
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.846
So I came here to see you,
though it may seem rude.

67
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.975
Have you given it some thought?

68
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.978
About our father's bone marrow transplant.

69
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.022
Don't you feel

70
00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:40.858
even slightly bad for asking me this?

71
00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.069
We'll compensate you handsomely.

72
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.197
So please let us know
the amount you would like.

73
00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.454
Yes?

74
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.165
Did you call for me, Professor?

75
00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.002
Do you want coffee? I have tea too.

76
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.046
I'm fine. I already drank some.

77
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.302
But why did you want to see me?

78
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.012
Dr. Jeon, I want to ask you a favor.

79
00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:14.225
Maybe I pushed myself too hard recently.
I'm feeling pretty tired.

80
00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:15.810
I want to run some tests,

81
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.895
but it'd be weird to order them myself.

82
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:22.191
Can you put in an order for
a liver function test, a CT, and an MRI?

83
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.484
Yes, I can do that.

84
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.988
If this is your medical checkup,

85
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.073
should I add a gastroscopy
or a colonoscopy as well?

86
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.078
I think that can be done
after seeing the blood test results.

87
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:38.207
Also, please ask that they run
a 1mm-thick scan for the liver CT.

88
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.542
One millimeter?

89
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.714
Isn't 1mm the protocol
for liver cancer or a liver transplant?

90
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.257
Why would…

91
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.675
Because I need to.

92
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.803
-Okay.
-Thank you.

93
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.430
Okay, I'll get it done.

94
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.295
Yes?

95
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.214
The police station?

96
00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:28.966
Yes, this is Kwak Ae-sim.

97
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.052
<c.bg_transparent><i>You're a victim of the Seomun
convalescent hospital scam, right?</i></c.bg_transparent>

98
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:33.137
Victim? Me?

99
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.765
That land is prohibited from development,

100
00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.518
<c.bg_transparent><i>but we received a report that investments
were received to develop a hospital.</i></c.bg_transparent>

101
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.686
It looks to be a sophisticated scam case.

102
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.773
<c.bg_transparent><i>I think you'll have to come
to the Seodaemun Police Station.</i></c.bg_transparent>

103
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:45.691
I see.

104
00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:53.282
Professor.

105
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.452
Ms. Kwak.

106
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.622
<c.bg_transparent><i>You must know now
since the police station contacted you.</i></c.bg_transparent>

107
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.791
I'm very sorry about the investment.

108
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.711
I lost both money and friends over this.

109
00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.423
The woman you met at the restaurant

110
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.134
<c.bg_transparent><i>was a woman I had been seeing
after my wife died.</i></c.bg_transparent>

111
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.430
<c.bg_transparent><i>I had no choice but to reconcile with her
because of this recent incident.</i></c.bg_transparent>

112
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.559
<c.bg_transparent><i>Please forget about a loser like me
and start over with someone new.</i></c.bg_transparent>

113
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.935
Hello?

114
00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.735
Ms. Kwak? Is that you?

115
00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.364
Ms. Min, it's been a while.

116
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.032
What a coincidence.

117
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.242
I know, right?

118
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:40.329
There are rumors that
the convalescent hospital you invested in

119
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.415
is all a scam.

120
00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:43.457
Is that true?

121
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.168
The money you borrowed from me
is safe, right?

122
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.128
Of course.

123
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.093
Professor Choi, over here.

124
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.691
I have some materials
I urgently have to review.

125
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.818
I think I'll have to eat later.

126
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:11.861
Do it after you eat.

127
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.406
I have something to give
the professors in our department.

128
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.700
I'm sorry.
You can give it to me next time.

129
00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.118
Okay.

130
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.292
Okay, let's get up too.

131
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.002
Take your time.

132
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.470
Thank you…

133
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.015
to you both.

134
00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:41.932
For…

135
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.476
For what?

136
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.144
For being my fellow residents.

137
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.854
They say the friends you make

138
00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:48.898
during med school
and your residency last forever.

139
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.444
But I haven't worked for so long
that I haven't seen my colleagues in ages.

140
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:58.949
I wanted to thank you
for eating with an old resident like me

141
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:03.204
and letting me in on things I don't know.

142
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.750
It's nothing.

143
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.670
That's nice and all,

144
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.422
but you're talking
as if you're going somewhere far away.

145
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.590
It feels weird.

146
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.636
Be on good terms
with the other residents too.

147
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.847
It'll be awkward if you become enemies
with someone you'll work with.

148
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.391
-Take it.
-No.

149
00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.267
-Like them?
-I won't!

150
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.020
-Take Bong-suk's wedding invitation.
-No, I won't!

151
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.564
You of all people
must accept this, you punk!

152
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.691
I of all people won't accept it!

153
00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.276
I won't accept it!

154
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.822
Then I'll read it to you.

155
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:39.323
Don't read it. I won't listen.

156
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.118
Even if I had ten ears,
they are all closed!

157
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.079
Let go of me!

158
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:48.082
Professor Oh, read it!

159
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:49.500
No, I'll kill you if you do!

160
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:52.253
-Don't read it, you punk!
-"Wedding invitation."

161
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:53.879
"We are two people

162
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.756
who used to walk on separate paths."

163
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.007
Then keep walking separately!

164
00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.677
-"But we'll now walk on the same path."
-Don't walk on the same path!

165
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.388
"Please join us in blessing
our new life together."

166
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.181
"The groom, Jung Seong-han."

167
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.851
"The bride, Lim Bong-suk!"

168
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.607
Bong-suk!

169
00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.278
Hey, Chief Yoon.

170
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.655
Make sure you come to the wedding.

171
00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.158
I'll pay for your meal ticket.

172
00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.201
Would you go if you were me?

173
00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.997
"I am leaving once this night passes,
to a person I don't want to go to."

174
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:32.168
"As my tears fall,
I depart to a person I do not even love."

175
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.003
"I shed endless tears."

176
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:36.338
Hey, hold on.

177
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.299
Where is Professor Seo?

178
00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:39.467
I need to give him this.

179
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.719
Something came up at home,
so he left early.

180
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.053
Really?

181
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:44.472
I have to give him this.

182
00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.390
Bong-suk!

183
00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.102
LAW FIRM KIM DONG-WOOK

184
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.520
Mother.

185
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.855
Why on earth are we here?

186
00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.817
If you're going to get a divorce anyway,
you need to be prepared too.

187
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.569
Are you just going to
let her walk over you?

188
00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:00.154
Jeong-suk even sent you
a divorce petition!

189
00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:01.322
I'm not getting a divorce.

190
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.240
You need this!

191
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.658
This is necessary. Follow me.

192
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.243
-Come on.
-Follow me.

193
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.455
After hearing your story,

194
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:13.626
it's undeniably clear that
you're the spouse at fault.

195
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.003
So naturally, you don't have
the upper hand.

196
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.129
Then,

197
00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:18.756
what about the assets?

198
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.674
Will he get his assets taken from him?

199
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.761
How will the assets be divided?

200
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:26.597
Division of assets
depends on contribution,

201
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.850
but recently, the importance
of domestic work has been recognized,

202
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.354
so there have been cases
where up to 50% has been awarded.

203
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:37.191
So she gets half of his fortune
when she didn't contribute anything to it?

204
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.442
What kind of law is that?

205
00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:43.864
She has a building under her name.
Does she get half of that too?

206
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.534
It's actually my building,
but it's just under her name.

207
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.246
She doesn't know that she has a building
or anything else under her name.

208
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:54.750
Did you buy the building
under her name to avoid taxes?

209
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.043
Yes, that was the case.

210
00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.255
In that case,
that counts as ownership trust.

211
00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.215
You can be punished by law.

212
00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:03.676
According to criminal law,
you can go to prison for five years

213
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.178
or get a fine of less than
200 million won.

214
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.681
Even if we put that aside,

215
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.224
you'd need to prove that

216
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:13.686
your daughter-in-law didn't contribute
to the building's purchase.

217
00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:16.814
-But that seems difficult in this case.
-My goodness. Then…

218
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.401
are you saying my building
will be taken away?

219
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.364
I mean,

220
00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.742
how could you keep
something like that a secret from me?

221
00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:30.870
Let's talk about that later.

222
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.955
First, we need to sell that building.

223
00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.958
Tell Jeong-suk the truth
and put the building on the market.

224
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.501
Even if we sell below the market price.

225
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.296
Why would you want to sell that
below the market price?

226
00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.509
About that.

227
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:48.262
I can't believe
something like this happened.

228
00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:49.179
Mother!

229
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.184
Three hundred…

230
00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.854
You gave that scamming bastard
300 million won?

231
00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:58.230
With the money you borrowed?

232
00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.940
I didn't give it to him.

233
00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:01.692
I invested.

234
00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:03.611
That's the same thing, Mother!

235
00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.821
You can get mad at me later.

236
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.281
What should I do?

237
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:10.993
If I don't pay back that money,
I'll become an outcast among my alumni.

238
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.245
The building won't sell easily.

239
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.123
Can't you get a credit loan?

240
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.125
You're a doctor.

241
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.377
In-ho, do something.

242
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.670
Do you not remember?

243
00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:25.382
I took out the biggest credit loan
I could get last year

244
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.927
and repaid the secured loan on the house.

245
00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.804
Interest rates are high these days.

246
00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.057
Do you know how much
the interest is each month?

247
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.935
Then what do I do?

248
00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.269
Your mother's reputation

249
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.312
is about to be destroyed

250
00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.440
because of 300 million won!

251
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.194
-Hey.
-I have to head back for a surgery.

252
00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.528
You pay for the meal.

253
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:47.988
In-ho.

254
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.448
In-ho.

255
00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:15.265
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

256
00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:21.772
Hey, it's me.

257
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.608
Let's meet later.

258
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:28.904
You could've told me over the phone.
Why did you insist on meeting?

259
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.280
What is it?

260
00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.950
This isn't something
I can discuss over the phone.

261
00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:35.619
But why do you look so pale?

262
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.496
What do you mean?

263
00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:39.581
Did you…

264
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:41.083
hear anything--

265
00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:43.502
Mother purchased a building
under your name.

266
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:46.839
What?

267
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:49.633
You mean the one in Gimpo?

268
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.010
You knew?

269
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.720
I found out when I went to the bank

270
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.305
to take out a loan for I-rang's academy.

271
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.891
But what about it?

272
00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:00.728
Why did you pretend
like you didn't know about it?

273
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.314
Forget it.

274
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.151
She got herself into trouble,
so she needs to sell the building.

275
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.486
You need to put it on the market.

276
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.280
If we list it below market price--

277
00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.197
I don't want to.

278
00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:14.491
-What?
-I don't want to.

279
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:16.910
I don't want to sell it.

280
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:17.828
Do you…

281
00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.417
Jeong-suk.

282
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:27.671
It may be in your name,
but it belongs to Mother.

283
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:28.839
Do you have proof?

284
00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:29.923
Are you crazy?

285
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.550
Yes, I am crazy.

286
00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:35.387
Why do I have to obediently cooperate
with the people who've used me?

287
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.682
Just think of it as a division of assets,
in a broader sense.

288
00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.350
We're not even divorced.

289
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.728
Why on earth are you mentioning
division of assets?

290
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.814
I really didn't want to say this,

291
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.399
but did you contribute even a single thing

292
00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:50.027
to the creation of these assets?

293
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.945
Don't be ridiculous!

294
00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.656
I see you had a plan all along.

295
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.785
Is this why you refused when I offered you
joint ownership of the house?

296
00:17:58.744 --> 00:17:59.745
That's right.

297
00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:02.873
I had a bit of conscience left,
so I was going to take the building

298
00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.666
and let you have the house.

299
00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.294
Anyway, I don't want to sell it.

300
00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:10.464
I'll claim the rights
to whatever is under my name,

301
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:11.548
and that's that.

302
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.550
Then what about the money
that Mother owes?

303
00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:15.803
Just sell the house
and take care of it with that.

304
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.721
Move to a smaller place,

305
00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.517
or if you don't want to do that,
then buy a big house in the suburbs.

306
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.269
If you sell the house,
both options are possible.

307
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.615
That's it.

308
00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:40.577
There are multiple ways of doing squats.

309
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.121
You can do that way too.

310
00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.205
Ms. Oh!

311
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:47.960
-What?
-Ms. Oh, please open the door.

312
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.212
-Ms. Oh.
-Goodness!

313
00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:53.674
Oh, my goodness!
Ms. Kwak, what are you doing here?

314
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.676
Gosh, you reek of alcohol!

315
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.804
-Why did you drink this much…
-Ms. Oh.

316
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.223
Have you been well?

317
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:04.434
Goodness.

318
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:05.435
Gosh, wait.

319
00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:11.942
I'm heading to…

320
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.656
Did she go to exercise?

321
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.833
Are you up?

322
00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.794
You should get up and have breakfast
if you're awake.

323
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:34.089
I thought your stomach might be upset,
so I made a clear broth.

324
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:03.243
I think I made
a lot of mistakes last night.

325
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.495
Yes, you did.

326
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.792
Don't assume

327
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.002
That I lived this way or that way

328
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:21.386
Jeez.

329
00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:30.687
You don't have to describe it
in such detail.

330
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.607
Please forget all of that
as fast as you can, Ms. Oh.

331
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.150
You're really upset

332
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:37.986
about the kids, right?

333
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.947
Thinking about the kids getting a divorce

334
00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:42.866
makes me feel

335
00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.577
like there's a hole in my chest.

336
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.496
It's not because I feel bad for In-ho.

337
00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.999
It's because I can't live
without Jeong-suk, Ms. Oh.

338
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.126
I'm being honest.

339
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.045
I really liked Jeong-suk.

340
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.297
She wasn't like a daughter-in-law.

341
00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:59.049
No matter how much I whined,

342
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.219
she accepted it all like an older sister.

343
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.596
Honestly, that's who she was to me.

344
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.557
You should treat your daughter-in-law
like your daughter-in-law.

345
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:08.600
You can't depend on her

346
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.560
like an older sister.

347
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:14.356
If you're an adult,
shouldn't you act like one?

348
00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.151
Don't talk about
how much you liked Jeong-suk now.

349
00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:20.487
Because of you,

350
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:25.033
Jeong-suk suffered
so much both physically and mentally.

351
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.744
Even so,

352
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:31.248
maybe she knew that's how you felt

353
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.960
because she doesn't seem
to hold much hate for you.

354
00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:36.253
Sometimes,

355
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.380
it seemed like

356
00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:42.009
she was trying to be the bigger person
by not thinking too much about it.

357
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.430
But I can't say that she should
continue to live in that house

358
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:50.017
just so you can be comfortable.

359
00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:56.064
All we can do is just watch them
handle things on their own.

360
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.903
Ma'am, do you still not have any energy?

361
00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.030
Yes.

362
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.743
Ma'am, you're being injected
with nutrients.

363
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.870
Since you can't eat,

364
00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:13.165
you're being provided
with nutrients through this injection.

365
00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:16.877
And the results of the tests
you took before will come out soon,

366
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.211
so just wait a bit longer.

367
00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:21.757
You just don't have energy
when you're old.

368
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.051
What's the point of tests?

369
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.471
I'll tell you a secret.

370
00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:32.350
You're my last patient.

371
00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:37.105
So I want to make sure you're all better
when you're discharged.

372
00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:42.069
She was born in 1920?

373
00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:45.155
Then that'd make her over a 100 now.

374
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:47.991
This is the first time I'm seeing
a patient that old in this hospital.

375
00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:49.910
People really do live to 100 these days.

376
00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:52.245
But why was she hospitalized?

377
00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:54.664
It's all the same for patients
of that age.

378
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.000
They either have no energy
or are unable to digest well.

379
00:22:57.959 --> 00:23:00.879
Dr. Cha, she's going home
after getting the IV drip, right?

380
00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:03.381
That was the plan.

381
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:05.634
But she has indigestion and chest pain,

382
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:08.011
so I had an APCT done just in case.

383
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.015
The video was uploaded, so I'm checking…

384
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.476
What?

385
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.604
It's an aortic dissection.

386
00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:20.107
It's a critical situation

387
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.317
when the most important artery
in our body is torn.

388
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.654
She needs to be transferred to
Cardiothoracic Surgery for an operation.

389
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:28.615
But due to her age,
I don't know if they will do the surgery.

390
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.492
If she doesn't get surgery…

391
00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:35.372
the chances she will die are very high.

392
00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:41.878
We brought her here because
she couldn't eat or digest anything.

393
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:45.966
It's common for elderly patients
not to show many symptoms.

394
00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.384
Then…

395
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:53.265
do you mean my mother
could pass away immediately?

396
00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:55.308
If she doesn't get surgery immediately,

397
00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:58.770
then yes, that could happen.

398
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.650
I'll first contact
the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department.

399
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.277
Please wait in the hospital

400
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.196
just in case you need to do
some paperwork regarding surgery.

401
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.077
Hello.

402
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.497
Is this Professor Seo In-ho's office?

403
00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.124
Yes, that's right.

404
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:20.542
I'm a college classmate

405
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.920
of your mother, Kwak Ae-sim.

406
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:25.797
I see.

407
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:30.177
She would always brag about her son,

408
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.805
so I stopped by
during a visit to the hospital.

409
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:37.225
-I see.
-I don't know if you know this.

410
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:44.024
Your mother borrowed
a little money from me.

411
00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:47.402
I thought you should
be aware of this as her son,

412
00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:53.700
since your reputation shouldn't be ruined
because of your mother.

413
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.869
You know how people get exposed for…

414
00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:58.038
a family member's unpaid debt.

415
00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.917
That happens to lots of people these days.

416
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:18.934
MOTHER

417
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:22.687
Yes, Mother.

418
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:24.940
In-ho, about that building.

419
00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:28.193
I think it'll be difficult
to liquidate it.

420
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.237
Which led me to think…

421
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:33.615
Here's an idea.

422
00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:34.991
What idea?

423
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:35.992
Seung-hi.

424
00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:38.245
How about borrowing money from her?

425
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.413
-What?
-Isn't 300 million won

426
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.331
just chump change to her?

427
00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:42.874
What are you even saying…

428
00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:46.753
Mother, don't even dream of it.

429
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.225
Professor Choi.

430
00:26:06.022 --> 00:26:07.774
Do you have some time tonight?

431
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:14.197
PATIENT NAME: LEE PAN-SIM
DATE OF BIRTH: APRIL 21, 1920

432
00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.616
What do you think it's like

433
00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.035
to live until you're 100?

434
00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:21.871
Just thinking about it is horrible.

435
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:27.961
That patient is really lucky
that such a critical condition

436
00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:30.714
was quickly discovered thanks to you.

437
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:32.757
Is she?

438
00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:42.183
-How can I help you?
-I'm Ms. Lee Pan-sim's guardian.

439
00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.393
Yes.

440
00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:45.729
What brings you here?

441
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:47.397
Who told you to take a CT?

442
00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:49.232
What?

443
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.151
She's old, so we didn't expect much.

444
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.528
We told you to just give her an IV drip.

445
00:26:54.195 --> 00:26:56.990
How much longer do you think
she is going to live?

446
00:26:57.532 --> 00:26:59.367
Aren't you just trying to make money?

447
00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.036
No, it's not that--

448
00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.495
She was just about to die,

449
00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:04.706
so we reserved the funeral home

450
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.666
and contacted all our relatives.

451
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.878
So you came here

452
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.257
to pick a fight over
why I was trying to save my patient?

453
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:17.302
Excuse me,

454
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:19.346
Doctor.

455
00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:21.806
My mother has lived a long life.

456
00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:25.060
I'll be 80 soon too.

457
00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:31.191
I'm tired of life even at my age,
so how do you think my mother feels?

458
00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.572
What's the point of fighting?
Let's just go.

459
00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.257
Is this the afterlife?

460
00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.176
Ma'am.

461
00:27:58.885 --> 00:27:59.969
Are you awake?

462
00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:02.889
So I'm alive.

463
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.935
I was trying to go this time,

464
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.020
but I wasn't able to.

465
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.606
I wasn't able to go again.

466
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.901
Living a long time…

467
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.529
is punishment too.

468
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:19.864
It's punishment.

469
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:27.789
It's a blessing to pass

470
00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.542
<c.bg_transparent><i>when your children
are still sad to see you go.</i></c.bg_transparent>

471
00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:41.428
So you're saying
you want to take a leave of absence?

472
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:43.346
Yes.

473
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.640
And you are aware
that the residents who are left

474
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.351
will suffer two or three times
as much if you leave now?

475
00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:49.310
Yes.

476
00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:51.146
I am aware.

477
00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:56.693
Have a seat.

478
00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:02.449
Dr. Cha.

479
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.159
You've done well until now.

480
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.497
Do you think it's easy for a resident
who takes a leave of absence to return?

481
00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:14.794
I know this hospital
received a donation thanks to you,

482
00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:16.755
but isn't this asking for too much?

483
00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:19.257
Let's hear the reason.

484
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.216
What's the issue?

485
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.177
Is the work too hard?

486
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.429
I'm the issue.

487
00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:28.683
My liver transplant isn't doing well.

488
00:29:29.684 --> 00:29:31.978
I have to be hospitalized
and treated again.

489
00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:35.940
I have neglected myself.

490
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.614
-Chief Lim.
-Yes?

491
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.951
Will there still be a place for me here
even if I take a leave of absence?

492
00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.661
I'm not sure.

493
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.539
I can't answer that right away.

494
00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:54.918
I know it may seem irresponsible,

495
00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:58.463
but please tell me
I can come back, Chief Lim.

496
00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:07.680
When I came back to the hospital,

497
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:12.685
<c.bg_transparent><i>I was determined to live as a doctor
while I was still alive.</i></c.bg_transparent>

498
00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:17.148
If you tell me I can come back
after getting treated,

499
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.653
I think it'll help me stay strong.

500
00:30:24.697 --> 00:30:27.659
Because it'll mean
I have a place to come back to.

501
00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:37.001
PROFESSOR ROY
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

502
00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:45.009
Dr. Cha is taking a leave of absence?

503
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:46.761
That's what happened.

504
00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.681
You remember Dr. Cha
received a liver transplant

505
00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:52.225
before she applied
to be a resident here, right?

506
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:55.353
It seems that her liver was damaged again.

507
00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:57.647
She says she needs
to be hospitalized right away.

508
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:02.986
Professor Choi, please explain
the situation to her fellow residents.

509
00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:07.156
It's hard on everyone
when even one person leaves the hospital.

510
00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:08.908
I will.

511
00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:12.787
But shouldn't this call for a resignation
instead of a leave of absence?

512
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:16.624
It'd be hard not to hire someone new
while we wait for her return.

513
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.001
I know.

514
00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.713
I don't know why this is happening
right after her mother recovered.

515
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:24.299
Dr. Cha wants to be reinstated
after being treated,

516
00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.968
but I think there will be
a lot of complications.

517
00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:29.220
I don't know
whether to accept her reinstatement

518
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.680
or to suggest resignation.

519
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:32.307
It's a real headache.

520
00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:38.146
You'll do what for me?

521
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:41.524
I think I'll be able to donate
my liver to you.

522
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.235
I took a test and the results are good.

523
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.528
It's entirely possible.

524
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.031
You'd donate your liver to me?

525
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:51.910
That's out of the question.

526
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.286
Why?

527
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.496
The man who abandoned me

528
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.833
showed up after 40 years
and asked for a bone marrow transplant

529
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.002
just because he's my biological father.

530
00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:04.380
On the other hand,
you're someone much closer to me.

531
00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:06.007
You're my patient,

532
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:10.178
a friend, and a colleague I care about.

533
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.764
What more is there to explain?

534
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:18.394
This was a hard decision
even for my husband of 20 years

535
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:20.688
to go through with.

536
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.899
This isn't something
you should decide on a whim.

537
00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:27.153
I want to see you live a healthy life.

538
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.739
That's reason enough.

539
00:32:29.822 --> 00:32:30.823
And another thing.

540
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:35.244
I'm healthy and my liver is big,

541
00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:38.373
so it's fine to cut a bit off.

542
00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:45.505
If you don't want my liver,
get treated well and get better soon.

543
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:50.426
Are you ready to be hospitalized?

544
00:32:52.428 --> 00:32:53.304
Yes.

545
00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.014
I'm ready.

546
00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:27.672
CHA JEONG-SUK

547
00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:13.801
CHA JEONG-SUK

548
00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:44.332
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk!

549
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:50.379
-I guess you're leaving work.
-Yes.

550
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:53.674
I think I might end up
getting exposed for Mother's debt.

551
00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.968
A creditor even came to visit me
in the hospital.

552
00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.346
This is all thanks to you.

553
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.431
Why is that thanks to me?

554
00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:01.933
It's thanks to your mother.

555
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:04.936
Right, then I'll correct myself.
It's thanks to both of you.

556
00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:06.604
-Happy?
-I am.

557
00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:09.774
You'll become rich!

558
00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:11.359
It must be nice!

559
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.653
What a jerk.

560
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:18.616
What is it?

561
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.119
You never ask to meet with me first.

562
00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:24.789
The thing is…

563
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:26.082
I really wanted

564
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.335
to thank you for treating
my mother-in-law.

565
00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:31.504
I only did my job.

566
00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:35.174
Still, you must have felt terrible,

567
00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:38.302
so I wanted to say I'm sorry,
and thank you so much.

568
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:41.430
Those are the only two things
you always say.

569
00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:43.057
Fine.

570
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.517
I'll accept your gratitude.

571
00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:46.978
Are you done?

572
00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:48.938
What?

573
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.577
Do you…

574
00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:07.373
want to invest in me?

575
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.875
Invest?

576
00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:14.380
How much?

577
00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:16.215
About…

578
00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:17.842
300 million won?

579
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.136
I'm not asking you to just give it to me.

580
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:23.306
I'm saying to invest it
in the man that I am.

581
00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:27.810
I'll make sure
to pay you interest regularly.

582
00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:31.022
You bastard.

583
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:33.983
You want to borrow money from me
after everything you've done?

584
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.777
What is wrong with you?

585
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.364
And what's with this sexy act?

586
00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:44.660
Do you think I'll just hand over money
to a bad boy like your mother did?

587
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.079
How did you know?

588
00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:49.957
Even a kid would know
this is just your imagination.

589
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.042
What?

590
00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:54.045
You should try to make yourself
look pitiable instead.

591
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.513
If you have nothing more to say,
I'm leaving.

592
00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:06.098
Wait!

593
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:09.435
Seung-hi.

594
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.148
Seung-hi.

595
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.316
Please lend me money.

596
00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:19.070
What are you doing? Get up.

597
00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:21.906
I'm not asking for a handout.
Just lend me some money.

598
00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:23.866
I'll be homeless at this rate.

599
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:24.951
Seung-hi.

600
00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:28.663
In-ho.

601
00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:31.207
I know we were in a relationship,

602
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.126
but there's a line you shouldn't cross.

603
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:39.257
You're trying to act weak to control me.

604
00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.509
But this is a type of gaslighting.

605
00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:44.553
Is this…

606
00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.723
also my imagination?

607
00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:49.016
You caught on quickly.

608
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.227
You shouldn't do that

609
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:54.146
in reality, okay?

610
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.857
You told me to act pitiable instead.

611
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.985
You did seem less of a jerk than before.

612
00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:08.369
You have nothing else to say, right?

613
00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.247
Then it's my turn to talk.

614
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.708
Did you know

615
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.252
your wife is quitting the hospital?

616
00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:18.879
What?

617
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.133
Here.

618
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.176
This looks delicious!

619
00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:25.886
Thank you for all this.

620
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.722
It's been a while
since I've cooked you a meal, right?

621
00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.765
Yes, I missed your cooking so much!

622
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:33.936
What's the occasion?
Why did you come all the way here to cook?

623
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.688
I did this just because.

624
00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:38.983
-Mom, more meat please.
-How pretty.

625
00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:41.444
-Me first.
-You can't be a picky eater.

626
00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:43.112
-Give me some first.
-Okay.

627
00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:46.198
Why did Jeong-suk quit the hospital?

628
00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.242
She wants to take a leave of absence,
to be precise.

629
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:49.744
Leave of absence?

630
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:52.955
When I ran into her before,

631
00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.790
she just seemed all high and mighty.

632
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:58.169
Did you not know your wife was ill?

633
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.755
Her condition isn't good right now.

634
00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.382
She'll go through drug therapy
at the hospital.

635
00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:04.842
In the worst-case scenario,

636
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.720
she'll have to consider
getting another transplant.

637
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:15.269
It seems that…

638
00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:18.731
I have…

639
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.734
to be hospitalized again for treatment.

640
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.491
Don't worry too much.

641
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.786
I'll recover quickly
after receiving drug therapy.

642
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.622
Are things really bad?

643
00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:36.791
If you need to be hospitalized…

644
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:43.422
Well,

645
00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.467
if the situation gets worse,

646
00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:50.137
I might have to get another transplant.

647
00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.139
But it won't come to that.

648
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:54.600
So don't worry, okay?

649
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.150
It's all my fault.

650
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:05.361
It's all my fault.

651
00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:09.907
You were stressed out and on edge
because I was sick.

652
00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:13.536
You were already exhausted,
and I made you worried on top of that.

653
00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:15.663
Mom, stop.

654
00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.332
Don't say that. How is this your fault?

655
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:21.335
Mom, I really can get through this.

656
00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:22.837
So don't worry.

657
00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:25.840
No need to worry ahead of time.

658
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.633
I can really get through this well.

659
00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:31.679
I'm really okay.

660
00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:35.015
So don't be too sad

661
00:40:35.724 --> 00:40:37.393
or feel tortured over this.

662
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:43.357
Let's think of good thoughts
and get through this, okay?

663
00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:45.860
Okay?

664
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:48.195
Mom.

665
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.953
I was really shocked too.

666
00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:57.663
Are you sure?

667
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.294
We have some responsibility

668
00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:06.213
for Jeong-suk ending up like this.

669
00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:08.757
Since we did a lot of
unacceptable things to her.

670
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:31.739
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

671
00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:37.661
Honey, it's so pretty.

672
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:39.413
I'm glad to hear you like it.

673
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.000
I'll cherish this forever.

674
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.044
Thank you, honey.

675
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:48.422
Come on, don't go overboard.
I can just buy you another one.

676
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:50.466
This is the first present
I've received from you.

677
00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:52.927
So it's that much more meaningful.

678
00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.682
You'll be 50 by the time you finish.

679
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.519
The average life expectancy is longer now,
so that's still young.

680
00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:03.896
Who would welcome
an old and sick resident?

681
00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.273
Don't be a nuisance and just drop it.

682
00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.193
Fine.

683
00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:11.111
If you so insist, go ahead.

684
00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.988
I won't stop you, so do your best.

685
00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.199
-Really?
-Yes.

686
00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:17.743
Do what you want,
since it's your decision.

687
00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.204
Just pretend we don't know
each other at work.

688
00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:23.582
Don't even dream of whining
or complaining about your tough work.

689
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.000
Do not ask me for help.

690
00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:26.585
Do not expect to receive

691
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:29.171
any special treatment
just because I'm there.

692
00:42:29.255 --> 00:42:32.550
We will be complete strangers
at the hospital.

693
00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:36.595
I will only treat you
as a rookie resident, do you understand?

694
00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:40.474
Yes!

695
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:41.976
So please just quit!

696
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:45.187
Do you know how hard it is
to see you at work?

697
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:53.445
You say whatever you want,
but have you ever considered how I feel?

698
00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:54.863
No.

699
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:58.284
I didn't think
about how you felt on purpose.

700
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.160
I want to put myself first from now on.

701
00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:03.956
I finally realized
there's a life for me out there,

702
00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:05.457
so I can't stop again now!

703
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:07.585
Honey, this is my last chance.

704
00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:12.631
Please…

705
00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:15.092
let me continue down this path.

706
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:19.388
I won't even ask for you
to help pave the road or hold my hand.

707
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:20.347
Just…

708
00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.518
let me be able to walk down this path.

709
00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:58.636
Is it because of that punk?

710
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:00.929
Roy Kimberley?

711
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.432
Don't get ahead of yourself.

712
00:44:03.515 --> 00:44:05.726
Do you think
that decent young man is into you?

713
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.362
We're not even divorced.

714
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:18.447
Why on earth are you mentioning
division of assets?

715
00:44:19.865 --> 00:44:21.533
I really didn't want to say this,

716
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.118
but did you contribute even a single thing

717
00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:25.746
to the creation of these assets?

718
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.414
Don't be ridiculous!

719
00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:06.120
Professor Kim,

720
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.872
please explain
my wife's condition in detail.

721
00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:13.877
I need to know now, at least.

722
00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:17.923
The results of her blood tests
and her liver ultrasound aren't good.

723
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.384
Her symptoms are quickly getting worse.

724
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:24.096
Her abdomen is distended due to ascites,
and her lungs are filled with fluid

725
00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:25.973
which is causing breathing difficulties.

726
00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.517
This will be hard to regulate
through diuretics alone.

727
00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:30.894
We'll have to do a biopsy,

728
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:31.979
but from the looks of it…

729
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.357
it's either acute liver failure
or transplant rejection.

730
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:38.318
If my wife

731
00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:41.738
needs a liver transplant, I'll do it.

732
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.992
That's what I came to tell you.

733
00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:51.874
It seems quite late for that.

734
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.377
I know it's late,

735
00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.255
but I want to make up for it.

736
00:46:17.399 --> 00:46:18.442
How did you find out?

737
00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.906
How long did you think
I'd stay in the dark?

738
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.950
You've been admitted
to the department I work for.

739
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.580
Yes.

740
00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:33.957
This is what happened.

741
00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:36.502
There's nothing I can do
this time as well.

742
00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:41.298
I can only get treated
and hope for the best.

743
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:42.216
Yes.

744
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.137
Get drug therapy and if it doesn't work,
I'll donate my liver to you.

745
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.472
So don't worry too much.

746
00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:51.850
Now you've decided to?

747
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.269
I know it's late, but yes.

748
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.271
I don't

749
00:46:57.397 --> 00:46:58.524
need your liver.

750
00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:02.402
You refused to give it to me
when I needed it most.

751
00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.154
So why are you acting like this now?

752
00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:07.908
Did you think

753
00:47:08.867 --> 00:47:11.453
I'd give you back the building
out of gratitude for this?

754
00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:14.039
Is that why?

755
00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:18.043
I called the real estate agency
and put the building on the market.

756
00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:20.045
I gave them your phone number,

757
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:22.756
so you should receive a call
if there's a buyer.

758
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:26.385
Why do you always make me out
to be the bastard?

759
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.520
I…

760
00:47:37.479 --> 00:47:39.231
What I did was wrong, but still.

761
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.692
You should…

762
00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:45.070
still give me one last chance.

763
00:47:46.488 --> 00:47:47.906
You should give me the chance

764
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.201
to make up for the hurt I've caused you.

765
00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:53.537
You should give me

766
00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:59.042
at least one chance to be the tiniest bit

767
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.670
of help to you

768
00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.381
as the father of our children

769
00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:07.676
and as your husband.

770
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:09.595
It's…

771
00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:11.930
all pointless.

772
00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:16.643
We'll break up in the end.

773
00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.607
So let's not make things difficult,

774
00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:23.984
and end things when we can.

775
00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:28.071
Even when we were
a regular married couple,

776
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.616
you weren't able
to willingly donate your liver to me.

777
00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.994
What's the point of giving me your liver
and getting a chance after all this?

778
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.329
I don't need any of that.

779
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.332
If I die,

780
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.460
then that's just my fate.

781
00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:44.421
What do you mean by fate?

782
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.215
It's all my fault.

783
00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:50.177
No, it's not your fault.
This isn't happening because of you.

784
00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.472
So stop.

785
00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.058
It's my fate.

786
00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:59.478
It's my fault
I wasn't able to maintain my health.

787
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:00.771
It's no one else's fault.

788
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:37.766
<c.bg_transparent><i>No, it's not your fault.
This isn't happening because of you.</i></c.bg_transparent>

789
00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:39.559
It's my fate.

790
00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:42.479
<c.bg_transparent><i>It's my fault
I wasn't able to maintain my health.</i></c.bg_transparent>

791
00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:43.772
It's no one else's fault.

792
00:49:58.537 --> 00:49:59.913
What are you looking at so intently?

793
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:01.998
Something interesting to see?

794
00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.254
I can see the funeral home from this room.

795
00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:14.052
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FUNERAL HOME

796
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.264
Out of all the rooms, why did…

797
00:50:18.724 --> 00:50:20.308
No, it's okay.

798
00:50:22.477 --> 00:50:27.733
I think it makes you realize
how close you are to life and death

799
00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:29.943
when you're in a hospital.

800
00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.739
Just think of good things.

801
00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.616
Thoughts like successfully
getting treated, going home,

802
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:38.744
and getting reinstated.

803
00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:41.621
Even if they aren't
those kinds of thoughts,

804
00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:44.541
I feel like

805
00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:48.003
I'm in the midst…

806
00:50:49.254 --> 00:50:50.380
of a beautiful moment.

807
00:50:51.256 --> 00:50:52.799
I've eaten various delicious food,

808
00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:55.761
seen many amazing sights,

809
00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.263
and studied as much as I could…

810
00:51:00.432 --> 00:51:02.142
in my life up until now.

811
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:06.104
I saw my kids grow up

812
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:08.732
without missing a moment too.

813
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.613
I think I would consider myself so lucky

814
00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:16.281
if I were able to die

815
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.160
amid a beautiful moment like this,

816
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.914
before I become too much
for my children to bear.

817
00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:26.500
So,

818
00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:29.044
I'm not sad.

819
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:34.549
I feel…

820
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.219
at ease, Professor Kim.

821
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:43.016
The difficult tests will start tomorrow.

822
00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.476
Your tests are done for today.

823
00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:47.354
Is there anything you want to do
before you get stuck in here?

824
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:49.689
There are so many things.

825
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:52.609
It's hard to choose what to do first.

826
00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.279
Professor Kim.

827
00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:58.490
Can I ask you for a favor?

828
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.451
I thought of something I want to do.

829
00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:17.342
Why are you just leaving?

830
00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:25.141
Didn't you come to see me?

831
00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.978
-That's right.
-Why?

832
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:30.230
To see what kind of state I'm in?

833
00:52:36.194 --> 00:52:38.864
Get better and come back to work soon.

834
00:52:42.701 --> 00:52:43.660
I will.

835
00:52:43.743 --> 00:52:44.786
You…

836
00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.289
had thanked me.

837
00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:51.167
But I wasn't able to say anything.

838
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:55.797
I'm sorry.

839
00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:05.056
I imagined what it'd be like
to hear those words from you.

840
00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:07.475
I thought nothing would change

841
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.645
no matter what you said.

842
00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:14.190
But it's better than
not hearing it at all.

843
00:53:20.238 --> 00:53:21.406
When I got to college

844
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:23.658
and met you,

845
00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.202
I wanted to be friends with you.

846
00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.373
You got good grades and were smart…

847
00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:34.127
but you weren't a shameless brat.

848
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:36.671
You came from an affluent family,

849
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.132
but you didn't make that obvious.

850
00:53:40.842 --> 00:53:43.011
If things hadn't become
so difficult between us…

851
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.765
then maybe right about now,

852
00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:49.935
we'd be eating a meal together

853
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.397
while complaining
about our husbands to each other.

854
00:53:58.777 --> 00:54:00.570
Am I an idiot…

855
00:54:02.948 --> 00:54:04.199
for feeling sad about this?

856
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:09.287
This whole time,

857
00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:11.873
you…

858
00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:14.084
and I…

859
00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:21.174
went through so much.

860
00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:24.135
I want to be…

861
00:54:27.472 --> 00:54:28.598
at peace now.

862
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.896
I hope you can too.

863
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.166
JUNG-MIN'S MOM
SORRY FOR YELLING AT YOU EARLIER

864
00:55:36.249 --> 00:55:43.006
I WASN'T ACTUALLY ANGRY AT YOU
I WAS ANGRY AT MYSELF

865
00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:44.758
I'M REALLY SORRY IF I HURT…

866
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.218
What were you saying
about Professor Roy before?

867
00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.345
The chief resident said that

868
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:54.267
he asked Dr. Jeon to run
a liver function test and a CT for him.

869
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.895
And a 1mm-thick scan of the liver at that.

870
00:55:56.978 --> 00:55:57.854
A 1mm scan?

871
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.190
Why?

872
00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:02.150
Does he have a really bad liver?

873
00:56:02.233 --> 00:56:04.235
It's not that. The chief resident thinks

874
00:56:05.278 --> 00:56:06.780
it's about Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

875
00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:08.448
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk…

876
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.574
My mom?

877
00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:11.576
Yes, your mom is currently hospitalized.

878
00:56:11.659 --> 00:56:14.579
What does that have to do
with my mother being hospitalized?

879
00:56:14.662 --> 00:56:17.540
Hey, the pure love and devotion of a man.

880
00:56:18.124 --> 00:56:19.292
Don't you get it?

881
00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:21.544
My goodness.

882
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:25.840
It seems Professor Roy has decided
to donate his liver to your mother.

883
00:56:27.008 --> 00:56:28.593
Hey, what are you talking about?

884
00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.189
Where are you right now?

885
00:56:42.273 --> 00:56:43.483
I asked you where you are!

886
00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:53.201
Why did he ask me
to come to a place like this?

887
00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:55.912
You got here quickly.

888
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:02.460
Why would you give your liver to my wife?

889
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:04.462
Why can't I?

890
00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:08.758
As you already know,
organ donors don't have to be relatives.

891
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:10.718
That's not what I'm saying right now.

892
00:57:10.802 --> 00:57:14.514
She has me. I'll give her my liver.
So why are you butting in here?

893
00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.475
Because I don't know
when you'll change your mind again.

894
00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:19.561
I'd rather give her my liver.

895
00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:20.478
Are you crazy?

896
00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:22.397
Why would she accept your liver
instead of mine?

897
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.858
And I don't even drink.
My liver is fresher.

898
00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:27.193
I'm younger and work out a lot.

899
00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.486
So don't be ridiculous.

900
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.738
And you've been drinking a lot lately.

901
00:57:32.157 --> 00:57:34.242
As if that amount would do much!

902
00:58:07.525 --> 00:58:10.361
-What are you doing here?
-You don't need to know.

903
00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.948
The two of you should stop.

904
00:58:14.032 --> 00:58:16.201
I heard every little ridiculous detail.

905
00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:22.248
I'll hear the reason
why you're here later.

906
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.042
It's great that
the person in question is here.

907
00:58:25.376 --> 00:58:26.711
Let's ask her directly.

908
00:58:28.087 --> 00:58:28.922
Let's do that.

909
00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:31.716
Make your choice.

910
00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:35.470
Between the two of us,
whose liver will you accept?

911
00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:38.264
Decide right here, right now!

912
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.683
Make your decision, Dr. Cha.

913
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:46.523
I'm not sure.

914
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:51.361
Whose liver should I accept?

915
00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:18.805
I choose…

916
01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.731
Please give me
the chance to save your life.

917
01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:14.569
<c.bg_transparent><i>Even though I may not be
by your side one day,</i></c.bg_transparent>

918
01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:17.989
I'll always protect you.

919
01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.950
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm scared I'll be causing
unnecessary suffering for someone</i></c.bg_transparent>

920
01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:22.952
because of me.

921
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.245
I'll let you go through with the divorce

922
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:27.040
and I won't pathetically cling to you.

923
01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.124
So get the surgery.

924
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.084
And live.

925
01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:36.049
