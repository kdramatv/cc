ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.801
-Dr. Cha, congratulations!
-Congratulations!

3
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.098
-Dr. Cha.
-Yes?

4
00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.934
-What were you going to talk to me about?
-Sorry?

5
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.270
Didn't you come to my office
to tell me something?

6
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.730
That…

7
00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.108
It was nothing.

8
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.027
Really? I see.

9
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.614
-What is your deal?
-What do you mean?

10
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.282
-What?
-Why did you push me?

11
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:15.825
You pushed yourself, not me.

12
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.285
-Are you joking?
-Joking?

13
00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.620
I don't have to joke with you.

14
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.622
What's with the tie?
Do you work at a bar or something?

15
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.831
I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.749
Just go away.

17
00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.083
"Waiter, I'll have some snacks…"

18
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.753
Did you tell your department?

19
00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:30.757
I can inform my department
if you're uncomfortable doing it yourself.

20
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.344
I need more time to think about this.

21
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.724
Haven't you had enough time to think?

22
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:40.975
What's there to think about now?

23
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.686
Why are you so keen on kicking me out?

24
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.731
What do you mean?
You're the one who decided to quit.

25
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.527
And this is all for the sake of you
and our family.

26
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.155
Right. What a great excuse.

27
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.578
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

28
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.997
Yes.

29
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.457
Okay, I'm coming right now!

30
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.676
CHOI SEUNG-HI

31
00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:21.432
Hello?

32
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.435
<c.bg_transparent><i>You told me she was going
to quit working at the hospital!</i></c.bg_transparent>

33
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.396
Let's meet and talk. See you later.

34
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.368
Ma'am, stay with us.

35
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.953
Check her blood sugar level.

36
00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.706
-It's at 120.
-Please administer one dose of lorazepam.

37
00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.332
Administering one dose of lorazepam.

38
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.210
She was granted a stay of execution
but with her condition…

39
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.795
Does that mean

40
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.047
she can go home?

41
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.090
It does.

42
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.967
But she has no family and no home.

43
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.386
There are a lot of people like her.

44
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.105
Ma'am.

45
00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:16.654
What can I do to convince you
to get yourself treated?

46
00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:24.954
I don't deserve
to be treated like a mother.

47
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.557
What would my daughter look like?

48
00:03:55.735 --> 00:04:01.115
<c.bg_transparent><i>My daughter did well in school,
so she was planning to go to med school.</i></c.bg_transparent>

49
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.245
<c.bg_transparent><i>But I have no idea
where she is or how she's living.</i></c.bg_transparent>

50
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:10.458
I don't know if she got to study medicine
given how expensive it is.

51
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.378
She had no one to help her.

52
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.181
What made you so certain?

53
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.225
You shouldn't have given me hope.

54
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.270
She said herself that she would quit.

55
00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.105
-I didn't know--
-What will you do now?

56
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.940
I can't work with your wife.

57
00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:35.942
Give me time to think--

58
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.319
When will you ever reach a conclusion?

59
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.904
Darn it.

60
00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:43.825
Get out.

61
00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.494
-What?
-I said get out.

62
00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.496
I can't bear being in the same car as you.

63
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:51.666
What about dinner?
I thought you wanted cold noodles.

64
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.584
Enjoy the stupid noodles by yourself.

65
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.685
Where am I?

66
00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:12.979
I left my bag.

67
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.608
I think I might've gone mad.

68
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.069
I slightly envy you these days.

69
00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.116
It feels like
there's no progress in life for me,

70
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.369
but it feels as
if time runs backward for you.

71
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.912
Come on.

72
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.082
Hey, anyway,

73
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.418
you know people
in the medical association, right?

74
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.627
Yes, I do.

75
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.964
I told you one of my patients is a felon
who got a life sentence, right?

76
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.967
I want to find her daughter.
Could you lend me a hand?

77
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.845
She has a unique name. Han Yeong-long.

78
00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:47.346
Jeong-suk.

79
00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.809
-Do I look like a private investigator?
-You little…

80
00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:55.688
You have lots of connections.
Help me out here.

81
00:05:58.816 --> 00:05:59.776
Hello.

82
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.170
Who is that?

83
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.424
He's a professor
in the department I'm dispatched to.

84
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.512
What's funny is he's the one
who performed my liver transplant.

85
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.223
He came to this hospital recently.

86
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.391
Is he married?

87
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.726
No.

88
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.062
-What's his personality like?
-He's nice.

89
00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:40.650
Why didn't you tell someone that handsome
was working at this hospital?

90
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.403
Is that…

91
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.115
something I should be sharing with you?

92
00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.909
Whatever. Can you set us up
so we can meet naturally?

93
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.745
Hey! We're not some teenagers.

94
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.249
Didn't you say you need my help
in finding that felon's daughter?

95
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.752
I guess you aren't
that desperate about it.

96
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:13.057
Didn't you get a physical checkup
done last year?

97
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.559
A quite expensive one, at that.

98
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.770
Just because I had beef last year

99
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.856
doesn't mean I can't
have it again this year.

100
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.358
Yes, you're right.

101
00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:23.818
By the way,

102
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.489
since the kids are here, let's be careful
how we address each other.

103
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.490
Sure.

104
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.033
As you wish, Ms. Ae-sim.

105
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.203
-Ms. Ae-sim?
-"Hey, Ae-sim."

106
00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.165
I can't address you like that, can I?

107
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.756
The botox you got last time settled
a bit unnaturally on your face.

108
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.258
Your eyebrows don't match.

109
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.594
-Ms. Kwak Ae-sim.
-Yes.

110
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.181
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

111
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.223
Yes.

112
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.454
Goodness.

113
00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.793
Honey.

114
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.339
Honey.

115
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.890
This is so delicious.

116
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:41.229
How did you find such a great restaurant?

117
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:46.859
It's been so long
since I've met someone on my level.

118
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.195
Oh, my. This is crazy.

119
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.206
She really must be dating.

120
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.544
It's been a long time.

121
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:05.670
Have you…

122
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.713
been well?

123
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.134
You shamelessly turned your back
on your family for 20 years,

124
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.095
and you ask if I've been well?

125
00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:15.680
You must be her.

126
00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:17.223
It's nice to meet you.

127
00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:18.891
What's your name?

128
00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.226
What's the point in asking that?

129
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.645
This family hasn't changed one bit.

130
00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.064
It's still old-fashioned and ignorant.

131
00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:26.190
You're one to talk.

132
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.443
You must be so sophisticated
that you had an illegitimate child

133
00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.946
and came to Dad's funeral
for your share of the inheritance.

134
00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:32.947
Listen.

135
00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.158
Back then, I was too young and naive,

136
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.412
so I thought I was a sinner
for having a child outside of marriage.

137
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.581
That's why I kept a low profile.

138
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.209
I can understand Dad's anger toward me

139
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.379
because he expected much from me
as you were so pathetic.

140
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.214
But…

141
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.385
it's plain rude of you
to treat me like this.

142
00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:58.931
He's the one who stopped your father
from disowning you.

143
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.975
If you had been disowned,

144
00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:04.395
you wouldn't have any money to your name,
let alone an inheritance.

145
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.397
People would laugh

146
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.649
to hear you say
I have no money to my name.

147
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.444
Stop showing off
when you're only a working doctor.

148
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:12.987
Just get lost.

149
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.323
Well, this working doctor is
about to become rich.

150
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.993
Talk to my lawyer
regarding the inheritance.

151
00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.120
Don't even think of
leaving out a single coin.

152
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.664
You know I'm much smarter than you, right?

153
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.124
Let's go.

154
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:26.792
-You little--
-Excuse me!

155
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.211
My name

156
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:31.881
is Choi Eun-seo.

157
00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.800
I'm not some illegitimate child.
I'm Choi Seung-hi's daughter,

158
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.302
Choi Eun-seo.

159
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.148
Mom, are you sad?

160
00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:50.900
Yes.

161
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.735
What are you sad about?

162
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:58.574
About Grandpa dying,
or Uncle being that rude to you?

163
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:01.994
Both.

164
00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.580
Then you should cry.

165
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.834
I should.

166
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.691
Her daughter really did become a doctor.

167
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.027
She runs her own clinic in Gangnam.

168
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:39.156
<c.bg_transparent><i>She married into an affluent family
and has two kids.</i></c.bg_transparent>

169
00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.242
SOOTHING INTERNAL MEDICINE CLINIC

170
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.785
What are your symptoms?

171
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.747
I didn't actually come here
because I'm sick.

172
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.416
Well…

173
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:54.171
I came to speak to you about your mother.

174
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:58.968
Your mother is currently a patient
at Gusan University Hospital.

175
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.887
And I'm her doctor.

176
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.724
Your mother misses you a lot.

177
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.561
I may be out of line here,

178
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:13.482
but I wanted to help her,
so I asked around about you.

179
00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.155
I had forgotten about my mother.

180
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.827
To be frank, all of this is making me
extremely uncomfortable.

181
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.163
Your mother was

182
00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.916
granted a stay of execution.

183
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.044
She doesn't have
to live in prison anymore.

184
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.589
But she has nowhere to go.

185
00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:41.260
I heard there are organizations
for people like her.

186
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.846
Please don't put that pressure on me.

187
00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.098
We're worse off than strangers.

188
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:49.393
Would it be too difficult to understand

189
00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.145
your mother?

190
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:52.688
Who?

191
00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:54.565
Me?

192
00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:06.410
Mom.

193
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.579
Hey, welcome home.

194
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.456
Mom, what is that?

195
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.250
It's medicine for your dad.

196
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.503
You must be hungry. Do you want to eat?

197
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:17.713
-Yes.
-Give me a second.

198
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:57.002
You're not eating?

199
00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:58.337
I will.

200
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:04.510
I was…

201
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.388
the one who poisoned his food. Not her.

202
00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.599
I wanted to be free of that hellish life.

203
00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.519
I'm the one who poisoned him.

204
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.187
So…

205
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:16.939
who am I supposed to understand?

206
00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.817
The child she gave birth to

207
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.528
made her go to jail.

208
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.406
Your mother…

209
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.492
will understand.

210
00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:34.582
You must know since you're a mother too.

211
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.012
Overall, you've taken good care
of your health.

212
00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.265
No need to take any pills
for diabetes or blood pressure.

213
00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.726
Your bone density is high
considering your age.

214
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.311
That's a relief.

215
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.897
And the mole you were worried
about on your back.

216
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.440
We did a biopsy on it.

217
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.067
It's benign. So you don't have to worry.

218
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:07.781
Then you're saying it's okay, right?
It's not something like cancer?

219
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:09.575
It's not.

220
00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:13.495
I guess I worried for nothing.
It's such a relief I came to check.

221
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.998
I should have listened
to my daughter earlier.

222
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.253
My daughter said I should get a checkup.

223
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.505
Your daughter was very wise.

224
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.924
Yes.

225
00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.091
Cancer?

226
00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.218
It's cancer,

227
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.511
but it's thyroid cancer.

228
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:33.223
The treatment is simple and easy
compared to other cancers.

229
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.893
Cancer is cancer.
What kind of cancer is simple?

230
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.647
You always talk about things
related to me as if they're nothing.

231
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.649
Jeong-suk is right.

232
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.069
Don't worry. The surgery is simple
and the prognosis is good.

233
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.279
Your father died of cancer.

234
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:51.951
The word cancer itself is so frightening
that it wakes me up at night.

235
00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:56.872
Goodness, how could life be so cruel?

236
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.292
I-rang, get me water.

237
00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:02.544
Hey, get it yourself.

238
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.129
Seriously.

239
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.965
How lazy can you be?

240
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.177
Jung-min, when did you get home?

241
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.762
Hello.

242
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.474
-I-rang, you're back from your academy?
-Yes.

243
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.228
Did you kids hear the news?

244
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.859
I have cancer.

245
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.198
Grandma, the surgery isn't a big deal.

246
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.534
You'll be admitted for three or four days

247
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:35.703
and make sure to take hormone medication
after the surgery.

248
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.626
Here.

249
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.753
You have to eat well.

250
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.715
You need strength to get surgery.

251
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.889
You're the only one
who cares about me, Professor Park.

252
00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:56.974
Of course.

253
00:16:57.057 --> 00:17:00.728
When we were young, were we able
to consider our parents' feelings?

254
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:01.979
You're right.

255
00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:04.356
What you're saying is right.

256
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.525
That's why I'm investing again.

257
00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:11.780
At our age, we need money in our hands
to be treated like adults.

258
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.575
Professor, what are you investing in?

259
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:18.162
A friend of mine opened up
a big convalescent hospital.

260
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.414
I pleaded and barely just got in
on the action.

261
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.126
How much did you invest?

262
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:30.007
Currently, you can be approved for a loan
of up to 1.18 billion won.

263
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.719
But the building is
under Cha Jeong-suk's name.

264
00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.805
Yes. That's my daughter-in-law
and because of taxes--

265
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.850
I'm the one who manages everything.

266
00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:41.143
I'm sorry, ma'am.

267
00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:45.814
Even if you're family,
the owner has to be here for the loan.

268
00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.817
I'm telling you I'm the actual owner.

269
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.694
It was initially mine.

270
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:54.490
Please visit with your daughter-in-law
to take out your loan.

271
00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:01.038
GUKIL BANK

272
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.291
Did you think I didn't know that?

273
00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:07.753
I never told her
the house is under her name.

274
00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.676
We will now begin the resident
disciplinary committee meeting.

275
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:18.222
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk, Ms. Jang Hae-nam
is your patient, right?

276
00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:22.226
-Yes.
-You knew she was a prisoner under custody

277
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:26.188
so why did you escort her to her tests
without a corrections officer present?

278
00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.899
The corrections officer
at the time was ill

279
00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:31.652
and asked me to escort the patient
to get her tests done.

280
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.737
And I said yes.

281
00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:38.575
Apparently, you also requested
the patient's handcuffs to be loosened.

282
00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:42.246
The patient's wrists were badly wounded,

283
00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:44.331
so I requested it.

284
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:48.794
Then shouldn't you have been
more cautious with the patient?

285
00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:53.048
I was in the middle
of escorting the patient

286
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:57.928
when Professor Choi Seung-hi asked me
to go on an urgent errand.

287
00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:02.057
So I was going to ask an intern
to take over,

288
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:04.309
but the patient disappeared.

289
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.729
Are you blaming this on Professor Choi?

290
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:09.648
No.

291
00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:14.319
It is my fault. I did not suspect
the patient would leave the hospital.

292
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.782
Dr. Cha, you may leave.

293
00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.701
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:24.288
Goodness.

295
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.583
Director, what will you do?

296
00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:30.502
We'll reduce her wages for three months.

297
00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:32.963
Director.

298
00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:35.215
A murderer escaped the hospital
without authorization.

299
00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.843
I don't think this is
something to be taken lightly.

300
00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.929
But the patient returned without an issue.

301
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.640
Thanks to Dr. Cha,

302
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.809
we received two robotic surgical systems.

303
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:46.977
It's not a small feat.

304
00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:52.065
Our department benefited the most,
so can't we be a little generous?

305
00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.610
Professor Seo?

306
00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.364
A three-month wage reduction will do.

307
00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:03.785
If we fire or suspend Dr. Cha
and Chairman Oh finds out,

308
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:04.995
we'll lose 10 billion won.

309
00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:07.873
A wise decision, sir.

310
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:18.842
Dr. Han.

311
00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:25.891
I'm glad you're here.

312
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:55.087
Mom.

313
00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:38.463
Your daughter was being treated

314
00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.882
at the OB-GYN for constipation
and abdominal pain.

315
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:45.345
But after she was moved to our department,
we discovered a mass.

316
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:51.518
We have to perform a C-section
before operating on the cancer.

317
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.355
But your daughter insists on waiting
until the baby weighs two kilograms

318
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:58.317
before removing the cancer.

319
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.818
Who is the baby's father?

320
00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:02.612
Well…

321
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.490
I'm not exactly sure.

322
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.367
Why are you asking the doctor that?

323
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:09.036
If she's giving birth
to a fatherless child,

324
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.830
she can stay unmarried
and raise the baby on her own!

325
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.834
Why would you curse a girl
with a promising future ahead of her?

326
00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:18.795
Why don't you live alone
if you like that idea so much?

327
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.005
Let go!

328
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:21.715
Please stop.

329
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.931
It's about after the surgery.

330
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.475
Yes, go ahead.

331
00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:35.937
Can't you just tell our daughter
that the baby died?

332
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:39.649
We'll put the baby up for adoption
through a trusted agency.

333
00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:44.071
I can't just let my 20-year-old daughter
become a mother like this.

334
00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:46.782
That's out of the question.

335
00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:49.868
We don't have that right either.

336
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.079
You should…

337
00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.539
try persuading your daughter.

338
00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.217
We have to catch that worthless father

339
00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.094
and beat him to a pulp.

340
00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:11.723
We need to restrict the employment
of assholes who abandon their kids.

341
00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.893
They should have electronic ankle monitors

342
00:23:14.976 --> 00:23:17.604
or be chemically castrated like criminals.

343
00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:21.566
Single parents get pointed at and blamed
because of scumbags like them.

344
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.735
The innocent kids get adopted abroad
and live like strangers

345
00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.904
before coming back
looking for their birth parents.

346
00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:27.906
-Aren't I right?
-Sure.

347
00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:29.366
Hey, pour me some soda.

348
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.788
This country should stop telling people
to have more kids

349
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.415
and focus on supporting the kids
who get adopted abroad instead.

350
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.584
The government always does nothing.

351
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:44.965
Didn't you say you were going
to a buffet later?

352
00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:47.050
Because it's your grandmother's birthday?

353
00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.260
A buffet is a buffet.

354
00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:50.178
Fried chicken is fried chicken.

355
00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:52.889
-Right?
-Totally.

356
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:04.651
Are you just coming back?

357
00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:06.194
Yes.

358
00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:09.531
My parents threw a fit earlier, right?

359
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.199
It makes sense.

360
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:14.452
Even I'm worried about you.
It's natural for them to worry

361
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:16.496
Do you agree with my parents

362
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.666
and think my baby should be
given up for adoption?

363
00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:23.753
Not really.

364
00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:27.966
But what I know is that
an entirely different life will unfold.

365
00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:31.720
I know that too.

366
00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:33.305
Do you think I haven't considered that?

367
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.392
I'll go now. This isn't good for the baby.

368
00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.610
Don't give out ridiculous advice.

369
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.407
Just because you're an adult doesn't mean
you have the right to give out advice.

370
00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:58.246
Raising a child on your own isn't easy.

371
00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.416
How would you know that

372
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.460
when you raised your kids in comfort?

373
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:09.299
I just shared my concern
because I'm a parent too.

374
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.427
You should know too
since you have a daughter.

375
00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.180
Were you snooping on me?

376
00:25:15.263 --> 00:25:16.556
"Snooping"?

377
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:20.143
I just happened to hear you
on the phone with your daughter.

378
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.886
I guess she could have the same one.

379
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:58.181
It's a bracelet you can buy
from the department store after all.

380
00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:14.906
I'm sorry I yelled at you that night.

381
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:17.158
I know it's not your fault.

382
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:22.414
I don't think I have the right
to receive an apology from you.

383
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:24.708
About your wife.

384
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:28.628
What will you do if she says
she's going to finish her residency?

385
00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.091
Just give me a little time.

386
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.727
Did you say goodbye to your father?

387
00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:46.730
Yes, I went to the funeral.

388
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.734
There's a single mom among your patients.

389
00:26:50.817 --> 00:26:52.902
Right, what about her?

390
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:56.406
That girl's parents want
to put the baby up for adoption.

391
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.200
My dad said the same thing.

392
00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:03.830
He continued to think Eun-seo
ruined my life until the day he died.

393
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.710
That's why I think you're so amazing.

394
00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:14.466
Thank you for not giving up on Eun-seo.

395
00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:16.509
Do you mean it?

396
00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:20.805
What do you mean?

397
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:23.975
I remember how your face went pale

398
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.561
when I told you
I was pregnant with Eun-seo.

399
00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:29.731
Even now, you try so hard
to look happy when you see her.

400
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.320
Throughout my entire life,
I always turned pale

401
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:39.157
when someone told me
that they were having my child.

402
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.910
I assure you it wasn't just with Eun-seo.

403
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.335
Can you go home late today?

404
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:54.089
How late?

405
00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:58.385
Not showering?

406
00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:00.261
Well,

407
00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:03.515
I just wanted to comfortably rest.

408
00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:08.353
We came all the way here.
You just want to rest?

409
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.024
Yes.

410
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:19.364
Sure, that's understandable.

411
00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:23.952
There was excitement between us
since we weren't married.

412
00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:27.455
If we were,
we'd be using separate rooms already.

413
00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:29.457
It's not that.

414
00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:33.753
Then what is it?
Do you have another woman?

415
00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:36.297
The truth is…

416
00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:40.510
-I'm taking medication.
-Medication?

417
00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:43.596
-What kind of medication?
-Finasteride.

418
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.392
I've been balding on the top of my head.

419
00:28:48.476 --> 00:28:49.561
You know the side effects.

420
00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:52.647
It's not reacting at all.

421
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.657
You just started taking it, right?

422
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.701
You're just getting used to it.

423
00:29:04.784 --> 00:29:07.036
After a month,
it'll start doing its job again.

424
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.371
You can't be sure.

425
00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:10.623
It's not like I can quit
medication for hair loss.

426
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.712
I haven't seen you
being this cute in a while.

427
00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:17.338
Were you so worried about that?

428
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.674
You should have told me
from the beginning.

429
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:22.802
Then for today…

430
00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.389
let's hold hands,

431
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.934
chat, and order something delicious.

432
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.479
Forget it.

433
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:33.688
We're not some gal pals.

434
00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:36.149
We can be gal pals for today.

435
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.651
This is nice.

436
00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:40.904
Then is this how I become a woman?

437
00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:42.655
No, you'll become a man again.

438
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:47.827
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

439
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:48.912
I'm sorry I'm late.

440
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.497
Why are you so late?

441
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.082
-How have you been?
-Grandma, happy birthday.

442
00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.918
Let's go eat, come on.

443
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:57.128
-Have you been well?
-Yes, Auntie. How about you?

444
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.763
What is it? Do you know them?

445
00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:07.847
Sorry?

446
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.433
No, not really.

447
00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.101
Let's go.

448
00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:45.510
This country's traffic order is a mess
because of the likes of you!

449
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:48.388
You're the one who swerved in
without using your turn signals!

450
00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.015
Look at you,
not even bothering to apologize.

451
00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:53.518
How dare you stare
and talk to me like that?

452
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:55.019
How old are you?

453
00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:56.771
Look at the direction of the car!

454
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:59.065
What about the direction? Let's hear it.

455
00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:02.652
-This is a new car!
-Sir, you can talk to me.

456
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.404
Go inside.

457
00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:06.364
Goodness.

458
00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:08.575
You should've helped her sooner.

459
00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.480
Hey, it's been a while.

460
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.650
Yes, it has been.

461
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.777
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

462
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:49.157
I actually have a favor to ask you.

463
00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:50.617
To me?

464
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.952
You'll be dispatched to
family medicine next, right?

465
00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:55.121
Yes, that's right.

466
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.748
Can't you switch with me?

467
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.625
I'll be in pediatrics.

468
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:00.752
Can we please switch?

469
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.046
Please?

470
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.509
Oh, my. You have the same one as me.

471
00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:12.263
I guess this must be popular these days.

472
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.890
I keep seeing it around.

473
00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.392
I got this as a birthday gift
from my boyfriend.

474
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:19.687
Me too. I got this as a birthday present
from my husband too.

475
00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:24.943
I thought you said
your husband passed away.

476
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.740
Well…

477
00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.241
A long time ago.

478
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:34.243
I got this

479
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.162
before he died.

480
00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:39.874
Anyway, I can switch.

481
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.043
So it's pediatrics?

482
00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.420
Yes, thank you so much, Jeong-suk.

483
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.130
Your order is ready.

484
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.132
Thank you.

485
00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:51.135
This is for you.

486
00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:53.596
Thank you, I'll get going.

487
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.067
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

488
00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:12.198
-Was that your last surgery for the day?
-No, I have another one left.

489
00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.896
I normally try not to interfere
in other people's business.

490
00:33:44.647 --> 00:33:47.567
But thinking about it, I realized
it's not exactly unrelated to me

491
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:52.822
since Dr. Cha
is both my patient and colleague.

492
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.913
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

493
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:04.000
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

494
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:09.714
It greatly irks me
to try and turn a blind eye

495
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:11.632
to what is happening.

496
00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:27.815
I don't know what you're talking about.

497
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.901
And let me warn you.

498
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:33.321
Mind your own business

499
00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:35.073
unless you want to get
needlessly misconstrued.

500
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:18.825
How dare he?

501
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.080
The patient is experiencing
a lot of diarrhea,

502
00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:26.457
so I tested for PMC,
and it came out positive.

503
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.668
The patient is on oral vancomycin

504
00:35:28.751 --> 00:35:31.796
but since the diarrhea didn't stop,
I prescribed an antidiarrheal.

505
00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:33.214
Which antidiarrheal?

506
00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:34.382
Loperamide.

507
00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:38.761
Are you out of your mind?

508
00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.098
Don't you know what happens
if a PMC patient takes that?

509
00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:48.187
If you administer loperamide,
which reduces bowel movements,

510
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.356
there will be a bacterial overgrowth
and the PMC worsens.

511
00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:51.274
You should know this.

512
00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:59.073
From now on, don't join in on rounds
and don't come into the operating room.

513
00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.367
No, don't bother coming in at all.

514
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.661
Why not start with actually
bothering to study first?

515
00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.913
Preferably somewhere out of the way.

516
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.644
Get out.

517
00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:30.646
Stop hanging around against my orders.

518
00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.542
What brings you here?

519
00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:54.879
I'm in charge of this patient.

520
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:57.215
Professor Seo told me to take over.

521
00:36:57.965 --> 00:37:00.301
I'll finish up. Please move.

522
00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:03.471
I'm already busy as is.

523
00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:12.730
What are you doing?

524
00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:15.816
Are you screwing me over
because I'm not quitting?

525
00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:18.319
Stop reading into it. It's not that.

526
00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:22.114
Then why are you treating me
like I'm invisible?

527
00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:26.744
I'm following my belief not to give work
to someone incompetent.

528
00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:28.412
It is rational and fair.

529
00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:31.540
I thought you wanted to be treated
like any other resident?

530
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.087
This is your ridiculous way of telling me

531
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.672
to quit working.

532
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:41.425
-What?
-Is it an illness of yours or just a habit

533
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:43.427
to play dirty against someone powerless

534
00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:45.429
and still act like you're high and mighty?

535
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.598
You're all about rationality and reason.

536
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.519
So did you think I'd quit
if you made a fool out of me?

537
00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:52.812
Like I did 20 years ago?

538
00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.272
Yes!

539
00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:55.856
So please just quit!

540
00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:59.068
Do you know how hard it is
to see you at work?

541
00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:07.326
You say whatever you want,
but have you ever considered how I feel?

542
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.744
No.

543
00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:12.164
I didn't think
about how you felt on purpose.

544
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.041
I want to put myself first from now on.

545
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:17.878
I finally realized
there's a life for me out there,

546
00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.338
so I can't stop again now!

547
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:21.549
Honey, this is my last chance.

548
00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.387
Please…

549
00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.973
let me continue down this path.

550
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:33.311
I won't even ask for you
to help pave the road or hold my hand.

551
00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.228
Just…

552
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.524
let me be able to walk down this path.

553
00:38:55.916 --> 00:38:57.251
You don't have to come.

554
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:22.109
Professor.

555
00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:25.446
What are you doing here?

556
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:28.532
I know, right?

557
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.827
What am I doing here?

558
00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:37.875
Do you remember
when you told me to quit last time?

559
00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:40.211
You said that on purpose, right?

560
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:42.713
Of course.

561
00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:46.842
Because I knew that you wouldn't quit.

562
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:49.387
It seems like I held out in vain.

563
00:39:51.263 --> 00:39:52.765
Dr. Cha.

564
00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:55.184
How about we become friends?

565
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.478
Not rapport, but actual friends.

566
00:40:02.191 --> 00:40:04.193
Friends?

567
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.237
That's a little too much.

568
00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:10.449
I mean, aren't I older than you?

569
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.284
Come on.

570
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.787
Just be friends with me.

571
00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.417
Do you want to exercise with me?
Let's run a marathon.

572
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.043
A marathon?

573
00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:22.586
Yes.

574
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.838
Ever since I was young,

575
00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:28.342
I could leave every worry behind
once I started running.

576
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.510
That's why I like it.

577
00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.761
Right.

578
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:34.682
When I was young,
there was this cartoon called 

579
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:38.853
The main character, Hany,
would run and console herself

580
00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:42.815
because she missed
her late mother so much.

581
00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.859
Then I naturally knew

582
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.236
that running is a good exercise

583
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:50.906
that helps you forget
about all the bad things in your head.

584
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.158
That's great then.

585
00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:55.077
I have a crew that runs on the weekends.

586
00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:56.328
You should join us.

587
00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:02.835
Dr. Kim, can I bring a friend along?

588
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:09.175
We're going to start at Jamsu Bridge
and follow north of Hangang Bridge.

589
00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:13.429
Then we'll hit Nodeul Island
and come back to Jamsu Bridge.

590
00:41:13.512 --> 00:41:14.805
It's about 9km?

591
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:19.977
But since we're beginners,
I don't think we can run for 9km.

592
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.606
Professor, can't you run along
slowly with us?

593
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:26.650
All right. Shall we begin now?

594
00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:29.153
How about we start by walking briskly?

595
00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:32.239
We'll warm ourselves up
for the first two kilometers,

596
00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.699
then we'll begin running.

597
00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:35.826
Okay, let's go!

598
00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:40.789
Hey.

599
00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:43.667
Didn't you finish a full marathon?

600
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.585
Me?

601
00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:46.003
That's news to me.

602
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:51.217
Goodness, that sneaky little fox.

603
00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:54.386
Lift it.

604
00:41:55.638 --> 00:41:56.555
A little more.

605
00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:58.599
It's not this side.

606
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.142
No, the opposite.

607
00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.062
This side--

608
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:07.525
Professor, are you okay?

609
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.487
Yes, I'm okay.

610
00:42:12.821 --> 00:42:14.782
Yes, hold it like that.

611
00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:16.242
Okay.

612
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:38.764
It's adhesive capsulitis.

613
00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:40.015
Simply put, a frozen shoulder.

614
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.060
A frozen shoulder?

615
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.437
It's not a ligament rupture?

616
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:46.438
No.

617
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:47.773
It won't heal fast.

618
00:42:47.856 --> 00:42:50.109
If you get physical therapy
and stretch regularly,

619
00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:52.736
then it'll help with the pain
and recover your mobility.

620
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.947
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want a shot?

621
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.199
I'm too young to have a frozen shoulder.

622
00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:59.827
What do you mean? You're almost 50.

623
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.579
What are you--

624
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:06.125
Hey, are you balding?

625
00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.044
The top of your head is looking sparse.

626
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:13.215
Right.

627
00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:15.884
I'm taking medication for hair loss.

628
00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:20.806
Thanks to it, I can't even get it up!

629
00:43:26.228 --> 00:43:28.188
The implant I got two years ago
is coming back up.

630
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.859
I have dysfunctions everywhere! Happy?

631
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.944
I don't even know who I am or where I am.

632
00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:36.363
I can't feel my legs.

633
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:39.283
-He's coming.
-You did well.

634
00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:42.369
-You did really well for your first time.
-Thank you.

635
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.416
To thank you for allowing us to join in,

636
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.668
how about we have dinner together?

637
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.295
It'll be my treat.

638
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:54.089
I'm so tired.

639
00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:02.139
Right, I know
some good places around here.

640
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:04.558
Sorry, I already have plans today.

641
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.394
-I'll join next time.
-Okay.

642
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.604
Bye.

643
00:44:08.687 --> 00:44:09.813
Bye.

644
00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:12.816
I think maybe that guy

645
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:14.860
is interested in you.

646
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:18.989
What kind of nonsense is that?

647
00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:20.949
Look how naive you are.

648
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:25.704
Asking to work out together
is clearly a move to start something up.

649
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.456
Stop saying ridiculous things.

650
00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:29.333
It's not good to have excessive delusions.

651
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:30.417
Then is this

652
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.753
a type of friendship Americans have?

653
00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.421
Who cares?

654
00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:38.467
Don't these kinds of misunderstandings
and delusions make life fun?

655
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:44.556
Baek Mi-hee, you must still be young
to be able to think like that.

656
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:46.809
I'm going.

657
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:50.396
-Should we do another lap?
-Forget it.

658
00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:51.522
Let's run one more lap.

659
00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:55.192
MY LOVE TO YOU

660
00:44:57.736 --> 00:44:58.612
Hello.

661
00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.419
You should be careful.

662
00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:17.548
-I really like this TV show too.
-

663
00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:18.632
I see.

664
00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:21.260
They say the leads
are really dating each other.

665
00:45:21.343 --> 00:45:23.554
No wonder they have great chemistry.

666
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.722
I'll have to take responsibility.

667
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.236
Excuse me.

668
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.113
Are you not going to pay?

669
00:45:45.617 --> 00:45:46.452
Dr. Cha.

670
00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:59.465
Should we have dinner tonight?
We weren't able to last time.

671
00:45:59.548 --> 00:46:00.424
Then…

672
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:02.301
should I also invite my friend?

673
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.595
No.

674
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.305
Just the two of us.

675
00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.184
Just the two of us?

676
00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:11.643
Yes.

677
00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:15.189
Don't you want to?

678
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:22.571
What was that?

679
00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.490
What is wrong with me?

680
00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:28.577
Why did I have that kind of dream?
I must be crazy.

681
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.037
This is so embarrassing.

682
00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:31.747
I must be out of my mind.

683
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.957
Why is my heart racing like this?

684
00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:35.584
Goodness.

685
00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:38.837
I really am crazy!

686
00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.923
I can't believe this!

687
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.966
He's a leukemia patient?

688
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:46.637
Yes. His lower abdomen hurt for a week,
and he was admitted to the ER

689
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.013
after he felt stabbing pains.

690
00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:51.892
Judging by the MRI and CT scans,
there are signs of colorectal cancer.

691
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:54.603
The biopsies didn't show any malignancy.

692
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:05.989
There's something in the mesorectum
and it doesn't seem normal.

693
00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:08.575
We have no choice
but to do a surgical biopsy.

694
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:18.502
When Dr. Jeon spoke during the briefing,
we learned he was a leukemia patient.

695
00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:19.503
Right.

696
00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:22.339
After that, two biopsies were done.

697
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.967
But they didn't come out as malignant.

698
00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:28.011
Based on the CT and MRI scans…

699
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:31.640
Are you okay?

700
00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:33.517
This too shall pass.

701
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:39.064
You've been staring
at something for a while. What is it?

702
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:40.649
It's a little weird.

703
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:43.777
This is the abdominal CT scan
of the patient, Choi Gyeong-su.

704
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.363
This is what was taken in the ER.

705
00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:49.533
And this was taken
after the biopsy was done.

706
00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:54.204
There seems to be a tiny decrease in size.

707
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:55.330
Really?

708
00:47:58.458 --> 00:47:59.793
I can't really tell.

709
00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:05.465
Maybe this isn't cancer tissue but…

710
00:48:06.925 --> 00:48:07.801
An abscess?

711
00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:11.888
It's not common, but I thought it may be
an abscess in the rectal diverticulum.

712
00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:14.766
Sure, you know that it's not common.

713
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:18.353
Don't you think it's weird
that you found a rare condition

714
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:22.941
with one CT scan, Dr. Cha Jeong-suk?

715
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:25.861
I remember I had a similar case
when I was an intern.

716
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:29.323
If it's an abscess,
you don't have to put a sick patient

717
00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:32.367
through a surgical biopsy
and can just drain it.

718
00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:33.702
Forget it.

719
00:48:33.785 --> 00:48:37.247
This decision was made after MRI,
CT, and even PET-CT scans were taken.

720
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:40.917
An abscess?
What in the world are you talking about?

721
00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:43.128
Don't say I didn't warn you.

722
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:47.007
Are you, a first-year resident,
challenging me, a professor?

723
00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:49.968
That's right, I gave it a shot.

724
00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:52.846
But if I'm right,

725
00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.682
allow me to work again.

726
00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:00.103
What if you're wrong?

727
00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:02.606
Are you going to quit or something?

728
00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.108
Fine.

729
00:49:05.692 --> 00:49:07.152
If I'm wrong,

730
00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:10.072
I'll quit.

731
00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:11.490
Deal.

732
00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:18.914
Reserve a surgery room
for Mr. Choi Gyeong-su's biopsy.

733
00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:21.750
I'll perform it myself.

734
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:27.005
Keep your promise.

735
00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:28.757
You keep yours.

736
00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:45.732
Lift it up more.

737
00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:47.567
To the left.

738
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.529
If you go straight in like this,
it'll definitely come out.

739
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:51.905
Just like this…

740
00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:01.707
The biopsy results
for Choi Gyeong-su came out.

741
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:02.708
What is it?

742
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.633
Damn it.

743
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:48.295
-Doctor, I'll take over now.
-What?

744
00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.922
Professor Seo In-ho said
that I can take over now.

745
00:50:51.506 --> 00:50:53.341
-Thank you.
-That's a relief.

746
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.135
All right then.

747
00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:58.096
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

748
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.891
Hello.

749
00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:03.727
You're a surgeon.
Why are you here getting acupuncture?

750
00:51:04.686 --> 00:51:06.646
I'm trying out everything.

751
00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:10.609
If it means getting better quickly,

752
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.738
I'd be willing to put anything
on my shoulder.

753
00:51:14.821 --> 00:51:17.199
When you have time,
put a hot compress on it.

754
00:51:18.658 --> 00:51:20.327
Doctor, it's time for Kim Min-su's Chuna…

755
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.746
Okay. Rest up.

756
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:23.663
Okay.

757
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:36.593
Hello.

758
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.971
Hello, Mr. Seo.
I'm I-rang's homeroom teacher.

759
00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:44.267
Yes, hello.

760
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:46.937
<c.bg_transparent><i>I wanted to discuss
I-rang's college admissions,</i></c.bg_transparent>

761
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.731
but Ms. Cha isn't answering her phone.

762
00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:51.733
That's why I called you.

763
00:51:51.817 --> 00:51:53.985
I see. You can speak to me about it.

764
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:57.197
I-rang wants to apply for
Hanguk University's College of Fine Arts.

765
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.115
They pick according to grades,

766
00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:01.535
so she'll have no trouble
making it past the first round.

767
00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:02.536
Wait.

768
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.246
Yes.

769
00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:07.040
It's hard for me to talk
on the phone right now.

770
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:08.917
Yes.

771
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:10.877
I'll call you back.

772
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.003
Yes.

773
00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:25.058
We finished quickly.
Are you just going to go home?

774
00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:26.935
I'm going to go see my mom
at the hospital.

775
00:52:27.018 --> 00:52:29.521
I see. The person who came
to pick you up last time?

776
00:52:29.604 --> 00:52:30.981
She was really pretty.

777
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:32.899
-Really?
-Yes.

778
00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.192
She looked like she could be your aunt.

779
00:52:36.194 --> 00:52:37.404
Are you strong, mentally speaking?

780
00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.364
I think I'm average.

781
00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:40.699
Why do you ask?

782
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:44.035
You're in 12th grade.

783
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:47.497
No matter what happens,
you need to stay strong.

784
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.587
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

785
00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:53.021
I'm home--

786
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:15.627
<c.bg_transparent><i>-Come on, let go of me!
-Honey, please.</i></c.bg_transparent>

787
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.046
-I said I'm just going to go home!
-No, gosh.

788
00:54:18.129 --> 00:54:22.384
Hey, they said my X-ray results were fine.
Why aren't you letting me go home?

789
00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:27.097
You may be fine now,
but there could be internal bleeding.

790
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.807
-You've been drinking, right?
-Yes.

791
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.850
-So just stay here a bit longer.
-Hey.

792
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.561
Do you think I can't tell
you're overcharging me because I'm drunk?

793
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:34.688
Stop cursing!

794
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.939
-Don't hit him.
-I'm sorry.

795
00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:38.441
Sir, please sit down for now.

796
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.902
You're angry
because I'm not letting you leave, right?

797
00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:43.989
-Dr. Cha. Please hurry up and come here.
-Okay.

798
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:46.533
-Please keep an eye on him.
-Okay.

799
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:47.742
We need an IV drip here.

800
00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:48.743
-Yes.
-Gosh.

801
00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:51.204
-Why are you acting like this?
-Stop it!

802
00:54:53.707 --> 00:54:55.083
Drink this and sober up!

803
00:54:56.876 --> 00:54:59.671
You shouldn't have drunk
and tripped in the first place.

804
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:01.047
That's enough!

805
00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:04.009
Sir, please lie down.

806
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:08.263
Gosh.

807
00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:11.474
Gosh, honey!

808
00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:12.767
Doctor!

809
00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.478
-I'll take a look.
-Okay.

810
00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:17.105
Sir?

811
00:55:17.188 --> 00:55:18.523
Sir, are you all right?

812
00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:20.650
-Bring the crash cart.
-Okay.

813
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:21.693
Honey.

814
00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:23.403
Sir!

815
00:55:31.953 --> 00:55:33.413
See you tomorrow.

816
00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:39.085
Right.

817
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.713
Patient Lee Yeong-bok
went into emergency surgery.

818
00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:44.174
It was a spontaneous mesenteric hematoma.

819
00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:46.009
The bleeding must have resumed

820
00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:48.678
after it was temporarily pressed
between the intestines.

821
00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:51.181
It wasn't obvious because
his blood pressure was stable for a while.

822
00:55:52.807 --> 00:55:53.892
That's such a relief.

823
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.770
Why didn't you let him go home?

824
00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.732
There was no fracture
or any other abnormal sign.

825
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:02.358
Well…

826
00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:05.070
I touched his abdominal area,

827
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:09.074
and his abdominal guarding seemed unusual
even for someone drunk.

828
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.785
I thought he had some muscle stiffness.

829
00:56:12.494 --> 00:56:16.039
So I stopped him
from being discharged just in case.

830
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:23.671
You did a good job.

831
00:56:49.322 --> 00:56:50.365
Oh, my.

832
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:52.700
Aren't you Eun-seo? I-rang's friend?

833
00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:54.619
Hello.

834
00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.412
But why are you here?

835
00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:59.332
I came to meet my mom.

836
00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.170
Your mom works here?

837
00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.296
She's a doctor, right?

838
00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:07.132
-Yes.
-Eun-seo.

839
00:57:07.215 --> 00:57:08.216
Mom.

840
00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:15.515
I recently heard your daughter
and Eun-seo are friends.

841
00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:19.561
What an interesting relationship we have.

842
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.021
I'll get going first. Let's go.

843
00:58:20.747 --> 00:58:24.459
JUST SILENCE

844
00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:55.865
Where's Dad?

845
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:57.075
Indoor golfing.

846
00:58:57.158 --> 00:59:00.245
I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.

847
00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:26.854
<c.bg_transparent><i>I recently heard your daughter
and Eun-seo are friends.</i></c.bg_transparent>

848
00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.315
What an interesting relationship we have.

849
01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.036
Professor.

850
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.705
You don't run at full speed in a marathon.

851
01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.375
Do you think you actually
are Hany or something?

852
01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.295
What brings you here?

853
01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:39.886
I have something to tell you.

854
01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:42.930
Something to tell me?

855
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.266
What do you--

856
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.060
It's something very important.

857
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.479
If I don't tell you today,

858
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.148
I might never be able to.

859
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.315
Why would that young professor
like a mother of two?

860
01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.276
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm saying working close together
may lead to it.</i></c.bg_transparent>

861
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.445
That punk knows about us.

862
01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.782
If you want to tell Dr. Cha about us,
go ahead.

863
01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.076
<c.bg_transparent><i>You've never experienced
what I have either.</i></c.bg_transparent>

864
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:47.078
It seems like someone is trying to jump.

865
01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:50.998
Dr. Cha went to dissuade him
because she's his doctor.
