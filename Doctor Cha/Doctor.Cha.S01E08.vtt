00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.640
Are you crazy? Why would you go up there?

3
00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.309
You almost died!

4
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.980
Are you okay?

5
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.118
I'm glad you're safe.

6
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.255
I'm…

7
00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.466
I'm fine.

8
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.218
I'm okay.

9
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.975
I have big news!

10
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.979
When I heard the rumor
about Professor Seo and Dr. Cha,

11
00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.523
I was skeptical.

12
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.983
But then I saw it with my very own eyes.

13
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.444
"Are you crazy? You almost died!"

14
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.321
Professor Roy took it a step further.

15
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.075
"I'm glad you're safe."

16
00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.661
You don't need to reenact everything.

17
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.454
What is this?

18
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.997
What could this be?

19
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:03.998
What do you mean?

20
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:04.958
What now?

21
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.128
Maybe they are in a love triangle! Right?

22
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.588
-Just eat your food, okay?
-Isn't it a love triangle?

23
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.756
It's nothing like that.

24
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.674
What?

25
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.300
How would you know, Dr. Jeon?

26
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.219
I just do.

27
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.305
Professor Seo and Dr. Cha
have nothing going on between them.

28
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.394
"Nothing's going on between them"?

29
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.314
Everyone heard the rumor that Dr. Cha
and Professor Seo are seeing each other.

30
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.650
Goodness, and you know Roy Kim?

31
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.527
That handsome professor is involved too.

32
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.779
People say they're in a love triangle.

33
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.698
I'm embarrassed even talking about this.

34
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.616
I mean, think about it.

35
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.162
How can someone her age not know
how to manage her reputation?

36
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.372
She's always the talk of the town.

37
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.417
Right, isn't Dr. Cha's next placement
in Family Medicine?

38
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.169
It is.

39
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.964
Professor Choi, make sure
to keep an eye on her

40
00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.549
so weird rumors don't go around.

41
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.843
I will.

42
00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.481
He can't just do that
to someone else's wife.

43
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:33.838
Are you all right?

44
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.049
Are you asking me?

45
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.967
You seemed quite shocked earlier.

46
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.471
I'm her husband but you seemed
even more shocked than I was.

47
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.640
I know, right?

48
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.476
I worry about Dr. Cha a lot.

49
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.689
In many respects.

50
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:55.485
I appreciate your concern

51
00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.029
but I'm not sure
if Dr. Cha would welcome it too.

52
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:02.951
There's a lot of talk
going around the hospital.

53
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.430
Mr. Hwang has been sent
to the suicide prevention center,

54
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.474
and a Psychiatry Department consultation
has been requested.

55
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.101
Okay.

56
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.061
I heard what happened.

57
00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:31.729
Are you okay?

58
00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:33.731
Yes.

59
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:35.900
That's a relief.

60
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.903
It's a relief no one got hurt,

61
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.864
but this event could have been
avoided altogether

62
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.742
had we consulted
the Psychiatry Department to begin with.

63
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.540
His wife told you about the possibility
of a suicide attempt,

64
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.751
and I officially notified you as well.

65
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.586
So are you telling me

66
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.006
that I'm at fault for all of this?

67
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.511
No.

68
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.555
We're all at fault here.

69
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.072
Where are we going?

70
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.241
There's somewhere I wanted to take you.

71
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.746
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
CANCER WARD

72
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.667
I'm not telling you to feel comforted

73
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.503
by witnessing other people's unhappiness.

74
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.259
<c.bg_transparent><i>There are countless patients
in this building</i></c.bg_transparent>

75
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.054
struggling just to survive.

76
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:50.433
<c.bg_transparent><i>The families of all of these patients
are just as desperate.</i></c.bg_transparent>

77
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.936
No one other than you

78
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.315
knows the full extent of your pain.

79
00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.609
So I won't say…

80
00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.529
that I understand what you're feeling.

81
00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.949
But I can tell you this.

82
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:13.873
There's no life on this earth…

83
00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.584
that isn't precious.

84
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:19.587
Sir.

85
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.048
Being able to live and breathe

86
00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:27.053
is something much more beautiful
than you think.

87
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:30.598
So don't die.

88
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.559
You must survive.

89
00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.283
Still, please never do that again.
You scared me.

90
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.828
Sorry. You must have been so worried.

91
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.454
No, I'll take better care of you.

92
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.164
Are you okay?

93
00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:56.624
I'm okay.

94
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.377
I'm really okay now.

95
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.678
I think he'll be okay.

96
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.766
His wife is young but devoted.

97
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.686
She comforted and persuaded him well.

98
00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:18.604
So I think he'll be okay.

99
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:19.522
Okay.

100
00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:22.859
And he cares about his wife too.

101
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.280
I'm just glad everything is okay.

102
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.198
Looking at that couple,

103
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.410
I felt kind of envious.

104
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:34.537
Envious?

105
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.000
Their love for each other seemed strong,

106
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.420
like they could overcome
any hardship together.

107
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:47.258
It made me wonder
if I have experienced that kind of love,

108
00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.511
or if I have received that kind of love.

109
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.638
Thoughts like that.

110
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.474
It's silly, right?

111
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.226
At least you know it's silly.

112
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:04.859
After I-rang is done
with her college admissions,

113
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:07.445
let's all go on a family trip
to Jeju Island.

114
00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.907
I haven't been there
since before we got married.

115
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.658
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.993
We went to Aewol together.

117
00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.037
Aewol?

118
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.956
When did we go to Aewol?

119
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.667
We went to Aewol, do you not remember…

120
00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:26.172
Who on earth did you go with?
Because it sure wasn't with me.

121
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.971
I went there for a conference.

122
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:39.101
You were so insistent
that for a moment I really thought I went.

123
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.313
Sorry, I mixed things up.

124
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.609
Jeez, my memory these days.

125
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.449
Look at you, working so hard.

126
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.618
You wanted me
to show my resolve with results.

127
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.496
Still, don't push yourself too hard
and get stressed.

128
00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.456
Just work hard like you always had.

129
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.166
I'm going to work harder than that.

130
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.003
WHAT TIME WILL YOU GET TO THE ACADEMY?

131
00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:14.345
-Are you close with Eun-seo?
-Why are you peeking at my phone?

132
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.264
How did you two become close?

133
00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.099
What do you mean?

134
00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:21.686
We go to the same academy,
so we ran into each other at a cafe,

135
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.939
and we exchanged lecture notes.
That's how we became friends.

136
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.984
So her mom's a doctor.

137
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.152
What does her father do?

138
00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.904
I think her parents are divorced.

139
00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.241
I didn't ask in detail,
so I don't know much.

140
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.338
Your carry has increased,
and your speed is good too.

141
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.634
But if you raise your shoulders
when you swing up,

142
00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.136
it messes up your aim.

143
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.262
Your turn.

144
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:57.680
Shall I?

145
00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:02.476
But you know, didn't you get

146
00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.148
an offer from Jaemin University Hospital?

147
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.357
I did.

148
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.151
If their offer was good,

149
00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:12.778
wouldn't it be good to accept it
and raise your pay rate?

150
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:17.158
They offered a similar salary,
and it's too far from home.

151
00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.327
And they already hired someone else.

152
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.037
I see.

153
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.247
I just thought I'd ask.

154
00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:30.755
Is something wrong?

155
00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:31.964
What?

156
00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:33.382
No.

157
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.092
I'm good.

158
00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.100
The ball went way off the mark.

159
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.186
Or is your club bent?

160
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.689
I know, I can't seem to get it right.

161
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.192
Right.

162
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.445
Eun-seo came in second
in a national art competition.

163
00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.530
You should meet and congratulate her.

164
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.163
How can you not even once
suggest meeting her first?

165
00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:10.503
Honestly, I can't look her in the eyes.

166
00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:14.673
It's scary when she looks at me
with such contempt.

167
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.635
It's because you haven't made an effort.

168
00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.720
An effort to get close to her.

169
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.516
Fine. I'll try.

170
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.059
Tell her I want to meet.

171
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.396
I should buy her something delicious.

172
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.525
-Mom!
-Ji-yun.

173
00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:34.777
-Yes, sir. We've just come out.
-Bye.

174
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:39.824
-Hello.
-Hello.

175
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:40.991
Hello.

176
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:43.786
Hi, Mom.

177
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.081
I'm on my way home.
I'm in a taxi with I-rang.

178
00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:50.626
Your dad heard you won an award
and wants to treat you to a nice dinner.

179
00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:53.170
It's not because you begged him
to meet me?

180
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.005
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

181
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:58.968
He wants to meet you
and congratulate you on your award.

182
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.053
Really?

183
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.472
If you don't want to see him,
you don't have to.

184
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.558
No, let's meet.

185
00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.269
I think it'll be fun if we meet.

186
00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:15.818
-Tell him I want to meet him soon.
-Okay.

187
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:19.655
What's going on?

188
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.782
It's nothing.

189
00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:41.719
AT THE SCHOOL LAWN
DON'T FALL ASLEEP IN-HO

190
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:42.887
FIRST PHOTO BOOTH PIC WITH IN-HO

191
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.513
HAN RIVER DATE WITH IN-HO

192
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.474
OUR LOVE IS FOREVER
IN-HO, SEUNG-HI

193
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.524
EUN-SEO IS STILL AFRAID OF CAMERAS
YOU SHOULD SMILE

194
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.743
Here, cheers.

195
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.495
Sure.

196
00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.206
Come on, talk to her.

197
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:17.213
Right. Eun-seo, I heard the award you won
is a really big award.

198
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.007
It'll help your college admissions, right?

199
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.091
Of course.

200
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:24.345
Yes, but you must dread
the fact that I-rang and I both

201
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:25.971
don't want to go to med school.

202
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.144
Well, I am a little disappointed.

203
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:34.980
But how did you two become friends?

204
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.901
I knew we were in the same academy,
so I approached her on purpose.

205
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.155
Eun-seo!

206
00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.450
Why?

207
00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.535
Why do you think?

208
00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:50.496
Because I'm curious and annoyed
about your family, Dad.

209
00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:57.795
Don't tell me…

210
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.382
you're thinking
of telling I-rang everything.

211
00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:04.718
I think it's a little too late
for you to be asking me that.

212
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.914
What's going on?

213
00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:36.125
Why are you here, Dad?

214
00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.172
I-rang, the thing is…

215
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.342
The truth is that your dad is my dad.

216
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.012
I just thought that you should know.

217
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:52.808
Your thoughtless naivety
really annoyed me this entire time.

218
00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.185
Do you not get it?

219
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.771
We're half-sisters!

220
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.815
We have different moms, but the same dad!

221
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.859
-Just stop!
-Don't yell at my daughter!

222
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:43.233
I did what you couldn't for 20 years.

223
00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:46.946
Why did you keep hiding
when it's this easy to say the truth?

224
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.498
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.837
"But a man
who commits adultery has no sense."

226
00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.548
Why are you here at this hour?

227
00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.384
Is I-rang not home yet?

228
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.969
No, she's not.

229
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.685
She's here.

230
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.521
Is Mom home?

231
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.899
She has night duty. Why?

232
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.528
Grandma.

233
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:54.490
Why did you do such a poor job
of raising your son?

234
00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.992
What?

235
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.745
-What did you just say?
-You raised him completely wrong!

236
00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.086
I guess I should congratulate you.

237
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.129
You have another granddaughter.

238
00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:12.299
Oh, my! Really?

239
00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:13.383
She's my age.

240
00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:14.968
Seo I-rang.

241
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.853
Don't ever tell Mom.

242
00:18:27.564 --> 00:18:31.235
I really don't know what I'll do
if Mom finds out too.

243
00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.995
Hey, In-ho.

244
00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:45.374
What's with her?

245
00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:52.381
You crazy bastard!

246
00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.298
Damn you!

247
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:58.720
A love child?

248
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.974
Gosh, dear Lord.

249
00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.185
What do I do with this sinful child?

250
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.480
How could you do such a thing?

251
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.399
What were you thinking?

252
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.985
What could I do
when she decided to keep the baby?

253
00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:15.571
You married Jeong-suk
after she got pregnant with Jung-min.

254
00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.907
How could you make the same mistake twice?

255
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.742
A mistake most people don't even make!

256
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:23.287
And you still consider yourself
an intellectual?

257
00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.957
By the way, how did I-rang find out?

258
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.001
My other daughter…

259
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.670
told her.

260
00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:32.796
What do we do?

261
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.175
Who gave birth to such a vicious daughter?

262
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.345
You know…

263
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.015
the mother too.

264
00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:44.933
Me?

265
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:46.643
I do?

266
00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:48.896
How could I know her?

267
00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:50.731
Who on earth is it?

268
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:55.903
Seung-hi.

269
00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.864
Seung-hi?

270
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.743
Seung-hi?

271
00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:05.204
The Seung-hi you dated in college?

272
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.372
Yes.

273
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.209
Goodness.

274
00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.843
Are you looking for someone?

275
00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:21.929
I wanted to see Professor Seo In-ho.

276
00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:24.139
He left for the day.

277
00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:29.186
Actually, Professor Seo performed surgery
on me five years ago,

278
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.104
and I made a full recovery.

279
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:35.525
During that time,
I published a collection of poems.

280
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.860
I wanted to give it to him.

281
00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:40.697
Could you give this to him for me?

282
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.367
Of course, I'll make sure he gets it.

283
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.826
-Thank you.
-Sure.

284
00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:54.628
"To Professor Seo In-ho,
whom I respect and am grateful for."

285
00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:06.014
So you've been seeing Seung-hi
even after you got married?

286
00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:08.225
No.

287
00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.227
When I was a resident,

288
00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.230
I went to the US for training.

289
00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.147
Right.

290
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:18.026
I met Seung-hi again at that hospital.
She was doing her residency there.

291
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.571
I was happy to see her.

292
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.533
And it made me think of our past.

293
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.911
After my residency, I came back to Korea.

294
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.497
Then she called me
saying she was pregnant,

295
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.541
but Jeong-suk was pregnant then too.

296
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.837
What could I do?

297
00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.840
I was at a loss for words,
so she said she'd take care of it.

298
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:44.094
But I had no idea that meant
she was going to have the baby.

299
00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:46.513
Seung-hi is a fool too.

300
00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:50.726
Why would a girl that has everything
have a child without a father?

301
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.979
She asked me to consider us divorced
and act as the child's father,

302
00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:55.981
so I met them whenever they came to Korea.

303
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.067
But three years ago,
they came back to Korea for good.

304
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:03.280
So you're saying you maintained
two families for all these years?

305
00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:06.867
Strictly speaking,
I did not maintain two families.

306
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:10.329
But once Seung-hi came back to Korea,
we saw each other often,

307
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.789
and those feelings--

308
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.124
Are you bragging right now?

309
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:16.710
You knocked up a girl
and had an affair for three years.

310
00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:17.794
What else would you call it?

311
00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.755
Mom, don't be so crass--

312
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.424
Do you think I can stay refined right now?

313
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.594
What does Seung-hi do now?

314
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.138
Does she own a clinic?

315
00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:30.432
Actually, Seung-hi…

316
00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:31.475
Yes?

317
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:33.977
…works at our hospital

318
00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:38.356
-in the same department as Jeong-suk.
-You darn little…

319
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:41.276
You don't deserve
to be called a human being.

320
00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:44.613
I must have given birth to a wild animal!

321
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.323
How can you even go about your day

322
00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:48.867
when your wife and mistress
are working at the same hospital?

323
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.495
Jeong-suk is the one
who started working against my will.

324
00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:52.746
Shut up!

325
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.498
What are you going to do?

326
00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:00.837
Make sure Jeong-suk doesn't find out.

327
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.882
You've fooled her until now.
Make sure she stays in the dark.

328
00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:06.468
But I-rang knows.

329
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:08.136
Did you not see her before?

330
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.806
She was against Jeong-suk finding out.

331
00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.599
Try and persuade her.

332
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:14.476
I'll talk to her too.

333
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.021
-Okay.
-Also,

334
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:19.940
allow I-rang to go to art school.

335
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.276
How do you expect to go against her now?

336
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:24.903
Damn you!

337
00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:49.386
Who is it?

338
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:51.847
That startled me.

339
00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:54.933
So what's your point?

340
00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:57.769
"Don't tell Mom"?

341
00:23:59.646 --> 00:24:00.814
I'd be grateful if you didn't.

342
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.692
Fine, that was my plan too.

343
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.193
I want to make this clear.

344
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:10.448
I'm not exposing your affairs
for Mom's sake, not yours.

345
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.368
Whatever the reason may be,

346
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.956
I hope you can think of it
as maintaining the peace in this family.

347
00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.374
That brings me to this point.

348
00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:23.378
With this opportunity, I decided
to reconsider your future and college,

349
00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:28.884
and despite my own beliefs,
I have decided to support your dreams…

350
00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.469
You don't have to ramble on like that.

351
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:34.806
I get that you're supporting me
because you're so damn sorry.

352
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:38.393
I got your message,
so can you please get out?

353
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:40.437
Okay.

354
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.990
But what school
do you have your eyes set on?

355
00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:54.534
Why? You want me to go
to Hanguk University?

356
00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:57.120
This country still cares a lot
about what school--

357
00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:58.872

MEET ME AT EAST WING
2ND FLOOR EMERGENCY EXIT AT 5:00 P.M.

363
00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:16.241
Hello.

364
00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:18.053
When you asked me
if I was mentally strong,

365
00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.890
were you worrying for me
before you tore my family apart?

366
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.725
I wasn't worrying.

367
00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:25.518
I was giving a warning.

368
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.481
I think you've misunderstood something.

369
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:33.485
Just because I know the truth
doesn't mean I'll tell my mom.

370
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.739
You and I can just continue living
as we always have.

371
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:39.449
Right.

372
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.534
You'll have to move academies.

373
00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:44.496
Did it never occur to you
that I'd take things further?

374
00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:45.413
What?

375
00:27:46.122 --> 00:27:47.457
You're going to tell my mom?

376
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.251
Do you think
I'll just stand back and watch?

377
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:53.421
My mom may be a resident,
but your mom is a professor.

378
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.589
My mom is a victim.

379
00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.341
Your mom is the perpetrator.
A home-wrecker!

380
00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:58.676
Then your father isn't an adulterer?

381
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.100
You said we have the same dad.

382
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.354
Will you be okay?

383
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.856
Your mom is a home-wrecker.

384
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.109
Your dad is an adulterer.

385
00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:18.321
You're a cheating couple's daughter.

386
00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:56.317
Get it together!

387
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.820
I said to move
the intestines to the right.

388
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.321
Do you not know which way that is?

389
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:01.740
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.994
Why are you daydreaming?
Did you not sleep last night?

391
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.455
No, I'll do it properly.

392
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.833
Lift it up more.

393
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.418
Bring in the camera.

394
00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:23.678
CHANGING ROOMS
STORAGE

395
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.064
Father.

396
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:37.400
What?

397
00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:39.319
We should address each other
in a professional--

398
00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:40.904
Are you close with Professor Choi?

399
00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.533
Why are you asking that?

400
00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:46.451
Are you two…

401
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.536
having an affair?

402
00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:53.833
Well…

403
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:01.883
Did I-rang tell you?

404
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.596
Did you hear from your grandma?

405
00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:09.140
-They both know?
-Then how on earth did you find out?

406
00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:11.309
I mean, the whole family knows?

407
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:15.980
Wait, that means all the rumors are true.

408
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.526
Does Mom know too?

409
00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:22.153
Your mom doesn't know,
and she can't find out.

410
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.864
You can never let her find out.

411
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.867
She's not healthy, and her work is taxing.

412
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:29.994
Anyway, she can never know.

413
00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:31.913
Yes, I agree.

414
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:39.128
I know you must be in shock
and I have no excuses to give you.

415
00:30:39.212 --> 00:30:43.132
But Jung-min, as an adult man,
I believe that you'll understand me.

416
00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:45.510
No, I don't want to understand you.

417
00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:50.598
There was a time when I wanted
to become a talented doctor like you.

418
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.226
I respected you.

419
00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.519
But not anymore.

420
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.855
I'm disappointed in you, Father.

421
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.254
Jung-min, have you eaten?

422
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:05.673
What about you, Mom?

423
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.304
Hearing you call me Mom here
makes me so happy.

424
00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:16.434
What about your medicine?
Are you keeping up with it?

425
00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:20.438
Of course. I put an alarm on
and take it regularly.

426
00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:22.607
Do you want to have dinner?

427
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.025
My treat.

428
00:32:27.403 --> 00:32:30.114
What a shame. I'm on night duty today.

429
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:31.824
Shall I take your night duty today?

430
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:34.202
You seem really tired.

431
00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.870
It's okay.

432
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:54.931
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:05.650
"The shameful truth about Actor S,

434
00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:07.735
who made my daughter a single mother?"

435
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.654
Who could this be?

436
00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:11.072
Stop looking at gossip.

437
00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:14.826
What are you doing?

438
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.203
It's Seo Min-jun.

439
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:20.915
What about Seo Min-jun?

440
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:22.625
The internet is blowing up.

441
00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.377
Apparently, he abandoned
his pregnant girlfriend.

442
00:33:25.294 --> 00:33:27.672
The girl's parents posted it
on the national civil complaints website.

443
00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:30.049
Really?

444
00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:32.468
I liked Seo Min-jun.

445
00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:34.095
How disappointing.

446
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.013
ACTOR SEO MIN-JUN'S IMAGE TARNISHED

447
00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:42.020
Right, I knew I recognized him
from somewhere.

448
00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:43.187
What are you talking about?

449
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:45.773
I think I just saw Seo Min-jun
in front of the ward.

450
00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.984
-Really?
-Yes, Seo Min-jun.

451
00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:53.114
Who told you to upload that post?

452
00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:56.951
I said it wasn't him!
I said he wasn't the baby's father!

453
00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:58.745
Just look how devoted you are!

454
00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:01.164
Do you think he'll be grateful
that you're protecting him?

455
00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:03.958
Fine, if it's not him, then who is it?

456
00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:08.087
You have to tell us the truth
for us to believe otherwise!

457
00:34:11.632 --> 00:34:16.054
Excuse me, is this Yoo Ji-seon's room?

458
00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:17.221
Who are you?

459
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.142
I'm Seo Min-jun's agent.

460
00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:48.377
Are you sure it was Seo Min-jun?

461
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:51.881
I ran into him right in front of the ward,
and we bumped into each other.

462
00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:55.301
And then he said, "I'm sorry."
That voice was Seo Min-jun's!

463
00:34:55.384 --> 00:34:56.552
It really was him.

464
00:34:56.636 --> 00:34:59.138
-It was Seo Min-jun. This is crazy.
-No way.

465
00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:01.182
Was it not?

466
00:35:02.725 --> 00:35:06.229
No, his voice sounded
just like Seo Min-jun.

467
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:07.730
The reverberation of his voice.

468
00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:11.442
I couldn't forget his voice
when he said he was sorry.

469
00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:12.860
Dr. Cha.

470
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.487
What? Yes?

471
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.991
When you went to my dorm room
to get my phone, did you clean it?

472
00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:20.785
Well…

473
00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:22.620
Yes.

474
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:25.373
There was no space left to move,

475
00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:28.501
so I instinctively cleaned things up
since you are so busy.

476
00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.504
Did I tell you to clean it?

477
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.589
You didn't.

478
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.841
Then?

479
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.970
Why did you just touch
someone else's things without asking?

480
00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.891
It was my mistake
to touch your things without asking.

481
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:45.810
Don't touch my things from now on.

482
00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:48.563
It's unpleasant.

483
00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.448
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.994
If you did, I would've
taken responsibility no matter what.

485
00:36:03.953 --> 00:36:05.246
Why did you not tell me?

486
00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:11.752
But at least I know now.

487
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:18.843
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:20.761
I'll take down the post

489
00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.472
and upload an explanation
that it's not true.

490
00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:26.475
You don't need to do that.

491
00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:27.852
I don't want to lie.

492
00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:31.230
The baby's father

493
00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:32.857
isn't you.

494
00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.276
You are not the father.

495
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:38.571
It's my ex-boyfriend's baby.

496
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:17.652
Hey, Mi-hee.

497
00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.739
Why? You want to go running again?

498
00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.325
Then what will you do?

499
00:37:25.117 --> 00:37:27.703
Me? I'm making side dishes.

500
00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.039
Really?

501
00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:33.251
Okay.

502
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:34.168
Bye.

503
00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:38.256
-Mother.
-What?

504
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:39.715
-Honey?
-Yes?

505
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.802
Can I go out to meet Mi-hee for a bit?

506
00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:43.928
Go.

507
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.972
Of course. Go get some fresh air.

508
00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:49.600
I feel so bad though. We haven't had
a family gathering in a while.

509
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.394
It's okay.
I can come home again next week.

510
00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:53.104
That sounds good to me.

511
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:55.231
Okay, then I'll be back.

512
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:11.122
-Mother, I'll be back.
-All right.

513
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:12.415
-See you later.
-Okay.

514
00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.041
-Bye.
-Okay.

515
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:26.429
It's really painful to see Mom like that
when she doesn't know anything.

516
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:31.142
End things with that woman
as soon as possible

517
00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:32.935
before Mom finds out.

518
00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:34.729
The thing is…

519
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:41.736
That relationship isn't something
that he can end that easily.

520
00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.154
He had a child with her.

521
00:38:44.363 --> 00:38:46.282
A child?

522
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:49.076
A daughter. Same age as me.

523
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.328
Crazy, right?

524
00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:11.098
He must be nauseated.

525
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:15.686
Well, it's understandable.

526
00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:26.322
Lately, my stocks are tanking

527
00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:28.366
and there are no young guys who like me.

528
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.743
Life is just no fun.

529
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:32.953
But still, your clinic is doing well.

530
00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:36.582
What's the point when all that money
just goes to paying the bank interest?

531
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.046
When you think of that,
salaried workers have it nice, don't they?

532
00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.092
-On that note.
-Yes?

533
00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:47.718
Let's go get our fortunes read.

534
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.595
-A psychic reading.
-Hey.

535
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.348
My mom goes to church.

536
00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:55.267
Don't even think about getting married.

537
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.061
What?

538
00:39:57.144 --> 00:40:01.357
As long as you don't see a man,
you have no cause for worry or concern.

539
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.151
Don't come back here
unless you get yourself a man.

540
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:06.404
Dear Lord.

541
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.699
Ask her if you are curious about anything.

542
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.451
Me?

543
00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:20.543
Is my husband cheating on me?

544
00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:22.086
He's seeing another woman?

545
00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:25.423
Mom can never, ever find out.

546
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:30.177
Father, Grandma, I-rang,
just act as you always have.

547
00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.846
That's what I think too.

548
00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.722
Having an affair is one thing,

549
00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:39.645
but it'll kill her if she finds out
that your affair produced a child.

550
00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:40.604
What about you, Father?

551
00:40:43.899 --> 00:40:45.609
I have no right to say anything.

552
00:40:46.193 --> 00:40:47.611
Just as I said last time,

553
00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:51.031
nothing good will come
from your mother knowing.

554
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:53.742
I-rang, you're on board, right?

555
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.787
I guess you do have
a meticulous side to you.

556
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.957
-Do you take after Dad in this regard?
-No!

557
00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:09.675
I don't know if it'll be possible to act
like nothing's wrong

558
00:41:10.426 --> 00:41:11.886
while hiding this big issue.

559
00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.805
They say that life is like one big play.

560
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:17.183
My gosh.

561
00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:18.142
Father.

562
00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:21.395
How long are you planning
to maintain two families?

563
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.647
I guess you would've kept going
if you didn't get caught.

564
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.067
Decide in three years,
when Mom will be done with her residency.

565
00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.529
Divorce Mom and choose that woman,

566
00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:33.616
or break up with that woman
and stay with Mom.

567
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:35.910
Promise me you'll choose.

568
00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:45.294
You already know.

569
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.171
What…

570
00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.174
-What do you mean?
-That your husband…

571
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:53.469
has zero charm.

572
00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.721
Gosh.

573
00:41:56.555 --> 00:41:58.224
He's not that bad.

574
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.683
You're the one men chase after!

575
00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.854
-What?
-Me?

576
00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:04.980
He's close by.

577
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:06.941
Think carefully.

578
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:09.318
Be careful.

579
00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:14.573
You have a rare fate.
More men cling to you as you get older.

580
00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:16.408
What on earth?

581
00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:18.744
What on earth is this?

582
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.998
Jeez, what a waste of time and money.

583
00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:24.959
Hey, what in the world?

584
00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:29.755
I guess your luck with men
will kick in later in life.

585
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:31.882
What nonsense are you talking about?

586
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:33.717
Why would men like someone like me?

587
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:37.304
Why did that woman say something
so preposterous?

588
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.472
Look at you.

589
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.766
Do you know how accurate this place is?

590
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:45.521
Well-known assemblymen
and celebrities wait in line

591
00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:48.148
to get their fortunes told here,
you crazy woman.

592
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:51.860
She's gifted.
She knew your husband had zero charm.

593
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:54.989
Hey, you little…

594
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:59.285
But why do you look so unwell?

595
00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:00.411
Oh, my.

596
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:02.454
Do I look gaunt?

597
00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:05.207
Did something bad happen?

598
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:06.292
Goodness.

599
00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:09.503
Professor, you should be a fortune teller.

600
00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:11.046
The truth is…

601
00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:14.216
my son has caused some trouble.

602
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.761
He's a professor at a big hospital.
What trouble could he have caused?

603
00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:19.513
Does he, perhaps,

604
00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:21.515
have another woman?

605
00:43:39.908 --> 00:43:42.828
In the end,
my whole family learned the truth.

606
00:43:43.495 --> 00:43:45.205
Did you come to brag about that?

607
00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.709
I'll take care of everything
when my wife finishes her residency.

608
00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:49.752
One way or another.

609
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.672
So I'm hoping that you won't interfere.

610
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:57.760
Since I don't want my ill wife
to suffer any shock.

611
00:43:58.385 --> 00:43:59.637
How…

612
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.846
considerate of you.

613
00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:05.225
That's why I'm asking you
to keep silent about this.

614
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.729
I understand what you're telling me.

615
00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:11.023
But I'm not sure

616
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:13.442
if my lips will cooperate.

617
00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:43.847
One person says to tell her,
and the other says to keep silent.

618
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:46.725
Gosh.

619
00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:49.478
What a fun scene I'm witnessing
from the middle.

620
00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:53.649
Do you still want me to tell Dr. Cha?

621
00:44:53.732 --> 00:44:55.609
I thought you already declined.

622
00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:56.735
Just wait.

623
00:44:57.611 --> 00:44:58.570
Who knows?

624
00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:02.449
I might grant one of you your wish.

625
00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:05.994
You two really suit each other.

626
00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:08.497
You create a mess without any hesitation.

627
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:10.833
But your solution is cowardly.

628
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:14.837
It might've been better

629
00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:17.005
to face it head-on.

630
00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:43.449
This is K-Fantastique Hotel, right?

631
00:45:44.032 --> 00:45:46.827
I want to make a reservation
for five for next Tuesday.

632
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.496
It's my daughter-in-law's
birthday that day.

633
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.331
Can you also prepare a cake?

634
00:45:51.874 --> 00:45:53.667
MEDICAL LICENSE
NAME: SEO IN-HO

635
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.294
A hotel? Why there?

636
00:45:55.377 --> 00:45:57.337
It's Jeong-suk's birthday.

637
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.338
I see.

638
00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.673
It's a great excuse.

639
00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:03.844
<c.bg_transparent><i>We can all gather as a family
and make her feel good</i></c.bg_transparent>

640
00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:06.138
<c.bg_transparent><i>by celebrating her birthday
and giving her gifts.</i></c.bg_transparent>

641
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.724
You've been lucky until now,

642
00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:12.019
but she works with Seung-hi,
so you might end up getting caught.

643
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:15.439
<c.bg_transparent><i>Keep an eye on her
so she doesn't do anything fishy.</i></c.bg_transparent>

644
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:16.857
I won't allow you to get divorced.

645
00:46:17.399 --> 00:46:18.484
I'm hanging up.

646
00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:28.118
Are you looking
for something in particular?

647
00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:30.120
I haven't decided on anything,

648
00:46:30.204 --> 00:46:32.289
but I want to buy
my daughter-in-law a gift.

649
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:34.124
What a great mother-in-law.

650
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.044
All mothers-in-law
are like this these days.

651
00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.420
It's not like the old times.

652
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:40.714
-Can you show me that bag?
-Okay.

653
00:46:44.676 --> 00:46:46.136
How much does this cost?

654
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.264
The medium size costs 2.3 million won.

655
00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:51.391
And the large size is 2.9 million won.

656
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:57.731
Well, can you show me
some wallets or scarves?

657
00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:58.649
Okay.

658
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:07.157
It suits you so well
since you have such fair skin.

659
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:08.116
I'll take this.

660
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.591
My shoulder hurts so badly.

661
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.760
Is there any good medicine for that?

662
00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.136
Please wait one moment.

663
00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:33.892
Hello?

664
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.064
What is this?

665
00:47:39.147 --> 00:47:41.316
Think of it as a sign of appreciation.

666
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.820
This is supposed
to work wonders on wrinkles.

667
00:47:44.903 --> 00:47:47.990
What's the point
of getting rid of wrinkles at my age?

668
00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:49.741
It's not like I'm going to get remarried.

669
00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:52.286
You're so witty, Ms. Oh.

670
00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:56.748
Gosh, people kept saying
it wasn't a serious illness.

671
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.793
But after the surgery,
I couldn't help but be depressed

672
00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:02.004
while lying in that hospital bed.

673
00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:06.258
But you prepared
all that food with such care.

674
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:11.638
You don't even understand
how touched I was.

675
00:48:12.347 --> 00:48:14.766
Why is she being so respectful?

676
00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:19.396
Well, it's a relief
if it brought you some comfort.

677
00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:22.774
Then I'll accept this gift with gratitude.

678
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:23.775
Yes.

679
00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:28.363
I want to try your rice punch
one more time.

680
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.907
I guess you've never
made rice punch before.

681
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:31.908
I haven't.

682
00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.536
It takes a lot of effort to make.

683
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.248
You strain your wrists
from kneading the malt.

684
00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:39.291
I see.

685
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:41.877
I didn't know.

686
00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:48.634
You haven't been able to see Jeong-suk
often these days, right?

687
00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:50.886
Yes, she's very busy.

688
00:48:50.969 --> 00:48:53.096
But even if it's hard, she likes working.

689
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.642
Of course, even though it's hard,
she finds it rewarding.

690
00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.061
I see.

691
00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:13.742
<c.bg_transparent><i>She's not the type to thank me like this
for making rice punch.</i></c.bg_transparent>

692
00:49:14.826 --> 00:49:19.247
<c.bg_transparent><i>She never thanked me once
for sending her kimchi every season.</i></c.bg_transparent>

693
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.633
She definitely doesn't know.

694
00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:33.762
Jeong-suk doesn't know,
and neither does her mother.

695
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:42.229
Hey

696
00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:47.192
<c.bg_transparent><i>What's the point in blaming
The unavoidable passing of time?</i></c.bg_transparent>

697
00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:54.491
<c.bg_transparent><i>I have no intention of breaking up
with Professor Seo.</i></c.bg_transparent>

698
00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.786
If you want
to tell her about us, go ahead.

699
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.872
I'll take care of everything
when my wife finishes her residency.

700
00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:04.126
So I'm hoping that you won't interfere.

701
00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.016
Professor, are you leaving work now?

702
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:24.229
I should.

703
00:50:25.605 --> 00:50:28.108
You look like you're in a good mood.

704
00:50:30.068 --> 00:50:32.279
-Is it obvious?
-Yes.

705
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:36.366
To tell you the truth,
today is my birthday.

706
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.746
I'm having dinner at a hotel
with my whole family.

707
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:42.247
I know it's not a big deal,

708
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.583
but I'm excited
we'll be having dinner at a hotel.

709
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.169
With your family?

710
00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.463
I guess Professor Seo

711
00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:51.047
will be there too.

712
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:53.592
That's right.

713
00:50:55.093 --> 00:50:56.678
I'll get going now.

714
00:50:58.305 --> 00:50:59.222
Dr. Cha.

715
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:04.728
I have something to tell you.

716
00:51:05.854 --> 00:51:07.773
It's something difficult to say.

717
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:10.901
And I'm not sure…

718
00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:12.944
if I should be saying this.

719
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.363
You're the one men chase after!

720
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:16.865
He's close by.

721
00:51:16.948 --> 00:51:18.450
Think carefully.

722
00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:22.329
Then I think it's best
that you don't say it.

723
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.873
If it's difficult to say,

724
00:51:24.956 --> 00:51:27.876
and if you're unsure
whether you should say it or not,

725
00:51:27.959 --> 00:51:29.878
then it would be best
not to say it, right?

726
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.757
That's true.

727
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.425
Then I'll get going now.

728
00:51:37.177 --> 00:51:38.136
Happy birthday.

729
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.979
It's okay to say that, right?

730
00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:05.705
Aren't you leaving?

731
00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:07.207
Not yet.

732
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.917
I want to put in
some prescription orders first.

733
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.588
Did you get back from a vacation?

734
00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:15.006
This isn't my account.

735
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.300
It's Professor Choi's social media page.

736
00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:19.386
I found it
through another doctor's account.

737
00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:20.470
Her life is so luxurious.

738
00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:24.307
I wish I could live like this too.

739
00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:26.601
I guess she went to Paris too.

740
00:52:35.402 --> 00:52:37.153
#BUSINESSCLASS #GLASSOFWINE
#EUROPE #PIT-A-PAT #TRIPTOPARIS

741
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:41.408
Oh, my.

742
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.369
I think she has a boyfriend.

743
00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:46.746
Or is it her husband?

744
00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.624
-Why do you say that?
-"Couple Goals."

745
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.960
It's a tag used only by couples.

746
00:52:55.797 --> 00:52:59.801
Wasn't there a conference in Paris
around this time?

747
00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:04.639
I think Professor Seo said
he went to a conference there.

748
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:08.894
I'm not sure, but Professor Seo
didn't go to a conference then.

749
00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:13.398
I remember him rescheduling an operation
because he was going on vacation.

750
00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:15.275
Vacation?

751
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:17.652
Professor Seo

752
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.196
went on vacation during that time?

753
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.615
Yes.

754
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.619
Gosh, this is so pretty.

755
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.877

757
00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:38.924
Can I…

758
00:53:40.175 --> 00:53:41.635
also access her social media?

759
00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:44.179
What? You can if you search her ID.

760
00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:05.951
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

761
00:54:12.165 --> 00:54:13.333
A bracelet?

762
00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.834
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

763
00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.463
I'm sorry to ask,

764
00:54:18.546 --> 00:54:19.714
but could you tell me…

765
00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:22.050
where you bought that bracelet?

766
00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:24.177
Why do you have to be sorry
for asking me that?

767
00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:28.515
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

00:56:42.774 --> 00:56:44.150
How many times have they come?

778
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:46.027
They always come…

779
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.155
-Jeong-suk.
-Hello.

780
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.907
-It's been a while.
-Hello.

781
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.033
What brings you here?

782
00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:53.034
Dr. Moon,

783
00:56:53.618 --> 00:56:57.038
remember when I said I'd switch positions
with you from Family Medicine?

784
00:56:57.831 --> 00:56:59.124
I'll need to take that back.

785
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:03.545
I have to go to the Family Medicine
Department for my next dispatch.

786
00:57:03.628 --> 00:57:05.380
But a promise is a promise.

787
00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:06.923
I'm really sorry.

788
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.175
It's difficult to explain,

789
00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.803
but it can't be helped.

790
00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:14.722
If you didn't want to switch,
you should've said so.

791
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:15.974
So annoying.

792
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.561
Fine.

793
00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:22.772
Your attitude makes me
not want to switch with you even more.

794
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:26.776
I'm going to Family Medicine next,
just as I was supposed to.

795
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:28.570
Got it, sweetie?

796
00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:31.531
Why are you calling me "sweetie"?

797
00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.450
Don't treat me like a child
just because you're old.

798
00:57:40.665 --> 00:57:41.833
When we first met, you told me

799
00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:44.461
you hated those who want special treatment
just because they're older.

800
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.713
But to me,

801
00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:50.467
I hate those who are rude,
regardless of age.

802
00:57:51.009 --> 00:57:52.385
I absolutely hate it!

803
00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:02.395
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO:
I'M AT K-FANTASTIQUE HOTEL

804
00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:06.774
IT'S MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY

805
00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.662
Can you all try to look happy?

806
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.539
No long faces on Jeong-suk's birthday.

807
00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.876
Grandma, you should have been an actress.

808
00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:26.169
Don't be sarcastic.

809
00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:28.713
I'm struggling to protect my family too.

810
00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:32.550
Who did Dad take after
to grow up to be such a womanizer?

811
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.929
Just because I gave birth to him
doesn't mean I know everything.

812
00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.765
You were raised poorly.

813
00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:39.807
Seo I-rang!

814
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:43.311
Don't tell I-rang off.
You don't have the right.

815
00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:45.563
-What?
-You're right.

816
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:47.607
I didn't raise him properly.

817
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.901
I deserve to be criticized.

818
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:51.778
See, In-ho?

819
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:54.322
You lose all your respect
as the man of the house

820
00:58:54.405 --> 00:58:56.115
when you have an affair.

821
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.867
I know that too. Why do you have to…

822
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:59.827
That's enough.

823
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:01.746
How could Seung-hi have a kid
without telling you?

824
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:03.540
Is she trying to destroy our family?

825
00:59:04.582 --> 00:59:07.544
She is just as pathetic too.

826
00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:09.712
She didn't do it on her own.

827
00:59:10.296 --> 00:59:12.549
Both parties are clearly at fault here.

828
00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:14.050
Everyone, be quiet!

829
01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:09.647
How pathetic.

830
01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:10.732
Mom's here.

831
01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.151
Mom.

832
01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:15.320
-Mom.
-Hey, Jeong-suk.

833
01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.628
I am going to leave this house.

834
01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.422
You'll see your husband at his worst.

835
01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.298
What do you think you're doing right now?

836
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.509
Simply put, it's a dirty fight.

837
01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:05.221
What if I just want a clean divorce?

838
01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:07.682
My wife is very sociable, isn't she?

839
01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:11.644
<c.bg_transparent><i>Are you going to reveal the truth?
About you and her?</i></c.bg_transparent>

840
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.480
Honey!

841
