00:01:55.698 --> 00:02:01.204
Since you've waited this long,
let's wait a bit more.

6
00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.415
A single opportunity may come.

7
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.544
And it will come soon.

8
00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.818
In-ho, don't do it!

9
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.153
Don't sign it!

10
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.363
No! You absolutely can't!

11
00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.740
No, I won't let you!

12
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.077
Mother.

13
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.039
No matter how much I think about this,
I can't let you have this surgery.

14
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.125
You should know better than I do
since you're a doctor.

15
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.919
There's no guarantee you'll be fine
after having that surgery.

16
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.045
Think of the kids.

17
00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.133
One of you two
needs to stay healthy for them.

18
00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.468
You can't. You'd have to kill me first.

19
00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.221
Don't do it. Did you sign anything else?
I can't bear…

22
00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.359
You can do it over my dead body.

23
00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.069
I won't allow this!

24
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:15.987
I won't.

25
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:24.871
What?

26
00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:28.041
He was about to sign the consent form,
but his mother showed up

27
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.335
and ripped the form,
screaming he can't do the surgery.

28
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.586
It was a complete mess.

29
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.296
So he's really not going to do it?

30
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.007
He says that he needs more time,

31
00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.092
but that just means he can't.

32
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.929
I won't let you do this.

33
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.350
A TA patient was just declared
brain-dead in the intensive care unit.

34
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.101
Should I check the compatibility?

35
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.687
It might be possible
with Cha Jeong-suk's MELD score.

36
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.158
-Honey.
-Yes?

37
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.829
Yes, tell me. What is it?

38
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.624
What?

39
00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.836
What did you say?

40
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.802
You…

41
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.387
little…

42
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.764
bastard.

43
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.492
Excuse me, the patient here has woken up!

44
00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.482

SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

47
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.870
I said you didn't have to come.

48
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.496
Still, you're getting discharged today.

49
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.541
I guess you wanted to do
at least one good thing.

50
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.628
Jeong-suk.

51
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:46.262
Do you remember what you said to me
in the recovery room after your surgery?

52
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.514
What did I say?

53
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.809
No, it must've been psychosis.

54
00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:55.313
Some patients say
absurd things after surgery.

55
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.773
That's strange.

56
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.400
I'm not normally the type
to say absurd things.

57
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.230
Hey, welcome home.

58
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:38.689
Mother.

59
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.402
Welcome back after regaining your health.

60
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.827
Mother called a place
and had them disinfect the entire house.

61
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.079
Your immune system is weak
after a transplant,

62
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.497
so you're prone to infections.

63
00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.208
Thank you, Mother.

64
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.417
You did well.

65
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:09.720
Your coffee.

66
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.476
-Mother, come sit down and eat.
-Okay.

67
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.774
Jeong-suk, do you want
to swing by Jay Department Store today?

68
00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:22.900
The department store?

69
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:26.654
Yes. A handbag that I bought
a while ago just came in.

70
00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:29.282
I waited six months,
so I was going to go pick it up myself,

71
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.576
but I have plans with a friend
who's back from the US after three years.

72
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.747
Don't give me that look.
My days are numbered now.

73
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.249
I bought one for the first time

74
00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.668
by saving up the tiny amounts
I get from my pension.

75
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.088
You also bought a mink coat last winter.

76
00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.591
I only had out-of-season winter clothes,

77
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:48.259
so I had no choice but to buy one.

78
00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:51.053
Three months ago,
you bought a designer wallet,

79
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.222
and last month you
got an 800,000-won scarf…

80
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.140
Hey.

81
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.100
Why do you have such a good memory?

82
00:07:56.767 --> 00:08:00.688
So are you saying that
you're going to go for me or not?

83
00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:04.775
I'll go get it for you.

84
00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:07.278
While I'm there,
I'll do some window shopping.

85
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.907
Sounds good. Do all
the window shopping you want.

86
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.200
Right, about the bag.

87
00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.619
Don't just bring it home
like you did last time.

88
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:17.663
You know you have
to check meticulously for any flaws.

89
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.581
Yes.

90
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.916
Let's eat.

91
00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.876
-Okay.
-Hurry up and sit.

92
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.213
Jung-min, you should eat slowly
or you'll get indigestion.

93
00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.923
I don't even want to eat breakfast.

94
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.676
-I said I just wanted to sleep more.
-You still have to eat.

95
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.137
Interns don't have time for breakfast.

96
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.140
Mom, I said I want a croissant, not toast.

97
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.975
I toasted the bread. Have it with cheese.

98
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.894
And drink your milk.

99
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.938
What's with the coffee?

100
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.773
I bought new beans.

101
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.399
Just buy the ones we used to drink.

102
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.360
Why can't you understand
I hate the acidic taste?

103
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.323
Why do you speak so curtly to your wife?

104
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.158
In-ho.

105
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.328
Jeong-suk, is my juice not ready yet?

106
00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.872
No, I'll have it ready for you soon.

107
00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:03.334
Hey, Jeong-suk, goodness.
I told you not to scrimp

108
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:05.836
when it comes to buying
the ingredients for my juice.

109
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.839
Do you think juice made
from wilted ingredients will be healthy?

110
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.299
That's not detox juice,

111
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.509
but toxic juice.

112
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.135
Mom, I have to go.

113
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.179
-Where's my mask?
-Mask?

114
00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:19.809
Eat some more, okay?

115
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:23.688
That was hilarious.

116
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.524
It went like this…

117
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:30.361
<c.bg_transparent><i>The realization of my loneliness

119
00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.166
What was I…

120
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.627
to them?

121
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.386
Wrap up the bottle of wine
on the first row of the wine cellar,

122
00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:56.846
all the way on the right.

123
00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.639
It's a gift to the hospital director.

124
00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.932
Okay.

125
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.310
Hey, did you apply
for your disability rating yet?

126
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:03.894
Disability rating?

127
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.688
If you have a liver transplant,
you get a Grade Five.

128
00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:08.858
Really?

129
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.319
But what's the point?
There aren't many benefits.

130
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.363
What are you talking about?
With parking so difficult these days,

131
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.407
it's great to park
in a disabled parking space.

132
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.658
The spot is great too.

133
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.577
You'll be able to apply online.

134
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.128
And about the new air purifier.

135
00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.340
Is it the one
with the lowest price on the market?

136
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.259
These days, the prices can vary greatly

137
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.845
even for the same brand and product.

138
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.931
You can lose so much money
by buying from the wrong retailer.

139
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.058
Where did she go?

140
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:46.604
She went to look up the prices, jeez.

141
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.128
But for SUDD, if fecal calprotectin
is used as a biomarker,

142
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.630
then the reliability
in the diagnostic rate increases.

143
00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.966
For unspecific symptoms like bloating,

144
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.843
pain, and altered bowel habits

145
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:01.971
often associated with IBS,

146
00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:05.933
it's hard to confirm if image tests
like colonoscopy aren't conducted.

147
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:07.059
But for SUDD,

148
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.478
because the fecal calprotectin
comes out higher than normal…

During a colonoscopy,
the location of diverticula,

153
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.331
the number of diverticula
per colonic segment…

154
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.624
I'm the one using it.

155
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.968
I've brought out the bag
that Ms. Kwak Ae-sim ordered.

156
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:45.014
We checked in the morning
that there was nothing wrong with it.

157
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:48.642
But we prepared it so that
you can check for yourself as well.

158
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.728
It's okay. Just give it to me.

159
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:52.897
But still, you should still check it once…

160
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.982
No, it's fine. Just package it for me.

161
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:56.275
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.780
-Excuse me?
-Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.033
Is there another one of those bags here?

164
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.994
Hello.

165
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.704
How are you feeling?

166
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:10.122
It still hurts.

167
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:12.166
It hurts?

168
00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:14.585
Cough as much as you can.

169
00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:16.420
You have to keep walking around

170
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:17.963
so you can release gas quickly.

171
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.132
-Make sure you walk, okay?
-Okay.

172
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.094
-How are you feeling?
-I've gotten a lot better.

173
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.721

JAY DEPARTMENT STORE

177
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.903
This is really something.

178
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:50.079
You guys can go ahead.

179
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:00.798
Where are you?

180
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.884
Where do you think? Cheongdam-dong.

181
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:04.969
What's your deal?

182
00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:07.888
-You must have been quite shocked.
-Did you buy all those things?

183
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.891
Right, I didn't find
the lowest price on the market,

184
00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.601
so we probably lost some money.

185
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.853
Why are you suddenly acting weird?

186
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.982
Maybe it's because I escaped death.

187
00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.984
I wanted to start doing things
I hadn't done before.

188
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:21.360
Is that why you spent--

189
00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.657
Are you crazy?
You could buy a car with all that money.

190
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.701
I spent the last 20 years
not doing stuff like this.

191
00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:31.620
I always used the handbags, coats,
and other things

192
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.747
after your mother got tired of them.

193
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.583
But I've never considered
buying them myself.

194
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:39.169
I couldn't even make a credit card
since I had no job

195
00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.463
and no assets under my name.

196
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.967
<c.bg_transparent><i>I had to go around with a credit card
that was under your name,</i></c.bg_transparent>

197
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.927
<c.bg_transparent><i>and I felt like I was being watched
every time I used it.</i></c.bg_transparent>

198
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:50.472
That's why I could never
spend money on myself,

199
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:54.268
like buying clothes or cosmetics,
or going to a salon.

200
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.603
Thank you.

201
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.272
-No one told you to live that way.
-Exactly.

202
00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:01.859
<c.bg_transparent><i>You make good money,
and you even have a house you inherited.</i></c.bg_transparent>

203
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.152
So why did I live like that?

204
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.987
Why are you asking me that?

205
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.824
Because of my pride in wanting
to stay detached from your money?

206
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:13.621
Because I thought it was unreasonable
to spend money that I didn't earn myself?

207
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.081
I think those were the reasons.

208
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.043
-But?
-But all of that was pointless.

209
00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:23.213
I want to live a little shamelessly
doing the things I want.

210
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.423
What?

211
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:27.760
I'm going to live
however I please from now on.

212
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:34.516
She hung up.

213
00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.480
That was good.

214
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:40.481
So damn good.

215
00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:45.027
Where were you hiding that
sharp tongue of yours this whole time?

216
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:46.904
You did well, okay?

217
00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:49.323
You need to spend money
to learn how to spend it.

218
00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:52.993
People think
I buy designer clothes every season

219
00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:56.747
and travel abroad on vacation
because I got married into a rich family.

220
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.708
But my only asset is a house that required
taking out a large mortgage,

221
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.962
and my only source of income
is my husband's salary.

222
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.673
But I didn't dislike being misunderstood.

223
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.342
I'm a snob after all.

224
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.594
You would've been more well-off

225
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.554
if you lived alone and kept working.

226
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.432
You would've had a home and a car
under your name.

227
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.688
But still, I thought my life was perfect.

228
00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:25.109
I may be at the bottom of the food chain
within my own household,

229
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:28.612
but on the outside, I'm the wife
of a prominent university hospital doctor

230
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.907
and a mother of a rich household
with smart kids.

231
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.619
Though I'm just a housewife now,
I felt superior to others

232
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:38.163
because I was an elite
who finished med school.

233
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.751
I stood tall and proud.

234
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:49.800
I thought I was living an upper-class life
that wasn't lacking by any standard.

235
00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.302
But?

236
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:53.971
But…

237
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.933
after coming back from the brink of death,

238
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.310
it turns out all of that was meaningless.

239
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.180
How can you sleep?

240
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.224
I bet you were happy
when your mother stopped you,

241
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.185
even though your wife was dying.

242
00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:45.981
Do you think I wouldn't know
that you felt relieved?

243
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.941
You're a hypocrite and a selfish prick

244
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:52.613
who acts as if you're the most ethical
and the most decent person in the world.

245
00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:57.201
Through this opportunity,
I saw the real you, you horrible bastard.

246
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.836
Did you just slap me?

247
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.964
-Yeah.
-Why?

248
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.050
-Because I'm in a bad mood.
-What?

249
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.718
Do you get facial treatments?

250
00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.137
Why is your skin so nice?

251
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:20.057
It seems like you haven't changed,
and I'm the only one who has gotten old.

252
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.393
You're mad that I have nice skin?

253
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:27.856
So you slapped me?

254
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.609
This was the first time
you've been slapped in the face, right?

255
00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:32.444
Yes.

256
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:33.946
So what?

257
00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:37.199
You slapped me to give me
an experience I'd never had before?

258
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:41.161
It felt like I was slapped
out of nowhere like that too.

259
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.581
I came to my senses after I got hit.

260
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.376
Why on earth are you being like this?

261
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.130
If someone has been
through something that big,

262
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.427
psychological changes can occur.

263
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:01.723
They could want to go shopping,
not do housework,

264
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.768
and show hostility toward
family members for no reason.

265
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:08.897
Right, that can happen.

266
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:10.607
I…

267
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.026
understand it all.

268
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.070
Do you really understand?

269
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.156
Yes.

270
00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:19.658
I do understand.

271
00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:26.081
So going forward,
just relax and focus on your recovery.

272
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.333
Don't worry about household chores,

273
00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.794
and do some shopping
from time to time too.

274
00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:35.132
I have to go to the bathroom.

275
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.759
You don't go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

276
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.677
I do.

277
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:46.977
Be careful.

278
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.606
Hypocrite.

279
00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.252
Mom, what about breakfast?

280
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:15.756
Even if I prepare breakfast,
you barely eat, so I didn't bother.

281
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.592
If you want to eat something,
prepare it yourself.

282
00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:35.067
I-rang, make your own breakfast
from now on. Your mom is exhausted.

283
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.860
What about my coffee?

284
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.613
I bought some capsules over there.
Drink those.

285
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:41.365
They're so easy to use.

286
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.825
-Why would I drink instant coffee?
-What do you mean?

287
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.078
You said I didn't have to worry
about the household chores anymore.

288
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:58.423
-Did Jung-min already leave?
-No, he didn't come home yesterday.

289
00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:00.759
Hey, that's my…

290
00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.470
What about my detox juice?

291
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.556
The ingredients for yours
are in the fridge.

292
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.267
You can make it yourself.

293
00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.193
Mother, will you be okay with the juicer?

294
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.863
-Shall I teach you how to use it?
-It's fine. I'll figure it out myself.

295
00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.782
Appliances are all the same.

296
00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:24.700
Okay.

297
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.327
Right. Mother, here.

298
00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.458
Please clean this too.

299
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:36.795
-Wait--
-Right. I'll be using the car today.

300
00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:38.338
Hey…

301
00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.176
What's with her?

302
00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:51.893
Mom, it's still early.
Where are you going?

303
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.271
-To go eat brunch.
-Brunch?

304
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.357
-See you…
-I'll see you.

305
00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:07.284
Thank you for the food.

306
00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:08.785
Do you not have food at home?

307
00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:11.496
Why did you barge into my house so early
asking for food?

308
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.125
This food is different though.
Your food is like medicine.

309
00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.668
Don't even mention medicine.

310
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.339
If I think about how much
it made you suffer, it pains me.

311
00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:25.052
It's fine. I'm alive right now
since my surgery went well.

312
00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:27.846
I've been…

313
00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:31.308
praying every day.

314
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:33.894
I don't even know how to pray,

315
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:36.480
but I pray with all my heart.

316
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:41.777
If I think about the donor
and their family,

317
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:47.324
I feel so guilty for feeling so happy
about my daughter living.

318
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:52.746
Why do you always think
you're a sinner and feel guilty?

319
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:55.707
Every night,
I feel so uneasy and restless.

320
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:59.294
I'm worried that you'll suffer again
due to transplant rejection.

321
00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:01.630
Even when I'm praying
about how grateful I am,

322
00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:03.548
my heart sinks worrying about you.

323
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.301
My gosh, it's fine.
You don't have to worry.

324
00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:10.013
I've been diligently taking
my immunosuppressants, okay?

325
00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.766
So from now on,

326
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:16.603
always be healthy,
enjoy and live a happy life.

327
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.233
I want to do that too,
but it's not that easy.

328
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:22.234
Why?

329
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:25.654
I don't know what makes me happy.

330
00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.657
Happiness isn't rocket science.

331
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.659
Start with something small.

332
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.285
Something you like the best.

333
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.162
What is it that I like?

334
00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:37.290
What did I like to do?

335
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:38.834
You don't even remember that?

336
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:41.253
The thing you liked the most was studying.

337
00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:43.130
Studying?

338
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.383
Come on, I'm way too old to study.

339
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:49.636
I don't know what you should study.

340
00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.805
But ever since you were young,

341
00:23:51.888 --> 00:23:54.975
you always liked
studying more than playing.

342
00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:56.893
And you liked learning about things.

343
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:13.785

will not go unpunished."

348
00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:46.651
"Amen."

349
00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:50.113
-Mother, I'll be back home later.
-Jeong-suk.

350
00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:52.824
You look good in those clothes.

351
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:55.076
I got myself a new outfit.

352
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.745
I see.

353
00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.122
You're going out frequently these days.

354
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.374
Can I ask what plans you have tonight?

355
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:04.377
Yes, of course.
I'm going to drink wine with Mi-hee.

356
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.503
Wine?

357
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.547
-I'll be back later.
-Okay.

358
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:10.175
Jeong-suk, isn't that my bag?

359
00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:11.760
This?

360
00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.221
Well, I bought one for myself as well.

361
00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.640
Then it's a knock-off?

362
00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:21.853
They made it so similar that
you can't tell the difference at a glance.

363
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:24.064
-Let me see the inside.
-Sure, take a look.

364
00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.066
Oh, my. It's exactly the same.

365
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.651
-It's the same as yours, isn't it?
-Yes.

366
00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:28.902
It's because it's real.

367
00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:34.574
Last time, when I went to pick up yours,
the store said they had one more.

368
00:25:35.283 --> 00:25:37.077
It was so pretty that I bought one too.

369
00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:40.247
How could you when it's so expensive?

370
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.667
I know, right? It was really expensive.

371
00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.669
But it's really pretty, isn't it?

372
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:47.921
I'll be back later.

373
00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:52.592
She must've gone crazy.

374
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:53.802
Lord have mercy.

375
00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:56.930
She's recently had surgery,

376
00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:58.848
-so pour her a little.
-I'll just hold the glass.

377
00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:06.231
It's been so long
since I came to a place like this.

378
00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:09.025
How is it that there are
so many places you haven't been to?

379
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:10.610
How did I end up like this?

380
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.363
Why are you asking me?
That's the life you chose to live.

381
00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:18.076
Right, I brought this unhappiness
upon myself, no one else.

382
00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:23.164
If your husband had been your liver donor,
would you still be like this?

383
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.541
No way.

384
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.043
If he had,
I would have been even more grateful

385
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:31.798
and pushed myself even harder
to become an even better wife.

386
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:32.841
Isn't it obvious?

387
00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:37.220
Then you should have
just let Seung-hi have In-ho.

388
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:41.558
Seung-hi? Who's Seung-hi?

389
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:43.935
How do you not know her?
She's your husband's first love.

390
00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:54.070
You rarely ask us to come to this place.

391
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.905
You don't like eating a lot like this.

392
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:59.284
It's hard to have
a proper meal these days.

393
00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:02.370
Why? You said your wife
serves you food like a king.

394
00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.081
I don't know. Ever since she got sick,

395
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:07.417
she just hates doing everything.

396
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.586
Here, eat this too.

397
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.631
<c.bg_transparent><i>Seo In-ho and Choi Seung-hi
were a famous couple on campus.</i></c.bg_transparent>

398
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:17.344
<c.bg_transparent><i>Everyone thought that
they'd get married to each other.</i></c.bg_transparent>

399
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:19.387
Oh, my.

400
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.723
Gosh, how could I forget that name?

401
00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.683
I guess a lot of time has passed.

402
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.477
You have a great memory.

403
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.314
Seung-hi, Mi-hee.
They used to call us the Hi-Hee sisters.

404
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:32.567
Right.

405
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:36.321
Even couples who were crazy
about each other at the start

406
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.824
naturally end up living
like strangers as time passes.

407
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.577
But we had an issue from the get-go.

408
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.746
You were an extremely problematic couple.

409
00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:49.501
One day, In-ho up and left Seung-hi
and married you.

410
00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.336
On top of that, it was a shotgun marriage.

411
00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:55.340
Exactly when was Jung-min conceived?

412
00:27:55.423 --> 00:27:57.634
-Forget about it.
-It's about time you tell me.

413
00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:10.397
<c.bg_transparent><i>In the second year of pre-med
during winter break,</i></c.bg_transparent>

414
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.150

<c.bg_transparent><i>but I didn't get very far
before I sprained my ankle,</i></c.bg_transparent>

417
00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:26.121
 so I went back to where we were staying.

418
00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:36.840
<c.bg_transparent><i>But for some reason,
Seo In-ho was the one who took me back.</i></c.bg_transparent>

419
00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:40.969
My goodness.

420
00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:43.888
I didn't expect you this early,
so I had the heater off.

421
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.850
It'll get warm soon.

422
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:48.268
When we got back to our accommodation, 

423
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:52.897
<c.bg_transparent><i>the owner must have
turned the heat all the way up</i></c.bg_transparent>

424
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:54.733
because it was boiling in there.

425
00:28:57.652 --> 00:29:00.947
In-ho was compressing my ankle,

426
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.867
and his face got so close to mine.

427
00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:19.340
His face was so beautiful.

428
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:24.846
And he smelled so good too.

429
00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.853
Wouldn't it have been the same for him?

430
00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:36.274
<c.bg_transparent><i>Two hotblooded youngsters
in a heated room all by themselves?</i></c.bg_transparent>

431
00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:41.488
<c.bg_transparent><i>And Seung-hi was on a trip abroad,
so there was no one there to stop us.</i></c.bg_transparent>

432
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.948
I guess it was just meant to be

433
00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:45.658
because the timing was so perfect.

434
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.461
That's…

435
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.297
when Jung-min was conceived.

436
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:02.300
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

437
00:30:18.274 --> 00:30:19.484
You bastard.

438
00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:22.320
You horrible bastard.

439
00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.281
<c.bg_transparent><i>When you were going to school
with your belly bulging out,</i></c.bg_transparent>

440
00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:27.534
we all felt bad for Seung-hi.

441
00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:29.786
Imagine how absurd
it would've been for her.

442
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:33.414
Back then, we were all young,
so we all got past it.

443
00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:37.794
But if you think about it now,
isn't Seo In-ho truly a horrible bastard?

444
00:30:37.877 --> 00:30:39.671
He's a complete bastard.

445
00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:42.340
And I'm…

446
00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:45.760
a horrible brat too.

447
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.347
Still, your husband said he would
take responsibility for you and your child

448
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.515
and he married you.

449
00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:52.684
Back then, it seemed admirable.

450
00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.936
Your mother-in-law threw a fit back then.

451
00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:57.564
"You two, are you out of your minds?"

452
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.946
Hey, I've been subservient my whole life
because of how grateful I was for that.

453
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:10.076
Flattering my husband, mother-in-law,
and then even the kids later on.

454
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:12.829
But seeing that none of you ran away

455
00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:15.456
and all three of you graduated
from medical school,

456
00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:17.584
all of you really are something.

457
00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.670
Do you know how Seung-hi is doing?

458
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:27.135
You seem like your mind
is somewhere else lately.

459
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.221
Really? Sorry.

460
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.181
I was all out of sorts.

461
00:31:32.807 --> 00:31:35.518
Is your daughter a sophomore?
Does she want to go to med school?

462
00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:38.479
-Yes.
-She must be smart.

463
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.273
Well, she is.

464
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:43.902
But at this rate, she might have
to go to a med school outside of Seoul.

465
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:46.529
She got into art, so she flunked a bit.

466
00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:50.366
You seem indifferent about your kids,
but you are quite devoted.

467
00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:53.578
Why are you saying that?

468
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.538
You know that I'm not a great father.

469
00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:58.666
This may be my guilt talking,
but it sounds like you're blaming me.

470
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.502
The fact I interfered with your life.

471
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:04.714
-Do you resent me for it?
-I think it was fate.

472
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:09.093
The fact I met you again at the hospital
in the US where I went for training.

473
00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:11.846
The fact that our connection
has brought us here.

474
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.017
They are some things
that humans cannot control.

475
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.605
I have no idea.

476
00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.441
I don't meet
with former classmates that often.

477
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.568
After med school,

478
00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:30.657
Seung-hi cut ties with everyone
while doing her residency in the US.

479
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.410
There are rumors
that she had kids and got divorced.

480
00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:35.828
I see.

481
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:38.665
She must be living well.
She's the daughter of a rich family

482
00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:41.501
that runs a clinic franchise
with over ten branches.

483
00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:43.211
She was pretty and had a good body.

484
00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:46.047
Considering her upbringing,
it's easy for her to be rude,

485
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.674
but she had a great personality.

486
00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:52.762
When you put it like that,
I feel even smaller.

487
00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:57.558
I already can't control
this empty feeling in my heart.

488
00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:00.228
Why? Do you feel uneasy?

489
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:06.359
There has to be a realistic way
to get rid of this empty feeling.

490
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.152
What is it?

491
00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:09.737
Perhaps…

492
00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:13.032
a man?

493
00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:42.103
Are you filming a commercial or something?
The video came out great.

494
00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.480
I'm sure it'll blow up
if you upload it on social media.

495
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.333
Man, my foot.

496
00:34:05.668 --> 00:34:06.919
I'm going to ask

497
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.797
to have my name added to the house deed.

498
00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.299
That's great!

499
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.260
At our age, I think
that's a reasonable request

500
00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:16.804
between a couple
that's been married for over 20 years!

501
00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.557
-Right?
-Go get it, Cha Jeong-suk.

502
00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:38.576
Patient Kim Yeon-suk from ward 151,

503
00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.288
please return to the ward.

504
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.592
I have surgery soon, so no tea for me.

505
00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.552
What brings you to the hospital?

506
00:34:57.345 --> 00:35:00.681
You look surprised.
It's not like I'm not allowed to be here.

507
00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:04.018
It's just that
you've never visited me here.

508
00:35:04.727 --> 00:35:07.522
I wanted to see Jung-min,
so I thought I'd drop by.

509
00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:08.689
I have something to say too.

510
00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.566
What is it? I only have five minutes--

511
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.360
Our house.

512
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:14.612
I want it to be jointly owned.

513
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.324
Jointly owned? With whom?

514
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:20.701
Isn't that obvious? Me.

515
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.873
So that's the reason
you came all the way here?

516
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.960
I always wondered,

517
00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:32.380
"Why is my phone
the only thing I have under my name?"

518
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.006
"Are other families like this too?"

519
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.010
I was always so curious
but too embarrassed to ask.

520
00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:41.222
I thought other wives
would treat me like an idiot.

521
00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:44.809
I inherited that house,
so I can't do whatever I want with it.

522
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:46.978
We'll talk later at home.

523
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:48.354
I have nothing else to say.

524
00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:50.064
Prepare to answer me when you get home.

525
00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:07.790
What, you crazy bastard?

526
00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:15.464
Who are you to send
a patient home, you idiot!

527
00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:18.426
I mean, I said that
they needed to be tested,

528
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.595
but the patient was adamant
about going home.

529
00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.305
Did it make you feel
like you were a real doctor

530
00:36:22.388 --> 00:36:23.890
after the patient said they felt better

531
00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:26.267
just because of
some painkillers you prescribed?

532
00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.228
Stop playing doctor at the ER.

533
00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:33.107
That patient should've had an appendectomy
and be in a hospital bed.

534
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:35.109
But because of you,

535
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.654
they're in excruciating pain
from septic shock from panperitonitis.

536
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:39.780
Do you understand?

537
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:45.453
What are you doing?
Hurry up and contact that patient.

538
00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:01.010
She's literally crushing him.

539
00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:05.389
She even looks mean.

540
00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:11.020
Doctor.

541
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:15.858
Doctor.

542
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.528
Oh, my. Professor.

543
00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:26.494
-But did you just call me "doctor"?
-Yes.

544
00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.705
It's been so long
since someone called me that,

545
00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:32.625
so it didn't cross my mind
you'd be referring to me.

546
00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:36.754
But it's nice to be called a doctor.

547
00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:39.548
It's nothing, but you seem
to be enjoying it a lot.

548
00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:40.466
Doctor.

549
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.219
Give me your number.

550
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:52.478
I feel like you misconstrue things often.

551
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:57.275
That's not it. It's just that you asked
for my number so suddenly.

552
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.859
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:02.196
The pictures of you.
I thought I should send them to you.

554
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.823
Right.

555
00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:07.410
You're right. There's no need for you
to hold onto photos of me.

556
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.204
Here you go.

557
00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:14.583
I sent them.

558
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:15.501
Okay.

559
00:38:22.174 --> 00:38:23.301
You can delete them now.

560
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:26.304
What brings you here though?

561
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:28.389
Someone asked to see me.

562
00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:30.516
What about you?

563
00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:33.144
I came to meet my son and husband.

564
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.521
You said they were both doctors, right?

565
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:37.940
So they work here.

566
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.027
Do you feel all right?

567
00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:45.323
Yes, you performed the surgery so well.

568
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:48.117
I wasn't able to properly thank you.

569
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:53.080
I guess being sick made me
forget my manners.

570
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.082
Thank you so much, Dr. Kim.

571
00:38:56.208 --> 00:39:01.964
To a doctor, there's no better thank you
than if a patient becomes healthy again.

572
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:07.386
I had forgotten for a long time,
but being a doctor…

573
00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.139
is such a good profession.

574
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:13.392
You heal the sick.

575
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:19.982
Do you have plans to work again?

576
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:21.859
What?

577
00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:25.821
That'd be a disservice to the patients.

578
00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:27.948
You saw what happened last time.

579
00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.075
That's not true.

580
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.580
I think you would do a good job.

581
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:38.793
Me?

582
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:12.493
THE 48TH CLASS OF GUSAN UNIVERSITY

583
00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:34.265
Joint ownership?

584
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:36.600
Yes, I thought that
I should consult with you.

585
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:40.396
Of course, you should consult me!

586
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.398
I'm the one who persuaded your father

587
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.608
-to switch the deed to your name early.
-Right.

588
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:48.446
Did the big surgery
mess with her head or something?

589
00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:49.655
I was surprised too--

590
00:40:49.738 --> 00:40:51.157
Don't even listen to her.

591
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.408
She'll hear you.

592
00:40:52.491 --> 00:40:53.951
That's the point!

593
00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:55.369
How dare she demand this?

594
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.413
She must've gone crazy
after that sickness.

595
00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:58.664
Look at her going on a power trip!

596
00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:00.624
-Stop going on a power trip!
-Come on.

597
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:02.251
Let go.

598
00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:03.544
My back hurts.

599
00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:07.673
I thought I had it under control.

600
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.512
RESIDENT
DR. CHA JEONG-SUK

601
00:41:37.536 --> 00:41:39.997
Do you have plans to work again?

602
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:56.388
Come here for a moment.

603
00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:00.518
CHA JEONG-SUK

604
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:02.061
What is it?

605
00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:05.439
About the joint ownership,
I consulted my mother--

606
00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:10.194
I consulted her, and…

607
00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:12.488
I think it'll be hard.

608
00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:14.114
She doesn't want to do it?

609
00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:15.783
It's under your name.

610
00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.076
She's from an older generation,

611
00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:19.620
so she may not be able to understand.

612
00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.206
I hope you can understand this time.

613
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.710
Was there ever a time
when I didn't understand?

614
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:28.462
Don't go all negative about this.

615
00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:31.340
You seem to be having fun lately
even without this.

616
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:34.176
Honey.

617
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:37.179
What if…

618
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.683
I applied for residency?

619
00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:45.104
-What?
-Because of Jung-min's accident,

620
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:47.022
I gave up on the residency.

621
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:51.485
Lately, I have a lot of regrets
about what I gave up back then.

622
00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:56.323
I was thinking of starting my practice…

623
00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:58.576
again.

624
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:02.538
Applying for residency? Why now?

625
00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:05.624
Seriously, stop making me laugh.

626
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.756
If you want to work,
go to work for a local clinic.

627
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:16.885
I have to have experience
to work at a clinic too.

628
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:20.097
I haven't practiced in 20 years,
so how can I suddenly treat patients?

629
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.517
It might be hard,
but going through my residency--

630
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:25.561
You'll be 50 by the time you finish.

631
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:28.314
The average life expectancy is longer now,
so that's still young.

632
00:43:28.397 --> 00:43:30.733
Who would welcome
an old and sick resident?

633
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.193
Don't be a nuisance and just drop it.

634
00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:35.195
If you keep being like this,

635
00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:38.449
I'm going to apply to your hospital
and your department.

636
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:40.909
I'm the chief of my department.
I won't pick you.

637
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.829
When we were in school,
my grades were much better than yours.

638
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:45.664
I took the lead after pre-med.

639
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:48.042
That's because I had a baby then!

640
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.628
If you had helped me out with the baby,

641
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:52.212
my grades wouldn't have dropped.

642
00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.840
If that's what you want to do,
then give it a shot.

643
00:43:54.923 --> 00:43:58.010
It's pretty obvious what your score
will be if you take the test now.

644
00:43:58.093 --> 00:44:00.512
Once you fail,
you'll finally get a reality check.

645
00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.058
If I pass, what will you do then?

646
00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:09.688
Just go to sleep.

647
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.286
Bonjour.

648
00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:28.957
This place makes proper French cuisine.

649
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.043
It's a Michelin two-star.

650
00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:33.170
It's hard to get a reservation here,

651
00:44:33.253 --> 00:44:36.340
but I asked a friend to pull some strings
so I could come here with you.

652
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:37.925
I see.

653
00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.343
There's no mother-in-law like me,
is there?

654
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.136
Yes.

655
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.431
A mother-in-law like you is rare.

656
00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:48.018
Eat up. I'm not sure
if it'll suit your palate though.

657
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:49.645
Okay.

658
00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:55.526
I'm sure you already heard it from In-ho,

659
00:44:56.276 --> 00:45:01.490
but I thought it would be better
to hear it from me directly and honestly.

660
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:07.788
In-ho wanted to add your name
to the house deed,

661
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.832
but I told him he can't.

662
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.292
Your father-in-law plugged away

663
00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.711
at his hospital to buy that house.

664
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:17.423
Though sons and daughters
are treated the same now,

665
00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.258
things are different
in a prestigious family like ours.

666
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:23.637
Assets should be passed down
from a son to their son.

667
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.557
In the end, all the family assets
will be passed down to Jung-min.

668
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.601
As his mother, there's no need
to touch your son's assets, right?

669
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.188
Don't take what I said to heart.

670
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:36.608
And don't give your husband
a hard time about this either, okay?

671
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.193
Okay.

672
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:47.828
You should use this car.

673
00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:50.497
I thought about getting you a new one,

674
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.541
but it's only been a year
since I bought it,

675
00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.585
so it's as good as new.

676
00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:01.049
It's okay, Mother.

677
00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:04.720
I understand what you're saying.

678
00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:06.847
All right.

679
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.224
You're a smart girl.

680
00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:17.983
Shall we have some wine?

681
00:46:18.692 --> 00:46:19.651
Okay.

682
00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:47.846
2022 RESIDENT EXAM PREP BOOK

683
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:31.765
Honey…

684
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.394
What?

685
00:47:40.607 --> 00:47:41.775
Jeez.

686
00:47:47.322 --> 00:47:48.282
Goodness.

687
00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:02.254
Wait. I'm getting off too. I'm sorry!

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:04.673

JUNG-MIN, YOUR RESIDENCY EXAM
SCORE IS OUT, RIGHT?

696
00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:42.020
HOW DID YOU DO?

697
00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:54.032
MY SON: I SCORED 45

698
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:59.496
THAT'S A GREAT SCORE AS AN INTERN
CONGRATULATIONS!

699
00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:20.934
It's a fresh, good look on you.

700
00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:23.895
Great.

701
00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:28.358
That's great. One more time.

RESIDENCY APPLICATION

00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:39.870
NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK

704
00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:44.040
DEPARTMENT

705
00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:47.252
Female, 36 years old.

706
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:51.006
We suspect she has multiple fractures in
her abdomen and pelvis from a car crash.

707
00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:53.383
She went into cardiac arrest,
so we've been performing CPR.

708
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:55.260
For how long? Is everything else okay?

709
00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:56.762
We've been performing it for ten minutes.

710
00:50:56.845 --> 00:50:58.513
Transfer her quickly.
Someone hold her bag valve mask

711
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.223
and someone keep performing CPR.

712
00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.559
What are you doing? Switch with him!

713
00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:04.019
Have you never performed CPR?

714
00:51:04.102 --> 00:51:05.687
-I'll do it!
-Let's go.

715
00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:09.399
DEPARTMENT: SURGERY

716
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.153
No.

718
00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:19.159
Hi, Ye-bin.

719
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:22.120
I have to take some blood samples.
There you go.

720
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:23.580
Doctor.

721
00:51:23.663 --> 00:51:24.790
Yes?

722
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:27.876
How long can I live?

723
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:36.760
Even the thought of it is heartbreaking.

724
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.767
I don't think I can treat sick kids.

725
00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:53.902
What should I do?

726
00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:58.073
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

727
00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:01.493
There are resident interviews today,
and I was looking through them

728
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:03.870
when I came across
a fascinating candidate.

729
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:05.747
She's older than me.

730
00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:07.290
She always got good grades.

731
00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:09.584
She scored high
on the medical licensing exam.

732
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.962
And she scored 49 on the resident exams.

733
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.674
I wonder why such a smart person
didn't practice for so long.

734
00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:18.593
What's the point? She'll be 50 soon.

735
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:20.679
How many applicants do we have this time?

736
00:52:20.762 --> 00:52:22.681
There are three spots and four applicants.

737
00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:25.642
Then it's decided. She's out.

738
00:52:25.725 --> 00:52:28.228
Dr. Choi, wasn't she a classmate
of yours in med school?

739
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.313
You seem like you're similar in age.

740
00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:34.568
Yes. But it's been so long
that my memory is kind of fuzzy.

741
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:38.655
But it says right here
that she received a liver transplant.

742
00:52:38.738 --> 00:52:41.241
What? Liver transplant.

743
00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:43.368
Goodness.

744
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:44.953
Then she's 200% out.

745
00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:53.003
-Hey.
-What's the deal with your wife?

746
00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:55.338
-What do you mean?
-She applied--

747
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:58.216
She applied to our hospital
in my department.

748
00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.384
Did you already know?

749
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.344
Really?

750
00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:04.472
One of the professors doing the interviews
showed me her application.

751
00:53:05.473 --> 00:53:06.725
She definitely applied.

752
00:53:06.808 --> 00:53:08.894
Cha Jeong-suk, Gusan University
School of Medicine, freshman in 1995.

753
00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:11.771
She scored 49 on the resident exams.

754
00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.524
Hello? Say something.

755
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:18.445
She scored 49?
That woman has completely lost her mind!

756
00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:22.282
Sorry. Hang up for a minute.

757
00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:36.755
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

758
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.221

-Damn it.

2022 RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

762
00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.883
I'll be there soon.

763
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:24.427
Okay, please just check for now.

764
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.358
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

765
00:54:46.324 --> 00:54:48.159
-Kim U-ju.
-Yes.

766
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.413
Mom?

767
00:55:03.425 --> 00:55:05.385
Mom.

768
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:08.638
You can't just come here.

769
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.141
It's fine.

770
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:12.642
INTERVIEW IDENTIFICATION TAG

771
00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.895
I'm here for an interview too.

772
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:19.149
-What?
-Let's talk later.

773
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:21.943
You've got this!

774
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:42.672
How is your health right now?

775
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.799
As I wrote in my application,

776
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:48.678
I received a liver transplant,
and I am healthy now.

777
00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:51.973
You may not have any difficulty
in your everyday life.

778
00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:55.435
However, the training process demands

779
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.979
a lot of mental
and physical energy, does it not?

780
00:55:58.063 --> 00:56:00.899
You must be taking
immunosuppressants right now too.

781
00:56:00.982 --> 00:56:03.985
-Yes.
-What if you get infected in the hospital?

782
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:06.237
Nothing's more important than your life.

783
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.948
That's enough.
She must know that the best.

784
00:56:09.574 --> 00:56:11.910
Also, you are not young.

785
00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:13.870
To be exact, you're a bit old.

786
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:16.331
I mean, you're very old.

787
00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:19.209
-Are you 45?
-I'm 46.

788
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:20.919
To be honest, given your age,

789
00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:24.297
it won't be easy to maintain
a good relationship with your colleagues.

790
00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.632
To be even more honest,

791
00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:29.010
you already know
that others will dislike you.

792
00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:51.074
Yes, hello?

793
00:56:51.157 --> 00:56:54.244
Yes, this is Cha Jeong-suk.

794
00:56:58.248 --> 00:56:59.165
Excuse me.

795
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:01.668
If you don't mind,

796
00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:06.381
could I know the reason I was rejected?

797
00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:09.884
Was it because of my age?

798
00:57:11.886 --> 00:57:13.680
Yes, okay.

799
00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:22.063
So what did they say?

800
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:24.524
They told me to look for other hospitals
before it's too late.

801
00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.568
Then you should apply
to a smaller hospital.

802
00:57:27.318 --> 00:57:29.696
You can just go somewhere else.
Why are you so down?

803
00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:33.658
Failure is always painful.

804
00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:38.079
-Welcome.
-Hello.

805
00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:39.789
What happened to your face?

806
00:57:41.749 --> 00:57:42.584
What about it?

807
00:57:43.209 --> 00:57:44.335
You don't look well.

808
00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:45.336
Really?

809
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.089
I feel fine.

810
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:49.257
Then that's a relief.

811
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:53.845
Right, why don't you go on a vacation?

812
00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.098
You're probably mentally
exhausted after the surgery.

813
00:57:57.182 --> 00:58:00.018
Don't you think it'd be good for you
to go somewhere nice?

814
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:35.011
She got rejected.

815
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:38.640
What a relief. Congratulations.

816
00:59:09.254 --> 00:59:12.590
Even though test methods have advanced,
you can't miss that point.

817
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:14.092
-Yes.
-Yes, okay.

818
00:59:14.175 --> 00:59:15.593
Yes, okay.

819

821
01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.144
We'll have to make her quit.

822
01:00:06.227 --> 01:00:08.521
Honey, can you drop me off?

823
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.606
No, I can't.
