﻿1
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.008
And then suddenly,

3
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:52.510
I had this thought.

4
00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:58.016
All of this isn't just your fault.

5
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.520
Your mother failed
to teach you right from wrong.

6
00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:08.443
And I was so permissive
in every single regard.

7
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.988
Our responsibility in this isn't any less.

8
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.407
Yes.

9
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.242
I've made my decision.

10
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.579
I think the time has come

11
00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:25.293
when it'll be okay if we're just
Jung-min and I-rang's parents.

12
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.963
As the father of my children,
I can let things slide.

13
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:30.465
But…

14
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.885
as my husband,

15
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:36.846
you no longer…

16
00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.516
hold any meaning to me.

17
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.853
I don't want to hate you anymore.

18
00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.731
I just don't feel the need
to hate you anymore.

19
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.025
It's already over…

20
00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.403
between the two of us.

21
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.032
Let's get a divorce.

22
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.725
Don't put on an act.

23
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:24.602
Get up.

24
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.646
Get up!

25
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.406
Honey.

26
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.116
Honey, open your eyes, okay?

27
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.993
What's with you?

28
00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.035
Wake up.

29
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.037
-Honey!
-What's wrong, In-ho?

30
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.165
-In-ho!
-Dad! What's wrong?

31
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.624
-Are you okay? In-ho!
-Wait.

32
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.251
-Hurry up and call 911.
-Okay.

33
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.919
In-ho.

34
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.379
What's wrong with him?

35
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.097
What on earth happened to him?

36
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.808
-Mother.
-What?

37
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.852
Please go get me a bucket of water.

38
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.271
Do we even have a bucket?

39
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.647
I'll get some water.

40
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.565
Okay.

41
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.525
In-ho.

42
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.486
What's wrong? Why is your nose bleeding?

43
00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:17.780
Here.

44
00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:19.782
Mom.

45
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.958
Looks as if he just opened his eyes.

46
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.418
In-ho!

47
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.671
Are you okay? Do you recognize me?

48
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.799
-Yes. The address here is…
-I-rang.

49
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.637
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.473
Yes, I think we're okay here.

51
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.602
Yes, thank you.

52
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.813
EPISODE 13

53
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.286
-Are you going to the hospital?
-I have to.

54
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.629
If you have something to say, say it.

55
00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.429
Please forgive me.

56
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.100
Think of all the years
we've been together.

57
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.768
We shouldn't end things like this.

58
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.230
I was ending things with Seung-hi too.

59
00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.232
It's almost done now.

60
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:38.236
I was going to spend the rest of my life
repenting for the things I've done to you.

61
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.198
You can't just end it like this.

62
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.324
I don't want…

63
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.661
to get a divorce.

64
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:47.996
Honey.

65
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.789
Your effort is admirable.

66
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.793
But this isn't something that can be
solved by you begging on your knees.

67
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.088
A divorce?

68
00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.674
How could you decide this on your own?

69
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.969
How could you not even bother
to discuss such a huge matter

70
00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.221
with me, the other party involved?

71
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.474
I've already made my decision.

72
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.393
I don't want to discuss it with you.

73
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:12.687
This is a notice.

74
00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.064
A divorce notice.

75
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.364
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.407
Divorce?

77
00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.452
-What do you mean, divorce?
-Mother, it's not that.

78
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.369
Yes, Mother.

79
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.540
I'm sorry to give you this news
today of all days.

80
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.167
But we've decided…

81
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.462
to go our separate ways.

82
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.425
Is that why you fainted?

83
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:45.803
Because you were shocked
when she said she wanted to divorce?

84
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.187
I would've died alongside your father

85
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.355
if I had known I'd have to witness this.

86
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.274
I can't live with this.

87
00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.277
I can't live like this!

88
00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.364
Divorce at this age?

89
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.949
Grandma, please get up.

90
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.367
Let go of me!

91
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.788
You both are on your mother's side.

92
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.540
Grandma, it's not like that.

93
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.709
We're only now
learning about the divorce too.

94
00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.087
-Grandma.
-Let go!

95
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.969
I'd understand if you two were young,
but you aren't.

96
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.681
If it were me,
I would find divorce too bothersome.

97
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.141
You two must be full of energy.

98
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.393
You're dating at your age.

99
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.355
What makes you think she wouldn't have
the energy for a divorce?

100
00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.150
In-ho.

101
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.861
Did you give Seung-hi child support?

102
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.405
Hurry up, give her the money,
and wrap things up.

103
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:50.618
Jeong-suk might change her mind
if she knows it's over between you two.

104
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.578
She wouldn't accept it anyway.

105
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.539
She would probably laugh at my face.

106
00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.540
I guess so.

107
00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:57.708
She's from a rich family.
She wouldn't accept such a petty sum.

108
00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:01.045
Her father probably
cherished his granddaughter.

109
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.381
It wasn't like that either.

110
00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.341
When she gave birth to Eun-seo,

111
00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:07.969
her father abandoned her,
so they lived like strangers.

112
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:12.140
She finally met him again
right before he passed away.

113
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.349
He passed away recently.

114
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.685
It must have been tough for her too.

115
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.647
Then what happened to all his assets?

116
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.898
Did she not inherit anything?

117
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.233
I don't know the details,

118
00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.943
but her father didn't leave a will,

119
00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.279
so she probably split it in half
with her brother.

120
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.823
Half? How much were all the assets worth?

121
00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.367
I'm not sure,

122
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:32.952
but…

123
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.371
wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

124
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:39.333
One hundred…

125
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.085
billion won?

126
00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.004
I know you were surprised.

127
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.507
But it probably wasn't something
totally unexpected.

128
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.010
You both are all grown up too.

129
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.597
So you probably thought
something like this could happen.

130
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.561
It might be too early to talk about this,

131
00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.814
but I want to hear your thoughts
on this situation.

132
00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.734
What kind of thoughts?

133
00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:09.071
Jung-min, you're a working adult,
so I'm not worried about you.

134
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.867
You can live in the hospital dorms
until you finish your residency.

135
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.868
Right?

136
00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.537
I-rang, what do you want to do?

137
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.375
If you want to live with me,
I can find us a place to live.

138
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.879
If you want to stay here,
then that's fine too.

139
00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:29.717
I guess things like that
need to be decided too.

140
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.721
It's not urgent,
so take your time to think about it.

141
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.389
Okay.

142
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:42.980
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.569
It would've been nice
if this didn't have to happen, right?

144
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.365
No. It's okay, Mom.

145
00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.259
Everything will work out.

146
00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.094
So don't worry.

147
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:14.971
Okay.

148
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:16.556
It's late.

149
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.307
Goodnight.

150
00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:09.025
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

151
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:51.776
Have a good day, sir.

152
00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:57.948
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE
BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT

153
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.826
JUNG-MIN'S DAD
IMAGE

154
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:07.458
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

155
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.336
HAVE SOME BREAKFAST BEFORE GOING TO WORK

156
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:17.885
Jeez.

157
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.643
Good morning.

158
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:26.936
Professor Seo.

159
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:31.315
About Yoo Ji-seon's guardian
wanting to sue Seo Jung-min.

160
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.150
They've decided not to sue.

161
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:38.114
It could have caused us some trouble
but it's a relief.

162
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:40.699
Yes?

163
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.202
-Goodbye, sir.
-Yes.

164
00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:48.207
It looks like Professor Roy
smoothed things out as an intermediary.

165
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.794
Judging by how he did all that
despite not being on good terms with you,

166
00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.797
he must be a really great guy.

167
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.714
I suppose.

168
00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.342
You two should have a drink
and get over your animosity.

169
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.470
And you should thank him
for what he did here.

170
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.848
You are both talented members
of our department.

171
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.474
It wouldn't do to stay enemies.

172
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.935
Right.

173
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.856
But have you made up
with Chief Lim of Family Medicine?

174
00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.568
You even punched each other
the other day in the ER.

175
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:25.119
Our relationship is more nuanced
and complicated than yours.

176
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.332
You used almost all the shampoo,
but the conditioner was new.

177
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:31.834
I'm a first-year.

178
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.961
It's hard to find time
even to use conditioner.

179
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:36.964
Thank you for this.

180
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.175
Right.

181
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.136
Are you having any luck
looking for your family?

182
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:44.513
I just was on my way
to the police station.

183
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:45.890
To register my DNA.

184
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:47.308
I see.

185
00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:48.517
Good luck.

186
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:51.812
Well…

187
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:53.731
Dr. Cha.

188
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.860
Ms. Yoo Ji-seon's mother

189
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.323
wanted me to relay a message to you.

190
00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:31.644
What brings you here, Doctor?

191
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:33.938
Today seemed to be
the last day of the funeral.

192
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.399
I wanted to say one last goodbye.

193
00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:41.403
My deepest apologies.

194
00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.874
From one parent to another,

195
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.335
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

196
00:13:57.878 --> 00:13:58.921
To tell you the truth…

197
00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:04.176
The resident who discharged her
came before too.

198
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.844
He left after crying on his knees.

199
00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.557
But doing that won't bring our child back.

200
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.519
I want to explain to you
why your daughter died.

201
00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:16.021
I don't want to hear it, so please leave.

202
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:21.110
Honey.

203
00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:22.278
Let's hear it.

204
00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:23.988
Honey.

205
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:24.905
Let's hear him out

206
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:27.283
just this once.

207
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.286
We're Ji-seon's parents.

208
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:32.288
We should know.

209
00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.081
I need to know…

210
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.626
before I'll be able to send her off.

211
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:51.724
She had a type of cancer
that was difficult to treat.

212
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:58.606
<c.bg_transparent><i>To tell you the truth,
I just needed someone to blame.</i></c.bg_transparent>

213
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:04.653
<c.bg_transparent><i>I think I even wanted to grab onto
the doctors who were trying to save her</i></c.bg_transparent>

214
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:09.658
<c.bg_transparent><i>so I could have someone
to blame for my daughter's death.</i></c.bg_transparent>

215
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.628
It's not your fault, Doctor.

216
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.880
I know that.

217
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:27.760
No.

218
00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:30.596
It's my fault too.

219
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.725
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.444
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.156
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.882
Thank you so much

223
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.678
for all your effort, Dr. Kim.

224
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.179
If you're grateful to me,

225
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.139
make me one promise.

226
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.351
A promise?

227
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:19.019
You missed your regular checkup.

228
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.563
Right.

229
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.898
You should hurry up

230
00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:24.525
and come to me.

231
00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.212
MY LOVE TO YOU

232
00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:46.213
Let's get married.

233
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:51.969
Yes!

234
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:55.973
I know

235
00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.058
I'm going to die.

236
00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.602
You know how sometimes

237
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.272
you just get this feeling?

238
00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:05.024
That's how I feel.

239
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.067
So…

240
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.820
I really want to save my baby.

241
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.909
If my mom and dad raise my baby,

242
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:21.248
they'll sometimes forget
that I'm no longer with them.

243
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:24.710
And sometimes…

244
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.173
there'll be days
when this baby will make them smile.

245
00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:32.426
My baby can find out who her father is

246
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.012
when she is a little older.

247
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.347
He's not someone
who will turn his back on her.

248
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.895
Still,

249
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.022
you should tell someone

250
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.149
who the baby's father is.

251
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.655
To tell you the truth,
I gave my dad a little hint.

252
00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:01.663
<c.bg_transparent><i>I promise to cherish you
for the rest of our lives.</i></c.bg_transparent>

253
00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:06.543
My darling wife.

254
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.137
This is a notice.

255
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.430
A divorce notice.

256
00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.018
Professor Seo?

257
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.604
Professor Seo?

258
00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.606
Are you all right?

259
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.608
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:31.902
Goodness, no reason to be sorry.

261
00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.197
Mr. Yang Gwi-ja?

262
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.074
Pardon?

263
00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:39.952
Professor Seo.

264
00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:43.038
That was the patient right before.

265
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.415
This patient is Mr. Park Myeong-u.

266
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:47.709
I'm sorry.
I confused you for someone else.

267
00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:51.463
Professor Seo, you must be very tired.

268
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:54.675
I'm okay.

269
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.024
-Professor Seo, are you okay?
-No, I'm not.

270
00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.819
You can't sit here like this.

271
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:17.948
Come this way.

272
00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.830
I really can't take this.

273
00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:26.582
Get it together.

274
00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:29.710
Why did you do something you'd regret?

275
00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:30.711
Jung-min.

276
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.297
Can you persuade your mother?

277
00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.507
She won't even listen to me.

278
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.261
I know it's shameless, but please?

279
00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.054
Put yourself in her shoes.

280
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:43.807
If Mom had a kid with another man,

281
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.642
would you be able to forgive her?

282
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.107
Are you okay?

283
00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.817
I'm not okay either.

284
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:56.153
I'm thinking about
what I should do going forward.

285
00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.864
Like what?

286
00:19:58.947 --> 00:19:59.907
Well…

287
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:01.742
I'll tell you once I've decided.

288
00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:05.662
Why?

289
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.122
What is it?

290
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.501
Is it a secret you can't tell me?
You can just tell me.

291
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.463
It's lunchtime.

292
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.632
You should eat.

293
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.560
Where should we sit?

294
00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:30.020
Over there.

295
00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:31.939
Chief Lim, please sit over here.

296
00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:41.865
Please have a seat.

297
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:48.538
Hey, the braised tofu is good today.

298
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:50.832
You like braised tofu.

299
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:52.459
What's with you?

300
00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:55.879
Why? Did Bong-suk say
she'd only date you if we made up?

301
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:59.299
No, I just saw the braised tofu
and was reminded of how you like it.

302
00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:00.717
What a load of crap.

303
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.177
You always try to run away

304
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.720
if anything bad happens.

305
00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:05.764
The same goes for this time too.

306
00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:06.807
Don't you agree?

307
00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.227
Yes, I was disappointed by
how the Surgery Department responded.

308
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.854
The same goes for the donation last time.

309
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.899
That was all thanks to
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk from my department.

310
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.651
Your department didn't do anything.

311
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:19.528
But you scooped up
two robotic surgical systems

312
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.904
that are 5 billion won each.

313
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.116
What do you mean by "scooped up"?

314
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.660
-We just accepted the offer.
-That's the same thing.

315
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.955
How shameless,
without even a trace of conscience.

316
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.249
Take them then!

317
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.376
I've had enough of this pettiness.

318
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.628
Do you even know how to use the robots?

319
00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:38.213
What?

320
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.924
Are you slandering every professor
of Family Medicine in the country?

321
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:43.135
All you know how to do is surgery!

322
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.345
-I know a lot of things!
-Tell me!

323
00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.889
We perform enemas, take out excrement,
and realign bones!

324
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.267
We make weird faces like yours
look presentable!

325
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.102
-What?
-Do you want to be slapped with tofu?

326
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.020
Try it!

327
00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:55.147
I'm going
to smash your face into the tofu!

328
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.606
We have things to talk about.

329
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.066
-Did you spit at me?
-That's right.

330
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.910
I'm sorry about the incident with my son.

331
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:10.954
I have no excuses to give.

332
00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.748
You were trying to protect your son.

333
00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.083
I could understand.

334
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.669
But I want you to remember one thing.

335
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.796
Eun-seo…

336
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.882
is your child too.

337
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:25.927
If something ever happens to Eun-seo,
be on her side no matter what.

338
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.345
Just like you were with Jung-min.

339
00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:28.972
Sure.

340
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:30.474
I will.

341
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:32.142
Then it's fine.

342
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.061
Let's pretend this didn't happen.

343
00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.063
Really?

344
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.939
Are you forgiving me?

345
00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:42.277
-Yes.
-Even when I was like that to you?

346
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.945
You're really okay with it?

347
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.989
Do I look like I'm okay?

348
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.283
Though I forgive you,

349
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:50.160
you should be taught a lesson,

350
00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:51.661
don't you think?

351
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.832
I heard Professor Roy Kim
helped with this incident.

352
00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.501
That's what they say.

353
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.003
What did your wife say?

354
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.130
There's no way she just forgave you.

355
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.050
She wants a divorce.

356
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:07.886
And?

357
00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.471
She probably said it out of anger.

358
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.474
I'll try my best to make her feel better.

359
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.394
Fine.

360
00:23:17.187 --> 00:23:18.313
Do everything you can.

361
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.273
That way, you won't regret it.

362
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:22.234
What do you expect me to do then?

363
00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.403
I told you I'll be the one to end things.

364
00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:27.155
Try to persuade your wife.

365
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.865
I'll wait for you.

366
00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:31.034
After all, I've waited for you
this whole time.

367
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:35.539
Use this opportunity
to play the role of a good husband.

368
00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:37.833
You should do what all the others do.

369
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:15.245
ROY KIM

370
00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.796
I heard that the Yoo Ji-seon incident
was resolved thanks to you.

371
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.923
-Thank you.
-Well,

372
00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:29.384
I didn't do it to receive your thanks.

373
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.013
Then who did you do it for?

374
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:36.975
It wasn't for anyone.

375
00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:39.394
I just did my duty as a doctor.

376
00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:42.981
I think righting a wrong
is the proper thing to do.

377
00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:47.235
And there shouldn't be anyone
who feels wronged by this situation.

378
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.448
Professor Kim, it seems
you're not very honest either.

379
00:24:57.537 --> 00:24:58.371
Seo Jung-min.

380
00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:03.168
-Hello, Chief Yoon.
-You punk.

381
00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:06.171
Why do you look so down
when everything has been resolved?

382
00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:08.506
It's okay.

383
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.218
You need experiences like this one
to become a real doctor.

384
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:12.302
Don't you think?

385
00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:13.220
That's right.

386
00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:16.389
Dr. Seo, don't be too discouraged.

387
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:18.642
Just think of it as a learning experience.

388
00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:20.435
Cheer up.

389
00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:26.316
A learning experience?

390
00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.907
Hey, Seo Jung-min.

391
00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:36.660
I heard the patient's guardian
isn't taking you to court.

392
00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:37.994
What a huge relief.

393
00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:39.746
A relief?

394
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:43.541
-Why is it a relief?
-Why are you being so sensitive?

395
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.585
I'm just saying
since it was resolved well--

396
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:47.587
Hey, don't say it like that.

397
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:48.922
Resolved?

398
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:50.674
A relief?

399
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:05.146
You can do exactly as written here.

400
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.231
Yes, Doctor.

401
00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.113
That's an expression
I don't see every day.

402
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.073
You seem very angry.

403
00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:17.492
Everyone seems carefree except for me.

404
00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:19.244
What does that mean?

405
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:21.371
They try to comfort me
by telling me it's okay.

406
00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:24.833
But I feel like I'm about to go crazy
hearing everyone say that.

407
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.168
How is any of this okay?

408
00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.628
Is it okay just because they're unscathed?

409
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:29.587
And…

410
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.798
should it even be okay?

411
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:34.718
I definitely shouldn't be feeling okay.

412
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:36.136
This is why I like you.

413
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.266
You don't try to justify things
in a petty way or wallow in self-pity.

414
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.685
You're good at putting yourself
in others' shoes.

415
00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:44.894
What?

416
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.274
Follow me.

417
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:06.875
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

418
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.424
<c.bg_transparent><i>The sky is especially pretty today.
It suddenly made me think of you.</i></c.bg_transparent>

419
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:16.843
He's unbelievable.

420
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.259
Are they filming an adult movie or what?

421
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.136
My goodness.

422
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.221
Kids these days.

423
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.806
Jeez.

424
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.943
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

425
00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.736
WOMEN'S AND JUVENILE AFFAIRS DIVISION

426
00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.035
Hello.

427
00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:26.204
What can I help you with?

428
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.264
Were there cases where biological parents
have been found this way?

429
00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:47.016
The probability of international adoptees
finding their biological parents

430
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.351
is quite low, to be honest.

431
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.353
About 1%?

432
00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.189
If the parents register their DNA,

433
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.150
then a match can be made quickly.

434
00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.736
But that isn't the case a lot of the time.

435
00:28:58.778 --> 00:28:59.612
I see.

436
00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:02.198
But there's been
a lot of publicity about this lately.

437
00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:05.660
There are parents who register their DNA
to look for their children.

438
00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:08.329
You see it on the news sometimes.

439
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:15.920
I broke my collarbone
and had to be admitted to the hospital.

440
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.798
But even in this situation,
I missed you all so much

441
00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.383
that I decided to do this live.

442
00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:23.470
I look pretty even in hospital clothes?

443
00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:25.346
Thank you.

444
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.056
Right. Everyone, give me a second.

445
00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:33.396
-Doctor!
-Hello.

446
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:36.900
Doctor, say hello.

447
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.944
You shouldn't be moving like this.

448
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.988
Doctor, please say hello to my followers.

449
00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:44.282
LOVE YOU NA-RA!
YOU'RE SO CUTE

450
00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:45.325
HELLO
HI FROM MALAYSIA

451
00:29:45.408 --> 00:29:47.452
How many followers do you have?

452
00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:51.498
Out of 500,000,
about 2,000 are here right now.

453
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:52.540
Two thousand?

454
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.084
My doctor needs to get ready too.

455
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.795
Put this on, Doctor.

456
00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:58.922
Hurry.

457
00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.298
-This?
-Yes.

458
00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:01.216
Like this.

459
00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.180
-Like this.
-Okay.

460
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.307
-Is that enough?
-Yes.

461
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.143
-Let's take a look now, shall we?
-Okay, bye.

462
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.273
I'm Cha Jeong-suk. Bye, everyone.

463
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:21.694
Everyone, isn't my doctor beautiful?
Her skin is so moist and amazing.

464
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.613
-Doctor, it's amazing.
-Thank you.

465
00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:26.199
I'm sorry, but you shouldn't
be moving about.

466
00:30:26.282 --> 00:30:27.826
Please lie down so you can get treated.

467
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.202
Menopause?

468
00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:33.331
I came here because I couldn't perform
at night with my wife,

469
00:30:33.414 --> 00:30:35.083
so what do you mean by menopause?

470
00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.418
Doesn't that only happen to women?

471
00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.419
No.

472
00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:42.340
When testosterone,
the male hormone, decreases,

473
00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:44.801
you can experience similar symptoms
to female menopause,

474
00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:48.346
including the symptom
that you're currently experiencing.

475
00:30:48.429 --> 00:30:51.099
Simply put, it's male menopause.

476
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:54.561
We need to check if you're suffering from
a lack of hormones,

477
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:55.812
so we'll do a blood test.

478
00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:58.606
This is quite embarrassing and strange.

479
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.359
Gosh, there's no need to feel that way.

480
00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:05.405
Even my husband has been losing his hair
and getting a frozen shoulder.

481
00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:07.657
And his mood keeps swinging
back and forth.

482
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:12.537
I don't know how he's doing in bed though.

483
00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.042
Sorry, I was thinking of something else.

484
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:18.960
No.

485
00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:22.463
It's comforting to know that your husband
is going through similar things.

486
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.464
Right?

487
00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:25.508
It's the same for everyone.

488
00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.760
-I'll just do a blood test.
-Okay.

489
00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:31.806
The cops found him passed out
on the street.

490
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:34.809
He smells of alcohol,
and his hygiene isn't good either.

491
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.270
His blood sugar is at 650,
and his abdomen is filled with fluid.

492
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:40.398
He seems to be addicted to alcohol
with liver cirrhosis and diabetes

493
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:42.525
that wasn't regulated,
which caused diabetic ketoacidosis.

494
00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:46.529
Can he be admitted if we request
a consultation with Family Medicine?

495
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:48.406
Wouldn't it be better
to consult Gastroenterology

496
00:31:48.489 --> 00:31:50.450
or Endocrinology,
instead of Family Medicine?

497
00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.579
The professors and residents
are on vacation,

498
00:31:54.662 --> 00:31:56.289
so they can't accept more patients.

499
00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:57.749
They asked me to consult
another department.

500
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.628
Okay, put in the consultation request.
I'll notify the professor.

501
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:02.712
Okay.

502
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.673
We'll also need to consult
with social services, right?

503
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:06.841
You're amazing.

504
00:32:07.675 --> 00:32:08.676
Thank you.

505
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.719
It's nothing.

506
00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:13.097
Sir, are you awake?

507
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:14.098
Where am I?

508
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:15.266
This is the hospital.

509
00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:17.602
Where does it hurt the most?

510
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:34.786
You only work for two days a week.
Is it still too hard on you?

511
00:32:35.703 --> 00:32:39.165
You're so popular among the elderly.

512
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:40.625
It's too bad.

513
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.544
I would continue if I could.

514
00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:47.465
But I'm not well right now,
so what can I do?

515
00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:49.592
You were doing so well
earning extra money.

516
00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:51.719
If you quit now, it'll be a waste.

517
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.806
I get a small amount from my pension,

518
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:57.767
and my daughter started working,
so she sends me money too.

519
00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:04.190
Then you can enroll in health insurance
under your daughter's name.

520
00:33:04.691 --> 00:33:05.775
That's true!

521
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.828
Hey, Mom.

522
00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.751
That lady is obsessed
with working these days.

523
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.254
Why is she working so hard
and being overly friendly?

524
00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:27.922
She's making us look bad.

525
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.508
I know, did something good happen
to her recently?

526
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.594
But still, I'm worried
she's pushing herself too hard.

527
00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:36.597
Hey, I was calling to tell you

528
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:41.811
that I'm going to quit
working as a care worker.

529
00:33:41.894 --> 00:33:43.021
Really?

530
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:45.231
That's great!

531
00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:46.941
Jeez.

532
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.570
You would throw a fit
when I told you to quit.

533
00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.072
What changed your mind?

534
00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:56.909
Mom,

535
00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:58.870
are you sick?

536
00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:02.457
No, I just want to take up some hobbies.

537
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:07.045
<c.bg_transparent><i>I want to learn how to draw
and how to play the harmonica too.</i></c.bg_transparent>

538
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.505
I don't think that's the reason.

539
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:12.717
Jeez, it's fine. There's no need to nag.

540
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.344
Since you have a job,

541
00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:18.806
I can get health insurance
under your name, right?

542
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:19.807
I forgot!

543
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:21.225
That's right.

544
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.019
Why didn't I think of that?

545
00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:26.022
That's great.
That takes care of one of my worries.

546
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:27.648
Mom.

547
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.358
Is your shoulder still not better?

548
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.277
Is it really bad?

549
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.029
It's because I'm old.

550
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:38.284
Someone told me to try acupressure,
so I'm on my way to do that.

551
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.245
<c.bg_transparent><i>It'll get better eventually
if I try different things.</i></c.bg_transparent>

552
00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.960
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

553
00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:54.592
WIFE: CHA JEONG-SUK

554
00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:01.724
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

555
00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:14.904
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

556
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.240
What is he trying to do?

557
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.868
I BOUGHT SOME SALT BUTTER ROLLS
AFTER SEEING THEM MADE ME THINK OF YOU

558
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:26.249
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE THE SALT OF MY LIFE…

559
00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:51.023
This isn't going to be solved
with baked goods.

560
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.109
It's too weak.

561
00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:06.122
Goodness.

562
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.083
Goodness.

563
00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:19.260
Mom.

564
00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:22.346
Did she go somewhere?

565
00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:24.098
Mom.

566
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.269
Mom, are you sleeping?

567
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.188
Goodness.

568
00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:33.149
Mom.

569
00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:34.275
Mom, are you in pain?

570
00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:35.359
What's wrong?

571
00:36:36.068 --> 00:36:38.112
Jeez, I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.

572
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.657
What do you mean? You can't even move.

573
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:43.492
Let's go to the hospital.

574
00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.412
I had acupressure in the afternoon,

575
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:49.457
and I think it was too strong.

576
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.084
I took a pain reliever,
so I'll get better.

577
00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:56.964
Every hospital says something different.

578
00:36:57.465 --> 00:37:00.676
A shot to relax the muscles.
A steroid shot.

579
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.054
I've gotten every shot there is.

580
00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:07.391
I've received acupuncture and acupressure.
I did everything I could.

581
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:09.602
None of them helped.

582
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.190
Taking pain relievers
is what makes things bearable.

583
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.401
If I feel better, I stop taking them.

584
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:19.612
But the pain comes back and I can't sleep.

585
00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:24.367
You've lost a lot of weight too.

586
00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:28.579
I have no appetite since I can't sleep.

587
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.539
So I just naturally lost weight.

588
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.627
I've been all over the place.

589
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:36.796
I didn't even know you were sick.

590
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.633
You should have told me!

591
00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:44.428
It's because I knew you'd worry.
You're busy enough as is.

592
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:48.599
But…

593
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:51.727
why did you come without telling me?

594
00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:53.479
Is something wrong?

595
00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.900
There's nothing wrong. I just came.

596
00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.402
Just came, my foot.

597
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.906
I also thought it was strange last time
when you just showed up late at night.

598
00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:06.450
Is there really nothing wrong?

599
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.995
What could be wrong?

600
00:38:09.578 --> 00:38:11.163
Just focus on getting better.

601
00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.623
Come to my hospital tomorrow.

602
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.125
Don't you dare say you won't.

603
00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:21.507
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

604
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:25.052
You do have a supraspinatus
partial thickness tear.

605
00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:27.847
But it's not bad enough
to require surgery.

606
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.807
It might get better with an injection.

607
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.726
You say you're aching all over,

608
00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.769
but it's not like
we can check your whole body.

609
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:36.314
I looked at your joints
through the ultrasound,

610
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:37.690
and nothing was wrong.

611
00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:39.650
Your BDI is around 30.

612
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:43.237
Based on your screening, you're severely
depressed due to chronic pain.

613
00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:00.755
Mom.

614
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:02.840
What are you doing?

615
00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.051
I'm just sitting here.

616
00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.636
I'm living a life of luxury thanks to you.

617
00:39:08.554 --> 00:39:11.474
How's being in a hospital a luxury?

618
00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:14.727
Still, I can be in a private room
like this because of you.

619
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:20.066
I think the nurses are nicer to me
because I'm your mother

620
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.776
and In-ho's mother-in-law.

621
00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:23.444
That's not it.

622
00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.738
The nurses in my department
are always friendly.

623
00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:31.327
Mother!

624
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.163
In-ho, what brings you all the way here?

625
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:37.666
My mother-in-law has been admitted.
Of course I should come.

626
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.839
Mother. Gosh, my hands are cold.

627
00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:48.677
Mother, please don't worry
about anything anymore.

628
00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:53.099
I'll call all my fellow professors
so you'll get better in no time.

629
00:39:53.682 --> 00:39:54.725
Okay.

630
00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:56.018
Sure, thank you.

631
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.694
My mother-in-law
was admitted to the hospital.

632
00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:06.987
Please.

633
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:08.989
Look into it and call me back.

634
00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:10.741
Thanks.

635
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.956
I'm friends with Professor Yang U-seok
of the Pain Medicine Department.

636
00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:17.915
He's very talented.

637
00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:20.543
He'll call back right away, so let's wait.

638
00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:21.460
Sure.

639
00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:23.504
Thanks.

640
00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:25.423
There's no need.

641
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.177
You didn't tell

642
00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:32.471
your mother anything, right?

643
00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:33.848
Tell her what?

644
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.933
That we're getting divorced?

645
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:37.518
Watch what you say.

646
00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:43.732
You acted like the world would end
if anyone found out we were married.

647
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.777
So why did you suddenly want to speak
where everyone can see us?

648
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:49.113
I mean, aren't we getting divorced?

649
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:52.116
To be exact, we're not getting divorced.

650
00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:54.410
You just suggested it,
but I never accepted it.

651
00:40:54.493 --> 00:40:55.953
Whatever.

652
00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:58.330
Don't let my mom know
what's going on between us for now.

653
00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.582
Of course.

654
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:00.833
I'll…

655
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:03.794
I'll be good to your mother too, honey.

656
00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:05.796
Don't fool yourself.

657
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.715
I'm not saying I won't get a divorce.

658
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.467
I'm just holding off on it for now.

659
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.677
Fine. I get it.

660
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:13.929
But…

661
00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:15.473
didn't you get anything?

662
00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:18.184
I sent something to your department's

663
00:41:19.101 --> 00:41:19.935
medical office.

664
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.145
What?

665
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:22.354
What is it now?

666
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:23.606
More bread?

667
00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.318
Something even better.

668
00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:04.772
APPLICATION FOR OWNERSHIP TRANSFER (GIFT)

669
00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:21.956
<c.bg_transparent><i>Jeong-suk, you asked to jointly own
the house before,</i></c.bg_transparent>

670
00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.500
and I'm sorry I didn't agree to it.

671
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:27.836
<c.bg_transparent><i>It may be late,
but I'll make things right.</i></c.bg_transparent>

672
00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:30.256
We'll have to pay more taxes

673
00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.299
<c.bg_transparent><i>since we've been
married for over ten years,</i></c.bg_transparent>

674
00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:35.344
but for you, I can bear that much.

675
00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:41.183
PS, just prepare your seal and ID.

676
00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.286
I don't want this.

677
00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:01.662
You'll be taxed heavily.

678
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.163
Save your money.

679
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.792
Are you really going to keep this up?

680
00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:09.962
-Are you really disregarding my sincerity?
-Mr. Seo In-ho.

681
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:12.172
It's already too late.

682
00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:26.687
I need to borrow some money.

683
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.775
Then what happened to all his assets?

684
00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:32.985
Did she not inherit anything?

685
00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:34.320
I don't know the details,

686
00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:36.071
but her father didn't leave a will,

687
00:43:36.155 --> 00:43:38.282
so she probably split it in half
with her brother.

688
00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:40.909
Half? How much were all the assets worth?

689
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.245
I'm not sure,

690
00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:44.288
but…

691
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.707
wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

692
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.209
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

693
00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:51.879
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

694
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:53.297
One hundred billion…

695
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.259
I'll be punished for this.

696
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:59.553
I can't toss my daughter-in-law out

697
00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:01.472
just to get more money.

698
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:05.184
Just the sound of 100 billion won.

699
00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:06.852
Gosh, my mind is all out of sorts.

700
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.858
Hello?

701
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:14.193
Why are you calling me at this hour?

702
00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:15.235
Mother,

703
00:44:15.944 --> 00:44:18.405
do you know my mother-in-law
was admitted to our hospital?

704
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:19.990
Ms. Oh?

705
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:26.580
You know how you crave something sweet
when you're in a bad mood, right?

706
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:30.000
So I bought every kind so
you can do that for every occasion.

707
00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:31.168
I see.

708
00:44:31.251 --> 00:44:33.212
They're too pretty to eat.

709
00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:35.214
Thank you for this.

710
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.216
You look unwell.

711
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.468
Have they still not found the cause?

712
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:43.889
Since I'm at a big hospital,
I consider myself half-fixed already.

713
00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:45.599
Gosh, of course.

714
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:48.936
My son is making every effort he can.

715
00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:52.398
He was so worried about you
after hearing you were admitted.

716
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:56.693
He may not express it,
but he has a deep heart.

717
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:58.153
You know this too, right?

718
00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:00.948
Yes.

719
00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:07.788
What did I do to deserve this?

720
00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.707
This is upsetting.

721
00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:12.501
Oh, my.

722
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.088
Look how good he looks.

723
00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:19.967
Gosh, that's my son.

724
00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.183
What in the world?

725
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:29.977
Look who it is.

726
00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:33.021
Hello.

727
00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:34.440
Do you know her?

728
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:36.900
Yes.

729
00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:38.193
You should head up first, Chief Lim.

730
00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:39.611
-Okay.
-Hello.

731
00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:41.530
Goodbye.

732
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.326
Goodness, I didn't expect to run into you

733
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.495
since this is such a big hospital.

734
00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:50.998
What brings you here?

735
00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:52.875
My in…

736
00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:56.503
Someone I know was admitted.

737
00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:58.964
Have you been well?

738
00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:02.301
I felt terrible after what happened
the last time we met.

739
00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:04.928
I see.

740
00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.681
Then please get home safely.

741
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.516
Yes.

742
00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.063
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

743
00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.608
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

744
00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:19.193
One hundred billion--

745
00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.360
-Grandma.
-Hey.

746
00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:22.821
What are you looking at?

747
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.032
Nothing.

748
00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:27.117
What brings you here?

749
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.286
I heard Grandma
was admitted to the hospital.

750
00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:31.538
Are you here to see her too?

751
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.582
Yes, I already visited her.

752
00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:35.876
Go and comfort
your grandmother well, okay?

753
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:36.793
Okay.

754
00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:40.130
-Then I'll see you at home later.
-Okay.

755
00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:44.468
They're so nice
to their maternal grandmother.

756
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.137
Gosh, it's all pointless.

757
00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:53.810
In-ho.

758
00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:56.146
Yes, I'm at the hospital right now.

759
00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:57.773
Do you have a minute?

760
00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:00.067
A PATIENT'S EARNESTNESS CAN OVERCOME LUCK…

761
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.903
She looked so pretty,
sophisticated, and intelligent.

762
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.655
What a shame.

763
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:08.325
I know you met her by chance,
but why did you act like you knew her?

764
00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:10.160
I wanted a taste of what I couldn't have.

765
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:15.707
You didn't upset my mother-in-law
and then leave, right?

766
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.419
I even bought expensive cookies
from the department store for her.

767
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:21.922
You did well.
Please keep up the good work.

768
00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.382
Hey, worry about yourself.

769
00:47:23.882 --> 00:47:27.261
When was the last time
you bought her a meal?

770
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:31.974
Have dinner with her tonight.

771
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:33.642
Tonight?

772
00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:35.727
Yes, I'll make the reservation.

773
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:37.854
And give her a lot of spending money too!

774
00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:41.316
Jeong-suk will see right through this.

775
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.526
Is that…

776
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:44.570
Is that the issue right now?

777
00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:47.406
You're about to lose your wife
and 100 billion won.

778
00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.159
-Father.
-Jung-min.

779
00:47:51.243 --> 00:47:52.411
Did you come to see me?

780
00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.497
Grandma, that's not it.

781
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.916
Father, did you hear?

782
00:47:58.792 --> 00:47:59.918
Why? Is something wrong?

783
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:02.170
The professor in charge of Grandma.

784
00:48:02.254 --> 00:48:03.380
-Yes.
-It's…

785
00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:04.298
It's?

786
00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:06.967
Professor Choi Seung-hi.

787
00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.439
Dr. Cha, you're here.

788
00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:21.815
You must have been so worried.

789
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:26.570
You can rest easy now that Professor Choi
will be taking care of your mother.

790
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:28.780
The chief here says

791
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:32.743
that it'd be good
if I came to Family Medicine.

792
00:48:33.493 --> 00:48:37.331
He even connected me to a talented
and excellent professor here.

793
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.251
It seems we met again.

794
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:43.253
Please take good care of my daughter.

795
00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:46.298
There's no need for that.
She's already doing well.

796
00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:51.553
You two must be busy.

797
00:48:51.637 --> 00:48:52.888
You should head back to work.

798
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.184
Then please don't worry too much now.

799
00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.102
-I hope your treatment goes well.
-Thank you.

800
00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:00.771
I'll come again, ma'am.

801
00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:02.397
Yes, thank you.

802
00:49:14.701 --> 00:49:16.370
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

803
00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:23.919
I know that doctor.

804
00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:28.006
I met with her for my checkup last time.

805
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.802
I ran into her when I came
to this hospital's Orthopedics Department.

806
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:35.972
She seems so nice and kind.

807
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:39.976
It'd be nice if you were to become
a professor like that.

808
00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:44.815
It's such a relief that you have
a good teacher around you like her.

809
00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:47.442
Your life changes

810
00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:52.114
depending on the people you meet.

811
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.075
Of course.

812
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:56.785
It changes your life.

813
00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:00.330
Completely.

814
00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:06.044
Mom.

815
00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:08.839
There are many other
great professors besides her.

816
00:50:10.382 --> 00:50:13.176
How about changing your doctor
to the chief of my department?

817
00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:16.888
Why change the doctor in charge of me
out of the blue?

818
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:21.727
Why? Is there an issue with her?

819
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.061
No.

820
00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.522
It's not that.

821
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.237
That professor…

822
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:38.076
was In-ho's girlfriend in college.

823
00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.204
What?

824
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:51.298
Why isn't she picking up?

825
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:57.053
Though I forgive you,

826
00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.680
you should be taught a lesson,

827
00:50:58.764 --> 00:50:59.639
don't you think?

828
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.527
My goodness.

829
00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:18.784
Stop laughing, Mom.

830
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:22.537
Jeez, you're so adorable.

831
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:25.373
That all happened ages ago.

832
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:27.459
That's not it.

833
00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.586
Do you like In-ho that much?

834
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.172
To be jealous of something like that?

835
00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.800
Goodness, you have no pride.

836
00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:38.136
Gosh.

837
00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:41.973
CHOI SEUNG-HI

838
00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:47.687
Assign a different doctor for my mom
no matter what.

839
00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:49.815
Why should I do that?

840
00:51:51.399 --> 00:51:54.361
Did you accept my mother
as your patient on purpose?

841
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:57.072
Think of it what you will.

842
00:51:57.155 --> 00:52:00.742
Are you going to expose your relationship
with In-ho to my mother?

843
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:03.662
Is that why you're holding her hostage?

844
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:08.375
Isn't that up to you?

845
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.671
I don't care what you think.

846
00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.339
I'm going my own way.

847
00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:17.676
So don't overstep your place, got it?

848
00:52:33.608 --> 00:52:36.862
-Please take care of Jeong-suk.
-Okay, don't worry.

849
00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:37.946
Mom.

850
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:41.992
-Professor Kim.
-You came right on time.

851
00:52:42.075 --> 00:52:43.618
What in the world?

852
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:47.622
Why didn't you tell me
your doctor was working here as well?

853
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.457
I know, right?

854
00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.167
Why didn't I?

855
00:52:52.627 --> 00:52:54.045
It always bothered me

856
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:58.383
that I didn't get a chance
to thank him before you got discharged.

857
00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:02.470
It's great that we met again.

858
00:53:03.054 --> 00:53:05.390
Thank you so much, Professor.

859
00:53:05.473 --> 00:53:06.850
Not at all.

860
00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:08.768
I wish you a swift recovery, ma'am.

861
00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:10.562
Thank you.

862
00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:19.988
Mother!

863
00:53:25.243 --> 00:53:27.537
Mother, why are you all the way out here?

864
00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:30.290
-Did you come out for exercise?
-Well,

865
00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.583
I felt a bit stuffy.

866
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.004
I was just about to come to visit you
in your hospital room.

867
00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:38.298
I wanted to ask you to dinner.

868
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:41.635
I made a reservation
at a great beef short ribs restaurant.

869
00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.803
That sounds good and all,

870
00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.765
but I'm worried I'll be
taking up too much of your time.

871
00:53:46.848 --> 00:53:48.808
Not at all, Mother.

872
00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:53.438
Let's all eat together with my mother,
Jung-min, and I-rang later.

873
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:56.232
The beef at that restaurant is so good.

874
00:53:59.527 --> 00:54:00.528
You're free too, right?

875
00:54:03.114 --> 00:54:03.949
I am.

876
00:54:06.618 --> 00:54:08.203
Gosh, Professor Kim.

877
00:54:08.828 --> 00:54:09.829
You should be on your way.

878
00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:12.082
I should.

879
00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:13.959
Then I'll get going now.

880
00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:17.837
Ma'am, if anything is bothering you,
please call me whenever.

881
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:21.424
Thank you for saying that, Professor Kim.

882
00:54:32.894 --> 00:54:35.981
-What kind of exercise did you do?
-I just walked.

883
00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:53.665
Why did it burn so much?

884
00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:55.750
I cooked it exactly according to the time.

885
00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:56.960
That's why I said I'll--

886
00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:58.920
I can grill it well too.

887
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:01.297
Mother, I shall cook the meat
for you today.

888
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.217
It's fine. It doesn't matter who cooks it.

889
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.178
What's important is that
we're here as a family.

890
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:09.723
-Excuse me.
-Grandma, I'll grill it.

891
00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.808
-Let me take it, Father.
-Sure.

892
00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:12.726
And the scissors.

893
00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:17.272
Ms. Oh, eat up.

894
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:19.024
The food here is famous.

895
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:23.945
Mother.

896
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.490
I have been so inattentive
this whole time.

897
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:29.492
I always used being busy as an excuse.

898
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:33.121
That's why I wasn't able
to catch on until you were this sick.

899
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:35.790
I have no excuses to give.

900
00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.209
Please enjoy this meal.

901
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:41.004
I promise to be
a better son-in-law from now on.

902
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:46.426
Thank you for saying that.

903
00:55:47.093 --> 00:55:52.057
All I want is for you and Jeong-suk
to live a happy life together.

904
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.892
Yes, we will do that.

905
00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.898
That is why I prepared something special

906
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:02.150
for you today, Mother.

907
00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:15.080
What is that?

908
00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:24.214
CASH CONVEYS FILIAL PIETY BEST
IT MAKES RAISING KIDS WORTHWHILE

909
00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.049
What is that?

910
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:33.348
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my.

911
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:35.433
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

912
00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.520
-Goodness.
-Oh my!

913
00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:41.064
-There's meat here.
-Oh, my!

914
00:56:41.147 --> 00:56:42.398
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

915
00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:45.902
Oh, my!

916
00:56:45.985 --> 00:56:47.153
My goodness!

917
00:56:47.862 --> 00:56:48.863
What in the world?

918
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.741
-Goodness.
-Hey!

919
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:53.660
-The meat is burning!
-Watch the money.

920
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.591
What is this?

921
00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.845
Father, how could you shoot money
like that here?

922
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:17.100
I just wanted Mother to enjoy it.

923
00:57:17.183 --> 00:57:20.103
You should've done it at home.
This is a public place.

924
00:57:20.186 --> 00:57:21.438
It's okay, Ms. Kwak.

925
00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:22.939
In-ho.

926
00:57:23.022 --> 00:57:24.607
I'm touched by this.

927
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:26.985
I've never been
showered with money before.

928
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:28.027
Thank you so much.

929
00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:31.573
I'm so relieved you liked it.

930
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.367
But let's quickly pick up the money first.

931
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:36.327
Yes, I'll pick them up.

932
00:57:37.328 --> 00:57:38.955
-Take all this too.
-Okay.

933
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.128
It's going to take ages
to get all of them.

934
00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:52.469
It's so good.

935
00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:56.931
Here.

936
00:57:57.015 --> 00:57:58.516
-Please enjoy.
-Okay.

937
00:58:02.854 --> 00:58:03.938
It's delicious.

938
00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:05.273
-Right?
-Eat up.

939
00:58:09.527 --> 00:58:10.361
Professor.

940
00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:14.782
Ms. Kwak.

941
00:58:15.366 --> 00:58:16.784
What are you doing here?

942
00:58:16.868 --> 00:58:19.704
Didn't you say you were going to Geoje
to visit your hometown?

943
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:25.043
And who is this?

944
00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.051
I feel like I'm getting a déjà vu.

945
00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:35.595
It's another situation

946
00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:38.723
where everyone knows the secret
except for one person.

947
00:58:39.807 --> 00:58:42.936
I know, it was like this
at Mom's birthday dinner too.

948
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.812
I have a bad feeling about this.

949
00:58:50.235 --> 00:58:52.612
-Let go!
-I'm glad I met you!

950
00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:54.239
Hey, you tramp!

951
00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:57.325
How dare you try to seduce my man?

952
00:58:57.408 --> 00:58:58.243
-Mother!
-No!

953
00:58:58.326 --> 00:59:00.078
-There must have been a misunderstanding!
-Mother!

954
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:03.331
-You must be mistaken!
-Mother!

955
00:59:03.414 --> 00:59:05.625
Please let go of her!
Let go first, and we can talk.

956
00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.669
Ma'am, let go of her hand first.

957
00:59:07.752 --> 00:59:09.087
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

958
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:10.380
Mother?

959
00:59:10.463 --> 00:59:11.673
Look at this.

960
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:15.134
So you're the son who had an affair
and raised a secret love child?

961
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.136
Be quiet!

962
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.013
No, Ms. Oh. It's not what you think!

963
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:19.931
Please cover your ears!

964
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:23.184
Like mother like son,
both of you are cheaters!

965
00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:25.019
Is it in your genes?

966
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:26.813
-Let go.
-Please be quiet!

967
00:59:32.277 --> 00:59:33.945
Ma'am, what did you just say?

968
00:59:35.863 --> 00:59:39.117
Did you just say he had an affair
and has a secret love child?

969
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:40.535
Yes!

970
00:59:40.618 --> 00:59:43.329
He had an affair with his first love
and has a daughter.

971
00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.747
Did you not know?

972
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.273
Welcome.

973
01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.116
Is it the professor in charge of me?

974
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.326
Professor Choi Seung-hi?

975
01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:07.246
<c.bg_transparent><i>What have you been doing this whole time?
You should have won her back by now!</i></c.bg_transparent>

976
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.332
Once you let go of Seo In-ho,
you can reel in Roy Kim.

977
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.793
Can you come with me?

978
01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:13.586
Is it because of that punk?

979
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.547
<c.bg_transparent><i>I don't want to use anything else
as an excuse to delay this.</i></c.bg_transparent>

980
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:17.840
You can take this to court.

981
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:22.136
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm going to stop the divorce,
even if I have to spend my entire fortune.</i></c.bg_transparent>

982
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:28.726
