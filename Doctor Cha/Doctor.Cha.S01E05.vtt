00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.361
We have ROSC. Check his vitals, please.

3
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.362
Dr. Cha!

4
00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.240
Dr. Cha!

5
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.992
Open your eyes!

6
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:17.368
Dr. Cha!

7
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.789
What's going on?

8
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.542
Dr. Cha!

9
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.462
What happened to her?

10
00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.548
She was electrocuted after touching
the patient's body during CPR.

11
00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.009
Jeez, she's such a klutz.

12
00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.143
What?

13
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:49.859
You're awake.

14
00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.028
Are you okay?

15
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.990
Why am I here?

16
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.242
Do you not remember?

17
00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.203
You fainted
after you were electrocuted during CPR.

18
00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.121
Me?

19
00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:04.707
I did?

20
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.044
You made a mistake
that not even med students make.

21
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.131
You created a moment
that'll go down in our hospital's history.

22
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.884
Anyway, I think you've laid down enough,
so why don't you get up now?

23
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.804
Okay. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.061
Why on earth did you do that?

25
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.479
I don't know.

26
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.440
I must've been distracted.

27
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.027
Jeez, this is embarrassing.

28
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.071
That's not the issue.

29
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.699
Do you know how shocked I was?
I mean, earlier…

30
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.702
Father was in the ER at the time,

31
00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:44.581
and he screamed at everyone
and carried you all the way here.

32
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.584
I've never seen him
so flustered like that.

33
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.504
Everyone, out of the way!

34
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.133
No!

35
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.510
No!

36
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.055
Your dad did?

37
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.602
Check up on your mom's condition often
and look out for her.

38
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.521
It might be hard, but I trust
that you'll understand my position.

39
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.024
Keep up the good work.

40
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.611
I'm the one who's doing all the work.

41
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.086
Why did I…

42
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.597
What happened to her?

43
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.266
She was electrocuted after touching
the patient's body during CPR.

44
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.559
Jeez, she's such a klutz.

45
00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.830
You have a sense of humanity that I lack.

46
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.292
That's if I were to put it nicely.
To be blunt, you're just nosy.

47
00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.210
Anyway,

48
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.338
I let you date me
because of that quality of yours.

49
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.299
But I've been feeling off recently.

50
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.679
Don't you think
you're a bit too friendly with that lady?

51
00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.973
-Me?
-Yes.

52
00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:29.686
I'm having trouble
putting a name to this feeling.

53
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.853
Jealousy?

54
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.564
That's a gross way to put it.

55
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.650
Camaraderie…

56
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:38.820
is a rather contemptible way
to describe it.

57
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.447
The word jealousy grosses me out as well.

58
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.074
It's nothing. It's just…

59
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.118
Let's just go with camaraderie.

60
00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.579
That word doesn't cut it.

61
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.666
Let's just call it pity.

62
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.501
Whatever. Think what you want.

63
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.044
More importantly,

64
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.213
you "let me date you"?

65
00:04:58.047 --> 00:04:58.965
"Let me"?

66
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.844
I know I liked you first,
but isn't this some kind of power trip?

67
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.178
You didn't know?

68
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.348
There are power dynamics
in romantic relationships.

69
00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.601
You like me more,
so I have power over you.

70
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:11.936
Well…

71
00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.112
Ma'am.

72
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:22.697
You're here.

73
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.163
I'm not too knowledgeable
about art schools,

74
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.248
so I'm not sure exactly how to help you.

75
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.959
Does your mother have
any strategies to support you?

76
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.253
My mom?

77
00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.213
When you were preparing for med school,

78
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.466
she was knowledgeable enough
to be a college counselor.

79
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.886
She doesn't know much
about preparing for art school admissions.

80
00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.721
And right now,

81
00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.308
she's busy pursuing her own career.

82
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.907
Excuse me, Professor.

83
00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.623
You have something stuck in your hair.

84
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.541
Here.

85
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.130
Thank you.

86
00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.470
Hey, daughter.

87
00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.763
Is something the matter?

88
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.349
Was I hallucinating?

89
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.105
"Daughter"?

90
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.899
She has a daughter?

91
00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.532
The surgical site is healing well.

92
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.409
I think you'll be able
to be discharged this week.

93
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.621
-Goodness. Thank you, Doctor.
-It's nothing.

94
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.417
-Then I'll see you on my rounds tomorrow.
-Please wait one moment.

95
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:02.797
Here.

96
00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.134
I made this
from the apples we raise ourselves.

97
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.593
Please have some together.

98
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:10.805
-Thank you.
-Yes.

99
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:13.766
Isn't that crazy?

100
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.935
Here, a present.

101
00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:19.313
This apple juice purely consists
of apples raised with love and care.

102
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.774
This is precious stuff,
so be sure to savor every drop.

103
00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.234
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

104
00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:26.320
But what was so funny?

105
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.866
Professor, you remember
that older resident right?

106
00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.369
The one who asked you for a ride
after the dinner party.

107
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.371
-Dr. Cha Jeong-suk?
-Yes.

108
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:40.501
Apparently, she got electrocuted today
after touching her patient during CPR.

109
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.086
Isn't that wild?

110
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.965
What's her condition? Is she okay?

111
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.176
She didn't get hurt?

112
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.262
Yes, they said she went
right back to work.

113
00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:54.348
Besides, first-year residents
have to act like they're fine

114
00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.766
even if they actually aren't.

115
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.684
That's a relief.

116
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.106
But is that something to laugh about?

117
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.344
DR. CHA, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED…

118
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.187
You're going to get the surgery?

119
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.104
Yes.

120
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.191
-You're not going to go to the US?
-I don't want to go.

121
00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.276
I'm going to get the surgery here.

122
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.320
I'm counting on you.

123
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.950
Even though I'm not in a position
where I can do much for your surgery,

124
00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:57.370
I must say you really made
the right decision, Chairman Oh.

125
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.871
We'll do our best.

126
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.457
Are you okay?

127
00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:04.043
You fainted while trying to save me.

128
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:07.838
Who told you that?

129
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.340
I saw it.

130
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.178
But you were in cardiac arrest then.

131
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:18.182
Well, I experienced something rather odd

132
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:22.603
that I never thought
I'd come across in my life.

133
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.874
He went on and on
about wanting to be discharged.

134
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.294
He's a nuisance to the very end.

135
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.795
Who said he wasn't?

136
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.257
I guess he won't be able
to go to the US like he wanted.

137
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.013
He just suddenly collapsed.

138
00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.723
Do you think I forgot Eun-bi's birthday?

139
00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:01.100
Then what do you expect me to do?

140
00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:02.893
You want me to leave that old geezer?

141
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.604
He's going to kill me.

142
00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:06.397
Can you just let it…

143
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.609
It's just this once.
It's not as if this happens all the time!

144
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:10.818
Come on!

145
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:12.153
"Old geezer"?

146
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:14.238
The weather just had to be great today.

147
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.741
I should be golfing on a day like this!

148
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.994
Are you not worried about your father?

149
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.663
That condescending old man
is called "the phoenix" for a reason.

150
00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.708
He'll probably come back
like a phoenix this time too.

151
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.753
He cares about his money too much
to just leave like this.

152
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:31.505
Aren't you secretly hoping
that he passes away?

153
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.799
Hey, what do you take me for?

154
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.052
What would the need for that be?

155
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.554
In the end,
everything will be mine anyway.

156
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.267
You worthless bastard!

157
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.855
You little bastard.

158
00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:49.690
Where is he?

159
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.787
Charge it to 200J.

160
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.414
Charge it to 200J.

161
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.249
One, two, administering shock.

162
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:16.801
<c.bg_transparent><i>I don't know if I should say
that I experienced the afterlife,</i></c.bg_transparent>

163
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:19.053
or that I had an out-of-body experience.

164
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.139
Anyway,

165
00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.017
experiencing death made me realize

166
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.186
that I needed to live.

167
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:32.441
No matter how crappy life might be,
living is always better than dying.

168
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.110
If I die, it's only a loss for me.

169
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.195
Dr. Cha.

170
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.531
Set a date for my surgery.

171
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:39.949
Yes, Chairman Oh.

172
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.120
I understand, as someone
who was on the brink of death as well.

173
00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:48.124
You should survive until the very end
and do everything you want.

174
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.084
-So you won't have any regrets.
-Shall I?

175
00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:52.670
-My goodness. Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

176
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.840
Jeez, you startled me.
Chairman Oh, you have to be careful.

177
00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.508
I'm fine.

178
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.054
I have two problematic patients, you know?

179
00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:07.476
Because they keep telling me
that they don't want to get treated.

180
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.273
But among the two, one of them told me
today that he will get his surgery.

181
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:18.070
You can't imagine how hard he cried
when he heard about his condition.

182
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.073
I felt so terrible.

183
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.533
It's such a relief now.

184
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:26.579
When I first learned of my condition,

185
00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.414
I cried too.

186
00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.750
Because I was so thankful.

187
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.048
It was like a gift to me…

188
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.637
since I didn't have
the courage to kill myself.

189
00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:49.560
I had the guts
to take someone else's life,

190
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.064
but I didn't have
the nerve to take my own.

191
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.525
You said you don't have the nerve,

192
00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:00.821
but how were you able to do
that to someone else?

193
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.958
-Doctor.
-Yes?

194
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.504
Could you please prescribe me
some cold medicine?

195
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.713
Are you sick?

196
00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.131
I'm aching all over.

197
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:22.301
A family member of the corrections officer
for the next shift passed away.

198
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:25.971
Goodness, it's going to be hard
to prescribe medicine in the ward.

199
00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.723
But I'll try to go find some medicine.

200
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:35.898
DR. CHA, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED,
ARE YOU…

201
00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:54.875
Professor!

202
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:56.835
What brings you here?

203
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.798
I thought Chief Resident Hwang
might be here.

204
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:03.300
She's not here right now.
Is she not answering her phone?

205
00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:05.553
I'll try calling her.

206
00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.513
Okay, then I'll get going now.

207
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.064
She seems fine.

208
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.030
Mom.

209
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.407
I need to talk to you.

210
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.118
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

211
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.329
Okay.

212
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.713
The art academy instructors can only do
so much for my art project report.

213
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.134
It's critical for early admissions,
but it's beyond my ability to do it alone.

214
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.469
I looked into it,

215
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.139
and there are consultants
that specialize in art school--

216
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.391
Mom!

217
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:56.478
Did I nod off?

218
00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:59.732
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired these days.

219
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.942
Where did we leave off?

220
00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.862
Forget it. Why bother
when you're not even interested in me?

221
00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:07.281
Come on, it's not like that.

222
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.491
Why would I have no interest in you?

223
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.494
Then are you aware I had a consultation
with my homeroom teacher today?

224
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.751
I've just been so out of it these days.

225
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:19.835
I-rang,

226
00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.838
I went through a lot today, okay?

227
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.965
I'll explain--

228
00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.425
I don't need your explanation.

229
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.719
Let's just live our lives
separately from now on.

230
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.513
That's what you'll prefer anyway.

231
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:33.933
I-rang.

232
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.773
What are you doing?

233
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:42.483
You startled me.

234
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.171
Are you asleep?

235
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:06.507
No.

236
00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:11.720
But why are you like that?

237
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.555
Did something bad happen?

238
00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.765
No.

239
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.142
What is it?

240
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:18.852
What?

241
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:23.774
Come here.

242
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:25.818
Why?

243
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:28.112
Stop talking back and just come over here.

244
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:35.828
What is it?

245
00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:43.168
Is it my birthday present?

246
00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:44.586
That bracelet?

247
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.554
It's so pretty.

248
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.432
Honey, it's so pretty.

249
00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:58.183
Give it to me.

250
00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.230
It's beautiful.

251
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.025
I'm glad to hear you like it.

252
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.822
I'll cherish this forever.

253
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.699
Thank you, honey.

254
00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:16.702
Come on, don't go overboard.
I can just buy you another one.

255
00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:19.747
This is the first present
I've received from you.

256
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.582
So it's that much more meaningful.

257
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.375
First?

258
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:26.253
Makes you think you've been
too neglectful, doesn't it?

259
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.049
And about I-rang.

260
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:33.052
It seems like she's being rebellious,
which is unlike her.

261
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.386
It's all my fault.

262
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.723
She's in 12th grade.
I should have taken better care of her.

263
00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:39.016
How about

264
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.562
you delay your residency for a year

265
00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.189
until I-rang gets into med school?

266
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.902
If you still haven't changed your mind
after I-rang gets into med school,

267
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.445
it won't be late to start then.

268
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.199
I do feel bad about I-rang.

269
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.331
Of course you do.

270
00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:06.585
Her mother turned a blind eye to her
at such an important time in her life,

271
00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:08.629
which resulted in her feeling
isolated and rebellious.

272
00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:11.757
How much pain she must be in, right?

273
00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:13.842
I think I might have taken

274
00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:17.721
the kids' problems too lightly.

275
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:27.231
By the way, honey,

276
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:32.861
I think Seung-hi has a daughter too.

277
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.244
Really?

278
00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.428
Eat up.

279
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:04.059
Do you feel good
about stuffing your faces by yourselves?

280
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.397
What? Damn it!

281
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:12.401
What? You are worthless!

I don't need anything.
Just spend it on yourself.

311
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.930
I think it'd be correct
to proceed with a laparotomy.

312
00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:07.224
But I feel like a laparoscopy
would be worth a shot too.

313
00:21:07.307 --> 00:21:10.435
Laparoscopic surgery
would be the best bet given his age.

314
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.562
He'll recover faster,
and there are lower chances

315
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.940
of complications
such as abdominal adhesions.

316
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:16.984
This patient is
a particularly delicate case.

317
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.568
Of course that might be the case…

318
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.362
Given the liver lesions,

319
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.489
a laparoscopic surgery
would be pushing it.

320
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:24.533
If we do an RFA after the incision,

321
00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.285
we'll be able to get most of it.

322
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.412
So laparotomy would be the best.

323
00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:31.456
It's metastasized through the liver
and artery lymph nodes.

324
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.334
Shouldn't we remove the portions
we are certain about

325
00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.587
and then do chemotherapy
before performing another surgery?

326
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.047
We don't want to push things.

327
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.134
We all know the best course of action
is to perform R0 resection

328
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:46.430
for patients who have colorectal cancer
that has metastasized to the liver.

329
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.683
Administering a treatment
when cancer cells are remaining

330
00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:52.227
will cause the patient's state to worsen.

331
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.896
We must give the patient
the best treatment

332
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.024
within the bounds of
what the patient's condition allows.

333
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.651
Isn't that
what an oncologic surgeon should do?

334
00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:04.072
I will judge whether I'm pushing things
too far or not.

335
00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:10.787
I hope this doesn't offend you,

336
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:15.042
but do you have the skill to remove
all the metastasized cancer in the liver?

337
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.711
I think you're being too daring.

338
00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.213
You're right.

339
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.591
I am a bit daring.

340
00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:24.676
Because I am that competent.

341
00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:30.307
It's as if I'm watching
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

342
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.726
-You can have a go at each other
-Shall I?

343
00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:06.218
Lift up the intestine.

344
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.260
Okay.

345
00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.929
-Bring in the camera.
-Okay.

346
00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:11.431
Turn the camera's angle to the left.

347
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.184
Compared to the footage,

348
00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:16.353
the invasion into
the sphincter isn't as deep.

349
00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:18.105
I think we can save the exterior.

350
00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:21.024
We can preserve the anus
by removing the sphincter.

351
00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:22.692
The patient will be so pleased.

352
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:23.902
I know.

353
00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:27.155
We'll have to add a temporary stoma,
but it can be removed in a few months.

354
00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.742
-Okay, I'll move downward now.
-Okay.

355
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.036
SURGERY DURATION, ANESTHESIA DURATION

356
00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.998
-Provide suction for the fluid.
-Yes, sir.

357
00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.251
This patient is famous.

358
00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:41.628
If word gets around
that you operated on him,

359
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.713
you'll get even busier.

360
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:46.842
Every patient is the same for me.

361
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:48.760
Scissors, please.

362
00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:58.228
Why is he already waiting?

363
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.272
I would've called him when we were done.

364
00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:01.231
Right?

365
00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:14.369
Things worked out so well, Chairman Oh.

366
00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.746
I thought even your anus
would have to be removed,

367
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.915
but thankfully that wasn't necessary.

368
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:23.503
Congratulations on being able
to preserve your anus.

369
00:24:25.046 --> 00:24:27.174
Yes, it worked out well.

370
00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:28.216
Of course.

371
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.554
Your quality of life changes drastically
depending on if you have an anus or not.

372
00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:36.183
The artificial stoma will only be in place
while you undergo chemotherapy.

373
00:24:36.766 --> 00:24:38.852
What are you so happy about?

374
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:44.858
None of my children even care
if I carry a poop bag around or not.

375
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.736
Goodness, no way.

376
00:24:48.528 --> 00:24:52.991
They may not express it,
but I bet they are feeling relieved.

377
00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:55.702
And I…

378
00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.539
bought this to give to you.

379
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:01.374
What is that?

380
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:04.544
Once you attach the stoma,
you'll have to wear bigger underwear,

381
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.046
so I bought this.

382
00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:09.341
But since it's temporary,
I'll get a refund for this.

383
00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:12.385
Why would you refund my gift?

384
00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.262
-Give it to me.
-It's big for you.

385
00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.223
Goodness, all I have is money.

386
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.266
I'll have it tailored. Give it to me.

387
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.976
-Really?
-Give it to me.

388
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.479
-I'll open it for you.
-Okay.

389
00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:23.772
-Do you want to see?
-Sure.

390
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:26.858
Goodness.

391
00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:42.749
You regret being mean to me
when we first met, don't you?

392
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:49.130
But this isn't from the department store.

393
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:53.385
-Just give it back.
-No, it's fine.

394
00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:55.387
-I'll return--
-You already gave it to me.

395
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:27.836
Going down.

396
00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:31.006
The doors are closing.

397
00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.975
You must be going home.

398
00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:43.476
Yes.

399
00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:00.160
Going down.

400
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:03.038
The doors are closing.

401
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:04.414
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

402
00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:19.637
Dr. Moon.

403
00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:21.639
Which way is your home?

404
00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:24.726
Have you gotten closer to your colleagues?

405
00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.895
It's still a bit awkward.

406
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:28.229
Why?

407
00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:29.898
Do you not get along?

408
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.651
It's not that we don't get along,

409
00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:36.613
but some bad rumors
are going around the hospital.

410
00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:38.406
So it's making things awkward.

411
00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.743
-Bad rumors?
-You didn't hear?

412
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:45.789
They say Dr. Cha and GS Professor Seo
are seeing each other.

413
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:47.499
The whole hospital knows about the rumor.

414
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:54.506
What are you talking about?

415
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.050
It's just a rumor going around.

416
00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:59.552
When Dr. Cha fainted
while she was administering CPR,

417
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.805
Professor Seo ran over
and worried about her--

418
00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:03.556
Stop saying such nonsense!

419
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.017
They were just colleagues in med school.

420
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:07.811
Can't friends worry about each other?

421
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:13.233
And why are you going around and spreading
rumors that haven't been confirmed?

422
00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:15.902
Do you not have
any loyalty to your colleagues?

423
00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.173
Take it. I don't need it.

424
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.050
What do you mean? What happened?

425
00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:42.679
How can I go around wearing
the same bracelet your wife has?

426
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:49.144
How could you buy us
the exact same bracelet?

427
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.479
Seung-hi, calm down.
Why don't we sit down first?

428
00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:02.991
Jeong-suk found the receipt.

429
00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:05.660
The receipt for the bracelet I gave you.

430
00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:10.457
I told her it was for her birthday,
so I had no choice.

431
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.501
Honestly, this is driving me crazy too!

432
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.174
I'll make sure this never happens again.

433
00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.134
I'm really sorry.

434
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:23.344
Shall I get you another gift?

435
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.059
He never says he's going to leave her.

436
00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.487
We got off early, so how about a latte?

437
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.905
Okay, let's go.

438
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:45.533
Eun-seo.

439
00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:49.120
Who is that?

440
00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:50.747
Your mom?

441
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:54.334
Sorry, I have to go.
Let's grab a latte together next time.

442
00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.598
I haven't picked you up in forever, right?

443
00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.892
How about we get something to eat?

444
00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:13.019
-What do you want to eat?
-Let's just go home.

445
00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:14.395
Without eating?

446
00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.357
-Why? We can eat the sushi you--
-I said let's just go home!

447
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.296
Choi Eun-seo.

448
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:43.132
Eun-seo.

449
00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:44.843
What's wrong?

450
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.594
Why are you so angry?

451
00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.012
Get out.

452
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.477
You have to tell me
what you're angry about to get over it.

453
00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:57.564
You should find a nice guy and marry him.

454
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.692
Where did that come from?

455
00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:03.736
I have no plans
to get a stepfather for you.

456
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.657
Why? Did that man tell you not to marry?

457
00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:10.118
"That man"?

458
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.661
He's your dad, Eun-seo.

459
00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:14.747
How can I call him "Dad"
when I'm just his mistress' daughter?

460
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.667
What? Am I wrong?

461
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.460
It's true that you're his mistress!

462
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.092
Choi Eun-seo!

463
00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:31.180
If that's not true, why am I Choi Eun-seo?

464
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.809
If I'm not just his mistress' daughter,
why am I not Seo Eun-seo?

465
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:39.355
You're at an age where I don't
have to explain every detail to you.

466
00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:43.151
Do you really want to hurt me
like an immature teenager?

467
00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:44.903
Am I the only one who's hurting you?

468
00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.238
You're the one
who had a kid with a married man!

469
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.074
You're the reason
I can't ever call my dad "Dad"!

470
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:52.410
Even if you get married and settle down,

471
00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:55.163
a lot of things can change with time.

472
00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:57.206
Can't you just think of it that way?

473
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.459
I can't understand it and I don't want to!

474
00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:02.670
Just…

475
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:05.882
Just give me some time.

476
00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:09.761
-It may be late, but I'll--
-But what?

477
00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.680
Did he say he'll divorce his wife
and come to you?

478
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:15.683
Do you believe that?

479
00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:19.854
Even I can tell that's a plain lie.

480
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.607
How can you be so naive at that age
to believe all that?

481
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:27.403
How long do I have to be the bad guy here?

482
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:29.238
You shouldn't have had me then.

483
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.616
You should've lived your life alone.

484
00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:32.909
Why did you have me

485
00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:36.037
just to get abandoned by your family
and treated like this by your daughter?

486
00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:38.915
Because I wanted to meet you so badly.

487
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.212
I wanted to meet you so badly
that I gave birth to you.

488
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.464
Because I wanted to meet you so much!

489
00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:12.240
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

490
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:32.468
Yes, come in.

491
00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.387
The meeting minutes?

492
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.057
Yes. There's a seminar
at half past seven on the fifth floor,

493
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:40.685
and you'll have to come in
and record the minutes.

494
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.062
Just come after work.

495
00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:45.898
I see.

496
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:47.984
Why? You don't want to do it?

497
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:50.987
Yes, I refuse.

498
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:53.865
Are there no other residents here?

499
00:33:53.948 --> 00:33:55.241
Why are you asking me

500
00:33:55.324 --> 00:33:57.869
when I'm currently dispatched
to a different department?

501
00:33:57.952 --> 00:33:59.037
Furthermore…

502
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:02.540
why are you suddenly
speaking casually toward me?

503
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.584
You don't want to do it?

504
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:08.755
Of course not. I'll do it.

505
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:14.093
Go to the in-house library
and get these materials for me.

506
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:22.769
Please organize these materials.

507
00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:34.405
<c.bg_transparent><i>Make a presentation
for tomorrow morning's meeting.</i></c.bg_transparent>

508
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:50.129
Can you type up this thesis?

509
00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:53.382
My wrists aren't in good shape.

510
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.389
Can you type faster?

511
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:06.604
You're so slow.

512
00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:11.651
Hello.

513
00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.617
Thank you.

514
00:35:25.748 --> 00:35:27.250
Have I gotten a lot worse?

515
00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:32.922
As expected,
your LFT has elevated slightly.

516
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:36.342
You are taking
your immunosuppressants regularly, right?

517
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.344
Yes.

518
00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.890
To be honest, I sometimes forget
because I'm so busy.

519
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.225
No matter how busy you are,

520
00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.353
you can't forget to take them
and need to take them on time.

521
00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:49.522
Doing that once
or twice won't do much harm.

522
00:35:49.605 --> 00:35:51.899
But in the worst-case scenario,
your liver could get damaged again.

523
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.653
You can't slack off
just because you feel all right now.

524
00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.702
I don't know if it's right
to say not to work too hard,

525
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:05.121
but your health has to take priority.

526
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.874
Always remember this.

527
00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:10.293
"My liver is precious."

528
00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:23.848
ANNEX SURGERY ROOM

529
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:28.519
Why not send the dispatched residents
from family medicine to my department?

530
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:32.398
I don't know about that.

531
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:36.402
The family medicine doctors don't seem
to prefer working in your department.

532
00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:40.114
For primary care, they need to learn
about the stomach and intestines,

533
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:42.325
I don't know if they'll have
the time to go to you.

534
00:36:43.784 --> 00:36:46.621
Family medicine doctors should know about
hepatobiliary and pancreatic conditions

535
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:49.790
like acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

536
00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:52.251
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:53.753
I'm short on hands too.

538
00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:11.354
Gosh, you startled me!

539
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.439
Goodness, Dr. Jeon.

540
00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:14.857
Why are you so shocked?

541
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.486
I mean, how could I not get shocked
when you're standing there like a ghost?

542
00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:21.197
I was just seeing
if you were giving out the wrong order.

543
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:24.283
Your eyes were half-closed.

544
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:28.246
I was focused
and entered everything in perfectly.

545
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:30.998
I have one thing to ask you.

546
00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:32.792
To ask me?

547
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.169
What's going on
between you and Professor Seo?

548
00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:40.633
What do you mean?

549
00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:43.386
There are rumors
about you two being a couple.

550
00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:47.640
Someone asked me, but I couldn't refute it
since I don't know the details.

551
00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:50.810
Since it's a bother
to be continually asked this,

552
00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:53.938
will you just be straight with me
and tell me if it's a yes or a no?

553
00:37:57.024 --> 00:37:58.859
Nothing is going on between us.

554
00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:05.908
You're getting excessively worked up
for it to be nothing.

555
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:10.955
I'll let it go for now.

556
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.466
"Seeing each other"?

557
00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:23.843
Yes.

558
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.095
Professor Seo and Dr. Cha.

559
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.765
Does that lady have some kind
of irresistible charm I don't know about?

560
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:32.143
Why do men swarm around her?

561
00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:34.562
She seems close to Professor Roy too.

562
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.105
You always talk about her too.

563
00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:39.442
Why is everybody so eager
to get involved with her?

564
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.362
Damn it.

565
00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:46.866
Focus.

566
00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:48.159
This is about your father.

567
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.165
-It's just a rumor.
-How would you know?

568
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.126
Darn you.

569
00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:58.919
Keep a close eye on the professor.

570
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.725
Normally I shouldn't be doing this,
but I'm having trouble standing.

571
00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:15.644
A colleague of mine
will come within an hour.

572
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:18.481
Can I ask you
to watch over her until then?

573
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:20.858
Okay, it's a simple test
so it won't take too long.

574
00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:26.113
But the patient has a wound on her wrist.

575
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.158
Is there a way to slightly loosen
the handcuffs?

576
00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:46.592
Okay, we'll be back soon.

577
00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.770
Today we're going
to take an X-ray and do an ECG.

578
00:39:58.354 --> 00:40:00.606
These are simple tests,
so you don't have to worry.

579
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.442
Dr. Cha.

580
00:40:04.527 --> 00:40:07.446
-Are you free?
-I need to run some tests.

581
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.281
Go to Gangnam Hospital right away.

582
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.785
My research materials are there,
and I need you to get them.

583
00:40:18.332 --> 00:40:21.001
I'll give you a contact
so you can get the materials.

584
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.044
But--

585
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.754
One second.

586
00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:25.965
Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

587
00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.384
Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

588
00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:31.095
Can I go in one hour?

589
00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:33.305
I have to be
with the patient for her tests.

590
00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:36.684
Since when do residents
go and oversee a patient's tests?

591
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.144
The thing is…

592
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.729
-Say goodbye.
-Bye.

593
00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:46.402
Get an intern to take care
of the patient's tests and go.

594
00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:28.194
Ma'am, are you all right?

595
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:29.862
Where are you going?

596
00:41:29.945 --> 00:41:32.281
You must be staying
at Gusan University Hospital.

597
00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:34.867
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to ask this of a stranger,

598
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.287
but can you lend me some money for a taxi?

599
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.043
-What do I do?
-What's wrong?

600
00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:46.378
Ms. Jang Hae-nam disappeared.

601
00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:52.218
You haven't found Ms. Jang Hae-nam?

602
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:53.761
No.

603
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.055
Are you out of your mind?

604
00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:58.057
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up!

605
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:02.645
How dare an incompetent resident
like you humiliate our hospital?

606
00:42:03.145 --> 00:42:04.897
There's a bed but no patient!

607
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:07.191
Damn it!

608
00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:21.872
Wait in the medical office.

609
00:42:47.606 --> 00:42:48.607
Where are you heading?

610
00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:52.403
To Gupabal.

611
00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:54.238
Where in Gupabal?

612
00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.740
Gupabal.

613
00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:57.700
Well…

614
00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:01.495
I'm not sure if it's still there.

615
00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:04.373
What was the name of that church?

616
00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.669
Goodness, I can't seem to remember it.

617
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.045
Ma'am.

618
00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.423
Do you know your home phone number?

619
00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:14.174
Home phone number?

620
00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:17.845
Do you know the cell phone number
of any of your family members?

621
00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:20.139
Your kids.

622
00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:21.724
I have a daughter.

623
00:43:24.184 --> 00:43:25.686
I want to see her

624
00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:30.065
just once…

625
00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:33.068
before I die.

626
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.078
Dr. Cha!

627
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:44.496
They found her?

628
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.833
The police station called.
A taxi driver brought her to the police.

629
00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:51.503
She was speaking incoherently
so the driver thought she had dementia.

630
00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:52.921
Is she all right?

631
00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:55.090
Yes, you don't have to worry.

632
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:56.425
It worked out.

633
00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.637
That's such a relief.

634
00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:01.889
It's such a relief.

635
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.731
CHIEF LIM JONG-KWON

636
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.864
Do you think you can continue to work?

637
00:44:20.115 --> 00:44:20.949
What?

638
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:23.952
Honestly, I've had a lot of worries
ever since you came here.

639
00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:29.458
It's possible to cover up any trouble
you cause within this department.

640
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:32.127
But nothing can be done
about the trouble you cause

641
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:33.629
in another department.

642
00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:38.801
-I'm sorry--
-That's why we avoid old residents.

643
00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:41.762
If someone young makes a mistake,
it's just a mistake.

644
00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:43.764
But if someone older makes a mistake,

645
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:45.683
it's incompetence.

646
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.769
If your livelihood isn't at stake,

647
00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:50.521
perhaps you could reconsider
your position here.

648
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:54.441
Do you mean I should quit?

649
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:57.611
Did it sound like I meant that?

650
00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:01.782
I just meant you should
give it some thought.

651
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:06.703
Professor, it's my fault that the patient
escaped due to my carelessness.

652
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:09.039
I have no excuses to give on that matter.

653
00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:11.667
But I find it unfair that
a mistake is equated

654
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.670
to incompetence just because I'm older.

655
00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:18.632
I'm still just a first-year resident
who has a lot to learn.

656
00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:01.717
Are you going home?

657
00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:03.343
Yes.

658
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.803
How are you getting home?

659
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.851
I feel like I've become useless.

660
00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.605
I'm such an idiot at the hospital.

661
00:46:14.688 --> 00:46:16.523
My body isn't the same as before.

662
00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:19.902
And I've neglected my daughter
who's trying to get into college.

663
00:46:21.403 --> 00:46:23.405
Is it right for me to continue doing this?

664
00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:25.866
Then just quit.

665
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.954
Even easy tasks feel hard
if you haven't done them in 20 years.

666
00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:33.248
Not to mention the work doctors do.

667
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:35.834
That's true.

668
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:39.588
If you're not confident,
you should just quit sooner than later.

669
00:46:39.671 --> 00:46:42.424
You won't learn anything at the hospital
with that attitude.

670
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.719
I have plans,
so I'll take a taxi from here.

671
00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.914
It's a relief you're healthy
and being discharged.

672
00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:15.582
I still have to undergo chemotherapy.

673
00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:19.378
Don't be discouraged
just because you're older.

674
00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:22.673
Make sure to learn a lot
and become a great doctor.

675
00:47:23.298 --> 00:47:25.801
When you start your own practice,
I'll be your patient.

676
00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:29.221
Just imagining it makes me happy.

677
00:47:29.304 --> 00:47:30.806
Why leave it just as an imagination?

678
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.266
You can make it a reality.

679
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:37.145
But why do you look so sad?
Did something bad happen?

680
00:47:38.605 --> 00:47:39.773
Do I look sad?

681
00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:41.817
Gosh.

682
00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:45.070
I'm sorry. I'm being silly.

683
00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.906
Don't be like that and come sit here.

684
00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:53.662
Come on.

685
00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.707
What's wrong? Tell me everything.

686
00:47:57.457 --> 00:48:00.085
Once you let everything out,
you'll feel better.

687
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.921
I'm afraid…

688
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.883
I'll have to quit working at the hospital.

689
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:08.051
Why?

690
00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:11.305
Because I'm lacking in so many ways,

691
00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:12.931
and I'm foolish.

692
00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.893
You're literally blinded
by your own privilege.

693
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:21.148
You should be thankful
for this chance at your age.

694
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.150
What kind of gibberish are you saying?

695
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.154
Stop saying such useless things
and think about learning and improving.

696
00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:30.532
You should learn by taking things
one step at a time

697
00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:32.075
and become a great doctor.

698
00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:35.662
Why are you laughing?

699
00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.581
I'm being serious right now.

700
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.836
You sound like my father.

701
00:48:46.798 --> 00:48:49.009
If my father were still alive,

702
00:48:50.969 --> 00:48:54.306
I think he would scold me
just like you did.

703
00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.228
But…

704
00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.481
later on…

705
00:49:03.565 --> 00:49:06.318
he would say,

706
00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:08.904
"Fine, do whatever you want."

707
00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:12.949
So?

708
00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:15.869
Are you just going to quit?

709
00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:27.506
Why would you come to my office
when you can talk to me at home?

710
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:30.926
Do you know there's a rumor about us
that something is going on

711
00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:32.511
between us?

712
00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:34.221
I know.

713
00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:36.932
You know?

714
00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:38.475
Yes, I know.

715
00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:41.228
That's it? Nothing else comes to mind?

716
00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.897
You said your husband is dead
so it might not hurt you,

717
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.691
but I'm an officially married man.

718
00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:48.485
How will I be able to face my patients

719
00:49:48.568 --> 00:49:51.071
when I'm labeled as some sordid cheater?

720
00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:53.615
Do you only care
about your professional achievements?

721
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:56.743
Do you not care if your husband
and son's reputations are destroyed?

722
00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.203
Were you always this selfish?

723
00:49:58.286 --> 00:49:59.871
I'm going to quit the hospital.

724
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:00.956
What--

725
00:50:03.792 --> 00:50:05.210
Does that make you feel better?

726
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:12.008
Why do you have to put it that way?

727
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.556
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

728
00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:19.433
It's not sudden.

729
00:50:20.892 --> 00:50:22.936
I only prepared for the resident exam.

730
00:50:23.603 --> 00:50:26.106
I make mistakes
all the time at the hospital.

731
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:29.651
And my health isn't great.

732
00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:35.449
More importantly, I need to help I-rang
with her college admissions.

733
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.577
They say your kids
are the scariest people you'll meet.

734
00:50:39.077 --> 00:50:42.289
What will I do if she blames me
if she doesn't get into college?

735
00:50:42.956 --> 00:50:43.790
Right.

736
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.084
That's a good idea.

737
00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.173
When will you tell the hospital?

738
00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:55.010
In a few days.

739
00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:57.679
I need some time to sort things out.

740
00:50:58.513 --> 00:51:00.891
I don't want to cause trouble
to the department I've been dispatched to.

741
00:51:02.184 --> 00:51:05.479
I was sent here
because the resident before me quit.

742
00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.355
So how can I just quit too?

743
00:51:07.939 --> 00:51:11.568
You don't have to worry about that.
What you think matters most.

744
00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:17.532
Will they allow me
to take a one-year break?

745
00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:22.996
Don't worry.

746
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.667
If they don't accept you next year,
I'll pull some strings

747
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:31.546
and find you a spot in another hospital.

748
00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:36.551
Thank you.

749
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.857
She's going to quit?

750
00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:52.359
I'm sure of it.

751
00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:57.322
You must have had a hard time.

752
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.324
I'm sorry.

753
00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:02.035
Her quitting takes care
of one of my worries.

754
00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.955
Will I see you in the conference room?
I heard there's some sort of event.

755
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:06.456
I heard about it.

756
00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:09.000
-If I have time, I'll go.
-Okay.

757
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:11.044
Let's see each other if we can.

758
00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.682
This looks so delicious.

759
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:25.642
Do you even have time to make it at home?

760
00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:28.436
-I should have made it for you.
-No need.

761
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:32.816
Mom.

762
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.484
I am…

763
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.028
going to quit the hospital.

764
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.655
What?

765
00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:40.699
Why?

766
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.493
Is it too hard for you to continue?

767
00:52:44.077 --> 00:52:45.287
Yes, and also…

768
00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.123
I-rang is in 12th grade,

769
00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:50.750
and she's having trouble
since I'm not there to help her.

770
00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:53.879
I see.

771
00:52:55.922 --> 00:52:58.842
I'm sure you've thought this through.

772
00:53:00.218 --> 00:53:01.428
Don't be disappointed.

773
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.388
Your health is the top priority,

774
00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:06.308
and they say kids are more precious
than any treasure.

775
00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:09.603
There's nothing
more precious in the world.

776
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.898
I didn't expect you to react like this.

777
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.359
I thought you'd be more upset than me.

778
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:19.738
That's because
you were so young back then.

779
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:22.449
And it was obvious
your mother-in-law would harass you.

780
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:27.954
But you were able to raise
Jung-min and I-rang until now.

781
00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:33.001
If you think about that, there's nothing
to be disappointed or upset about.

782
00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.421
Right.

783
00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:38.131
You're right.

784
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:41.509
What you say is always right.

785
00:53:44.262 --> 00:53:48.975
I made an appointment
for your checkup at this hospital.

786
00:53:50.185 --> 00:53:52.938
That's the least
I can do for you before I quit.

787
00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:56.316
You're so stubborn!
I told you there's no need for that!

788
00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.152
Goodness, Mom.
You're the one that's stubborn.

789
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:00.278
I'm not going to do it!

790
00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:01.863
No, just do it.

791
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:02.781
No.

792
00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:03.823
Come on!

793
00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:24.803
Goodness.

794
00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:27.889
Dr. Cha, what brings you here?

795
00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:29.891
You've already heard?

796
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:31.601
No, it's not that.

797
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:34.229
I just had something to tell you.

798
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:36.648
It's a good thing you came.
What perfect timing.

799
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.694
The hospital director wants to see you.
Come with me.

800
00:54:41.236 --> 00:54:42.278
The hospital director?

801
00:54:44.572 --> 00:54:45.573
Hello.

802
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:49.661
Hello.

803
00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:56.751
I've lived 76 years,

804
00:54:56.835 --> 00:55:01.297
but I lived as a miser
who didn't even spend 100 won on others.

805
00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:06.720
Even I am moved by the fact
that I am donating not 100 won

806
00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.888
or one million won,

807
00:55:09.764 --> 00:55:12.475
but ten billion won.

808
00:55:13.768 --> 00:55:17.647
I would first like
to sincerely thank Professor Seo In-ho

809
00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:22.318
and Professor Roy Kim for operating on me.

810
00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:25.697
10 BILLION WON DONATION CEREMONY

811
00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:36.541
But there is another doctor
who helped give me this new life.

812
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:39.085
And that

813
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.046
is Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

814
00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:49.179
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk,
please come up to the stage.

815
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.686
Come up here.

816
00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:04.778
While others treated me
kindly on the outside

817
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:09.199
and treated me with contempt inside
for being a cranky old man,

818
00:56:09.282 --> 00:56:11.159
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk was different.

819
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.874
When I broke down
and cried due to my condition,

820
00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:19.876
she treated me sincerely and comforted me.

821
00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.003
I'm sorry.

822
00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:26.508
<c.bg_transparent><i>And when my heart stopped,
she gave it her all to save me.</i></c.bg_transparent>

823
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:30.970
<c.bg_transparent><i>After she found out I didn't have to use
a permanent stoma bag after surgery,</i></c.bg_transparent>

824
00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.847
she was happier for me

825
00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:35.642
than even my own kids.

826
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:43.775
She had unconditional compassion for me.

827
00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:48.988
Dr. Cha.

828
00:56:50.532 --> 00:56:51.741
Thank you so much.

829
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:57.247
I won't forget this until I die.

830
00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:09.634
I'm not sure
if it's because the work is hard,

831
00:57:09.717 --> 00:57:13.263
but Dr. Cha said that she might quit.

832
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:16.724
But I will keep
my eyes peeled for you all.

833
00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:20.395
If you let this kind of talent get away,
this hospital has no future.

834
00:57:21.062 --> 00:57:24.190
And I'm going to take back
every single bit of my ten billion won.

835
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:32.740
I am going to continuously storm in here

836
00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:36.744
and check until Dr. Cha Jeong-suk
becomes a specialist.

837
00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:41.791
Actually, it would even be better
if she became a professor here.

838
00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:44.502
If Dr. Cha wants to do research,

839
00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:49.424
I will fund it all, no questions asked!

CHAIRMAN OH CHANG-GYU,
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

844
00:58:20.413 --> 00:58:21.706
Dr. Cha.

845
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.335
Professor Seo, you too.

846
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:39.015
All right.

847
00:58:39.098 --> 00:58:42.018
In honor of Dr. Cha Jeong-suk,

848
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:43.895
please give another round of applause.

849
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.042
He's going to buy us
two robotic surgical systems.

850
00:59:06.125 --> 00:59:07.877
She's our lucky charm.

851
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:09.796
I knew it from the first time I saw her.

852
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.673
-Take good care of her.
-I will.

853
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:13.800
Professor Seo, you must be happy.

854
00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.301
Yes.

855
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.479
Excuse me, I'll get going first.

856
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:27.397
Okay.

857
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:29.691
You get involved in everything.

858
00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:38.992
Dr. Cha.

859
00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:42.495
Are you really going to quit?

860
00:59:48.793 --> 00:59:49.711
Are you crazy?

861
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.500
<c.bg_transparent><i>A murderer escaped the hospital
without authorization.</i></c.bg_transparent>

862
01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.045
I don't think this is
something to be taken lightly.

863
01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.380
Why are you so keen on kicking me out?

864
01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:38.176
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

865
01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:40.094
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

866
01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.430
<c.bg_transparent><i>I think maybe
that guy is interested in you.</i></c.bg_transparent>

867
01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.558
No matter what happens,
you need to stay strong.

868
01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:49.270
-What brings you here?
-I have something to tell you.
