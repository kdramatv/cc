EPISODE 14

3
00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.554
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

4
00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.307
Mom.

5
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.475
Eun-seo!

6
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.147
Are you treating me because it's payday?

7
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.275
Of course. It'll be a full-course meal,
including dessert.

8
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.195
What are we eating?

9
00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.447
Let's see. Beef?

10
00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:13.948
Sounds good?

11
00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.038
Why isn't she picking up?

12
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.207
Did something urgent come up?

13
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.459
Who are you calling like that?

14
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.377
It's the hospital.

15
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.923
I guess you're nervous that Seung-hi is
in charge of my mother.

16
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.090
What are you on about?

17
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.259
Someone might hear you.

18
00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.345
You listen carefully.

19
00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.306
My mother may find out one day
but now is not the time.

20
00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.267
If you make a mistake
and my mother finds out about our divorce

21
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.020
before she's treated and discharged, then…

22
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.855
I won't hold back.

23
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.900
Of course.
But we haven't gotten a divorce.

24
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.527
Welcome.

25
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.486
There you are.

26
00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.612
-Hello.
-Hey.

27
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.447
Mother, you're here.

28
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.743
Yes, I feel bad for bothering you
when you're so busy.

29
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.286
No, it's fine.

30
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.206
Even busier people do
at least this much for their families.

31
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.708
-Let's go in, Mother. Let's go, Mom.
-Okay.

32
00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:19.722
Eun-seo, you have to eat
a lot today, okay?

33
00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.017
Do you see this?
I'm wearing elastic pants.

34
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.521
Okay, let's eat until those pants rip.

35
00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.192
How dare you try to seduce my man?

36
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.110
-Mother!
-No!

37
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.028
-There must have been a misunderstanding!
-Mother!

38
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:37.490
-You must be mistaken!
-Mother!

39
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.576
Please let go of her!
Let go first, and we can talk.

40
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.619
Ma'am, let go of her hand first.

41
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.037
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

42
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.330
Mother?

43
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.623
Look at this.

44
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:49.085
So you're the son who had an affair
and raised a secret love child?

45
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.087
Be quiet!

46
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.839
No, Ms. Oh. It's not what you think!

47
00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:53.798
Please cover your ears!

48
00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.135
Like mother like son,
both of you are cheaters!

49
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.970
Is it in your genes?

50
00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:00.763
-Let go.
-Please be quiet!

51
00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.896
Ma'am, what did you just say?

52
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:13.151
Did you just say he had an affair
and has a secret love child?

53
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:14.485
Yes!

54
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.280
He had an affair with his first love
and has a daughter.

55
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.698
Did you not know?

56
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.224
Welcome.

57
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.401
Gosh, Grandma.

58
00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.154
Goodness.

59
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.077
Excuse me.

60
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:05.787
Ms. Kwak.

61
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.163
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:08.957
Hey, let's go.

63
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.458
Go where?

64
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.877
Ms. Kwak.

65
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.589
I'll contact you soon.
I'll explain everything then.

66
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.342
-Come on.
-An affair is an affair!

67
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.177
What other explanation is needed?

68
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.264
Let go! I'm not going to stand back!

69
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.308
Wait.

70
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.686
Let's go out and talk for a minute.

71
00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.729
Let go.

72
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.025
What are you two doing here?

73
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.319
We came to eat.
Why else would we come here?

74
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.239
Just by coincidence?

75
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.420
Did all of you know about this?

76
00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.090
Ms. Kwak.

77
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.052
Jung-min and I-rang too?

78
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.726
Jeong-suk, did you know too?

79
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.436
Mom.

80
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:15.273
Mom…

81
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.195
Where did In-ho go?

82
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.992
Of course it's by coincidence.
Do you think we stalk you?

83
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.620
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.123
I'm all out of sorts right now.

85
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.625
But the situation here isn't great.

86
00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:38.129
I'm sorry, but can you go eat
somewhere else?

87
00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:39.589
Why should we do that?

88
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.924
-Seung-hi.
-I don't want to hide anymore.

89
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.094
I don't want to look pathetic
in front of Eun-seo anymore.

90
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.847
If you go in there right now,
you won't look pathetic.

91
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.724
You'll look downright deplorable.

92
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.267
Seung-hi, Eun-seo, please.

93
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:55.521
Save me just this once, please?

94
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.815
Seo In-ho, you bastard. Where are you?

95
00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.118
Okay?

96
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.244
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.038
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:14.248
Bye.

99
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.947
Let us go to my place.

100
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:53.704
Does that include me?

101
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.557
Shall we go to another beef restaurant?

102
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.351
No, let's change the menu.
What do you want to eat?

103
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.730
Are you still dating Dad?

104
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:26.320
You're not legally married
and it's not like there's a custody issue.

105
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.905
So why are you still with him?

106
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:29.365
Eun-seo.

107
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.120
You'll understand once you meet
someone you like later on.

108
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.082
These things aren't easy.

109
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.419
I understand that it isn't easy.

110
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.301
Do you not want to eat?

111
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.511
I'm not in the mood to have a meal.

112
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.556
Let's go and let off some steam.

113
00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.311
-It's so spicy.
-It's spicy?

114
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.606
You actually spend money
on something this spicy?

115
00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.818
You feel a sense of catharsis
if you eat something this spicy.

116
00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:10.323
Mom, you shouldn't have any more.
You had gastric cramps recently.

117
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:12.533
It's okay. I'll have a little more.

118
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.703
This is actually kind of addictive.

119
00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:16.746
-Right?
-Yes.

120
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.834
Mom.

121
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.421
Let's go back to the US.

122
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.508
Let's go back

123
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.426
and start over.

124
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.346
You and me.

125
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:40.478
Do you

126
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.564
really have a child out of wedlock?

127
00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.738
I'm sorry, Mother.

128
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.535
I guess it's true
since you're saying you're sorry.

129
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:58.454
Who is the woman?

130
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.791
That lady before said
it was with your first love…

131
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.256
Don't tell me…

132
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.968
Is it the professor in charge of me?

133
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.844
Professor Choi Seung-hi?

134
00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:16.597
Mom…

135
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.226
That's why you wanted me
to switch doctors? Right?

136
00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.521
The truth is…

137
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:24.730
I'm sorry, Mother.

138
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.274
What I did is unforgivable.

139
00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:43.583
These are the medicine
and expensive cosmetics

140
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.751
that your mother gave to me as gifts.

141
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:46.669
Take them back.

142
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.005
But the cosmetics did nothing wrong--

143
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.298
I thought it was strange

144
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.383
when your mother started
giving me expensive gifts

145
00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.677
because she never did
anything like that before.

146
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.389
But now I know
that she bought these things for me

147
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.058
because she felt guilty
about what her son had done.

148
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.313
Do you think I can take
and use these knowing that?

149
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.398
Mom.

150
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.734
Mom, don't worry too much.

151
00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:13.654
We'll resolve all this one way or another.

152
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.198
Exactly how will you resolve this?

153
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.451
I'm mad at you too.

154
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.870
You had surgery and barely survived.

155
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.788
Why would you keep this bottled up?

156
00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.542
You work in the same place as that woman!

157
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.795
You must have felt such fury
every single day!

158
00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.182
Fine.

159
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:45.853
It's pointless for me to say
what's right and wrong now.

160
00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.397
But, In-ho.

161
00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:50.399
Yes, Mother.

162
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.111
People can make mistakes
and do the wrong thing.

163
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:55.988
But…

164
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.075
what separates humans from animals

165
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.454
is that humans can repent for their sins
and ask for forgiveness.

166
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.582
No matter what happens between you two,

167
00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.044
you should sincerely ask my daughter,
whom you've hurt, for forgiveness.

168
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.967
Mother, what I did was wrong.

169
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.888
I'll spend the rest of my life
reflecting and asking for forgiveness.

170
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.974
Please help her change her mind.

171
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:26.394
She wants to divorce me.

172
00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.147
That matter is up to you two.

173
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.154
Get up. I have to go to the hospital.

174
00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.991
Go to the hospital?

175
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.327
I have to go to the hospital
and get my things!

176
00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:01.637
Mom, you can't be discharged right now.
Let's go tomorrow.

177
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.305
You deal with the procedures.

178
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.517
I want to sleep comfortably
in my own home.

179
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.061
Let's hear the results
before you get discharged.

180
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.980
If you were me,
would you want to stay here?

181
00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.531
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

182
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.908
Right now?

183
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.077
The patient's brain MRI came out.

184
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.413
She had a headache for two months, right?

185
00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:28.372
Yes, that's right.

186
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.999
If you look at the image,

187
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.668
it's white to the right
of the middle cerebral artery.

188
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.171
A cerebral infarction occurred
as the blood wasn't able to flow there.

189
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.883
If you look at the start
of the right internal carotid artery

190
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.720
and the left vertebral artery,
both show signs of stenosis.

191
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:45.514
But thankfully, fibrinolytic therapy
can be done right away.

192
00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.224
And we want to proceed immediately.

193
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.851
Yes, okay.

194
00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:58.777
Doctor.

195
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.029
You must've been worried.

196
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.198
All the blood clots were broken down well.

197
00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.534
She can get better right away,
but it can differ for each case.

198
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.829
We'll follow up on her vitals
and symptoms in the ICU

199
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.040
and monitor her progress
through imaging tests.

200
00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.249
I see.

201
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.543
Thank you, Professor.

202
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.461
Sure.

203
00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.228
Mom.

204
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:33.896
Is it okay?

205
00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.565
Yes, of course.

206
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.651
It's okay. You did well.

207
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:39.568
Okay?

208
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:24.029
CHOI SEUNG-HI
IN OFFICE

209
00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:12.536
PATIENT NAME: OH DEOK-RYE
DIAGNOSIS: RA (RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS)

210
00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:34.058
Ms. Oh Deok-rye received
many localized injections in her joints

211
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.352
and was admitted
after visiting many departments.

212
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.146
But she's very depressed
as her pain still hasn't improved.

213
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.231
Dr. Cha must be very worried.

214
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.983
What on earth is the issue?

215
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:46.195
She has pain in both shoulders,
her neck, and thighs.

216
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.864
She has severe early morning stiffness
that makes it hard to move.

217
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:49.990
She can't climb stairs either.

218
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:54.703
Over six months, she had six kilograms of
weight loss, hot flashes, and asthenia,

219
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.414
so she was diagnosed
and treated for rheumatoid arthritis.

220
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.041
But there was no improvement.

221
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.126
Are there no issues with her labs
and image tests?

222
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.672
Her ESR and CRP levels have gone up.
Her tumor markers are normal.

223
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:08.342
And her ANA, RF, and Anti-CCP are too.

224
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.552
Her electromyography
and electroneurography tests,

225
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.846
and even her WBBS have normal results.

226
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.392
Has she taken fibromyalgia
or psychiatric medication?

227
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.186
Yes, but there was very little effect.

228
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.399
All her neurological exams show
no issue either.

229
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.530
Mom.

230
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.991
What are you doing? Why are you packing?

231
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:33.701
I told you I'm going home.

232
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.661
Why should I stay here?

233
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.788
You have to be treated!

234
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:39.540
Who said I wasn't going to be treated?

235
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:41.041
There are hospitals everywhere.

236
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.962
How could I get treated by those bastards
who hurt my daughter?

237
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.549
Mom, please. Don't be like this.

238
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:49.800
-Please, Mom.
-Move.

239
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.594
-Mom, don't do this!
-Move!

240
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.433
Let go.

241
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.811
Your daughter is a doctor
at this hospital!

242
00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:06.191
Mom.

243
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:10.571
You can be treated
at a different hospital…

244
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:12.740
but I…

245
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:15.701
I…

246
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.871
I don't want you to be sick
somewhere without me.

247
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.915
I don't want to even imagine it!

248
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:28.338
Mom, I can't fix your illness,

249
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:31.341
but at the very least,
I can be with you here.

250
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.095
If I'm not with you…

251
00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.266
You're just going to say
you're okay again!

252
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:49.151
Stop crying, you're an adult.

253
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.823
I don't want you to be sick.

254
00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:59.036
You know I'm not just saying this, right?

255
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:01.872
Gusan University Hospital
is the best in the country.

256
00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:04.875
Of course I know.
After all, my daughter works here.

257
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.544
And…

258
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.130
And what?

259
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:23.060
I get an employee discount here.

260
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.524
Jeez!

261
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.650
Goodness.

262
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.693
Unbelievable.

263
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:37.324
Mom, you should get treated
and get better quickly, okay?

264
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.787
You know that
you're all that I have, right?

265
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.416
Let's get you better soon, okay?

266
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.516
Come in.

267
00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.275
What can I…

268
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:18.991
Hello.

269
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.958
What brings you here?

270
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.759
I don't have a lot of time,
so maybe next time--

271
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.219
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.804
For what?

273
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:43.390
For causing Eun-seo's arm injury.

274
00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:48.228
I heard she can't go to the art school
she wants to this year.

275
00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.898
You should apologize to Eun-seo.

276
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.608
I'll apologize to her too.

277
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:55.027
I will.

278
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.988
But I came here to ask a favor.

279
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.909
-A favor?
-Please break up with my father.

280
00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:05.537
I know you came first before my mom.

281
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.290
Eun-seo told me everything.

282
00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:11.335
And asked me to give my dad to her.

283
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:14.630
My dad

284
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.715
may not be a perfect father.

285
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.052
But still,
I'm scared of losing him entirely.

286
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.598
I'm not expecting this favor for free.

287
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:26.391
I'll receive punishment too.

288
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.560
I'll give up

289
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:30.145
on art school…

290
00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:34.149
just like Eun-seo.

291
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:36.818
And…

292
00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:39.404
please save my grandmother too.

293
00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:47.913
I-rang.

294
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.666
Your hair has grown so much.

295
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.044
You look like a grown woman.

296
00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.130
Grandma, I'm all grown up now.

297
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.800
Jeez, as if.

298
00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:01.718
You're still a baby in my eyes.

299
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.806
-Come here.
-I said I'm all grown up.

300
00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.062
I-rang.

301
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.983
When you were four or five,

302
00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:21.989
I would pick you up from daycare,
and you would come running to me.

303
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:24.783
You would scream "Grandma!"
and plop into my arms.

304
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.368
Goodness.

305
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:31.039
You were so pretty then,
I thought my heart would burst.

306
00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:35.460
Even now, my heart feels soft and fuzzy

307
00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.298
whenever I think of that moment.

308
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.050
I-rang.

309
00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.805
I wasn't able to raise your mother

310
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:51.560
with the same care
and love as you received.

311
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.148
So make sure you give your mom
all the love you can.

312
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.775
Okay, I will.

313
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.154
Gosh.

314
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:06.700
Are you being cute only to Grandma again?

315
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.370
Grandma's sick.
Hurry up and get down from there.

316
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.457
Mom, Grandma said I was prettier than you.

317
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:19.713
-Mom, did you really say that?
-Jeez, pay no attention to it.

318
00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:22.215
How could you say that?
Your daughter should be prettier.

319
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:23.175
Look.

320
00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:24.593
You're scaring me.

321
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.729
Aren't you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

322
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.814
Do you have time right now?

323
00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:43.779
It's so comfortable to move around
sitting like this.

324
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.283
You should get better soon and walk.

325
00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:51.620
I don't like pushing you around
in a wheelchair.

326
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.081
Jeong-suk.

327
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.124
Yes?

328
00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:58.752
The stars are so pretty.

329
00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:04.883
They really are.

330
00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:12.516
Don't consider your life
to be too miserable.

331
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:17.020
Life can't only be filled
with good things.

332
00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:23.443
You have Jung-min and I-rang.

333
00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:27.155
And after going in circles,
you became a doctor again.

334
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.699
Right.

335
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:34.621
If I died now,
I wouldn't be too sad about it

336
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:38.083
I'll be going
after seeing so many good things.

337
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:39.709
I mean it.

338
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:57.018
What?

339
00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.521
Did we turn off the lights?

340
00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:00.480
Did we?

341
00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:04.401
-Ta-da.
-Grandma.

342
00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:05.485
You startled me.

343
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.865
What is this? It's not even my birthday.

344
00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.408
Are parties only for birthdays?

345
00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:13.535
We prepared this so you can smile.

346
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.123
Ta-da! There are presents too.

347
00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:21.793
My goodness.

348
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.336
These are all so expensive.

349
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.338
Where did you kids get the money for this?

350
00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:27.257
I saved up my allowance.

351
00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:30.635
When I would play house with you
when I was young,

352
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.388
I remember you saying
you wanted a trench coat

353
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.308
and a pretty handbag
like the one Audrey Hepburn wore.

354
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:40.020
Jung-min bought the handbag.

355
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:44.858
We played house
before you went to elementary school.

356
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.067
You remembered that?

357
00:24:46.943 --> 00:24:48.028
Gosh.

358
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.822
Who do you two take after
to be this smart?

359
00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.490
What do you mean by who?

360
00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:53.909
They take after their mother.

361
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:56.953
Grandma, the candles.

362
00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:03.335
You must be so happy, Mom.

363
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:10.383
OH DEOK-RYE

364
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.137
It's so pretty.

365
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:15.680
Mom, look.

366
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:20.143
I picked them out.

367
00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.740
MY DAUGHTER EUN-SEO
MOM, WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

368
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.951
I HAVE A LOT OF MATERIALS TO LOOK OVER
SO I'LL BE LATE

369
00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.494
DON'T WAIT FOR ME AND GO TO BED

370
00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:22.914
I LOVE YOU, MY DAUGHTER

371
00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:00.780
Jeong-suk.

372
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.118
Ma'am.

373
00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:06.411
Gosh.

374
00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:09.581
You must be busy.
Why did you come all the way here?

375
00:29:09.664 --> 00:29:10.540
Ma'am.

376
00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:13.168
Please don't say that.
Of course I should come.

377
00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:16.755
It's tough, isn't it?

378
00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:18.047
No, it's fine.

379
00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:19.966
You didn't have to buy all this.

380
00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:33.813
Your mom looks so gaunt.

381
00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.274
No diagnosis yet?

382
00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:38.943
They're doing various tests.

383
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.070
I'm looking into it too.

384
00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.072
But it's not easy.

385
00:29:44.073 --> 00:29:44.908
Jeong-suk.

386
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:47.577
My brother's friend is a professor

387
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.496
in the Neurology Department
at Aseong Hospital.

388
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:52.248
How about you take your mother there?

389
00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:53.708
Aseong Hospital?

390
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.669
How is their Neurology Department?

391
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:59.047
What's there to say?
It's the best in the country.

392
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:03.051
I know you want to keep your mom
by your side,

393
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.678
but her treatment takes the top priority.

394
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.598
Think about it
if there's no progress here.

395
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:11.976
I'll ask that professor
to pay special attention to your mother.

396
00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.030
Yes, Chief.

397
00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:27.158
Ms. Oh Deok-rye?

398
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.786
I'll go over right away.

399
00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:37.752
Dr. Cha.

400
00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:41.673
I have to tell you something
about your mother.

401
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.424
You can tell me here.

402
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.970
I did a biopsy
after discussing Ms. Oh's condition

403
00:30:47.053 --> 00:30:49.305
with professors in the Rheumatology
and Neurosurgery Departments.

404
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:51.224
Based on the biopsy
of her temporal artery,

405
00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:53.977
there was large cell infiltration
and intimal hyperplasia.

406
00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.145
It's giant cell arteritis.

407
00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:58.189
Your mother has no risk factors,

408
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.316
but the GCA caused
her cerebral infarction.

409
00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:05.029
My diagnosis is that your mother is
suffering from polymyalgia rheumatica.

410
00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.157
I heard she's moving hospitals.

411
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.995
Even if she does,
have prednisone administered to her first.

412
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:15.123
Even better, have her treated here.

413
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:18.376
Not only is she your mother,

414
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.670
but also she's my patient.

415
00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:30.638
Also,

416
00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.308
take care of your own health too.

417
00:31:34.267 --> 00:31:35.351
You don't look well.

418
00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:16.517
Hello.

419
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.611
Gosh, Dr. Cha. You're here too.

420
00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.782
Ms. Oh Deok-rye,
how are you feeling today?

421
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:33.493
I feel so much better than before.

422
00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:35.703
My shoulder barely hurts,

423
00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:39.165
and I have enough strength in my legs
to go on walks.

424
00:32:39.248 --> 00:32:41.334
Thank you so much, Professor.

425
00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:44.629
It's Professor Choi here
who you should be thanking.

426
00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:47.465
Professor Choi worked hard on this.

427
00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:50.051
We'll monitor you for a few days.

428
00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.678
You can be discharged afterward.

429
00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:55.348
-Okay.
-Thank you for being so considerate.

430
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:56.933
Dr. Cha, you have gone through a lot.

431
00:32:57.684 --> 00:32:59.102
You can relax now.

432
00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.103
Goodbye, ma'am.

433
00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:20.081
What is it?

434
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:24.585
Thank you…

435
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.673
for treating my mother.

436
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:32.969
But that doesn't mean I forgive you.

437
00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:34.512
No.

438
00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:36.973
I can't forgive you.

439
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:40.476
But still, I'm grateful for what you did.

440
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:43.354
I thought I should say thank you.

441
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:49.318
I-rang came to see me.

442
00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:55.408
She said she was sorry
she injured Eun-seo.

443
00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:59.370
And she said she'd give up
on art school this year too.

444
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:03.458
Tell her to go to the school she wants.

445
00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:07.670
And she doesn't have to feel guilty
about Eun-seo anymore.

446
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:12.008
We…

447
00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.179
hurt our kids too much.

448
00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.876
Something feels ominous.

449
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.057
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

450
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.266
SEO IN-HO, CHA JEONG-SUK

451
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:05.311
What is this?

452
00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:06.437
Isn't it obvious?

453
00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:08.147
It's a divorce application.

454
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:10.983
Having it by mutual agreement
is better than going to trial, right?

455
00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:14.987
I'll text you the necessary paperwork,
so let me know when you're ready.

456
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.573
I can go by myself to turn in the papers.

457
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:20.159
How can you just act as you please?

458
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.120
A divorce can't be done alone.

459
00:35:22.203 --> 00:35:24.747
I won't cooperate
if you'll do things however you want!

460
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:26.749
I mean,

461
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:31.546
do you really have to do this
when your mother is still recovering?

462
00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:34.048
Yes, I need to do this.

463
00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:39.053
This divorce has become more urgent
and important to me than anything else.

464
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:39.971
My daughter.

465
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:45.560
Your daughters are suffering.

466
00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.688
The kids are in pain because of us.

467
00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:52.817
My mother is recovering,

468
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.028
and I don't want to use anything else
as an excuse to delay this.

469
00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:57.196
I want to end things quickly.

470
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.656
I refuse to get divorced!

471
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:01.325
So if you want a divorce,

472
00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:04.996
you can take this to court.

473
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.044
I'm appalled at your audacity.

474
00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:15.590
You're the spouse at fault!
You're the one who's causing the divorce!

475
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.925
That's why I got down on my knees
and apologized!

476
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.760
And I'm trying my best to please you!

477
00:36:21.053 --> 00:36:22.263
If you take this to court…

478
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.933
I'm going to stop the divorce,

479
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:28.352
even if I have to spend my entire fortune.

480
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:53.836
What are you doing here?

481
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.882
We used to come here
to avoid meeting our co-workers.

482
00:36:57.965 --> 00:36:58.966
I know.

483
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.052
You said you'd do everything
you can for your wife,

484
00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:03.471
so why did you come to a place
we often went together?

485
00:37:04.972 --> 00:37:06.474
I just came.

486
00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:14.607
What do you expect me to do
when my legs just brought me here?

487
00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.405
I mean,

488
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.616
what is going on?

489
00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:26.661
You're treating me to drinks
at a place like this?

490
00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.580
Jeez, do you have to pay all the time?

491
00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:32.792
I wanted to treat you once too.

492
00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:35.086
Cheers.

493
00:37:36.212 --> 00:37:40.758
Jeez, I guess you're feeling relaxed
now that your mother is recovering.

494
00:37:42.134 --> 00:37:44.929
Maybe it's because of that,
but I feel like I'm in a hurry.

495
00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:46.013
What?

496
00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:49.141
I told In-ho that I want a divorce.

497
00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:50.184
Really?

498
00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.812
I gave him the papers.

499
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:54.772
What did he say?

500
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.150
He doesn't want a divorce

501
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.069
and told me to go to court.

502
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.488
Is he crazy?

503
00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:04.699
I'm sorry!

504
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:08.995
Seung-hi, I'm really sorry.
I deserve to die.

505
00:38:10.162 --> 00:38:10.997
Right?

506
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:13.416
Please be quiet.

507
00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.922
My life has been…

508
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.592
like a shirt that I buttoned up wrong
from the very start.

509
00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:28.764
These buttons.

510
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:31.392
They were fastened onto you,

511
00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:33.853
but I mistakenly
fastened them onto Jeong-suk.

512
00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:39.233
I tried to unbutton and button them again.
And then I kept trying.

513
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:41.694
But in the end,

514
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.114
all the buttons fell off.

515
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.660
This is all my fault though, right?

516
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.120
At least you know that.

517
00:38:51.203 --> 00:38:55.124
But now she's asking for a divorce?

518
00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:56.459
A divorce!

519
00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:00.546
How could she do that to me?

520
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.550
I didn't do everything right.

521
00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:06.886
But…

522
00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:09.263
I even got on my knees

523
00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.308
and begged her to forgive me.

524
00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.145
You got on your knees?

525
00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:17.730
Yes!

526
00:39:17.813 --> 00:39:19.523
Why are you telling me this?

527
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.118
Drink slowly.

528
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.496
Sure.

529
00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.749
It's fine to start a new life.

530
00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:39.877
There are plenty of better fish
in the sea.

531
00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:42.838
Once you let go of Seo In-ho,
you can reel in Roy Kim.

532
00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:46.092
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

533
00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:48.260
What do you mean by nonsense?

534
00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:49.678
I have reasonable suspicion.

535
00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:53.349
Hey, in what way or form
is that reasonable?

536
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:56.268
Did he confess
that he liked me or something?

537
00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:57.395
Jeez.

538
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.026
Okay, now it's your turn to talk.

539
00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:07.446
About Jeong-suk.

540
00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.116
I…

541
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:17.456
No.

542
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:20.126
Not really.

543
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:21.585
Well.

544
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.505
He didn't say that.

545
00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:28.884
But do you really have
no feelings for him?

546
00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:30.594
Hey.

547
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.806
I don't have the energy
to think about that right now.

548
00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:35.224
My mother is sick.

549
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.560
I'm about to get a divorce.

550
00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:40.646
My daughter is in 12th grade. I'm working.

551
00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:43.149
My mind is all over the place.

552
00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:46.569
But if you get a divorce,
will you really be okay

553
00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.864
seeing Seo In-ho and Choi Seung-hi
live a good life together?

554
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.286
Can the two of them…

555
00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:59.039
really live a good life together?

556
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.001
If I were Seung-hi,

557
00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:06.380
I think I'd finally see things
for what they really are.

558
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.302
Say there is a limited edition handbag
you really want

559
00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:14.096
and you're really
anxious about it selling out.

560
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.098
But once you actually
get your hands on it,

561
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:19.727
that feeling of happiness
doesn't last long.

562
00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:23.022
You just put it away in your closet
and forget about it.

563
00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:24.106
That's true.

564
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.024
Come on!

565
00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:28.360
Hey, a handbag isn't
the same thing as a man.

566
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:31.780
It's different.

567
00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:33.365
A handbag is better.

568
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:35.451
Cheers.

569
00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:48.881
Pull yourself together.

570
00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:01.101
Get up.

571
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:04.146
Get up!

572
00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.943
I said get up!

573
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:11.904
I can't believe this.

574
00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:16.116
Come on, one, two.

575
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.366
-Did you call a designated driver?
-I called one earlier.

576
00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:58.993
Go first.

577
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:02.371
I'll walk a bit and take a taxi.

578
00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:03.330
Okay.

579
00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:06.125
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

580
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:07.459
Jeong-suk.

581
00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:16.885
Don't worry.

582
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:20.472
Go.

583
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.641
-Bye.
-Bye.

584
00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:24.435
-Don't trip and fall.
-I get it.

585
00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:27.938
-Get home safely.
-I told you, I get it!

586
00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:41.869
It's nice that you two have a place to go
even if you go your separate ways.

587
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.706
Seo In-ho can go to Choi Seung-hi.

588
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:49.835
And Cha Jeong-suk can go to Roy.

589
00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:54.298
No.

590
00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:57.134
Not really.

591
00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:58.927
Really?

592
00:44:00.346 --> 00:44:02.306
I know that my feelings right now

593
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.726
could cause trouble for Dr. Cha.

594
00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.062
So right now…

595
00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:10.648
it's a no.

596
00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:14.026
Let's just say I feigned ignorance
and said, "No."

597
00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:19.907
That's scarier than saying you like her.

598
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:30.959
I'm lonely.

599
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:32.044
So lonely.

600
00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.712
I need another drink.

601
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:30.185
PROFESSOR PARK HO-WON

602
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:35.149
<c.bg_transparent><i>Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to voicemail…</i></c.bg_transparent>

603
00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.401
Did he take my money and go off the grid?

604
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.154
It's unfair that
I'm being labeled an adulteress.

605
00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:41.238
Now my money's gone too.

606
00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.324
Wait, do I have to report this
to the police?

607
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:54.042
Mother, you're up early.

608
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:56.253
Why did you stay out without calling?

609
00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:58.255
Were you in surgery all night?

610
00:45:58.338 --> 00:46:00.591
Yes, I had a difficult patient.

611
00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:02.801
Hey.

612
00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:06.305
This came from the court. What is it?

613
00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:07.473
The court?

614
00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:09.183
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
TO SEO IN-HO

615
00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:14.313
DIVORCE PETITION

616
00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:16.523
Oh, my. Is this a divorce petition?

617
00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:19.318
For crying out loud!

618
00:46:19.902 --> 00:46:21.403
Are you two really getting divorced?

619
00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:24.573
What have you been doing this whole time?
You should have won her back by now!

620
00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:27.117
You'll be the death of me.

621
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:33.373
So this is how our family gets destroyed.

622
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:43.550
What on earth is this?
What is the meaning of this?

623
00:46:44.092 --> 00:46:45.093
You know what it is.

624
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.306
How could you send me a divorce petition

625
00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:51.266
after asking me
to divorce by mutual agreement?

626
00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:55.187
Are you really going
to end things with me?

627
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.231
Do you want it so badly?

628
00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:00.567
I wanted to end things quietly
with a divorce by mutual agreement.

629
00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:02.903
But you refused.

630
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.029
You told me to go to court.

631
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.573
I expected that, so I prepared in advance.

632
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.910
Did you think I really meant that?
I said it because I didn't want a divorce!

633
00:47:11.286 --> 00:47:13.830
Seriously, do you not know
how to read between the lines?

634
00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:17.793
I'm trying to tell you that
I'm determined to get this divorce.

635
00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:25.300
What's the real reason…

636
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:29.680
you want to get divorced this badly?

637
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.764
What does that mean?

638
00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.933
Is it because of that punk?

639
00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.893
Roy Kimberley?

640
00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:37.980
Don't get ahead of yourself.

641
00:47:38.063 --> 00:47:40.357
Do you think
that decent young man is into you?

642
00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:43.652
My gosh.

643
00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:45.696
Jeez.

644
00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.949
You're the most pathetic loser
I've ever seen.

645
00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.243
Thank you so much for helping me

646
00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:53.662
get rid of the little affection
I had left for you.

647
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.206
Jeez.

648
00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.626
You can't just leave like this.

649
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.003
We're not done talking!

650
00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:11.471
Ms. Park, can I please have
Shin Gyu-seon's chart?

651
00:48:13.015 --> 00:48:14.141
One moment.

652
00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.060
Hello?

653
00:48:17.144 --> 00:48:20.856
<c.bg_transparent><i>Hello? This is the Seocho Police Station's
Women's and Juvenile Affairs Division.</i></c.bg_transparent>

654
00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.566
Is this Roy Kimberley?

655
00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.360
I called to give you good news.

656
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.237
Good news?

657
00:48:32.492 --> 00:48:33.619
Dr. Cha!

658
00:48:37.539 --> 00:48:39.041
Did something good happen?

659
00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:40.042
Yes.

660
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:42.502
And I wanted to tell you first.

661
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:45.297
Really?

662
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.007
You really found your family?

663
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.675
I can't believe this.

664
00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:51.762
So are you going to meet your family?

665
00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:52.846
Yes.

666
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:57.267
They say I have an older brother
and older sisters.

667
00:48:57.851 --> 00:48:58.977
I see.

668
00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:03.273
They raised them, so I wonder why
they put me up for adoption.

669
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:11.615
I heard that families
with financial difficulties back then

670
00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:15.285
would sometimes
put their youngest up for adoption.

671
00:49:15.827 --> 00:49:18.413
That way, they would go to college
in a good environment.

672
00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:21.083
What's the point of a good environment
if there are no parents?

673
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.877
And I don't understand
the point of college either.

674
00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:29.383
But I still want to meet them.

675
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:33.804
-I'm curious.
-Yes, you should meet them.

676
00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.222
But…

677
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.392
don't have high expectations.

678
00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.936
No expectations. I'll keep that in mind.

679
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.147
But, Dr. Cha,

680
00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:46.900
I have a favor to ask.

681
00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:47.901
What is it?

682
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:49.861
When I go to meet my family,

683
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:53.490
can you come with me?

684
00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.953
I know you're having a hard time lately,
but please come with me.

685
00:49:58.036 --> 00:49:58.954
I'm really nervous,

686
00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:00.789
to be honest.

687
00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:11.508
Excuse me.
How do I apply for a leave of absence?

688
00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:13.093
Is something wrong?

689
00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:17.723
I'm planning to enlist,
so I just want to look into it first.

690
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.766
You'll have a hard time if you enlist now.

691
00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.309
You should finish your residency first.

692
00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.946
What did you just say?

693
00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.948
Say it again slowly.

694
00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:38.702
I'm going to the military.

695
00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:41.580
I won't ask you to wait for me.

696
00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:43.582
I thought you were going
after your residency.

697
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.126
I need some time to think.

698
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.962
It's not just
because of Ms. Yoo Ji-seon's incident.

699
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.424
I want to find a specialty that fits me.

700
00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.886
I just came to the Surgery Department
because of my father.

701
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:56.803
Sure.

702
00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.847
That's your decision,
so that's fine by me.

703
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.474
But are you breaking up with me?

704
00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.350
I never said that.

705
00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:05.812
I'm just saying
you don't have to wait for me.

706
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.565
Hey, be more honest.

707
00:51:08.648 --> 00:51:10.275
Would you be happy
if I date some other guy?

708
00:51:10.358 --> 00:51:11.485
Of course I'd hate it.

709
00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:12.903
Then tell me to wait for you!

710
00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:15.155
Make it clear.

711
00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:19.576
Okay.

712
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.661
Then wait for me.

713
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:24.498
You better not date some other guy.

714
00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:34.216
Hey.

715
00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:35.467
They're all staring.

716
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:55.779
This is crazy.

717
00:52:01.576 --> 00:52:03.954
-You can do it exactly like this.
-Yes, okay.

718
00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:06.081
Dr. Cha, your mother
is being discharged today, right?

719
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.040
Yes.

720
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:10.877
Thank you so much for taking care
of my mother this whole time.

721
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.462
Gosh, it was nothing.

722
00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:15.131
We're glad that she's going home healthy.

723
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:17.926
-Aren't you going to her room?
-I was going to go now.

724
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:19.761
-Have a good day.
-You too.

725
00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:23.265
Mom.

726
00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:24.808
Mom.

727
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:38.780
MY DAUGHTER

728
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.366
Thanks to you, I'm being discharged.

729
00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:42.951
Yes.

730
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.746
Thank you for making me better
when no one else could.

731
00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:51.376
I thought I was going to wither away
and die like this.

732
00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.796
But it feels like
I'm finally living again.

733
00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:00.594
I came to give you this before I leave.

734
00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:04.264
It's not filled with money,

735
00:53:05.098 --> 00:53:06.391
so don't get your hopes up.

736
00:53:33.501 --> 00:53:34.419
TO DOCTOR CHOI SEUNG-HI…

737
00:53:34.502 --> 00:53:36.671
When I looked at you, for a moment,

738
00:53:36.755 --> 00:53:40.342
<c.bg_transparent><i>I felt sympathy and affection for you
like a daughter.</i></c.bg_transparent>

739
00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:44.763
<c.bg_transparent><i>Though I can no longer look at you
with affection,</i></c.bg_transparent>

740
00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.223
I still feel that sympathy.

741
00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:53.480
The way I see the world has changed a bit

742
00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:56.691
after suffering from a serious illness.

743
00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:00.487
Before, my daily life seemed like nothing,

744
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.324
but now, it feels so dear and precious.

745
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:17.837
Mom, do you want some water?

746
00:54:19.547 --> 00:54:24.970
<c.bg_transparent><i>So I want to live whatever life
I have left as a kinder person.</i></c.bg_transparent>

747
00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:29.182
<c.bg_transparent><i>It may be late,
but that's what I've decided to do.</i></c.bg_transparent>

748
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:38.108
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm saying this to you
as a fellow woman and mother.</i></c.bg_transparent>

749
00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:45.365
<c.bg_transparent><i>Do not abandon your chance
to become a good person and mother.</i></c.bg_transparent>

750
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:55.083
<c.bg_transparent><i>From now on,
live an honorable life for yourself.</i></c.bg_transparent>

751
00:54:56.001 --> 00:55:01.673
That is when you'll find real happiness.

752
00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:20.442
Are you very nervous?

753
00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:25.238
I am.

754
00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:29.242
Thank you

755
00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.995
for coming with me today.

756
00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:36.041
Let's say I was building rapport.

757
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:40.045
You can come in now.
Your family is waiting.

758
00:55:40.628 --> 00:55:41.463
Okay.

759
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.388
I hope you have a good time with them.

760
00:55:50.472 --> 00:55:51.681
I'll be waiting here.

761
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.725
-Okay.
-Good luck.

762
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.071
I'm nervous.

763
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:24.923
Hello.

764
00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:27.926
-My name is Roy.
-It's nice to meet you.

765
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.261
Please have a seat.

766
00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:37.852
This is our father.

767
00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:42.398
This is my younger sister,
and over there is my younger brother.

768
00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.068
Nice to meet you all.

769
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.612
You grew up well.

770
00:56:47.695 --> 00:56:49.322
You grew up to be a good man.

771
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.491
I hear you're a doctor.

772
00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:52.909
Yes.

773
00:56:52.992 --> 00:56:56.121
The only good thing that woman did

774
00:56:56.204 --> 00:56:58.039
was to die early.

775
00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:02.752
If you were raised by your mother,
you would've ended up dirt poor.

776
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:03.837
Father.

777
00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.881
Why would you say that here?

778
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.012
I'll be straightforward.

779
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:16.933
Since you're a doctor,
you'll find it easy to understand.

780
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:21.271
The reason we found you
was because of our father.

781
00:57:22.063 --> 00:57:26.109
Our father has acute leukemia.

782
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:28.403
So…

783
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.115
we need someone
who can do a bone marrow transplant.

784
00:58:04.063 --> 00:58:05.398
Did you have a good meeting?

785
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:08.735
Yes.

786
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:12.947
I wanted to meet my mother…

787
00:58:15.783 --> 00:58:17.243
but she had already passed away.

788
00:58:18.703 --> 00:58:19.537
I see.

789
00:58:22.123 --> 00:58:24.000
How were your other family members?

790
00:58:24.584 --> 00:58:26.377
Did they look a lot like you?

791
00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:50.109
-Are you going straight to the hospital?
-I should.

792
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:51.736
What about you?

793
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:52.946
Yes, me too.

794
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.781
Then should we grab a taxi?

795
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:56.824
Okay.

796
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:06.000
Professor Kim.

797
00:59:07.126 --> 00:59:09.379
Do you want to run to the hospital?

798
00:59:10.838 --> 00:59:11.673
From here?

799
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.091
Wait.

800
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.471
It's 9.8km to the hospital from here.

801
00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.807
That's a distance we can run, right?

802
00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.852
But I don't have my running shoes.

803
00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:30.316
They're the same design.

804
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.234
They are.

805
00:59:31.985 --> 00:59:34.237
-Are our tastes similar?
-Are they?

806
00:59:36.364 --> 00:59:38.116
Shall we start running then?

807
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:39.617
Shall we?

808
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.453
You look really tired.

809
01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.122
Yes.

810
01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:29.000
I did some running yesterday,
so I'm really tired.

811
01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:32.503
You should work hard to stay in shape,
with your age and all.

812
01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:34.047
Tell me about it.

813
01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:38.217
Right. Dr. Cha, did you know
you are the Resident of the Month?

814
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.345
What?

815
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.764
Me?

816
01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.689
BEST MEDICAL PERSONNEL OF THE MONTH
DR. CHA JEONG-SUK, FAMILY MEDICINE

817
01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:04.994
This is the best.

818
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.121
Thank you.

819
01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.124
Do it as fast as you can.

820
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.252
I have neglected myself.

821
01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:39.672
<c.bg_transparent><i>Did you contribute even a single thing
to the creation of these assets?</i></c.bg_transparent>

822
01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.841
Did you not know your wife was ill?

823
01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.218
I don't need your liver.

824
01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.262
You should give me at least one chance.

825
01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:49.974
<c.bg_transparent><i>It seems Professor Roy
has decided to donate his liver.</i></c.bg_transparent>

826
01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.727
I'm giving her my liver.
So why are you butting in here?

827
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.812
Make your choice.
