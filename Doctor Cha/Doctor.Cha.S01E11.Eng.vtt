00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.839
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.716
Something's wrong,

3
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.468
isn't it?

4
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.137
Yes.

5
00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.347
Something's wrong

6
00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.683
but I can't even believe it

7
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.519
because it feels too unreal.

8
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.025
I think I know what it is.

9
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.985
No.

10
00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.738
You really don't know.

11
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.324
I think I know what it is!

12
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.708
You want to kill those two bastards.

13
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.769
Professor Seo is cheating on you!

14
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.734
It's raining!

15
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.570
Hurry up and close it.

16
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.531
My goodness!

17
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.491
-Why isn't it working?
-Hurry up!

18
00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.575
I'm trying!

19
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.619
You can't even close
the roof of your own car?

20
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.246
I opened it for the first time today!

21
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.916
What do we do?

22
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:06.417
It's cold!

23
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.546
My goodness!

24
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.473
This isn't the time to be laughing!

25
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.686
It's cold!

26
00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.240
Come on, stop laughing!

27
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.489
How badly did you two fight
to end up like this?

28
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.868
How will you even draw in this state?
Your entrance exams are around the corner!

29
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.916
-What?
-You said you're done letting off steam!

30
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.335
You should've just ignored her,
not fought her!

31
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.378
Are you saying I should've held back
when she grabbed my hair?

32
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:33.880
What?

33
00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.256
Why should I move academies?

34
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.467
She keeps telling me to move!

35
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.761
That brat is treating me
like I'm some home-wrecker too!

36
00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.562
I'm leaving for the day.

37
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.272
-Goodbye.
-Great work today.

38
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.357
Goodbye.

39
00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.405
I-rang.

40
00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.912
EPISODE 11

41
00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.038
Honestly.

42
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.999
Thankfully, I don't think it'll scar.

43
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.877
Are you hurt anywhere else?

44
00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.757
What on earth happened?

45
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.594
Are you getting bullied in school
or something?

46
00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:25.807
You and your friends will be adults soon.
They should know better.

47
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.558
Why would they do this to you?

48
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:28.851
Who did this to you?

49
00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:31.604
-Auntie Mi-hee.
-Yes.

50
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.899
I feel so bad for my mom.

51
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:36.776
Your mom?

52
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.906
MI-HEE:
I-RANG CAME TO VISIT MY CLINIC…

53
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.871
MI-HEE:
I-RANG CAME TO VISIT MY CLINIC

54
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:54.085
I'M GOING TO TAKE HER HOME, SO DON'T WORRY

55
00:04:58.047 --> 00:04:59.340
Who is it?

56
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.890
There's non-alcoholic beer too.

57
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:11.894
On my grandma's birthday,

58
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.065
my family got together for dinner.

59
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.067
It was at a hotel.

60
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.071
And I coincidentally saw
Professor Seo there.

61
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.284
I saw who the other woman was too.

62
00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.127
When I was in middle school,

63
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.922
my father did the same thing.

64
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.385
My mother had depression
after that happened.

65
00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.096
She suffered for more than ten years.

66
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.058
So I kind of know how you feel.

67
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:54.562
Something like this can be so destructive…

68
00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.815
that it can ruin someone.

69
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.737
How was it for you?

70
00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:04.781
Did you wish that

71
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.950
your mother and father would get divorced?

72
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.660
At the time,

73
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.082
I thought Mom's hatred toward Dad
was what kept her going.

74
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.668
If they got divorced,

75
00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:21.339
I thought my mom would lose the only thing
that gave her the will to live.

76
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:22.757
So I told my dad…

77
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.802
that if he divorced my mom,

78
00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.639
I would throw myself from the roof.

79
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.808
I threatened him.

80
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.566
I know you keep to yourself.

81
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.862
So thank you for trying

82
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.281
to comfort me.

83
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.617
I'm not trying to comfort you.

84
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:53.246
It's just…

85
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.581
these things happen.

86
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.085
More often than we think.

87
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.838
Try to get some sleep.

88
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.635
Thank you for the drive today.

89
00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:51.512
Sure.

90
00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:55.808
Actually…

91
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.271
I have something to confess.

92
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.233
The two of you.

93
00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.526
Jung-min.

94
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.112
I know that you're dating

95
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.156
my son.

96
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.367
From the looks of it,

97
00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:16.704
you two suit each other.

98
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.086
COLON AND RECTAL SURGERY SPECIALIST
SEO IN-HO

99
00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:48.004
OUT OF OFFICE

100
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.914
-Please check the consultation request.
-Okay.

101
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.691
Do you think you can work today?

102
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:52.610
I have to.

103
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.406
Working is the only thing
I can do right now.

104
00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:13.672
-You see this, right?
-Yes.

105
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.883
This part seems to be causing the issue.

106
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.721
-You said she draws right?
-Yes.

107
00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.808
Even when she gets out of the cast,
her arm's range of motion can be limited.

108
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.811
And her wrist might not move
the way she wants.

109
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:30.523
It'll take around three to six months

110
00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:32.191
for the nerves to recover.

111
00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:58.884
How would you know that
when you raised your kids in comfort?

112
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.429
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Seung-hi working at our hospital.

113
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:05.891
But I already explained
why I didn't tell you.

114
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:09.061
And I also just learned that I-rang
and Seung-hi's daughter are friends.

115
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.064
Could you tell me
where you bought that bracelet?

116
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.484
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

117
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:46.098
-Where is Choi Seung-hi right now?
-Sorry?

118
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.102
She'll be in the seminar room.
All the professors today…

119
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.939
Didn't she just address her by name only?

120
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.317
I think she said, "Where's Choi Seung-hi?"

121
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.027
Come on, no way.

122
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:04.950
Any updates on the academic research fund
that we applied for?

123
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.870
We plan to apply for a collaborative
multidisciplinary team study.

124
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.705
So we are preparing a joint research plan

125
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.624
with the infectious diseases
and pulmonology departments.

126
00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.335
We'll need to schedule regular meetings.

127
00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:17.213
Sure. Meetings are one thing.

128
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.174
But please share the progress via email…

129
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.762
Yes, what is it?

130
00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:25.846
Professor Choi.

131
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.474
I need a word with you.

132
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.270
If it's not urgent, let's talk later.
I'm in the middle of--

133
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:34.480
It's urgent.

134
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.233
Or shall we talk here?

135
00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.618
-What is it?
-Let's go to your office.

136
00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.088
Tell him to come.

137
00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:01.840
Seo In-ho.

138
00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.385
Did you not hear me?

139
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:05.678
Tell Seo In-ho

140
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.388
to come here.

141
00:14:08.055 --> 00:14:08.931
Right this instant.

142
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:17.439
Call him.

143
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:22.319
Hey.

144
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:25.447
I just finished an outpatient appointment.
I have some time.

145
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:29.451
To your office?

146
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.162
Don't ask and just come.
You'll know when you get here.

147
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:37.835
Come here right now.

148
00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:40.170
Unless you want

149
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.134
the whole hospital to be talking about
your affair with Choi Seung-hi.

150
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:58.439
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

151
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.878
FAMILY MEDICINE SPECIALIST CHOI SEUNG-HI
IN OFFICE

152
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.046
OUT OF OFFICE

153
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.524
-Honey.
-Shut up.

154
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.319
Confirm something for me.

155
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:47.821
I-rang's friend, Eun-seo.

156
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:51.367
Is your daughter

157
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.160
Seo In-ho's daughter?

158
00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:54.703
Honey, the thing is…

159
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.580
That's right. She is In-ho's daughter.

160
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.544
We met coincidentally
at a hospital in Chicago

161
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.046
where In-ho and I trained.

162
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:07.257
Eun-seo was conceived then
and I gave birth to her.

163
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.801
But I didn't keep seeing her.

164
00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:12.346
Three years ago, when Seung-hi came back
to Korea and came to this hospital,

165
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.014
we got close again…

166
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.394
Did you have no one
to share your love story with?

167
00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.145
You two are taking turns talking

168
00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.606
as if you're so eager
to get the next word in.

169
00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.901
Sure, so the two of you

170
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:27.820
are in love?

171
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.199
I hope it lasts forever.

172
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.701
It's not that. The truth is…

173
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:37.830
-We already decided to break up…
-Who said we would?

174
00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:41.208
I don't plan on breaking up.

175
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.172
Whether you two break up

176
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.175
or live together for years on end

177
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.678
has nothing to do with me anymore.

178
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:58.642
I restarted my residency after 20 years,
and I'm going to complete it.

179
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.436
As for you two,

180
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.522
don't disgrace me or my son.

181
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.359
And Choi Seung-hi.

182
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.194
Quit this hospital.

183
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.905
You have other hospitals you can go to.

184
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.657
Don't you come from a rich family?

185
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:19.329
I know that the two of you
have been doing all you can

186
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.206
to get me to quit.

187
00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:25.461
Those cheap tricks
won't work anymore, so you quit.

188
00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.671
You have a month.

189
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.048
Quit within a month

190
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:31.759
and get out of my sight.

191
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:35.512
And you, Seo In-ho!

192
00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:38.849
You lie low and wait.

193
00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:43.020
I'm still thinking about
what I should do with you.

194
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.371
When you said
we should take some time to think,

195
00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.415
I thought you meant we should break up.

196
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.626
I guess that's what you wanted to hear.

197
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:08.670
I guess you were so desperate
for me to give up on you.

198
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.963
It's not that.

199
00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.131
Then going forward…

200
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.301
Do we really need to break up?

201
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.429
I think you'll be a free man at last.

202
00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.059
-A free man?
-Don't you think she'll divorce you soon?

203
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:55.634
This…

204
00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:01.473
How much does I-rang know?

205
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.059
Tell me the truth!

206
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.061
She knows everything.

207
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.733
What about Jung-min?

208
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.361
-He knows.
-What?

209
00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:15.737
Mother knows too.

210
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.831
Look what you've done.

211
00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:28.709
And you dared
to act all high and mighty in front of me

212
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.002
after everything you've done?

213
00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:33.589
My children are so pitiful
to have you as their father, you bastard!

214
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:34.965
Be quiet.

215
00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:37.342
Why did you make a fool out of me
when the whole family already knew?

216
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.802
Why was I the only one who didn't know?

217
00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.387
The kids didn't want you to know!

218
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:50.314
They didn't want you to be in shock
when you haven't fully recovered yet.

219
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.528
Live the rest of your life…

220
00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.740
atoning to the kids.

221
00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.035
You horrible bastard!

222
00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.830
How could you do this?

223
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.750
How could you do this to our kids?

224
00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.890
Dr. Kim, hello.

225
00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:27.184
-You went to see your baby again?
-Yes.

226
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.853
It's a relief that both of you are safe.

227
00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.023
I was really shocked when I heard
you had to give birth right away

228
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:33.941
due to amniorrhexis.

229
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.860
My baby was the one who pulled through.

230
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.404
She's recovering well
like her nickname "Little Miss Strong."

231
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.031
How admirable.

232
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.158
I heard you're being discharged.

233
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:44.618
Yes.

234
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.121
And my baby is going to be discharged
in about two weeks.

235
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:53.043
Are you really just going to leave
without getting treated?

236
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.087
Yes.

237
00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.757
I'll go home,
and my mom will take care of me.

238
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.092
Once the baby comes home,

239
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:04.179
I'll feed it formula,
put it to sleep, and bathe it.

240
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:06.014
That's what I want to do.

241
00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.392
I won't be able to do that
once I start treatment.

242
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.435
There's no hope anyway.

243
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.607
Be good to your mom.
Becoming a mom is hard.

244
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.411
I just visited the baby.

245
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:29.496
She's gotten chubbier since yesterday.

246
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.790
When I called out her nickname,

247
00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:34.543
she looked at me as if she recognized--

248
00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.169
I don't want to hear it. Stop.

249
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.880
No one is happy to see your baby.

250
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:40.632
Mom.

251
00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.055
Stop hating my baby.

252
00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.976
If I'm gone,
all she will have is you and Dad.

253
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.146
You and Dad will have to raise the baby.

254
00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:55.605
You raise the baby.

255
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.233
You're responsible for your child, not me!

256
00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:02.112
You should be the one to do everything
from her 100th-day celebration party

257
00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:04.865
and her first birthday,
to taking her to her first day of school!

258
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.451
If you don't,
I don't want to see that kid.

259
00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:11.538
Okay.

260
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.667
I'll do all of that, okay?

261
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:48.075
Yes, is this Seocho Police Station?

262
00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:51.620
I want to find the family
I was separated from as a child.

263
00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:57.709
How do I register my DNA?

264
00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:11.890
Are you free after work?

265
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:17.813
That's new.

266
00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:23.735
You've never once asked me
if I have time or if I want to meet first.

267
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:27.989
I'm the one who clings to you,
appeases you, and gets upset.

268
00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:31.952
Even when I do that,
you meet me once every five times.

269
00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.580
This doesn't seem like
a normal relationship.

270
00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:36.873
Sure.

271
00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.875
If that's what you think, it must be true.

272
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.671
Being stubborn is in your nature.
Why are you agreeing with me on this?

273
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:47.300
Shouldn't you be lecturing me about
how relationships can differ?

274
00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:50.303
What's the point when things are ending?

275
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.556
But we should
at least end things properly.

276
00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.724
We'll still be seeing each other.

277
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.102
I have something to tell you too.

278
00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:58.728
Let's meet after work.

279
00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.888
D&J
ART ACADEMY

280
00:24:35.682 --> 00:24:36.808
-Seo I-rang.
-Mom!

281
00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:40.979
Were you waiting long?

282
00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:42.814
I didn't wait that long.

283
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.358
You were working so hard.

284
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:46.943
-You saw?
-Of course!

285
00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:49.571
Let's eat something good.

286
00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.281
-Great!
-Great!

287
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:04.920
Do you have something to say?

288
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:11.009
I…

289
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.595
-found out.
-About what?

290
00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:15.263
About Dad.

291
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.227
And about your friend Eun-seo too.

292
00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.319
It must've been so painful.

293
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.030
You couldn't even tell me.

294
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.116
It felt strange.

295
00:25:36.117 --> 00:25:38.328
To find I have a sibling
other than Jung-min.

296
00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.917
There is someone else
in this world who calls my dad "Dad."

297
00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:47.545
And that person is Eun-seo.

298
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.465
I'm sorry

299
00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:54.094
for making you worry about something
other kids don't have to go through.

300
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:57.305
Did you tell Jung-min?

301
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.556
That you know everything?

302
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.559
He is an adult,
so I'm not worried about him.

303
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:04.145
I'm grown up too, so don't worry about me.

304
00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:07.065
And do what you want.

305
00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:08.942
Whatever that may be, I don't care.

306
00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.195
No, I'm okay with it.

307
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:17.492
I feel so reassured

308
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.412
to have you guys.

309
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:25.000
You should hurry up and eat.

310
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:26.876
I'll end up eating everything.

311
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:28.545
I'll eat.

312
00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:30.880
Okay, is the

313
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:32.382
It's good.

314
00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.061
Eun-seo, what's wrong?

315
00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:47.063
How will I take the early admissions exam
with this arm?

316
00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:48.273
There are regular admissions.

317
00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:50.483
You won't be wearing the cast then.

318
00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.445
You really know nothing.

319
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:54.738
For regular admissions,

320
00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:57.574
you can only apply to either
Hanguk University or Hongin University.

321
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:58.950
Then just apply to one.

322
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:01.202
I never pressured you about college.

323
00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.372
Seo I-rang can apply
to both universities, unlike me!

324
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.418
I can't even compete in early admissions,
and I can only apply to one school.

325
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:09.502
Eun-seo.

326
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:12.255
I'd rather die than
go to a less prestigious school than her!

327
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.551
I'll lose some of my touch
after being in a cast for two months.

328
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:18.553
What do I do?

329
00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:24.184
It's okay.

330
00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.186
You won't lose your touch.

331
00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:27.729
You're…

332
00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:29.773
going to do well.

333
00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.442
Why do I have to get things taken away?

334
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.612
From Dad to opportunities.

335
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.989
Why is it always me?

336
00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:53.213
Is there really a need
to meet like this to break up?

337
00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:54.798
I have something to say.

338
00:27:55.382 --> 00:27:56.216
Say it.

339
00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:59.386
I found out that Professor Seo
is having an affair.

340
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:04.099
And I learned that Dr. Cha found out

341
00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.226
about his affair.

342
00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:11.356
It's embarrassing to have found out
all these fine details about your family,

343
00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:13.108
but I thought I should let you know.

344
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:16.820
I thought you should know
if you didn't already.

345
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.863
Did you not know?

346
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:20.824
I knew about my father's affair.

347
00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:26.121
But I didn't know that my mom knew.

348
00:28:27.497 --> 00:28:30.125
-It must be hard for you.
-It's something I have to handle.

349
00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.418
Are you done?

350
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.296
I'll go now.

351
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.720
Seo In-ho, that bastard.

352
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:26.222
He doesn't look like it,

353
00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:31.102
but it seems like he has
incredibly strong instincts to reproduce.

354
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:34.856
If not, how can he maintain two families
and have a secret love child

355
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:36.608
in this day and age?

356
00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:37.942
Sure.

357
00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:40.945
Tell the whole world about
my husband maintaining two families.

358
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.698
What? Do you want me
to give you a loudspeaker?

359
00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:46.409
What on earth do people see in him?

360
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:51.539
What gives him the right
to be loved by two great women?

361
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.292
Is Seo In-ho good in bed?

362
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.086
Jeez, honestly.

363
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.965
What? I need to know that
to explain this fiasco!

364
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:01.966
Hey!

365
00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:07.847
Do you think I'd remember?
We slept in separate rooms for ten years.

366
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:10.600
Right, you're Candy.

367
00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:15.605
So what are you going to do now?

368
00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:17.774
What can I really do?

369
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:20.985
We'll fight and pester each other,

370
00:30:22.403 --> 00:30:24.113
and in the end, we'll get divorced.

371
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.908
And who would benefit from that?

372
00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:32.622
So?

373
00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.707
What will you do now?

374
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:38.503
Are you going to live with Jeong-suk?

375
00:30:38.586 --> 00:30:41.214
Or will you divorce her
and go to that woman?

376
00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:42.549
Not in front of the kids.

377
00:30:42.632 --> 00:30:45.552
We should be aware of your decision too.

378
00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.805
So are you going to marry that woman?

379
00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:50.682
Hey, don't say such nonsense.

380
00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:52.392
You're really the worst.

381
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:56.688
It's better to give up on one side
and devote yourself to the other.

382
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:59.315
This is the worst thing to do to Mom
and that woman.

383
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.943
Unlike what you think,
it's not an easy decision.

384
00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.863
You can't speak so recklessly about
grown-ups' matters.

385
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.739
So are you going to get divorced?

386
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.700
What are you going to do?

387
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:19.752
I…

388
00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:23.673
don't want to get divorced.

389
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:30.722
Try to walk.

390
00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:35.059
This is the first time
I walked out of a bar on my own

391
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.811
because I was embarrassed.

392
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.063
How did you never grow up?

393
00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:40.940
You're the same as you were in college.

394
00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:46.321
Fine, you're the mature one.
You're the true adult here. Happy?

395
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.238
I am!

396
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:49.198
-I'm tired.
-Sit.

397
00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:51.492
Jeez, why did you drink so much?

398
00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.123
Jeong-suk.

399
00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:03.046
I'm surrounded by foolish men like that.

400
00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:06.090
You would think
their wives would not be great, right?

401
00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:09.427
But no, they're all decent.

402
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.432
Do you think those women aren't getting
a divorce because they have no pride?

403
00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:16.809
They just live with it.

404
00:32:17.852 --> 00:32:19.646
You live an exciting life on your own.

405
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:22.482
And you're telling me
not to get a divorce?

406
00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:24.192
My life is lousy.

407
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:28.237
You just don't know how thankful
you should be for that lousy life.

408
00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:29.864
Honestly,

409
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.033
if hell exists,

410
00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:33.952
then that place

411
00:32:35.161 --> 00:32:36.287
would be in here.

412
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:40.458
Anyway, I'm jealous of that too.

413
00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:43.378
So just live your life.

414
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.254
You want me to keep living like this?

415
00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:50.385
I bought you a plant in college
that cost 5,000 won.

416
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:54.097
You still managed to keep it healthy
even after 20 years.

417
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.891
You could never let go
of any relationship you have,

418
00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:58.851
whether it be with a plant
or with an animal.

419
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:00.812
Do you think you can leave Seo In-ho?

420
00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:02.939
Fine.

421
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:05.066
If that makes you happy,

422
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.610
I'll welcome that decision
with my arms and legs--

423
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:09.070
Hey!

424
00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:11.239
-I'll do a shoulder dance too.
-Jeez, honestly.

425
00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:15.201
Still…

426
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:18.579
regardless of everything,

427
00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:21.833
if breaking up is the path
that will make you unhappy,

428
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.293
then you shouldn't do it, Jeong-suk.

429
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.754
Think long and hard about it.

430
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.301
No one will live your life for you.

431
00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:37.640
You know me

432
00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:40.893
better than I know myself.

433
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:01.224
Why do I have to quit the hospital?

434
00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:04.268
I'll quit if you get a divorce.

435
00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:07.146
Then you can finish your residency
without problems.

436
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.439
Are you telling me

437
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.399
to get a divorce?

438
00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:17.240
Whether I get divorced or not,

439
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.867
what gives you the right to demand that?

440
00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.035
"Right"?

441
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.912
Then what right do you have?

442
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.625
You're the one who stole my man,
got pregnant, and married him.

443
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:30.128
How dare you talk to me about rights?

444
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.963
You, out of all people!

445
00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:34.799
If that hadn't happened,
this wouldn't have happened either!

446
00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.176
Even when I was pregnant in the US,

447
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.095
I had no intention
of breaking up your family.

448
00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:42.140
But come to think of it,
I was being arrogant.

449
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.892
I didn't want to seem pathetic,
so I pretended to be dignified.

450
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.811
But all that was pointless.

451
00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.814
I should've shamelessly snatched him away.

452
00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:51.566
Just like you did.

453
00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.109
So your actions right now

454
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:55.444
are justified?

455
00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.405
Sure, I'm not saying I did anything good.

456
00:35:58.197 --> 00:36:00.074
But what should In-ho have done?

457
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.909
A one-night mistake resulted in a child.

458
00:36:02.618 --> 00:36:04.996
He left me because you got pregnant.

459
00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:07.415
Should he have left you
because I got pregnant?

460
00:36:07.915 --> 00:36:10.376
Is that it?
Then you don't deserve redemption either.

461
00:36:10.459 --> 00:36:12.086
You and I are basically the same.

462
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.172
So why am I the only immoral one here?

463
00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:15.548
Why are you the only victim?

464
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:17.967
I am a victim and so is my daughter!

465
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.804
My daughter is about to give up
going to college because of your daughter!

466
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.307
Are you satisfied now?

467
00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:29.270
No.

468
00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.647
Your daughter ending up like that

469
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:34.275
isn't enough to make me
feel satisfied in this situation.

470
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:38.321
But I do hope you realize one thing.

471
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:42.325
Your daughter's unhappiness
is the price of your actions.

472
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:45.494
Don't be bitter.

473
00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:49.832
I'll consider this the price I'm paying
for my actions as well.

474
00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:33.436
I guess you had emergency surgery.

475
00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:36.480
A patient with panperitonitis
caused by a cancer obstruction came in,

476
00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:39.275
so I did the Hartmann's procedure.
Thankfully, it went well.

477
00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.194
-Keep up the good work.
-Thank you.

478
00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:45.740
Professor Seo.

479
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.833
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Is something wrong?

480
00:38:55.916 --> 00:38:58.919
A short circuit must have
caused a fire in the dorms.

481
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.880
Thankfully, the security guard
discovered it early,

482
00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:02.131
so it didn't spread much.

483
00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:05.426
But the smoke is really bad.
It's like a tear gas chamber in there.

484
00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.969
I see. I'll see you later.

485
00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:51.430
Jeong-suk.

486
00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:54.058
I have to go.

487
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:11.951
Jeong-suk.

488
00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:29.552
Dr. Cha.

489
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.221
Dr. Cha, are you inside?

490
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.515
Dr. Cha, wake up!

491
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.393
Dr. Cha, wake up!

492
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:39.645
Dr. Cha!

493
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:41.605
Open the door right now!

494
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.238
Dr. Cha!

495
00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:51.031
Dr. Cha!

496
00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:58.747
We have to get out of here.

497
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.254
Let's hurry out.

498
00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:06.630
Grab onto me.

499
00:41:35.242 --> 00:41:36.410
Jeong-suk.

500
00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:47.171
I'll be the one to carry my wife.

501
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.691
Let go. Put me down.

502
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:09.485
Put me down.

503
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:18.536
I'm fine, so go.

504
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.248
Why was that guy with you?

505
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.584
And why did you come?

506
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:27.628
What?

507
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:29.421
Did you think I hit Seung-hi or something?

508
00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:31.924
Seung-hi came here?

509
00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:34.510
Yes, she unleashed
her anger on me and left.

510
00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:43.102
Seung-hi.

511
00:43:12.965 --> 00:43:14.216
-Mom.
-Hey.

512
00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:16.802
Thank you.

513
00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.638
There's still a lot of smoke, right?

514
00:43:19.722 --> 00:43:21.098
It's much better than before.

515
00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:24.393
Hey, Mom.

516
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:27.313
I heard you know.

517
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.649
About what Father did.

518
00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:34.612
Did Dr. Jeon tell you?

519
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:36.530
Yes.

520
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:39.825
Let's talk about that later.

521
00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:42.328
I'm too weak to do it now.

522
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:45.956
It's okay.

523
00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:49.293
I just need some time.

524
00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:51.045
Mom, let's go to the ER together.

525
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.715
You inhaled a lot of smoke,
and you don't look well.

526
00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:57.009
I got out quickly,
so I didn't inhale that much.

527
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:58.802
I just need to rest.

528
00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:00.888
The dorms will be closed for three days.

529
00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.598
They need to find out
what caused the fire.

530
00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:04.892
I see.

531
00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.353
Are you going to come home?

532
00:44:20.074 --> 00:44:22.034
PROFESSOR ROY

533
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:25.245
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'm opening my place for free
to the residents</i></c.bg_transparent>

534
00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:27.247
who lost a place to stay due to the fire.

535
00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.458
<c.bg_transparent><i>It's a three-minute walk
from the hospital.</i></c.bg_transparent>

536
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.543
Unlimited bread and
will be provided.

537
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:38.300
Dr. Cha, are you feeling all right?

538
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:39.385
I'm fine.

539
00:44:41.887 --> 00:44:43.389
What are you doing here at this hour?

540
00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:45.849
The night duty room
in our department is full.

541
00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:48.977
I was going to check
if there was room here to sleep.

542
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:51.063
Did you not see the message?

543
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:53.273
Professor Roy opened up his place.

544
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.568
Still, how can I go there?

545
00:44:57.152 --> 00:44:59.113
Where are you going to sleep and shower?

546
00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:01.115
There's no room here.

547
00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:03.158
But going there is a bit…

548
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:07.413
It might be awkward to go alone,

549
00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:09.248
so let's go together.

550
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:11.208
I was wondering what to do if no one came

551
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.876
after sending out a message like that.

552
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.337
I sincerely welcome you both.

553
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:18.048
There are two empty rooms over that way.

554
00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.466
You can each take one.

555
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.634
I'll wash up first.

556
00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:23.887
The rooms are first come,
first served, right?

557
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:24.888
Of course.

558
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.312
How do you feel?

559
00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:35.190
You looked quite unwell before.

560
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:37.526
I'm fine.

561
00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.154
I guess I had a nightmare.

562
00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:45.451
Do you want a cup of tea?

563
00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.339
They are my parents.

564
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:02.092
So when you said you were adopted…

565
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:03.093
It's true.

566
00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:12.144
They seem like good people.

567
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:16.190
That's right.

568
00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.984
I was a very lucky case.

569
00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:24.323
The truth is,
I'm trying to find my family here.

570
00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:27.784
I'm going to register my DNA first.

571
00:46:30.162 --> 00:46:31.413
You made a good decision.

572
00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:36.251
You have to try once
so that you won't have any regrets.

573
00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:38.754
I wish you the best of luck.

574
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.215
Thank you.

575
00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:44.468
I'll head into my room now.

576
00:46:50.265 --> 00:46:54.061
And thank you so much for today.

577
00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:58.607
I wouldn't have been able
to escape without you.

578
00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:28.595
Professor, this is your chance.

579
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:31.598
-What?
-You like Dr. Cha.

580
00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:34.268
Me?

581
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:37.354
Did you really think
it wouldn't be obvious?

582
00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:41.900
It does feel a bit immoral,
but this situation is an exception.

583
00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:43.777
So I think it's fine.

584
00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:45.696
Go for it.

585
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:48.490
You know that Professor Seo is cheating.

586
00:47:51.118 --> 00:47:51.994
Well…

587
00:47:53.745 --> 00:47:54.997
But…

588
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.290
Dr. Cha…

589
00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:58.333
could forgive him.

590
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:02.129
She may be a very forgiving person,

591
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.089
but it'll be hard to forgive him.

592
00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.008
He has a kid.

593
00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:09.052
With the woman he's having an affair with.

594
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:20.647
Hello.

595
00:48:32.659 --> 00:48:34.578
Tell your mom to come home.

596
00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:36.872
The dorms are closing for a few days.

597
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:40.292
I did tell her to,
but she said she wasn't going to.

598
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:43.253
Then where is she sleeping?

599
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:46.381
She said she was staying
at Professor Roy's place.

600
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:47.341
What?

601
00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:52.846
He opened up his place to any resident
who has no place to go.

602
00:48:53.972 --> 00:48:55.474
I'm sure a lot of people went.

603
00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:16.620
Okay, we'll move on
to the next item on the agenda.

604
00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:18.664
What Professor Roy applied for--

605
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.791
Do you really need the devices you applied

606
00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:22.417
for purchase approval?

607
00:49:22.501 --> 00:49:23.585
Yes.

608
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.048
If someone asks you a question,

609
00:49:28.882 --> 00:49:31.301
shouldn't you answer with an explanation?

610
00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:34.638
It's difficult to perform a
major hepatectomy

611
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:36.223
with the laparoscopic instruments
we have now.

612
00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:39.893
We need a laparoscopic system
with 4K image quality and 3D resolution.

613
00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:43.814
And we need an ICG camera
to accurately check the resection margin

614
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:45.899
and to minimize bile duct injuries
as much as possible.

615
00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:48.860
You're already using a laparoscope
with 3D resolution.

616
00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.532
Perhaps you were not aware of this.

617
00:49:53.615 --> 00:49:56.910
While it may not be an issue
for GI tract surgery,

618
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:59.621
it has its limits for surgery involving
the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

619
00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:01.998
And it has no real-time
ICG conversion capability.

620
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.418
I explained this all
during the last medical meeting

621
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.087
before I applied for approval,
so I find the way you're reacting now…

622
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:08.964
quite troublesome.

623
00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:11.466
We bought the device only three years ago.

624
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.969
If you request a purchase approval
as soon as you come here,

625
00:50:14.052 --> 00:50:16.138
what about the devices
for other departments?

626
00:50:16.638 --> 00:50:19.099
You're putting the hospital director
and the planning director on the spot.

627
00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:22.269
We have fewer patients, and the revenue
stays the same even if we get new ones.

628
00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:23.562
They'll nag us!

629
00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:26.857
Excuse me, I shall say a word.

630
00:50:27.649 --> 00:50:29.443
This here--

631
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.653
That was before I came here.

632
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:34.531
Since I came to this hospital,
a lot of things should change.

633
00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.909
And Professor Seo,
why are you worried about that?

634
00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:39.786
Not even Chief Yoon is saying anything.

635
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.538
What?

636
00:50:46.668 --> 00:50:48.003
Enough!

637
00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.882
Why are you fighting like this
in a meeting?

638
00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:55.177
As doctors,
you should be setting an example!

639
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.762
Yet you're glaring at each other!

640
00:50:57.345 --> 00:50:59.473
I'm talking right now
and you're still glaring at each other!

641
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:24.748
I was out of line during the meeting.

642
00:51:25.832 --> 00:51:26.708
I apologize.

643
00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.879
You humiliated me publicly.

644
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.800
Yet you apologize
when there's no one else around.

645
00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.387
I know that you don't get
the organizational culture

646
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.639
because you lived abroad.

647
00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:43.892
But how could you be so rude
and two-faced?

648
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:55.529
You always look at me with contempt.
But don't get the wrong idea.

649
00:51:56.029 --> 00:51:57.948
Are you that different from me?

650
00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.075
At the very least…

651
00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.663
I didn't covet something that wasn't mine.

652
00:52:05.163 --> 00:52:06.540
How indecent.

653
00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:21.888
Yes, honey.

654
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:24.599
You can tell me, honey.

655
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.436
It's okay, just tell me.

656
00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:34.651
Hello? Professor Seo?

657
00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:36.486
Yes, okay.

658
00:52:38.029 --> 00:52:39.155
I said talk!

659
00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:40.866
Right,

660
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:43.952
<c.bg_transparent><i>the guardian of the patient Park Gwi-nam,
who had surgery two days ago,</i></c.bg_transparent>

661
00:52:44.035 --> 00:52:45.912
wants to see you no matter what.

662
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:47.581
What should I do?

663
00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:50.584
Is it that difficult
to look into a patient who is in pain?

664
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.918
Surgery doesn't solve everything!

665
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.379
She's in pain
after you performed the surgery!

666
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:57.090
You should do something
so she's not in pain!

667
00:52:57.966 --> 00:52:59.634
I understand that you're worried.

668
00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:02.929
It's only been two days since her surgery,
so it's natural she's in pain.

669
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:07.434
So give her medicine.
She's going to die like this at her age!

670
00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:10.645
We have already given her
as many painkillers as we can.

671
00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:11.855
If we give her any more

672
00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:14.482
and cause a delay
in discovering any new pains,

673
00:53:14.566 --> 00:53:15.984
things may become dangerous.

674
00:53:18.445 --> 00:53:20.322
You pretend as if you care.

675
00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:24.576
My aunt also underwent surgery
for her colon cancer in another hospital.

676
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:27.704
But her pain was gone within a day
and she was able to walk around.

677
00:53:27.787 --> 00:53:30.957
How dare you spew nonsense
after screwing up the surgery?

678
00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.417
Damn it.

679
00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.797
The surgery went well.

680
00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:40.091
The level of pain
that she is experiencing is

681
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.929
all within the boundaries
explained in the consent form you signed.

682
00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:45.639
If it gets worse,

683
00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.892
we will find
an appropriate painkiller to administer.

684
00:53:59.277 --> 00:54:00.362
What?

685
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:02.072
What happened?

686
00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:03.698
She spat on him.

687
00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:04.783
-What?
-She did what?

688
00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:05.784
She spat on him.

689
00:54:05.867 --> 00:54:07.160
-Spat?
-Really?

690
00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.328
Who?

691
00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.663
Oh, no.

692
00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.081
What did you do this time?

693
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.291
-I just…
-No, hang on…

694
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.710
You bit me like a coward?

695
00:54:16.628 --> 00:54:18.213
You pinched me like a coward?

696
00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:21.424
-I pinched you because you bit me.
-I bit you because you pinched me.

697
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:23.593
I'll send you to the ICU.

698
00:54:25.804 --> 00:54:28.348
What a disgrace to fight in the hospital.

699
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.266
You.

700
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.644
Consider yourself lucky
that you're still alive.

701
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:35.647
If you contact Bong-suk one more time,

702
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:37.691
all bets are off.

703
00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.192
I told you already.

704
00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.069
Bong-suk texted me first.

705
00:54:41.653 --> 00:54:42.487
At least, today.

706
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.907
Whether it's a text or call,
don't answer it. Block her!

707
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:47.784
Don't order me around.
It's not your business!

708
00:54:47.867 --> 00:54:50.245
You betrayed her to marry
into a rich household.

709
00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:52.080
How dare you sway her?

710
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:53.623
You filthy bacteria.

711
00:54:53.707 --> 00:54:55.291
Bacteria? You little…

712
00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:00.088
You virus, how dare you meddle?

713
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:02.382
Why would you meddle in our ardent love?

714
00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.009
You're not her father!

715
00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:05.176
I'm practically like her father.

716
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.346
My father told me not to associate
with the likes of you on his deathbed.

717
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.974
Your father died when you were young,
before we even met.

718
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:13.059
I should sew your lips shut with a needle!

719
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.561
-I'll punch you! Three times!
-I'll do it two times!

720
00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:17.022
-I'll do it four times! Six times!
-I'll do it five times!

721
00:55:17.856 --> 00:55:19.315
Please be quiet!

722
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.781
This punk called me "bacteria."

723
00:55:28.033 --> 00:55:30.326
I held back.
I was going to call you "cancer."

724
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.454
You punk, you're divorced with two kids.

725
00:55:32.537 --> 00:55:34.789
My younger sister is still unwed,
so how dare you!

726
00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:37.876
Calm down. You two being like this--

727
00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:40.211
You two being like this
won't solve anything.

728
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:43.089
That's exactly what I was saying.

729
00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:45.008
So…

730
00:55:45.925 --> 00:55:47.135
Chief Yoon.

731
00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:48.803
What will you do now?

732
00:55:51.097 --> 00:55:52.432
If Bong-suk forgives me,

733
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.060
I want to start over with her.

734
00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.562
Chief Lim.

735
00:55:57.645 --> 00:55:59.439
If your younger sister forgives him,

736
00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:00.982
it's fate, and all is well--

737
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:02.776
What do you mean by forgive?

738
00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.737
Bong-suk told me
she's still thinking about it!

739
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.239
Things were going well
with the attorney she met!

740
00:56:10.825 --> 00:56:11.951
Wouldn't you try to stop this?

741
00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:15.789
If that person is precious to me,

742
00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:18.083
I would.

743
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:21.753
I would cheer on her new love.

744
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:26.257
A man who betrays someone once
can betray them again.

745
00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:28.676
-Right.
-Dr. Roy, you punk!

746
00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.305
What will you do if Bong-suk forgives him?

747
00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:35.350
Love…

748
00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:37.602
lasts forever.

749
00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:42.899
Doesn't love change?

750
00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:45.568
It did so for you.

751
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.785
You're all ready.

752
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.872
Hello, you're here.
Dr. Roy dropped by too.

753
00:56:57.956 --> 00:57:00.416
My patient is being discharged,
so I should come.

754
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:04.045
-Did you go see the baby today too?
-Yes.

755
00:57:04.712 --> 00:57:05.755
She's so pretty.

756
00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:07.966
How can I leave her here?

757
00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.635
The baby may seem like an angel now,

758
00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:13.012
but once you raise her,
it's harder than you think.

759
00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:13.930
Right, ma'am?

760
00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:19.769
But they say no mother regrets
giving birth to their child.

761
00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:24.190
You're preparing
for her first birthday already?

762
00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.401
-Yes.
-Jeez, don't even get me started.

763
00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:30.613
She's already reserving the food
and trying to order the clothes.

764
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:33.199
Jeez, you're the epitome
of an overzealous mother.

765
00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.409
She takes after you.

766
00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:40.290
Dr. Seo, what item did you grab
on your first birthday?

767
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.250
Me?

768
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:47.922
I…

769
00:57:50.508 --> 00:57:51.426
Dr. Seo

770
00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:53.887
grabbed a pencil.

771
00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:57.849
To tell you the truth, he's my son.

772
00:57:57.932 --> 00:57:58.933
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

773
00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:00.643
Really?

774
00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:03.646
-What in the world?
-You look alike!

775
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.689
-We do, right?
-Yes.

776
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.066
He resembles his father.

777
00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:08.568
I see.

778
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.072
-Then Dr. Seo, can I ask you for a favor?
-Sure.

779
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:17.035
I'm going to prepare
a really strong ball of yarn.

780
00:58:17.118 --> 00:58:21.080
But for the pencil,
they say it's good to use one

781
00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:22.790
that was used by a smart person.

782
00:58:22.874 --> 00:58:27.420
I see. Would a ballpoint pen work too?

783
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.255
Is it okay to accept this?

784
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.340
Yes.

785
00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:31.424
Thank you.

786
00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.015
Thank you.

787
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:40.433
Get home safely.

788
00:58:43.144 --> 00:58:44.812
-Mom, give that to me.
-No.

789
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:46.439
Give it. I'll carry it.

790
00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:50.276
I hope she makes it
to the baby's first birthday.

791
00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:54.322
She will.

792
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:57.575
Right.

793
00:58:58.618 --> 00:59:01.496
Didn't your dad give you
that pen as a gift?

794
00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.207
For when you got into med school.

795
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.334
Yes.

796
00:59:08.419 --> 00:59:09.254
It doesn't matter.

797
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:12.549
I'll get going.

798
00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:28.815
Hello, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

799
00:59:29.774 --> 00:59:31.025
What?

800
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:34.153
That's dangerous. Hey, guys!

801
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.530
Stop it!

802
00:59:35.613 --> 00:59:36.864
Get this bastard.

803
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:39.325
-Stop! This is a hospital!
-No way.

804
00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.410
It can't be!

805
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:45.456
-I told you to stop!
-Oh, my!

806
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.624
My goodness!

807
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.127
-Oh, my!
-I said stop!

808
00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.837
-You two must be crazy!
-Come on!

809
01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.949
<c.bg_transparent><i>What's with you? I thought you were
all about maintaining your image.</i></c.bg_transparent>

810
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.536
<c.bg_transparent><i>Defend yourself. Otherwise, you might
end up on the chopping block.</i></c.bg_transparent>

811
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.830
Someone always has to be held accountable.

812
01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:27.665
Hey, Seo In-ho!

813
01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.584
<c.bg_transparent><i>It's annoying to the point
of driving me crazy,</i></c.bg_transparent>

814
01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:30.710
so hurry up and leave.

815
01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:31.961
You must have lost your mind.

816
01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:34.130
If you say we should break up,
I'm going to kill you.

817
01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:36.591
I'll wait until you finish your meal.

818
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.636
Let's get a divorce.

819
01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:47.018
