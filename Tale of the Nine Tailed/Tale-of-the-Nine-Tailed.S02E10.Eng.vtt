WEBVTT

﻿1
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:03.794
Finally, one person appeared

2
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.212
What are you?

3
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.715
Just hearing my name on the battlefield

4
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.634
Enemies used to urinate

5
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.261
don't be surprised

6
00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:16.306
Shinigami mercenary group

7
00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:17.891
Ushiuchibo

8
00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:25.816
What is that?

9
00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.527
These guys just go around hunting Joseon monsters.

10
00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.030
Actually, it's nothing special.

11
00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:34.115
I don't know what it is
You're a little crooked over there

12
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:36.284
Joseon mountain gods now
Because we are making friends

13
00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:39.079
Why is the head shaped like that?

14
00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:41.456
How dare these people ignore me?

15
00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:54.219
You guys are full of venom
I inhaled the fog

16
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.346
Do you want to lose?

17
00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.640
Are you the ones losing?

18
00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.476
Only I can decipher the poison I created.

19
00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:03.395
Among the mercenaries

20
00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:05.021
I heard there was a poisoner, so it's you?

21
00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.607
You were the one who took poison at the well in Gyeongseong, right?

22
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.234
You've heard of my reputation

23
00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:10.944
hand over the treasure

24
00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:12.571
Then I will spare their lives.

25
00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:14.114
Don't be funny

26
00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:15.740
Huh?

27
00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:20.287
uh? uh?

28
00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:27.586
1 hour at most

29
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:29.713
You're bleeding all over your body

30
00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:31.256
will die in pain

31
00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.300
Just for a guy like that!

32
00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:34.676
how is it?

33
00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.845
give a treasure
Do you want to save your friend?

34
00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:37.971
- Or
-Change it

35
00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:40.390
No, Yuna, you can’t give me treasure!

36
00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.725
Hey, what should I do?

37
00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:43.852
To catch a rabbit, you have to go down the rabbit hole.

38
00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:47.230
- Rabbit?
- Yes.

39
00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:48.899
What's so easy?

40
00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:53.695
antidote

41
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:57.073
- Give it to me.
- Well, when I think about it,

42
00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:59.492
getting the antidote
The easiest way is

43
00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.248
It's violence

44
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:13.048
Mr. Lee

45
00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:14.758
Since ancient times, we have been doing this

46
00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:16.927
It was called the rabbit mall.

47
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.514
Ah, ‘Sumimasen’

48
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.768
All three of us are very picky about what other people say
Because I'm the type of person who doesn't trust you.

49
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:26.895
start

50
00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.104
Yeah

51
00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.402
아휴, 너는 그걸 다 챙겨 왔냐?

52
00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:36.821
Sliced ​​Nabak? Shredded?

53
00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:37.989
Or sharpening?

54
00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:40.784
에이, 깔끔하게 그냥 다져 버리자

55
00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:42.911
안 돼, 그럼 너무 빨리 죽잖아

56
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.163
얘 얼굴 마음에 안 드니까

57
00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.832
음, 턱이랑 코만 좀 손 보자
그럼 좀 괜찮아질 것 같아

58
00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:49.626
These crazy guys!

59
00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:51.294
Leave it at that.

60
00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:52.963
Um, okay

61
00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.010
이제부터 해독제가 나올 때까지

62
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:02.138
Every bone in your body will start to break apart one by one.

63
00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.980
우시우치보는 어디로 가 버린 거야?

64
00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.401
I hear a sound

65
00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:17.320
than ushiuchi

66
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.657
There's someone next to me

67
00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:24.160
that bastard

68
00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:26.037
To take the treasure alone

69
00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.123
하여튼 저밖에 모르는 이기적인 놈

70
00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:29.666
I'll go and come back

71
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.960
Yuki, come with me

72
00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.057
Would you like a shift?

73
00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:48.393
We haven't even started yet?

74
00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:56.192
Hey

75
00:04:56.568 --> 00:04:58.862
내가 조선의 산신 중에
Are you the strongest?

76
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.613
- Well, then.
- 힘 조절해서 패는 게

77
00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:01.740
I mean it's much more difficult.

78
00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:06.244
A mountain god who lost his country

79
00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:08.621
You talk a lot

80
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:13.376
From now on, just three

81
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.670
If the antidote doesn't come out within three or three times,
My head is broken

82
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.344
No matter how much you struggle

83
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.515
you die here today

84
00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.100
Are you laughing?

85
00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:34.439
Hongjoo

86
00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:37.859
Avoid!

87
00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:44.532
My body didn't move

88
00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:49.704
This is his specialty

89
00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:52.582
Get out of the way

90
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:06.846
- one car
- Wait a minute.

91
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:09.432
two cars

92
00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:12.102
Captain!

93
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.359
three generations

94
00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:29.536
dead

95
00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:32.038
What if I kill you?

96
00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:34.165
This keeps pissing me off

97
00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:35.834
There are three left now?

98
00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.337
You knew from the beginning, right?

99
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.422
When he's cornered, he spews poison.

100
00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.091
Yeah

101
00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:44.217
Why didn't you tell me?

102
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.344
You guys in the first place

103
00:06:46.636 --> 00:06:48.847
You had no interest in anything other than my treasure.

104
00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:50.682
Wow, you really are a bad boy

105
00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:52.392
I need to get out of here right now

106
00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:55.186
The mercenaries will come at his call.

107
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.437
All you have to do is destroy it all.

108
00:06:56.521 --> 00:06:57.856
It's impossible in this state

109
00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:00.024
Let’s go out and find a way to detoxify our body first.

110
00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:01.609
Let's go out

111
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.114
Let's go together

112
00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:08.366
Anyway, I'm the only one who's okay.

113
00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:30.722
Please save me!
Save people!

114
00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:32.307
Uh, here it is, oh, oh, oh, oh

115
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.918
Lee Rang!

116
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.215
Here you go, you bastards!

117
00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:06.299
Ah, boss!

118
00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.426
be careful
No matter how much I cut them, they keep happening

119
00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:10.303
Now, madam, quickly go to your room!

120
00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:11.429
Oh, really!

121
00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:18.686
- You have to go up quickly.
- Damage!

122
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.979
Leave this to me!

123
00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.901
Come to work, die, die, die!

124
00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:26.611
we now
We have to go quickly too

125
00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:27.695
Everyone die, Mr.!

126
00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:36.537
Oh, go away!
Oh my, really

127
00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:40.375
Shinju!

128
00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:47.548
- I'm scared
- Hey!

129
00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:48.883
- Oh, I'm scared.
- hey!

130
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.677
Hey, everyone dies!

131
00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:54.264
Tonight at this hotel
No matter what happens, don't get involved.

132
00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:58.685
Hey, don't push, you bastards!

133
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.985
Mr. Jae-yu

134
00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:08.486
my roommate is the best

135
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.573
Please save me!

136
00:09:18.955 --> 00:09:20.748
- What should I do?
- What should I do?

137
00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:23.835
Please open the door, please open the door

138
00:09:24.544 --> 00:09:25.837
Die like that

139
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:27.839
Oh, are you crazy?

140
00:09:32.677 --> 00:09:33.803
Is there anyone?

141
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.701
Go to my room and never come out

142
00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:58.661
- And you?
- I'll bring the kids.

143
00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:01.164
I'm going with you too

144
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:04.917
I'll be right back

145
00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:14.177
No!

146
00:10:20.433 --> 00:10:21.434
Yeohee

147
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.817
This doesn't make sense

148
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.153
Ushiuchibo is dead.

149
00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:35.114
The mountain spirit of Joseon
Is it this strong?

150
00:10:35.198 --> 00:10:37.950
The more I look at it, the more attractive it becomes

151
00:10:38.034 --> 00:10:39.160
Don't be funny!

152
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.453
Ushiuchibo

153
00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.288
the weakest among us

154
00:10:42.372 --> 00:10:45.541
Where did this cute nine-tailed fox go?

155
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.419
It's the west?

156
00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:49.712
Yuki

157
00:10:49.962 --> 00:10:51.798
You can't act alone

158
00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:53.299
I'll just take a look

159
00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:54.384
Yuki!

160
00:10:55.093 --> 00:10:56.928
Hey, where are you going?

161
00:10:57.929 --> 00:10:59.847
Hongjoo, just cheer up a little more, okay?

162
00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:09.690
Is it because of my mood?

163
00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:11.484
I think I passed by here earlier too

164
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.653
What on earth is this forest?

165
00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:16.030
It's in the picture in room 404.

166
00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:18.783
Among the mercenaries, there is a guy who uses illusions.

167
00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:21.619
Is there someone with that level of skill?

168
00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:23.621
He must be the boss, right?

169
00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:31.754
What is it? Why is he like this again?

170
00:11:31.838 --> 00:11:32.964
It's because of poison

171
00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.633
From earlier, I too
My eyes are getting blurry

172
00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:38.594
Hey, are you okay?

173
00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:40.012
don't touch my body

174
00:11:40.096 --> 00:11:41.097
Oh, really?

175
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.974
Hey, how about your feet? Hey, are you okay?

176
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.852
uh? Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, Muyoung?

177
00:11:46.602 --> 00:11:47.645
Muyoungah

178
00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:49.689
Yuna

179
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.778
This is a much stronger poison than you think.

180
00:11:55.862 --> 00:11:57.155
No, no, no.

181
00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:58.990
You can't pass out here, okay?

182
00:12:02.702 --> 00:12:04.662
wait for a sec

183
00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.873
It's a picture I don't like.

184
00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:08.166
Are you a mercenary group?

185
00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:13.045
- Are you a lover?
- He's my friend, why?

186
00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:15.006
Are you not a lover?

187
00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:16.466
Thank goodness

188
00:12:16.757 --> 00:12:18.593
I'm Yuki

189
00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:20.720
Wait a minute

190
00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:24.557
What are you doing?

191
00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:30.354
Do you like snowmen?

192
00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:32.106
- to?
- Yuki

193
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.941
I'm giving a snowman to my lover as a gift.

194
00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:39.030
Oh? oh

195
00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.573
It's my heart

196
00:12:41.782 --> 00:12:43.284
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

197
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.745
It's not cheap

198
00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:46.996
Is this mine?

199
00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:48.247
crazy bitch

200
00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:50.208
Yuki will have it!

201
00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:52.752
- That...
- Do you want to join us?

202
00:12:52.835 --> 00:12:53.836
Whoever wins gets it?

203
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.296
No, no, hey, that

204
00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:58.007
You guys own me
Don't insist, eh?

205
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.300
You're out!

206
00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:01.135
Sheesh

207
00:13:16.025 --> 00:13:17.652
- Stop it, no.
- It's disgraceful.

208
00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:18.903
It's you who's being mean

209
00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:20.571
This guy drank a lot of poison.

210
00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:23.866
Yuki

211
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.951
Huh?

212
00:13:25.034 --> 00:13:27.245
- Yuki
- Oh my gosh

213
00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:31.040
- I have to go.
- Why?

214
00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:33.834
Now is the time to take the treasure
This must be a golden opportunity, right?

215
00:13:34.502 --> 00:13:35.586
That's right

216
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.296
If you move as you please, you will be scolded by the captain.

217
00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:39.882
uh

218
00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:42.510
Where is your captain?

219
00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:45.638
we'll see each other soon

220
00:13:47.223 --> 00:13:48.558
Yuna

221
00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:49.892
Yuna, you have to catch it.

222
00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:05.199
ice

223
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.617
child, child

224
00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:08.911
IC

225
00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:10.955
Oh, I almost got hit, Mr.

226
00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.292
- Do you know about me?
- Uh

227
00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:15.835
I heard a rumor

228
00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:18.754
Among the mercenaries, there's something like Ice Skake.
There is a monster

229
00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:22.967
my real name is

230
00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:25.720
- It's Yuki-onna.
- Um

231
00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:27.388
‘Yuki-onna’

232
00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:28.806
Do you want to make a deal with me?

233
00:14:29.724 --> 00:14:30.808
transaction?

234
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:32.893
you

235
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:34.353
You came to look for this, right?

236
00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:35.938
- Guardian stone and gold chuck
- That...

237
00:14:36.022 --> 00:14:38.024
Are you going to give it to Yuki?

238
00:14:38.107 --> 00:14:39.317
Uh, wait.

239
00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:41.402
I

240
00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:43.446
I'll give you a treasure

241
00:14:44.238 --> 00:14:45.573
Let's exchange it for an antidote.

242
00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:49.285
Huh?

243
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.496
don't do it

244
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.749
- And if something goes wrong with you too
- It doesn't matter.

245
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.591
That's enough now

246
00:15:06.093 --> 00:15:07.428
Am I going to die?

247
00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:09.639
you won't die

248
00:15:10.348 --> 00:15:12.016
Turned into those monsters

249
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.810
What if I don’t recognize you and I?

250
00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:17.605
I won't let you do that

251
00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:24.362
I have a question

252
00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.783
Why did you save me then?

253
00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:31.952
The first day I came to our club

254
00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:38.209
that day

255
00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:42.421
I feel so dirty

256
00:15:44.215 --> 00:15:46.008
Did you think you were going to die?

257
00:15:49.804 --> 00:15:51.555
Then I saw you on stage

258
00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:54.558
no one
A song you don't listen to

259
00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:57.770
He was singing with a happy expression.

260
00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:05.152
I don't know why

261
00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:07.780
While listening to that song

262
00:16:09.532 --> 00:16:11.450
I felt like I had to live

263
00:16:12.284 --> 00:16:13.452
thank you

264
00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:18.207
For being next to me at this moment

265
00:16:20.376 --> 00:16:21.877
If I were alone

266
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.048
I think it must have been very scary

267
00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:27.299
I'll be by your side

268
00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:29.218
lifetime

269
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.144
Lee Yeon gave it to me

270
00:16:43.357 --> 00:16:46.235
A scene like this
How long have I dreamed of

271
00:16:48.571 --> 00:16:50.072
Why is it today?

272
00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:52.533
I

273
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.454
Because I was born crooked

274
00:16:57.997 --> 00:17:00.833
Even in minor misfortune
I used to fall down often.

275
00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.293
For life

276
00:17:04.086 --> 00:17:06.672
from my past
I lived like I was running away

277
00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:14.305
I can't fall anymore

278
00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:17.850
I don't plan on running away

279
00:17:19.643 --> 00:17:21.896
Because you are there

280
00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:29.528
Yeohee, Yeohee, what's wrong?

281
00:17:31.322 --> 00:17:32.615
Ah, it's cold

282
00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:36.911
My body is like a ball of fire

283
00:17:46.754 --> 00:17:48.047
What should I do?

284
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.382
brother

285
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.936
laugh a little

286
00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:03.521
Don't touch me

287
00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:09.527
Until marriage

288
00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:12.738
I will protect you

289
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.451
I'll get off here

290
00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:18.786
Aren't you going home?

291
00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:20.329
I want to walk

292
00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:21.664
Drop me off

293
00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:30.631
Oh, why doesn't Yeohee come here?

294
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.259
Isn't there something going on?

295
00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:35.344
Oh no

296
00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.389
Lee Yeon is also at the hotel.
Because there is also Irangi

297
00:18:50.484 --> 00:18:51.819
Eunho

298
00:19:09.628 --> 00:19:10.754
- Eunho.
- Boss?

299
00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:12.339
What are you doing here?

300
00:19:12.423 --> 00:19:13.591
That guy just now

301
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:15.342
Who are you?

302
00:19:15.593 --> 00:19:18.220
Ah, Ryuhei Kato, Chief of Police Affairs, Government General Government.

303
00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:19.388
Your brother-in-law?

304
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:20.681
It was my brother-in-law.

305
00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:22.558
Are you going to become a couple now?

306
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.018
What does that mean?

307
00:19:24.727 --> 00:19:26.729
Are you asking me to marry you, to that person?

308
00:19:27.563 --> 00:19:28.647
Eunho

309
00:19:29.815 --> 00:19:31.442
you listen to me carefully

310
00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:35.487
the man

311
00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:37.948
It's not a person

312
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.870
What does that mean?

313
00:19:43.454 --> 00:19:44.955
The police chief is not a person.

314
00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.165
i saw it

315
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:48.834
clearly with both eyes

316
00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:50.586
Lee Yeon

317
00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.421
Don't come!

318
00:19:55.132 --> 00:19:56.759
If not a person, what is it?

319
00:19:58.052 --> 00:19:59.845
I don't even know what it really is

320
00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:01.680
But Eunho

321
00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:04.391
You never tell that guy
Don't go close

322
00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.810
The secret that my sister saw

323
00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.520
No way...

324
00:20:11.774 --> 00:20:13.275
My sister knew

325
00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:15.653
So that bastard killed my sister.

326
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.363
Forget it, eh?

327
00:20:17.613 --> 00:20:18.614
I have to forget it

328
00:20:18.697 --> 00:20:20.407
There's nothing you can do about it

329
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:21.992
So what should I do?

330
00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:24.495
sister's enemy

331
00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:27.122
enemy of the fatherland
I married that man

332
00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:28.749
Do you live with your eyes closed and your ears blocked?

333
00:20:33.879 --> 00:20:35.839
What on earth are you fighting for?

334
00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:46.350
This

335
00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:47.851
Why dynamite?

336
00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:52.106
I do it

337
00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:55.567
That police chief
Even if we embrace each other and die together...

338
00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:56.902
Why boss?

339
00:20:56.986 --> 00:20:57.987
I

340
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:01.824
more than you think
lived much longer

341
00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:03.033
in this land

342
00:21:03.117 --> 00:21:05.494
I've been through all kinds of storms and waves.

343
00:21:06.704 --> 00:21:07.871
What should I do?

344
00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:11.667
I still love this Joseon

345
00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:13.502
It's pretty

346
00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:16.213
You who want to protect Joseon

347
00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:19.842
Just pretty

348
00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:28.142
I can't do it alone

349
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.771
I have an idea

350
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.491
I will do it

351
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.494
What?

352
00:21:47.953 --> 00:21:49.121
this marriage

353
00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:50.581
I will do it

354
00:21:50.998 --> 00:21:52.541
Now

355
00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:54.293
Antidote?

356
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.171
That girl gave you this?

357
00:21:57.588 --> 00:21:59.423
- Uh
-Why him?

358
00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.133
- I changed it to Geumcheok.
- What?

359
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.719
You handed it over to a Japanese monster?

360
00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:05.387
uh

361
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:07.765
First of all, shouldn't you all be saved?

362
00:22:09.224 --> 00:22:11.351
Is it really an antidote?

363
00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:13.187
You don't know that

364
00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:16.023
Which side are you on?

365
00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:18.484
I'm the antidote

366
00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:23.989
don't eat

367
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:27.367
You're saving us?

368
00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:29.870
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust you either.

369
00:22:29.953 --> 00:22:31.163
at least

370
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.749
Don't gamble with Hong Joo's life.

371
00:22:35.084 --> 00:22:37.086
If it's gambling

372
00:22:37.169 --> 00:22:38.253
Hey

373
00:22:38.337 --> 00:22:40.172
I have to do this, huh?

374
00:22:40.255 --> 00:22:41.256
Yuna

375
00:22:42.925 --> 00:22:43.926
now

376
00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:45.928
If I can't wake up, this is poison

377
00:22:46.345 --> 00:22:47.554
crazy guy

378
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.014
What should I do?

379
00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:51.183
Yuna

380
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.063
Wow, Mr.

381
00:22:59.483 --> 00:23:00.734
Hey

382
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:09.493
Let's go, let's go

383
00:23:09.868 --> 00:23:11.328
Hey, I saved you, I

384
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.579
- This way
- Huh?

385
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.920
I, I saved it this time

386
00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:22.381
- Me!
- You, Mr. Lee, you, you bastard!

387
00:23:23.465 --> 00:23:25.676
Hey, when you came running towards us earlier

388
00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:27.469
Swish, swish, wow

389
00:23:27.553 --> 00:23:29.179
Yeah, it was really cool, it was cool.

390
00:23:29.263 --> 00:23:30.430
Huh?

391
00:23:30.514 --> 00:23:32.558
Ah, on the way passing by
There were just two people

392
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.101
Don't give it meaning

393
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.562
Ah, you always say such good things.
Cho chine, mr.

394
00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:38.313
Because everyone serves different people.

395
00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:39.898
If they become enemies

396
00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:41.608
We have no choice but to fight

397
00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:43.527
That was back then

398
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.778
- Now
- Huh?

399
00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:46.780
Now our roommates
We are all one family

400
00:23:46.864 --> 00:23:48.198
Me, Jaeyu and

401
00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:49.950
Huh?

402
00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:51.577
Hey, what's your name?

403
00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:54.705
Well, whatever, call it whatever you want.

404
00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:56.874
Say ‘Hey’ or whatever.
'Boss' or something like that

405
00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:59.042
- No name?
-Tell me.

406
00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:01.420
I don't want to talk

407
00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:03.714
- Oh my, really.
- Oh, why are we like this?

408
00:24:03.922 --> 00:24:05.465
We've crossed the line, huh?

409
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.762
What year?

410
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.472
What...

411
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:14.141
Miyeon Lee

412
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:18.687
Hey, your name is the Magic Bandits

413
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.772
Is your name this pretty?

414
00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:23.734
Hey, that's the name our boss gave us.

415
00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:25.652
Our leader, Saint Igaeda

416
00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:27.446
rice rice, fate

417
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:29.323
Eat your fill of rice and just

418
00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:30.449
Cheer me up to live long, Mr.

419
00:24:30.532 --> 00:24:31.783
Okay, Miyeon.

420
00:24:31.867 --> 00:24:33.285
- Sigh, sir!
- Miyeon, Son

421
00:24:33.744 --> 00:24:34.995
Hey! you boss

422
00:24:35.078 --> 00:24:37.581
Leeyeon or Miyeon
Hongjoo is more out of place, wow, sir.

423
00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:39.082
Wait a minute, wait a minute

424
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:41.919
Hey, my boss and my wife
Are you safe now?

425
00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:45.380
That's right, hey, if anything goes wrong with you.
I'm dying from Lee Yeon!

426
00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:49.843
Yuna

427
00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:51.929
Female, Yuna

428
00:24:54.223 --> 00:24:55.807
Muyoung, what should I do?

429
00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:56.975
Yeon...

430
00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.936
Hey! Oh no

431
00:25:00.103 --> 00:25:01.271
Oh, there's something else to joke about

432
00:25:01.855 --> 00:25:03.273
sorry

433
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:06.944
As expected, this was an antidote.

434
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.656
Muyoung, let’s eat quickly too.

435
00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:14.618
It won't work for free

436
00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:17.329
What do you mean?

437
00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:18.705
What kind of guys are they?

438
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:20.082
Except the nine-tailed fox

439
00:25:20.165 --> 00:25:22.292
The other two guys
I'm weak after taking poison

440
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.086
Yeah?

441
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:25.337
But I gave you the antidote

442
00:25:26.797 --> 00:25:27.881
This is crazy

443
00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:30.509
Yuki: There’s a reason for everything.

444
00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:32.135
What reason, what reason, what reason!

445
00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:36.306
salty

446
00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:38.392
I exchanged this for the antidote.

447
00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:40.811
Oh?

448
00:25:41.311 --> 00:25:42.479
Ah

449
00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:45.941
It's real

450
00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:48.777
It's a real treasure

451
00:25:51.947 --> 00:25:53.031
But what's the plan?

452
00:25:53.115 --> 00:25:54.491
I guess I need allies

453
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.661
What about the other two?

454
00:25:58.495 --> 00:25:59.496
how is it?

455
00:26:00.038 --> 00:26:01.999
I hung out with a girl, Sanshin, once.

456
00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:03.417
It was quite useful

457
00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:05.002
Even though I took poison

458
00:26:05.794 --> 00:26:07.921
But did they give you the antidote?

459
00:26:08.297 --> 00:26:10.966
They even have new ones
You don't know how to do it

460
00:26:11.675 --> 00:26:13.051
great body

461
00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:14.594
the more the better

462
00:26:16.513 --> 00:26:18.223
That makes sense.

463
00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:20.392
Yuki has this

464
00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.693
Give me the antidote

465
00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:32.404
There is one condition

466
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.072
Conditions?

467
00:26:34.906 --> 00:26:35.907
you guys

468
00:26:36.158 --> 00:26:38.076
You came all this way for my treasure, right?

469
00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:39.328
But

470
00:26:39.745 --> 00:26:41.580
Now we have a common enemy

471
00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:43.665
mercenary group

472
00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:48.503
I'll give you an antidote

473
00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:50.130
Let's catch them together with me.

474
00:26:50.547 --> 00:26:51.548
That's my condition

475
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:53.300
By the way, I definitely do it

476
00:27:01.058 --> 00:27:02.225
Muyoung Cheon

477
00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:06.355
I don't need your help

478
00:27:08.023 --> 00:27:10.150
Me, because you're pretty
Do you know how to do this? uh?

479
00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:13.320
Even if it ends with me
Don't you have to get out of here first?

480
00:27:13.862 --> 00:27:16.156
And you're so excited
one of those treasures

481
00:27:16.239 --> 00:27:17.574
It's already in their hands

482
00:27:20.202 --> 00:27:21.453
Eat without being proud

483
00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:24.122
If I were a kite
It's a mercenary group and they're sleeping.

484
00:27:24.706 --> 00:27:25.916
I left you to die.

485
00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:27.250
This red and white mask

486
00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:30.962
Why do you want to save me too?

487
00:27:38.678 --> 00:27:40.806
I need your skills

488
00:27:40.889 --> 00:27:42.057
The woman I saw earlier

489
00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:44.226
It's a monster that wields snow and ice.

490
00:27:45.268 --> 00:27:46.353
you are fire

491
00:27:58.532 --> 00:28:00.992
Besides, just in case
Even those damn mountain gods jump in.

492
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.953
Four Japanese monsters and two mountain gods

493
00:28:03.036 --> 00:28:04.037
It's a 6 to 1 fight

494
00:28:04.788 --> 00:28:07.624
That's the real goal of this operation.

495
00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:11.336
Hongju and Muyoung

496
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.088
What if you're on our side?

497
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.090
So this

498
00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:18.802
What if it becomes a fight between mercenaries and mountain gods?

499
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:34.734
my wish
How many are left?

500
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.113
wish?

501
00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:40.657
There's still some left, right?

502
00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:45.328
It's my last wish

503
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:47.664
please get out of this room

504
00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.126
as far away as possible

505
00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:54.171
I hate it

506
00:28:56.423 --> 00:28:58.175
Then promise me one thing

507
00:29:00.177 --> 00:29:01.428
if i change

508
00:29:03.638 --> 00:29:05.056
kill me with your own hands

509
00:29:10.854 --> 00:29:11.855
no

510
00:29:13.482 --> 00:29:14.566
I'll die with you

511
00:29:16.943 --> 00:29:18.445
until the fox dies

512
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.365
'Cause there's only one woman

513
00:29:24.993 --> 00:29:26.286
I have

514
00:29:28.163 --> 00:29:29.873
Did you really like Gyeongseong?

515
00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:34.002
The lights in the club

516
00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:37.214
Gorgeous stage costumes

517
00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:41.843
Jewelry from our fashion store

518
00:29:43.178 --> 00:29:46.306
There were lots of shiny things everywhere.

519
00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:51.353
The thing that shines the most in Gyeongseong is

520
00:29:56.358 --> 00:29:57.984
It was you and me

521
00:30:15.752 --> 00:30:16.878
Yeohee

522
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.421
Yeohee, Yeohee

523
00:30:20.382 --> 00:30:21.925
I'm still hiding

524
00:30:22.008 --> 00:30:23.218
No, don't die.

525
00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:24.553
Yeohee, come to your senses!

526
00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:25.845
Come to your senses!

527
00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:27.138
Lee Rang

528
00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:28.974
boss

529
00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:30.100
Lee Rang

530
00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.603
Baby

531
00:30:33.937 --> 00:30:36.356
I brought some food

532
00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:40.443
Wow

533
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.946
Don't drink alcohol on an empty stomach

534
00:30:47.492 --> 00:30:48.660
Sometimes I

535
00:30:49.411 --> 00:30:52.455
There is no end or bottom to you
There are times when kindness can be a little scary.

536
00:30:53.248 --> 00:30:54.249
Me?

537
00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:56.876
Such a kind person

538
00:30:57.294 --> 00:30:59.462
How can you endure me?

539
00:31:01.006 --> 00:31:02.340
I'm bad at myself too

540
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.511
i am

541
00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:08.430
Are you still cool?

542
00:31:09.472 --> 00:31:11.516
Who else would endure it but this woman?

543
00:31:12.017 --> 00:31:15.437
The master of Samdocheon
A place as heavy as hell

544
00:31:19.024 --> 00:31:20.817
Well said owner

545
00:31:21.318 --> 00:31:23.570
I'm like a jailer with my hands and feet tied

546
00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:26.698
You can't intervene in the human world

547
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.992
It’s okay to say you don’t know me too much

548
00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:31.202
I can't fight with anyone

549
00:31:31.286 --> 00:31:33.038
I can't protect anyone

550
00:31:33.121 --> 00:31:34.956
Instead, you raised those children.

551
00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:36.416
Of course

552
00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:39.210
Although Muyoung was slightly upset at the end,

553
00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:42.964
Everyone was a good mountain god

554
00:31:43.757 --> 00:31:45.050
you are a good teacher

555
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.803
good

556
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:51.931
-He's a teacher...
- So

557
00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:53.099
I believe it

558
00:31:53.183 --> 00:31:55.352
Those kids eventually
I'll make the right choice

559
00:31:55.435 --> 00:31:57.646
And I'll win, yeah

560
00:32:01.232 --> 00:32:02.442
Are you drunk?

561
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.070
It looks strangely smooth, doesn’t it?

562
00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:06.321
really?

563
00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:08.490
Have one more drink

564
00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.283
Huh? There's no alcohol

565
00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:11.618
I'll bring you a drink

566
00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:13.119
honey

567
00:32:13.912 --> 00:32:14.913
Yes?

568
00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:16.790
Do you want to go see the theater with me tomorrow?

569
00:32:17.874 --> 00:32:18.875
theater?

570
00:32:19.084 --> 00:32:20.502
- you?
- Yes

571
00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.003
Yeon said that

572
00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:24.923
Don’t be confined to the three kingdoms.

573
00:32:25.006 --> 00:32:26.341
Go out and see the world

574
00:32:26.841 --> 00:32:28.927
I like it

575
00:32:29.302 --> 00:32:30.470
I'll bring it quickly

576
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.105
Will the Great King Wudo come to the theater?

577
00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:44.984
Surrounding the guardian stone and gold chuck

578
00:32:46.027 --> 00:32:49.030
what is going on
I need to find out

579
00:32:50.532 --> 00:32:52.117
You know how to cure it?

580
00:32:52.659 --> 00:32:54.536
Come on tell me
Jindo dog, yes?

581
00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.580
say!

582
00:32:57.664 --> 00:32:59.124
Or here
I die and you die

583
00:32:59.207 --> 00:33:00.375
Ah, our boss fights

584
00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:02.210
Why does the mermaid girl have to be sacrificed?

585
00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:04.337
Jae-yu doesn’t want that either, huh?

586
00:33:06.256 --> 00:33:07.924
That's all I just picked up and heard.

587
00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:09.342
Yacha?

588
00:33:11.803 --> 00:33:12.804
I'm unlucky

589
00:33:12.887 --> 00:33:14.514
What if he or my kids get hit?

590
00:33:14.848 --> 00:33:16.933
If possible, never leave your room.

591
00:33:17.016 --> 00:33:18.059
If you get bitten by one chance

592
00:33:19.436 --> 00:33:21.104
Boil the pistils of the irises and feed them.

593
00:33:21.187 --> 00:33:23.523
Iris pistil?

594
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:25.442
That works?

595
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.026
This is a monster created by Muyoung.

596
00:33:27.318 --> 00:33:28.319
It will work.

597
00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:30.155
Iris right now
Where can I get it? yes?

598
00:33:30.238 --> 00:33:31.239
Even if you go outside...

599
00:33:31.322 --> 00:33:33.241
I have to save my life before I die

600
00:33:33.867 --> 00:33:34.868
Are you sleeping? Mr.

601
00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:36.286
It's in the hotel restaurant.

602
00:33:37.746 --> 00:33:39.038
'Bonjour'

603
00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:45.420
It's a French restaurant.
I saw saffron in the cabinet

604
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.046
- Sharp?
- It's spice.

605
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.131
It is a type of iris flower.

606
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.425
- I'll come back.
- Ah, now.

607
00:33:50.508 --> 00:33:51.509
Are you going out there?

608
00:33:51.593 --> 00:33:53.636
- There are a lot of yakshas out there now.
- I have to go.

609
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.013
Oh, then I'll go too.
I'm going too, Mr.

610
00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:56.639
- I'm going too.
- Hey!

611
00:33:57.474 --> 00:33:59.225
Oh, why do I go there?

612
00:33:59.517 --> 00:34:00.727
our family

613
00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:04.773
I'm sorry but
my life is not mine

614
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.026
- It's our boss's.
- No time, let's go.

615
00:34:08.693 --> 00:34:09.986
Please take care of my wife.

616
00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:12.906
please

617
00:34:13.907 --> 00:34:15.408
Just hold on until I come

618
00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:53.571
Very good at the restaurant
We're having a party, Mr.

619
00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:55.865
How do we get through there?

620
00:35:02.956 --> 00:35:04.666
My movements have become slower than before

621
00:35:06.376 --> 00:35:07.836
Where are you going? uh?

622
00:35:09.546 --> 00:35:10.672
Lee Rang

623
00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:38.950
Oh, you can't see that?

624
00:35:39.325 --> 00:35:40.326
uh?

625
00:35:58.803 --> 00:36:00.638
Without the light, we can't see them.

626
00:36:00.972 --> 00:36:02.015
I'm only reacting to sound

627
00:36:02.098 --> 00:36:04.225
As quietly as possible
I guess I can approach it.

628
00:36:04.893 --> 00:36:05.894
no

629
00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:07.312
Conversely, use sound

630
00:36:07.979 --> 00:36:09.147
Shinju are you

631
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.773
Go to the restaurant and get some irises

632
00:36:11.316 --> 00:36:13.776
We lure the yakshas to one side
As loudly as possible

633
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.362
Should I at least yell? yes?

634
00:36:16.446 --> 00:36:17.614
Burn this body

635
00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:19.240
If you are caught, Shinju will be in danger.

636
00:36:19.324 --> 00:36:20.491
Then?

637
00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:31.210
record player

638
00:36:35.882 --> 00:36:36.883
record player

639
00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:38.551
Let's move it over there and lure it in.

640
00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:41.804
When I hear a song
Because they will flock like that

641
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.681
let's go

642
00:36:44.474 --> 00:36:45.516
So

643
00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:47.060
What are you going to do now?

644
00:36:47.894 --> 00:36:48.895
Look look

645
00:36:49.228 --> 00:36:50.563
Among the four mercenaries

646
00:36:51.022 --> 00:36:52.649
Because the poisoner is dead

647
00:36:52.732 --> 00:36:54.275
This guy is gone

648
00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:57.070
Now there's three of them, three of us

649
00:36:57.153 --> 00:36:58.404
What is their power?

650
00:36:59.906 --> 00:37:01.157
Currently number 1

651
00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.659
Snow Maiden Yuki-onna

652
00:37:03.076 --> 00:37:04.369
Well, everyone saw this guy earlier.

653
00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:06.079
Write, twice

654
00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:07.497
Ha, his name is

655
00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:10.291
Is it a sack or a cauldron?
Well, it was something like that.

656
00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:11.709
Oh my gosh

657
00:37:11.793 --> 00:37:13.503
- I said Oogama.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, right.

658
00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:15.505
- Ooh Gama
- What is that?

659
00:37:15.713 --> 00:37:18.591
japanese
Toad monster that is hundreds of years old

660
00:37:18.675 --> 00:37:20.218
I've seen it in the literature

661
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:22.220
He's got a big head and a lot of strength, right?

662
00:37:22.553 --> 00:37:25.056
- I'll handle it.
- Tsk, okay.

663
00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.225
Write, the problem is number 3

664
00:37:27.308 --> 00:37:28.476
Ah, this guy

665
00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.269
I don't know your name, I don't know your talent

666
00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:32.146
This guy looks like a leader

667
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:36.234
Well, anyway, I'll deal with it here.

668
00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:37.819
How are you going to catch those three?

669
00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:40.530
Because I gave you gold.

670
00:37:40.613 --> 00:37:42.365
Now they will come looking for the guardian stone.

671
00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:44.826
I'll be the bait

672
00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:46.786
Is it necessary?

673
00:37:47.245 --> 00:37:48.663
They're probably looking for you too

674
00:37:49.038 --> 00:37:50.248
It will crawl on its own

675
00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:51.416
Oh my

676
00:37:51.499 --> 00:37:53.960
I don't have time to sit and wait, okay?

677
00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:57.672
Well, some guy went to the hotel
Release the yaksha and bring it

678
00:37:58.214 --> 00:37:59.298
Mr. Lee

679
00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:01.426
Then let's go together

680
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.011
That's enough

681
00:38:03.553 --> 00:38:06.889
No matter how much antidote I took
It takes some time to decipher the poison.

682
00:38:06.973 --> 00:38:09.809
'Cause I'll lure them in
You guys are recovering first.

683
00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:14.480
Yuna

684
00:38:15.314 --> 00:38:16.357
Huh?

685
00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:19.777
Just in case

686
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:21.904
No, what, boy, what

687
00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:24.866
Ah, that...

688
00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:27.035
Hey, and what are they?
I'm not even human

689
00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:28.536
Why are you giving me a gun? uh?

690
00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:30.455
If anything happens, you have to call me.

691
00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:32.623
Oh, what am I?

692
00:38:32.707 --> 00:38:34.083
uh? Now take this, take this

693
00:38:34.167 --> 00:38:35.501
- Yuna
- Huh?

694
00:38:35.793 --> 00:38:37.128
Take one more of this

695
00:38:39.338 --> 00:38:41.007
Okay, okay.

696
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.175
I'll be back

697
00:39:29.847 --> 00:39:30.890
Hey there

698
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:35.770
- Please take me too.
- Get out.

699
00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:36.896
no

700
00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:39.107
Hey, you just hit me earlier.

701
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.775
- Don’t you feel sorry for me?
- Fuck off, Mr.

702
00:39:40.858 --> 00:39:43.152
Don't do that, let's live together, okay?

703
00:39:43.236 --> 00:39:44.987
- I'll help too, okay.
- Oh, don't touch me.

704
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:46.364
Shhh!

705
00:39:52.537 --> 00:39:53.871
If you get in my way, I'll kill you.

706
00:39:54.747 --> 00:39:55.748
Okay

707
00:39:55.998 --> 00:39:57.041
As if it exists or not

708
00:40:28.114 --> 00:40:29.115
Chairman?

709
00:40:31.117 --> 00:40:32.118
Chairman

710
00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:33.870
It's me

711
00:40:46.924 --> 00:40:48.092
Quickly, quickly, quickly

712
00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:49.177
Quick, quick, come in!

713
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.386
Don't come, don't come!

714
00:40:57.351 --> 00:40:58.644
Play that quickly, play that quickly

715
00:40:58.728 --> 00:40:59.770
Turn it on quickly

716
00:41:01.063 --> 00:41:02.815
I will die in a place like this

717
00:41:03.065 --> 00:41:04.483
He's not a great person.

718
00:41:05.735 --> 00:41:07.320
Don't push me, Mr.!

719
00:41:26.005 --> 00:41:27.215
Where are you now?

720
00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:29.175
IC

721
00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.971
Huh?

722
00:41:34.222 --> 00:41:35.389
What does this smell like?

723
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:38.684
It's a smell you definitely recognize, right?

724
00:41:41.687 --> 00:41:42.813
What is this again?

725
00:41:46.108 --> 00:41:47.235
Who are you?

726
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.281
Please save me

727
00:41:52.365 --> 00:41:53.532
Huh?

728
00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:55.576
Wow, old man, where did you see this?

729
00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.954
That, that, myo, Myoyeonggak.

730
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:05.127
Ah, ah, ah, uh, uh, uh, I remember.

731
00:42:06.754 --> 00:42:07.922
Are you a native god?

732
00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:10.758
yes, yes

733
00:42:11.008 --> 00:42:13.302
But where on earth is this?

734
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.638
Why am I suddenly in the forest...

735
00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:17.515
That's up to you to explain.

736
00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:20.559
How did you get in?

737
00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:21.978
Until just now

738
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:24.188
I was at the hotel

739
00:42:24.272 --> 00:42:26.023
But the monsters came after me

740
00:42:27.149 --> 00:42:28.359
I ran into the room with the door open and

741
00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:30.278
Wow

742
00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:31.570
It's pathetic

743
00:42:32.655 --> 00:42:35.241
It's more dangerous here than the hotel
Because Japanese monsters are everywhere

744
00:42:36.575 --> 00:42:37.868
Wow

745
00:42:37.952 --> 00:42:39.036
Please

746
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.371
Can you take me with you?

747
00:42:41.664 --> 00:42:42.999
chased by monsters

748
00:42:43.749 --> 00:42:44.959
I sprained my ankle

749
00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:47.628
Ah, I'm busy but it's annoying, really.

750
00:42:48.212 --> 00:42:49.213
Oh no

751
00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:50.423
Hey, piggyback

752
00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:55.678
thank you

753
00:43:09.859 --> 00:43:11.819
Why...

754
00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:15.156
Even from that poisonous doctor earlier,
It smelled the same

755
00:43:15.406 --> 00:43:16.866
A strangely unpleasant sweet smell

756
00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:26.375
This

757
00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:27.710
Caramel?

758
00:43:27.793 --> 00:43:29.128
Are you a mercenary group?

759
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.964
Do you have a good feeling?

760
00:43:32.048 --> 00:43:33.090
Are you the boss?

761
00:43:34.842 --> 00:43:36.052
my name is newdo

762
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.388
Oonyudo

763
00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:44.769
- I like you.
- You're not my style.

764
00:43:49.023 --> 00:43:50.316
Huh?

765
00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:20.388
what?

766
00:44:22.556 --> 00:44:23.599
Why is my body there?

767
00:44:25.393 --> 00:44:26.977
It's called Oonyudo.

768
00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:29.688
It means a monster that can change its body.

769
00:44:32.942 --> 00:44:34.026
What do you think?

770
00:44:34.235 --> 00:44:36.195
My new body?

771
00:44:40.825 --> 00:44:41.826
Give it to me

772
00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:43.202
my nice body

773
00:44:45.454 --> 00:44:47.665
Wow

774
00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.376
So why did you leave the knife sting?

775
00:44:50.793 --> 00:44:51.794
Huh?

776
00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.213
You are

777
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:57.425
Do you think you're over our heads?

778
00:45:00.719 --> 00:45:01.971
Joseon’s mountain gods, etc.

779
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.098
It's nothing

780
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:13.607
By the way, where is this treasure?

781
00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:14.859
huh?

782
00:45:16.277 --> 00:45:17.611
To you guys

783
00:45:18.988 --> 00:45:20.322
I can never give it to you

784
00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:21.407
Huh?

785
00:45:22.783 --> 00:45:24.243
IC

786
00:45:24.452 --> 00:45:26.036
Where did you put the treasure?

787
00:45:26.787 --> 00:45:27.913
No?

788
00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:35.546
no way...

789
00:45:36.338 --> 00:45:37.673
Oh, stop it.

790
00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:38.966
Clothes are getting heavy, oops

791
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.887
Damn it

792
00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.142
I don't have any treasure

793
00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:49.935
Yeah?

794
00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:53.564
I guess the rest of them have it, whatever.

795
00:45:56.358 --> 00:45:57.443
No way

796
00:46:00.654 --> 00:46:02.323
If you go...

797
00:46:06.118 --> 00:46:07.369
No way

798
00:46:12.166 --> 00:46:14.001
Be bossy
Take a quick look, boss!

799
00:46:36.899 --> 00:46:37.942
Where have you gone, you bastard?

800
00:46:48.494 --> 00:46:50.162
you die by my hands

801
00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:57.378
Will Hong-joo and Mu-young be safe?

802
00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:00.339
What if he pretends to be me?

803
00:47:13.686 --> 00:47:14.937
The treasure was stolen

804
00:47:15.354 --> 00:47:16.647
The body looks like this

805
00:47:16.855 --> 00:47:18.440
I don’t even know if Lee Rang is alive or dead.

806
00:47:19.149 --> 00:47:20.401
What on earth

807
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:22.653
Where did it go wrong?

808
00:47:32.204 --> 00:47:33.622
Are you sure you're alive?

809
00:47:36.125 --> 00:47:37.501
I can hear you breathing

810
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:40.379
Then it turns into a monster
What if they try to eat us?

811
00:47:41.964 --> 00:47:43.632
They said it was okay as long as I was still breathing.

812
00:47:44.091 --> 00:47:45.593
Ha, I'm dying of anxiety.

813
00:47:46.927 --> 00:47:47.928
What about Jae-yu’s brother?

814
00:47:48.304 --> 00:47:49.471
I went to find the boss.

815
00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:50.806
I want to go out

816
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.433
I don't want to die in a place like this

817
00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:56.061
- It's an orchid!
- Leave it alone.

818
00:47:56.145 --> 00:47:57.479
I told you not to go out

819
00:47:57.563 --> 00:47:58.856
Get out of the way, girl.

820
00:47:58.939 --> 00:48:00.274
It's terrible to be here, I'm dying.

821
00:48:00.357 --> 00:48:02.359
You never know what's out there

822
00:48:05.237 --> 00:48:07.448
Huh? The boss may have arrived

823
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:08.866
I can't leave even if I die

824
00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:10.618
He must be crazy

825
00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:13.162
Lee Yeon, Lee Rang
Don’t you remember saving your sister?

826
00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:15.247
I owe you my life too

827
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:18.709
I'm annoyed

828
00:48:19.209 --> 00:48:20.461
Don't get too excited

829
00:48:20.878 --> 00:48:22.254
If I run out of breath

830
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.631
I'll finish it

831
00:48:28.594 --> 00:48:30.429
You can't get killed in a place like this.

832
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:44.735
Open the door!

833
00:49:18.185 --> 00:49:19.311
Close it!

834
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.249
saffron, saffron

835
00:49:42.543 --> 00:49:43.836
saffron

836
00:49:52.428 --> 00:49:53.470
Boss!

837
00:49:53.554 --> 00:49:54.596
boss!

838
00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:05.524
Ouch!

839
00:50:07.818 --> 00:50:09.027
I, I, I, I don't want to die

840
00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:10.279
Uh, I, I, I, I don't want to die.

841
00:50:10.362 --> 00:50:11.905
Hey, you bastard, come to your senses!

842
00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.115
Hey, wake up!

843
00:50:13.198 --> 00:50:14.283
Come to your senses!

844
00:50:14.491 --> 00:50:15.909
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

845
00:50:15.993 --> 00:50:17.703
no!

846
00:50:17.953 --> 00:50:19.329
no!

847
00:50:33.552 --> 00:50:35.471
Oh no!

848
00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:08.879
us

849
00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:11.006
Can we get out of here?

850
00:51:13.884 --> 00:51:15.177
Why do you say that?

851
00:51:16.053 --> 00:51:17.137
just

852
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:19.097
Strangely, I have a bad feeling

853
00:51:19.973 --> 00:51:22.434
On the morning of the day I took the Sanshin exam
I felt exactly like this

854
00:51:24.061 --> 00:51:26.063
- You passed the test.
- instead

855
00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:28.148
I lost what I loved the most

856
00:51:30.526 --> 00:51:31.610
you guys

857
00:51:50.921 --> 00:51:52.089
I guess not me?

858
00:51:53.465 --> 00:51:55.050
I was always looking at you

859
00:51:56.009 --> 00:51:57.010
Hongjoo

860
00:51:57.636 --> 00:51:59.346
You were only looking at Lee Yeon

861
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.225
I was always looking at you

862
00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:06.520
I wanted it

863
00:52:07.604 --> 00:52:09.064
Even though I know I can't have it

864
00:52:16.822 --> 00:52:17.906
First love

865
00:52:18.198 --> 00:52:19.658
Why do things always go astray?

866
00:52:22.703 --> 00:52:23.912
Because it’s your first love?

867
00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:31.295
If his first love
What if I get the treasure by myself?

868
00:52:33.422 --> 00:52:35.382
Ah, well, are you worried?

869
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:39.386
It's better than losing it to Lee Yeon.

870
00:52:43.891 --> 00:52:44.975
Guys

871
00:52:45.225 --> 00:52:46.393
Yuna

872
00:52:48.562 --> 00:52:50.689
Why are you alone? What about the mercenaries?

873
00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:53.150
Uh, I got ambushed by these guys.

874
00:52:53.525 --> 00:52:55.569
You sure didn't run away?

875
00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:58.947
Instead, I found their stronghold.

876
00:52:59.323 --> 00:53:00.407
Where are you?

877
00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:03.035
But

878
00:53:03.493 --> 00:53:05.162
How are you guys feeling? uh?

879
00:53:05.245 --> 00:53:06.496
Has the poison been completely detoxified?

880
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:09.416
The bleeding stopped

881
00:53:09.625 --> 00:53:10.751
Not 100% yet

882
00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:12.753
That's good

883
00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:14.504
Let’s lure them to the mercenary den.

884
00:53:14.963 --> 00:53:17.549
Oh, let's hurry, now's our chance

885
00:53:18.258 --> 00:53:19.384
let's go

886
00:53:24.723 --> 00:53:25.849
newdo

887
00:53:26.808 --> 00:53:28.060
New too!

888
00:53:28.477 --> 00:53:30.437
- It's a mercenary group.
- Newdo

889
00:53:32.648 --> 00:53:33.690
newdo

890
00:53:35.108 --> 00:53:36.109
newdo

891
00:53:38.403 --> 00:53:39.613
If you catch my eye now

892
00:53:40.197 --> 00:53:41.490
I'm dead

893
00:53:42.449 --> 00:53:44.701
With this body
I can't deal with it

894
00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:46.370
newdo

895
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:49.164
Hey, there's no new

896
00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:50.832
Strange?

897
00:53:51.625 --> 00:53:54.169
Did you hear footsteps nearby?

898
00:53:54.836 --> 00:53:56.129
Aren't you one of the mountain gods?

899
00:53:57.464 --> 00:53:58.840
I wish it was a nine-tailed fox

900
00:54:04.262 --> 00:54:05.764
- Here...
- Please

901
00:54:06.556 --> 00:54:07.724
please go somewhere else

902
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:10.894
I guess there isn't one

903
00:54:12.521 --> 00:54:13.563
let's go

904
00:54:21.113 --> 00:54:22.406
lived

905
00:54:24.449 --> 00:54:25.492
Wait a minute

906
00:54:26.618 --> 00:54:27.619
maybe

907
00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:30.080
This might be an opportunity

908
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.083
They don't know my body has changed

909
00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:36.169
But what if you get caught?

910
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.007
It's here!

911
00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:42.968
newdo

912
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:44.177
newdo

913
00:54:58.692 --> 00:54:59.693
What are you?

914
00:55:05.282 --> 00:55:06.491
Ouch!

915
00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:40.192
boss

916
00:55:41.735 --> 00:55:42.778
Are you okay? yes?

917
00:55:43.987 --> 00:55:45.572
- Lee Rang
- Gusinju

918
00:55:45.906 --> 00:55:46.907
What about irises?

919
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.452
- Let's go
- I got bitten, I got bitten.

920
00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:52.120
Let's go together, okay?

921
00:55:52.204 --> 00:55:53.246
This dog, this...

922
00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:55.165
Oh, it wasn't intentional earlier.

923
00:55:55.499 --> 00:55:57.084
- You...
- The living must be saved.

924
00:55:57.167 --> 00:55:58.293
Right, right, right

925
00:55:58.376 --> 00:55:59.795
What should I do? yes?

926
00:56:04.674 --> 00:56:06.093
- Don't come!
- 저, 같이 가시지...

927
00:56:06.176 --> 00:56:08.053
이놈의 새끼, 씨
뒈져 버려라, 그냥

928
00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:18.271
살려 줘, 살려 줘, 살려 줘!

929
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:34.371
What are you doing?

930
00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:36.540
I waited long enough
You’re not coming!

931
00:56:36.623 --> 00:56:38.041
- He's coming.
- What if he doesn’t come?

932
00:56:38.125 --> 00:56:39.960
- What should we do?
- The boss said so.

933
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.962
A place to live and die
You decide for yourself

934
00:56:42.379 --> 00:56:44.506
- I want to live.
- Let's wait a little longer.

935
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:46.466
- Get out of the way!
- Stop it.

936
00:56:47.008 --> 00:56:49.261
- Sister
- You're out.

937
00:56:51.513 --> 00:56:52.639
I'm sorry

938
00:57:00.147 --> 00:57:01.148
What are you?

939
00:57:03.859 --> 00:57:04.860
What is it?

940
00:57:07.195 --> 00:57:08.280
What?

941
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:11.199
Why is it like that?

942
00:57:14.035 --> 00:57:15.120
Oh no

943
00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:17.497
I was hit by a nine-tailed fox

944
00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:24.671
Bye bye, bye bye bye

945
00:57:24.754 --> 00:57:27.883
It looks good
He was so proud

946
00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.384
shut up!

947
00:57:30.385 --> 00:57:31.553
But

948
00:57:32.262 --> 00:57:33.722
Are you really a newdo?

949
00:57:36.766 --> 00:57:38.643
- what?
- Gumi Tiger

950
00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.604
You can change your body

951
00:57:42.814 --> 00:57:43.982
No way

952
00:57:45.942 --> 00:57:47.235
It hasn't changed, right?

953
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.823
Because there is no Ushiuchibo

954
00:57:52.407 --> 00:57:54.326
Can you identify the monster?

955
00:57:54.784 --> 00:57:55.785
Like that?

956
00:57:58.538 --> 00:57:59.998
If you are new

957
00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:01.750
Why didn't you change it?

958
00:58:06.963 --> 00:58:08.173
Ah

959
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.765
That guy

960
00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:19.351
You know more about us than you think

961
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:21.478
Even my talents

962
00:58:21.811 --> 00:58:22.979
How did you know?

963
00:58:23.063 --> 00:58:24.105
Actually

964
00:58:25.357 --> 00:58:26.775
Did you know about me too?

965
00:58:29.319 --> 00:58:31.154
Shouldn't you tell the captain?

966
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.534
colon?

967
00:58:36.618 --> 00:58:37.786
Where is the captain?

968
00:58:38.161 --> 00:58:39.454
you don't know

969
00:58:39.537 --> 00:58:40.747
The guy who stole my body

970
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.249
Wasn't it the captain?

971
00:58:43.959 --> 00:58:45.252
Shinigami mercenary group

972
00:58:46.127 --> 00:58:47.796
It's not four, it's five!

973
00:58:48.838 --> 00:58:50.048
Where is he now...

974
00:58:52.926 --> 00:58:54.010
No way...

975
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:02.519
What about mercenaries?

976
00:59:03.603 --> 00:59:04.938
Any news yet?

977
00:59:05.855 --> 00:59:08.024
The captain is at the Bando Hotel.

978
00:59:10.026 --> 00:59:11.027
Satori?

979
00:59:11.319 --> 00:59:12.320
yes

980
00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:14.322
Since Satori participated in the war

981
00:59:14.823 --> 00:59:17.284
That hotel is for everyone, whether people or monsters.

982
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:20.829
It's a massacre

983
00:59:56.114 --> 00:59:57.365
Come quickly

984
01:00:34.527 --> 01:00:37.322
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

985
01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:41.201
From now on, you guys
I can't even take a step out of this room

986
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:42.952
until death

987
01:00:43.453 --> 01:00:44.454
Hongju!

988
01:00:44.537 --> 01:00:45.538
That sucks.

989
01:00:47.874 --> 01:00:50.335
Muyoung
The reason I came to this era

990
01:00:50.418 --> 01:00:52.212
- Cheon Mu-young!
- What is it?

991
01:00:52.545 --> 01:00:53.963
Isn’t there something you can point out?

992
01:00:54.881 --> 01:00:57.342
With gold
Trying to wake something up

993
01:00:57.425 --> 01:00:58.551
No way

994
01:00:58.635 --> 01:00:59.928
You can't wake it up!

995
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:02.597
Dare to hope

996
01:01:03.473 --> 01:01:05.016
Don't embrace it

997
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.267
Don't die, Muyoung.

998
01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:08.478
stay behind me

999
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:09.896
so i can fight
