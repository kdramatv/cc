﻿1
00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:01.124
Lee Yeon!

2
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:03.960
A letter came from Gyeongseong.

3
00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:08.340
Who is it? read it

4
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:09.966
This is

5
00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:12.219
‘The flowers are falling’

6
00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.763
'It's time to go back
It means we're getting closer.'

7
00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:16.848
'Unwantedly
'Thrown into this era'

8
00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:18.225
'It only brought hardship'

9
00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:20.685
Unwillingly thrown into this era

10
00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:22.062
I only brought you hardships

11
00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:23.814
I wanted to write this

12
00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:27.108
Looking back, I had a pretty cool nightmare.
I feel like it

13
00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:29.903
In 1938, you were just taking drugs

14
00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:32.948
I have quite a lot in that world.

15
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:36.034
Latest massage chair with platinum card

16
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:38.912
The essence of anti-aging
high frequency massager

17
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:41.748
Oh, we also have a home theater.

18
00:01:44.793 --> 00:01:45.961
What does he say?

19
00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:47.629
I don't know

20
00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.632
I don't know what it is
You just have to feel deprived

21
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.843
'Cause I'm showing off

22
00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.845
This is so crazy, huh?

23
00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:56.680
This is also Lee Yeon.

24
00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.723
IC, tsk.

25
00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.767
The world turns crazy

26
00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:02.811
Gyeongseong becomes an apartment complex

27
00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:05.272
The place where the gods reside disappears

28
00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:07.691
People don't believe in legends anymore

29
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.277
We very rarely

30
00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:12.904
It only appears in dramas

31
00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.407
Don't regret going then

32
00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:17.450
Come back

33
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.036
In this era, there is still a nine-tailed fox

34
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.913
I need a mountain god

35
00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.001
Come back, to Rangi’s side.

36
00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.880
There isn't much time left for Rangi

37
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.258
Please stay by her side instead of me.

38
00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.720
Ah, that's enough

39
00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.513
Where are you preaching, tsk

40
00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.223
- Mr.
- Oh, wait, wait a minute.

41
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.642
I think you should definitely see this, right?

42
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:44.269
IC

43
00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:47.856
'P.S.'

44
00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.026
‘By the way, there’s one thing I left out.’

45
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.695
‘At my house’

46
00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:55.864
‘There is her too’

47
00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:58.742
Her?

48
00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.160
Her?

49
00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:03.246
Wow, oh my god

50
00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:05.624
Ah, I guess the lady was reborn.

51
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.756
Shinjuya

52
00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:15.342
pack your bags

53
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.681
Let's go back

54
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:24.059
To Gyeongseong

55
00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:34.402
Are you afraid?

56
00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:44.663
I'm not afraid

57
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:49.250
The boss has never
You never abandoned us

58
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.588
You will come

59
00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:57.842
He will definitely come

60
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.953
Would you like to wear it? Or

61
00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:27.330
Would you like me to wrap it for you?

62
00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:28.665
I should try it on

63
00:04:28.748 --> 00:04:29.916
The dressing room

64
00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.459
This way

65
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.847
I think the pants are a bit long

66
00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:48.560
Maybe I have short legs?

67
00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.107
Is it you?

68
00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:56.609
A guy called the Chief of Police Affairs at the Government General

69
00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:57.694
Did I tell you?

70
00:04:58.278 --> 00:04:59.529
that we will meet again

71
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.741
What are you, you?

72
00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:08.246
Daitengu

73
00:05:10.832 --> 00:05:13.043
He was a highly virtuous monk while alive.

74
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.253
Before the war, he was a mountain god on the mainland.

75
00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:17.464
Mountain god?

76
00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:18.840
As the same mountain spirit

77
00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:20.842
I'm very interested in you

78
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:22.302
come out

79
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:23.928
Let's have a fight between the same mountain gods

80
00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.015
I have to go to the wedding.

81
00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.976
Ah, when I die, my soul gets married.
Well, I'll do something like that.

82
00:05:30.477 --> 00:05:31.895
Aren't you here to find hostages?

83
00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:33.146
Did you bring the treasure?

84
00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.606
Of course I left it behind

85
00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:38.902
if you die

86
00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.862
I can't find the treasure

87
00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:41.946
if i die

88
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.323
you can't find the hostage

89
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:45.909
Let's exchange, fairly

90
00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:48.495
Ah, he needs formal education.
I didn't get it right

91
00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:50.663
Sorry, you don't know the meaning of fairness.

92
00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:52.457
Do you read the newspaper?

93
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.375
It's been 28 years since you lost your country.

94
00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.212
If I'm fair then that's fair

95
00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.923
Bring me the gold chuck and the guardian stone.

96
00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:02.801
Oh my, you don't know anything about the world.

97
00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:04.052
No more now

98
00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:05.720
The Northern Mountain God flew and ate it

99
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.971
All that remains is the guardian stone

100
00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:08.890
Pass on that too

101
00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.141
Why do you need it?

102
00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:13.436
Creating the world's best barrier
I heard it was a thing

103
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.396
Our empire is at war now

104
00:06:16.106 --> 00:06:17.941
Protecting the homeland is also my duty.

105
00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:21.027
my job is with that
I'm going back home

106
00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:24.572
If you don't find the treasure today

107
00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:26.991
hostage dies

108
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.787
When you find a hostage

109
00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:32.580
you die today

110
00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:38.837
Start catching the tail

111
00:06:41.005 --> 00:06:42.006
Already

112
00:06:43.883 --> 00:06:46.136
This side started

113
00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:50.098
What did you just say?

114
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.725
Only one of the two is hostage
I said I could buy it

115
00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.060
What?

116
00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:56.354
A child who is like limbs to Boss Ryu

117
00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:58.731
And this girlfriend
It's in our hands

118
00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:00.191
only one of them

119
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.651
I'm sending you back alive

120
00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:02.735
What do you want?

121
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.320
Fighting with the nine-tailed fox

122
00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:06.322
First, I will release the one that brought the treasure.

123
00:07:09.075 --> 00:07:10.618
Originally, these Joseon bastards

124
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:13.037
Joseon guys fight like they're eating a meal, right?

125
00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:16.875
- Kill it.
- That's not going to happen.

126
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.841
Please release Jaeyu.

127
00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:27.677
He's not related

128
00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:30.722
I gave CEO Ryu several opportunities.

129
00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:32.974
You hit me in the back again and again

130
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:34.267
Above all

131
00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:37.687
I really wanted to see that look

132
00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:51.451
I don't know if I have time for this

133
00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.494
Run for dear life

134
00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:55.205
Now the two of you

135
00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:57.248
Because we are rivals

136
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:08.259
What should I do about this situation?

137
00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:10.511
You have to choose between Suho Seok and the hostage.

138
00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:13.932
Lee Yeon, please help us Yeohee.
Please help me, okay?

139
00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.018
The lunar eclipse is today

140
00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:19.020
Once you pass the guard stone, there is no way to go back.

141
00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.065
Less than 6 hours left

142
00:08:22.148 --> 00:08:23.399
Please say something

143
00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:26.819
Shinju, you go now.

144
00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:28.112
Okay, what should we do first?

145
00:08:29.113 --> 00:08:30.448
Just buy me a glass of iced Americano

146
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.533
Oh? In the meantime?

147
00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:34.994
Ugh, he's been fighting a battle of brains.

148
00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:36.162
I urgently need caffeine

149
00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:45.338
Wow, it tastes bad.
Hey, why are you writing this like this?

150
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:46.631
It's not even a poison

151
00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:48.091
You're so different, really.

152
00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:51.219
Let's go to Myoyeonggak

153
00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:53.346
Ureong Gaksi goes and brings the bride.

154
00:08:54.764 --> 00:08:56.933
Gather all stakeholders

155
00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:03.773
Do you know where the treasure is?

156
00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:05.358
Are you planning to betray Lee Yeon?

157
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:08.152
Because Jae-yu only has me.

158
00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:10.446
Jindo dog is like that

159
00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:13.491
Like a fool, I serve only one master my whole life.

160
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.661
No matter what happens, I will come
I will believe and wait

161
00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:18.288
What about Lee Yeon?

162
00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:19.998
He can't go home without his guardian stone.

163
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:22.917
Let's be honest, we

164
00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:25.461
Yeon stays here

165
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.631
Isn’t this what you and I both wanted?

166
00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:35.430
I mean people

167
00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:37.307
Knowing when to let go

168
00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:39.100
Yuna

169
00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:41.728
I know you both have a lot to worry about.

170
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.273
Now, decide right here.

171
00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:49.902
On the grill they laid
If you play around, you'll get roasted crispy.

172
00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:51.571
Or

173
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:54.407
Will you overturn that grill with me?

174
00:09:59.203 --> 00:10:02.081
We have two goals
We gathered here

175
00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:05.126
First, rescue the two hostages safely.

176
00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:07.670
Second, the culprit of this situation is

177
00:10:07.754 --> 00:10:09.672
Wipe out the police chief's gang.

178
00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:13.509
Our weakness is time

179
00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:15.303
The lunar eclipse is

180
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:16.804
Ends at 7pm

181
00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:19.474
Save the kids within the time limit

182
00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:21.434
Gotta catch them

183
00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:23.519
5 hours to go

184
00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:25.688
someone

185
00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:27.106
You could get hurt or die

186
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.443
If you want to live, get out now

187
00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:37.575
I want to say it nicely

188
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.163
i really need you guys

189
00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:47.919
Okay, from now on
Let's divide into teams and move.

190
00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:50.088
First, let's find the hostages.

191
00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:52.423
How do I find it?

192
00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:55.051
The time of kidnapping is estimated to be around 10 o'clock.

193
00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:57.804
This era
Because it's a time without curfew

194
00:10:58.262 --> 00:10:59.680
Unless they take to the sky

195
00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:01.140
There must be witnesses

196
00:11:01.933 --> 00:11:03.184
Do you have any pictures of the two of you?

197
00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:04.477
I need it to investigate

198
00:11:04.811 --> 00:11:06.270
- None.
-Me too

199
00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.815
‘I’m drawing a picture’, hand?

200
00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:12.026
Uh, Kookhee

201
00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:19.951
Better hearing and visual acuity than humans
Dogs are much better

202
00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:21.577
You have the ability to talk to animals, right?

203
00:11:23.162 --> 00:11:24.163
Now, pay attention

204
00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:26.249
You guys are ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in this neighborhood?

205
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.251
Are you number one?

206
00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:30.211
Then is it you? Is it you?

207
00:11:30.294 --> 00:11:33.256
From now on, I am living off Gyeongseong.
Tell this to all domestic dogs and stray dogs.

208
00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.383
Looking for interest

209
00:11:39.554 --> 00:11:40.596
interest

210
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.140
The one kidnapped was a native Jindo dog.

211
00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:44.350
To have a sense of responsibility as a dog

212
00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:46.936
tell me

213
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.610
you are a mongrel
You hate purebred Jindo dogs?

214
00:11:58.698 --> 00:11:59.782
The bounty

215
00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:01.409
It took this long?

216
00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:02.785
gaga!

217
00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:06.080
please

218
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.753
The boss's wife was kidnapped.

219
00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:14.881
Put the honor of our magic bandit on the line and find it!

220
00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:16.757
- yes!
- Are you the boss?

221
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:18.050
yes! Oh, my goodness

222
00:12:18.134 --> 00:12:20.052
sorry, sorry
I am very motivated

223
00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:21.345
I will definitely bring you there

224
00:12:21.888 --> 00:12:23.598
- Let's go!
- yes!

225
00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:27.852
This side is preparing to attack the wedding hall.

226
00:12:27.935 --> 00:12:30.062
I'll join as soon as things get organized here.

227
00:12:30.563 --> 00:12:32.690
The problem is
Just bombs, no weapons.

228
00:12:33.483 --> 00:12:34.484
The organization was completely destroyed

229
00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:37.904
Follow me

230
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.121
Are you going to war?

231
00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:49.749
I collected it by selling gold.

232
00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:52.418
I think a day like this will come someday

233
00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:53.878
No, but

234
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:55.588
How do I get all this in?

235
00:12:56.464 --> 00:12:57.673
My face was exposed

236
00:12:57.757 --> 00:12:59.842
Hotel security must be very tight.

237
00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:02.386
You know these guys

238
00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:09.727
To me, nothing is as precious as this Joseon
It's your life

239
00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:13.856
never get hurt

240
00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:19.237
“Peninsula Hotel”

241
00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:34.460
check

242
00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:37.797
Come here, I'm Ginko.

243
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.341
This is the bridesmaid

244
00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:41.801
sorry

245
00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:43.469
There was an order telling me to put all my effort into security.

246
00:13:47.682 --> 00:13:49.267
open it

247
00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.231
What is it?

248
00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:57.483
gayageum

249
00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:05.950
Jukhyang-ah

250
00:14:06.033 --> 00:14:07.994
You made rice balls
Feed the kids as soon as they come

251
00:14:08.077 --> 00:14:09.579
- Yes
- Now

252
00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:13.708
I'm going to go to the undressing group.

253
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:15.835
If only I had grandma's clairvoyance

254
00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:17.545
Hongjoo

255
00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.047
You know?

256
00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:22.049
We never lost as a team

257
00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:25.052
I'll find the kids safely.

258
00:14:26.012 --> 00:14:27.179
believe it

259
00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:55.124
Yeah, their movements
It's not unusual

260
00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:57.168
Shouldn’t hotel security be strengthened?

261
00:14:57.376 --> 00:14:58.419
If you just give me one chance...

262
00:14:58.502 --> 00:14:59.629
- Try it.
- Yes

263
00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:01.297
yes

264
00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:03.132
Everyone pay attention

265
00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:05.926
How dare your Excellency the Governor-General
The wedding hall you are attending

266
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.803
I received intelligence that the enemy would attack.

267
00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:09.680
Everyone risk their lives to stop it!

268
00:15:09.764 --> 00:15:10.848
yes

269
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.774
He's looking for a hostage

270
00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:21.651
I'm so excited

271
00:15:23.027 --> 00:15:24.153
I guess so

272
00:15:25.363 --> 00:15:27.031
Should we move the hostage somewhere else?

273
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:30.493
There's no need for that.

274
00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:32.620
If he finds a hostage

275
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:34.705
The plan will be in vain

276
00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:39.085
You go there right now

277
00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:40.753
Do whatever I tell you.

278
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:50.054
Yes!

279
00:17:03.502 --> 00:17:05.880
Everyone hurry up a little more

280
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.430
Huh?

281
00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:19.602
Hyun Eui-ong's grandfather

282
00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:21.771
Hey Hongju, are you going to see grandma?

283
00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:23.272
Yes, you have an office, right?

284
00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:25.232
Oh, don't go now, a guest is coming.

285
00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:26.859
Guest? Who?

286
00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:28.360
Well, I don't know who it is

287
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:30.696
They say you shouldn't come in until the sun sets?

288
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.323
Oh, I don't know, I don't have time for that.

289
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.741
Let's go quickly

290
00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:39.121
Wow, with that guy’s temperament

291
00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:41.791
How can you be so similar to your grandmother?

292
00:17:41.874 --> 00:17:42.875
Fish oil!

293
00:18:30.464 --> 00:18:31.757
Grandmother

294
00:18:32.258 --> 00:18:34.426
Please lend me your clairvoyance, it's urgent.

295
00:18:38.681 --> 00:18:39.682
what?

296
00:18:40.516 --> 00:18:41.684
Why are you doing this?

297
00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:52.570
snow

298
00:18:52.778 --> 00:18:54.071
What's wrong with my eyes?

299
00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:57.575
the first mountain god

300
00:18:58.868 --> 00:18:59.910
he is back

301
00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:02.538
The seal failed.

302
00:19:03.163 --> 00:19:04.331
So

303
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.709
Clairvoyant

304
00:19:08.127 --> 00:19:09.420
In his hands...

305
00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:13.257
The first mountain god?

306
00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:15.509
What does that mean?

307
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.012
The guardian stone
I need to send it back to the future

308
00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:22.016
Go tell Yeoni.

309
00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:23.309
Definitely today

310
00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:25.895
I have to come back on time

311
00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:28.772
Take responsibility and take the guardian stone back

312
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:31.901
If he collects all four treasures,

313
00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:35.029
They say the world is coming to an end

314
00:19:37.573 --> 00:19:38.782
The end?

315
00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:41.076
What about Muyoung?

316
00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:43.871
If he was brought back to life with a gold chuck,

317
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:45.331
What about Muyoung?

318
00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:47.583
It's better not to know now

319
00:19:50.586 --> 00:19:52.963
The military truck that kidnapped the kids
It disappeared from Dongnimmun Gate.

320
00:19:53.047 --> 00:19:54.214
The dogs in that neighborhood

321
00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:56.216
This is the truck that transported independence activists.

322
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.260
Dongnimmun, independence activists

323
00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:01.472
Seodaemun Prison

324
00:20:01.555 --> 00:20:02.556
let's go

325
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.641
Oh, wait a minute.

326
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:04.934
Something's a little strange

327
00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.310
What?

328
00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:07.853
The kids' location was exposed too easily.

329
00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:09.688
no time to think more

330
00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:11.523
The wedding is starting soon, right?

331
00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:13.859
Leave this to me
You ended up being the police chief.

332
00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:15.110
let's go

333
00:20:15.194 --> 00:20:16.612
Yes?

334
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:19.615
- I'm going
- Iranga

335
00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:22.868
Once upon a time, my father
I've said this before

336
00:20:24.203 --> 00:20:25.871
I have a younger brother

337
00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:27.706
That guy

338
00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:29.708
Someday you might surpass me

339
00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:31.919
Chi, lie

340
00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:34.129
But

341
00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:35.798
No matter how half

342
00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:37.967
you are definitely my sister

343
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.468
It's a decent nine-tailed fox family.

344
00:20:40.094 --> 00:20:41.887
If you have to fight for your life

345
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:43.472
believe in yourself

346
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.641
like i trust you

347
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:49.812
What

348
00:20:50.312 --> 00:20:51.355
I don't want to hear it

349
00:20:53.691 --> 00:20:54.775
You too

350
00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:56.443
Be sure to return alive

351
00:20:56.527 --> 00:20:57.736
Oh, I...

352
00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:00.906
That...

353
00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:04.368
There's something I've never told you before.

354
00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:08.372
- Love...
- Shut up

355
00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:09.707
uh

356
00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:12.710
- Hey, Miyeon.
- Huh?

357
00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:14.044
- Hey
-Why?

358
00:21:15.004 --> 00:21:16.505
Give me your shoes and you do this

359
00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:19.508
Report that

360
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.011
If you feel like you're going to die, huh? Run away so fast

361
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:24.763
Are you saying this is a limited edition or something?

362
00:21:24.847 --> 00:21:25.931
What is limited edition?

363
00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:28.392
In this world you were my limited edition

364
00:21:28.475 --> 00:21:29.935
Hey friend!

365
00:21:33.522 --> 00:21:34.773
Hey, hurry up

366
00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:36.025
Let's go

367
00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:37.943
Hey, hey

368
00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.112
- Huh?
- Go

369
00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:41.363
let's go too

370
00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:01.383
Search quickly!

371
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.312
Where to plant the bomb?

372
00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:14.521
Wouldn’t it be better to be out of sight?

373
00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:15.606
no

374
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.733
Basically, it is darkest under the lamp.

375
00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:19.777
in the most visible place

376
00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:28.660
Hey

377
00:22:30.037 --> 00:22:31.330
Why are you here?

378
00:22:35.417 --> 00:22:37.961
Lady Eunho, please, wedding assistant.

379
00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:40.172
Who is that brother?

380
00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:41.632
Ah

381
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.801
I am in charge of protecting the police chief.

382
00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:45.135
I mean me

383
00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:47.054
If you do well, you might become a police chief.

384
00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:58.148
Hey

385
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.192
Why are you dropping your hands like that?

386
00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:03.195
This guy has hydrocephalus.

387
00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:09.868
Guys
There's a lot to do, so let's go quickly

388
00:23:27.344 --> 00:23:28.679
Director's order

389
00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:30.305
What is this?

390
00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:31.849
ear saw tree

391
00:23:31.932 --> 00:23:33.267
Inject right now

392
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.655
You bastard!

393
00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:51.702
Damn it

394
00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:53.620
Sir, one is broken!

395
00:23:56.081 --> 00:23:57.666
Which of the two should I choose?

396
00:23:58.834 --> 00:23:59.918
this?

397
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.211
no

398
00:24:01.587 --> 00:24:02.671
Take that one

399
00:24:03.005 --> 00:24:04.673
That girl is the one that Sanshin loves.

400
00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:13.724
Let go, let go!

401
00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:24.735
You too

402
00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:26.486
You have to do your part

403
00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:39.208
Yeohee

404
00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.426
Everything is empty, why?

405
00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:55.349
Yeohee

406
00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:56.850
Why are you here now?

407
00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:58.810
I thought I was bored to death

408
00:24:59.895 --> 00:25:00.979
Yeohee

409
00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:03.065
Just stand there

410
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.818
Oh my, handsome man

411
00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:08.987
Are you still not awake?

412
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:11.031
Hey, that bitch came too

413
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:12.824
Could you please stop talking?

414
00:25:13.283 --> 00:25:14.743
Just put one finger on her

415
00:25:14.826 --> 00:25:16.745
What should I do?

416
00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:19.206
- You already said it?
- Kill it.

417
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.708
Just take one step

418
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.933
I moved, what should I do?

419
00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:41.687
What about Jae-yu?

420
00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:45.732
- I'm leaving.
- Let's go together.

421
00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:47.025
- No need.
- Hey!

422
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:52.572
I'm sorry

423
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.700
I should have come sooner

424
00:25:58.245 --> 00:26:01.206
I thought I lost the whole world in one day

425
00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:20.183
Jaeyuya

426
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.186
Jaeyuya

427
00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:25.897
Jaeyu, answer me

428
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.233
Jaeyuya

429
00:26:29.318 --> 00:26:30.777
Are you caught?

430
00:26:32.696 --> 00:26:34.740
I guess they came looking for you

431
00:26:35.615 --> 00:26:38.285
Jaeyuya
Answer me when you hear my voice

432
00:26:38.994 --> 00:26:39.995
answer

433
00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:42.122
I hate it

434
00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:46.585
Jaeyu!

435
00:26:47.961 --> 00:26:49.004
Can you hear me?

436
00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:54.051
Jaeyuya

437
00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:00.182
Then

438
00:27:00.265 --> 00:27:04.311
Have a good time with your owner

439
00:27:17.574 --> 00:27:18.909
Jae-yu, Jae-yu!

440
00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:21.995
Jae-yu, Jae-yu

441
00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:23.789
Jaeyu, open your eyes.

442
00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:25.457
It's me, Jaeyu

443
00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:27.376
Boss?

444
00:27:29.628 --> 00:27:31.380
It's alive, it's alive

445
00:27:33.924 --> 00:27:36.009
You can't solve it

446
00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:37.594
You can't solve it

447
00:27:38.512 --> 00:27:40.263
- If you solve it...
-Are you okay?

448
00:27:40.347 --> 00:27:41.640
Are you hurt anywhere?

449
00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:53.985
You can't be here.

450
00:27:55.654 --> 00:27:57.114
- Let's go
- No!

451
00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:23.932
Jaeyuya

452
00:28:27.894 --> 00:28:28.979
Why are you like this?

453
00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:31.398
I'm Hongju

454
00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:33.817
die

455
00:28:34.443 --> 00:28:35.986
Die, die!

456
00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:37.112
Jaeyoo Yoo

457
00:28:37.487 --> 00:28:39.030
Come to your senses!

458
00:28:48.582 --> 00:28:49.958
are you okay

459
00:28:51.543 --> 00:28:53.003
Everything will be okay

460
00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:00.302
Boss?

461
00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.096
yes

462
00:29:03.472 --> 00:29:04.473
yes, it's me

463
00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:07.642
Am I like that?

464
00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:11.688
How could I tell my boss...

465
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:13.440
What did they do to you?

466
00:29:16.443 --> 00:29:17.736
Jaeyuya

467
00:29:18.487 --> 00:29:19.863
Jaeyuya

468
00:29:21.323 --> 00:29:22.365
in my head

469
00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:24.201
someone is whistling

470
00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:25.660
Whistle?

471
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.251
No way

472
00:29:33.335 --> 00:29:34.586
Ear saw tree?

473
00:29:37.756 --> 00:29:38.840
Go

474
00:29:38.924 --> 00:29:40.091
I can't hold on any longer

475
00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:42.761
I'll never go without you
Even if I die, I will take you with me

476
00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:44.888
I can't go, they said

477
00:29:44.971 --> 00:29:46.681
When you hear the whistle
I can't turn it back

478
00:29:46.765 --> 00:29:48.517
There must be a way, right?

479
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.851
I'll find it

480
00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:51.061
Jaeyuya

481
00:29:51.144 --> 00:29:53.396
Please! Please go away.

482
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.481
Jaeyuya

483
00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:55.732
Jaeyuya

484
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.984
Jaeyuya

485
00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:03.323
Until I die
I will serve only one master

486
00:30:16.461 --> 00:30:17.754
don't cry

487
00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:20.507
No, Jaeyu.

488
00:30:21.758 --> 00:30:22.759
No way

489
00:30:23.134 --> 00:30:24.344
Uh, no.

490
00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:26.429
Huh? No way

491
00:30:26.513 --> 00:30:28.223
No!

492
00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:31.685
no!

493
00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:36.273
Jaeyu!

494
00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.528
your mom is sleeping

495
00:30:41.903 --> 00:30:44.447
He said he takes headache medicine.
He said he picked up sleeping pills and took them.

496
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.410
That's what I changed

497
00:30:48.994 --> 00:30:49.995
What?

498
00:30:50.078 --> 00:30:51.830
Mom doesn't deserve to be here.

499
00:30:52.664 --> 00:30:55.834
This kid told my mom
What are you talking about?

500
00:30:58.503 --> 00:31:00.589
His Excellency the Governor-General
You have arrived

501
00:31:15.312 --> 00:31:16.479
Koo Shin-ju, Lee Yeon

502
00:31:17.314 --> 00:31:18.607
Why aren't you coming yet?

503
00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:28.033
Shinjuya

504
00:31:28.116 --> 00:31:29.701
How long does it take for the old lady to change clothes?

505
00:31:29.784 --> 00:31:32.495
15 minutes by car
You have to leave at 6:40 at the latest.

506
00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:35.915
- Let's go
- Lee Yeon

507
00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:37.709
Just say one word

508
00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:38.918
We can come back alive

509
00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:42.255
I brought you here

510
00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:44.424
I'll send you home safely

511
00:31:54.643 --> 00:31:56.061
How do I get through that?

512
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.189
Hey, I'm a nine-tailed fox

513
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.781
fool

514
00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:09.908
The thing that lured that mountain spirit woman was

515
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:11.534
To isolate you

516
00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:12.827
Take her out first

517
00:32:13.203 --> 00:32:14.788
No, boss, go with me.

518
00:32:14.871 --> 00:32:15.955
Get out!

519
00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:17.082
Ai!

520
00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:18.625
Go, go

521
00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:21.920
Oh, what is it, Mr.

522
00:32:22.003 --> 00:32:23.546
Without Yuki’s permission

523
00:32:24.047 --> 00:32:25.632
No one can get out!

524
00:32:36.518 --> 00:32:38.186
Oh my

525
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:39.521
Are you really weak?

526
00:32:45.193 --> 00:32:46.986
I had high expectations since it was the same nine-tailed fox.

527
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.113
It's no big deal, right?

528
00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:50.073
We don't need to use our talents

529
00:32:50.657 --> 00:32:51.700
play with me

530
00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:01.501
boss

531
00:33:14.055 --> 00:33:16.099
Oh, sir, are you okay?

532
00:33:16.182 --> 00:33:17.475
yes?

533
00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:31.823
Hey, this...

534
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.305
- Boss!
- Don't come!

535
00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:57.807
Don't come and protect her

536
00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:43.853
How did you get along with that nine-tailed tiger?

537
00:34:43.937 --> 00:34:45.480
You two are brothers, right?

538
00:34:45.563 --> 00:34:47.106
I have an older brother too, right?

539
00:34:47.482 --> 00:34:48.566
It's Akira

540
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.235
You're much weaker than me

541
00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:52.403
I saved you a few times

542
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:54.531
As I was doing this, this thought occurred to me?

543
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.491
It's annoying

544
00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:58.952
This guy is just
Wouldn’t it be better to be eliminated?

545
00:35:00.662 --> 00:35:01.996
I didn't say anything

546
00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:05.041
I guess your brother thinks the same way?

547
00:35:05.124 --> 00:35:06.251
Then

548
00:35:06.584 --> 00:35:07.836
So it's half?

549
00:35:08.336 --> 00:35:12.549
A bastard who is neither a nine-tailed fox nor a human being

550
00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:13.800
illegitimate child

551
00:35:13.883 --> 00:35:15.468
Isn’t this an illegitimate child born to a fox?

552
00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:16.845
Kill it!

553
00:35:17.428 --> 00:35:19.722
asleep! Kill it!

554
00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:24.519
you should never have been born

555
00:35:24.811 --> 00:35:26.396
To remove you from my stomach

556
00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:28.022
There's nothing I haven't done before.

557
00:35:28.398 --> 00:35:29.440
you

558
00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:32.193
It's a monster

559
00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:33.862
baby

560
00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:44.247
No, no, no.
Jae-yu, Jae-yu

561
00:35:46.249 --> 00:35:47.750
Even without me

562
00:35:49.127 --> 00:35:51.087
You can't walk around with something like this buried in your face.

563
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.381
No way

564
00:35:54.048 --> 00:35:55.842
No, Jaeyu.

565
00:35:56.759 --> 00:35:59.721
It was an honor to serve you.

566
00:36:02.348 --> 00:36:04.517
To us who have been abandoned by the world

567
00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:07.562
What a great comfort it was from the boss.

568
00:36:18.531 --> 00:36:20.408
Are you alone?

569
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:21.659
Do you want to come with me?

570
00:36:24.454 --> 00:36:26.205
Don’t do this, Jaeyu.

571
00:36:26.915 --> 00:36:28.958
Don't leave me behind, okay?

572
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.668
already

573
00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:33.880
Blood, I shed so much blood

574
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:35.840
no, you

575
00:36:35.924 --> 00:36:36.925
until you die

576
00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:38.259
Are you saying you will only serve me?

577
00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.429
You are what I tell you to do
You said you'd do anything

578
00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:43.806
So wake up, wake up!

579
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:50.730
To our boss
Don't talk nonsense!

580
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.275
Oh my gosh

581
00:37:05.078 --> 00:37:06.371
don't look

582
00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:28.101
Oh no

583
00:37:29.894 --> 00:37:31.062
die

584
00:37:32.313 --> 00:37:33.856
Die!

585
00:37:38.403 --> 00:37:39.570
no

586
00:37:40.947 --> 00:37:42.532
No matter how half

587
00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:44.283
you are definitely my sister

588
00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:45.785
It's a decent nine-tailed fox family.

589
00:37:46.327 --> 00:37:47.870
If you have to fight for your life

590
00:37:48.287 --> 00:37:49.622
believe in yourself

591
00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:52.709
like i trust you

592
00:37:53.543 --> 00:37:54.794
I can't do it

593
00:37:57.922 --> 00:37:59.173
Oh my gosh

594
00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:00.550
Get it over with!

595
00:38:04.137 --> 00:38:05.722
Langa

596
00:38:35.084 --> 00:38:36.169
two eyes

597
00:38:36.878 --> 00:38:38.087
Has everything changed?

598
00:39:12.163 --> 00:39:14.207
Once upon a time, my father
I've said this before

599
00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:16.542
I have a younger brother

600
00:39:17.502 --> 00:39:20.588
That guy will me someday
I might jump over it.

601
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:46.823
OMG!

602
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.346
half-hearted

603
00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:12.390
On the topic...

604
00:40:17.645 --> 00:40:18.813
I

605
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:22.733
It's a nine-tailed fox

606
00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:34.370
boss

607
00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:38.332
boss

608
00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:39.750
Are you okay? yes?

609
00:40:40.168 --> 00:40:41.627
- boss
- Let's go

610
00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:44.922
Oh, I lived

611
00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:47.049
I lived

612
00:40:47.133 --> 00:40:48.551
I lived

613
00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:06.485
Someone's whistling in my ear

614
00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:11.949
Oh, it's so noisy, I'll have to kill them all.

615
00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:37.433
The real Lee Yeon appears

616
00:41:38.351 --> 00:41:40.019
Ah, Mr.

617
00:41:42.355 --> 00:41:43.814
Jaeyoo Yoo

618
00:41:44.523 --> 00:41:46.067
This is an order, wake up!

619
00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:48.861
wake up and go home

620
00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:53.324
Home...

621
00:41:55.368 --> 00:41:56.869
Born as a stray dog

622
00:41:58.037 --> 00:42:00.248
It was our first house.

623
00:42:02.124 --> 00:42:03.376
Now

624
00:42:05.461 --> 00:42:07.046
There's no way back

625
00:42:07.588 --> 00:42:09.090
Jaeyuya

626
00:42:09.882 --> 00:42:10.925
how

627
00:42:11.342 --> 00:42:13.427
How can you do this to me?

628
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.056
Are you crying?

629
00:42:21.435 --> 00:42:22.812
Oh my, are you crying so much?

630
00:42:25.022 --> 00:42:26.023
It's been a while

631
00:42:26.857 --> 00:42:27.942
I guess everything is dying

632
00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:29.819
Go away

633
00:42:29.902 --> 00:42:32.071
Ah, I meant to give you something nice.

634
00:42:32.446 --> 00:42:33.572
Don't hate it

635
00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:38.619
I made a bet with Beodeulryeong.
Did you get it the hard way?

636
00:42:41.497 --> 00:42:42.623
Willow spirit?

637
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.584
No way...

638
00:42:46.002 --> 00:42:47.211
bloodsucking flower

639
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:07.732
Everyone
Please take a seat

640
00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:14.238
From now on, Kato Ryuhei
Director of Police Affairs, Japanese Government General of Korea

641
00:43:14.322 --> 00:43:17.491
Ms. Kinko Tawara
Let's start the wedding

642
00:43:20.786 --> 00:43:22.288
groom entrance

643
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.887
bride entrance

644
00:44:11.837 --> 00:44:15.925
In the following order:
I would like to offer congratulations from His Excellency the Governor-General.

645
00:44:32.233 --> 00:44:36.362
This marriage
It is a symbol of unity

646
00:44:36.946 --> 00:44:39.532
As the Director of Police Affairs at the Government General

647
00:44:39.615 --> 00:44:42.910
Taking the lead in maintaining public order in Joseon

648
00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:44.620
Ryuhei Kato

649
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:50.709
And he donated two airplanes.

650
00:44:50.793 --> 00:44:52.878
daughter of a patriot family

651
00:44:52.962 --> 00:44:55.005
Miss Tawara Kinko

652
00:44:55.089 --> 00:44:58.634
This marriage is called Shindonga Construction.

653
00:44:58.717 --> 00:45:02.721
To complete the great work
I hope it becomes a foundation

654
00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:06.559
the marriage of two people
We sincerely congratulate you.

655
00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:09.395
- In the next order...
- Wait.

656
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.564
- 'Eh'?
- Can I also say something?

657
00:45:16.485 --> 00:45:19.405
who came to this wedding
Thank you to all the guests

658
00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:22.324
Thanks to you, I
There is no need to visit me anymore.

659
00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:24.243
What are you doing?

660
00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:27.788
May you rest in peace in advance.

661
00:45:28.372 --> 00:45:31.667
Coincidentally, this place
It will be your grave

662
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.211
long nose

663
00:45:37.715 --> 00:45:38.716
Hey

664
00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:40.217
What are you?

665
00:45:41.427 --> 00:45:42.511
me?

666
00:46:01.572 --> 00:46:02.615
me?

667
00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:04.408
The last mountain god of Joseon

668
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.256
Protect His Excellency the Governor!

669
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.217
Protect His Excellency the Governor!

670
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.343
This way!

671
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.439
It's a surprise attack!

672
00:46:36.148 --> 00:46:38.651
It's been a while
Jiri Mountain Transforms into a Crazy Fox

673
00:46:49.954 --> 00:46:50.955
Bring it quickly!

674
00:46:51.372 --> 00:46:52.831
- Bring them quickly!
- Close it, close it quickly!

675
00:46:52.915 --> 00:46:54.041
Go right up!

676
00:47:32.037 --> 00:47:33.038
why

677
00:47:33.122 --> 00:47:35.207
Why fight against the Empire?

678
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:37.668
Well, maybe it's some kind of example?

679
00:47:38.627 --> 00:47:40.337
To you guys
I think I should show it to you

680
00:47:41.422 --> 00:47:42.590
we are

681
00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:44.842
That I will fight until the end

682
00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:58.308
long nose

683
00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:01.687
kill the author
I...

684
00:50:15.075 --> 00:50:16.201
Tawara Ginko

685
00:50:17.703 --> 00:50:20.789
Born in Joseon as the daughter of Lee Tawara Sho.

686
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.625
you could be anything

687
00:50:24.918 --> 00:50:26.128
But why...

688
00:50:26.211 --> 00:50:27.463
It could have been anything.

689
00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:29.798
first female newspaper reporter

690
00:50:30.132 --> 00:50:31.383
The owner of this peninsula hotel

691
00:50:31.717 --> 00:50:32.843
or gold mining conglomerate

692
00:50:33.427 --> 00:50:34.428
But dad

693
00:50:36.388 --> 00:50:37.931
I decided to become an independence activist

694
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.934
Come, not Ginko.

695
00:50:41.518 --> 00:50:42.561
Sunwoo Eun-ho

696
00:50:44.021 --> 00:50:46.398
I was given it by my father
I really like that name

697
00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:04.541
You are not my daughter!

698
00:51:09.046 --> 00:51:10.297
Avoid it, Eunho.

699
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.757
I'm about to explode a bomb

700
00:51:25.312 --> 00:51:26.814
Your Excellency
Murdered!

701
00:51:28.023 --> 00:51:29.316
I'm not

702
00:51:30.943 --> 00:51:31.985
No, I'm not...

703
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:16.405
Hey, let's stop here, okay?

704
00:52:16.488 --> 00:52:18.282
I have an important appointment at 7 o'clock

705
00:52:22.828 --> 00:52:23.871
Are you laughing?

706
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.083
So I have something prepared for you

707
00:52:33.881 --> 00:52:35.007
Huh?

708
00:52:35.465 --> 00:52:37.467
Are you looking for this?

709
00:52:45.142 --> 00:52:46.310
Oh shit

710
00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:58.614
Fortunately, it barely touched me

711
00:52:58.697 --> 00:52:59.823
Run straight to the hospital

712
00:53:03.994 --> 00:53:04.995
us

713
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:06.330
We can't meet again, right?

714
00:53:10.959 --> 00:53:11.960
in the future

715
00:53:12.669 --> 00:53:13.754
The name is Seonwoo Eunho.

716
00:53:13.837 --> 00:53:15.422
Maybe no one remembers

717
00:53:17.257 --> 00:53:18.383
But I can't forget

718
00:53:20.761 --> 00:53:22.262
how hard you fought

719
00:53:28.602 --> 00:53:29.603
That's enough

720
00:53:33.565 --> 00:53:34.566
It was nice to meet you

721
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.817
comrade

722
00:53:39.363 --> 00:53:41.031
Me too, comrade

723
00:53:55.003 --> 00:53:56.129
Wow

724
00:53:58.215 --> 00:53:59.591
Ah, why did you blow it up...

725
00:54:00.676 --> 00:54:02.135
IC

726
00:54:25.325 --> 00:54:27.411
Hey, these are expensive clothes, really.

727
00:54:53.186 --> 00:54:56.148
Will Joseon change just because you go on a rampage?

728
00:54:58.358 --> 00:55:02.320
They say they'll catch me alone
Do you think this country will ever become independent?

729
00:55:03.071 --> 00:55:04.197
I

730
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.783
Can I give you a spoiler?

731
00:55:07.784 --> 00:55:08.785
exactly

732
00:55:09.619 --> 00:55:12.330
August 15, 1945

733
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:17.002
Japan was defeated in the war

734
00:55:17.878 --> 00:55:19.379
we become independent

735
00:55:21.339 --> 00:55:22.632
Then you guys

736
00:55:23.508 --> 00:55:25.052
In your land for a while

737
00:55:25.343 --> 00:55:26.928
I can't even plant that flag

738
00:55:27.387 --> 00:55:28.680
I can't even sing the national anthem

739
00:55:29.389 --> 00:55:30.390
What?

740
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.450
Nevertheless

741
00:55:50.994 --> 00:55:52.579
you can't see the future

742
00:55:53.705 --> 00:55:54.998
Do you know why?

743
00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.793
I die here today

744
00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:02.172
in my hand

745
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.902
Baby, with that body
Where are you going now? boss

746
00:56:24.194 --> 00:56:25.487
I have something to say to Lee Yeon.

747
00:56:25.987 --> 00:56:26.988
I'm so happy

748
00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:34.037
At this point

749
00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:35.997
We have to end it too

750
00:56:58.603 --> 00:56:59.896
The owner of this land

751
00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:02.357
not you guys

752
00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:04.151
dare

753
00:57:05.318 --> 00:57:07.487
Joseon's mountain god...

754
00:57:29.467 --> 00:57:31.553
Oh my, it stings

755
00:57:32.804 --> 00:57:34.097
Oh, wait, wait, wait

756
00:57:35.557 --> 00:57:38.560
Ah, well, all at once like this
Isn't there anything that comes easy?

757
00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:46.735
There's something you don't know

758
00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:48.987
The mountain god of this land

759
00:57:49.196 --> 00:57:50.488
I'm not alone

760
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:08.632
Everyone

761
00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.426
I'm feeling really crappy today.

762
00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:12.844
That's why

763
00:58:13.345 --> 00:58:14.888
Not a single one gets out alive.

764
00:58:18.475 --> 00:58:19.809
Lee Yeon, hurry up!

765
00:58:20.143 --> 00:58:21.686
- Uh
- Go

766
00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:23.939
- Leave this to me.
- What about the kids?

767
00:58:24.397 --> 00:58:25.440
Everyone is safe

768
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:26.691
Your younger brother too

769
00:58:29.486 --> 00:58:30.487
Going

770
00:58:31.363 --> 00:58:32.405
goodbye

771
00:58:33.615 --> 00:58:35.533
Thanks to you, I decided what name to live by.

772
00:58:36.493 --> 00:58:37.827
Western Mountain God Ryu Hongju

773
00:58:39.746 --> 00:58:40.997
Than the president of Myoyeonggak

774
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:42.332
That suits me better

775
00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:49.589
I'll miss you

776
00:58:49.965 --> 00:58:50.966
Leeyeon

777
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:55.011
thank you

778
00:58:57.514 --> 00:58:58.556
Go quickly

779
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:19.828
uh?

780
00:59:21.496 --> 00:59:22.539
What are you doing?

781
00:59:22.747 --> 00:59:24.165
- The engine won't start.
- IC

782
00:59:24.249 --> 00:59:25.834
Let's go!

783
00:59:29.587 --> 00:59:31.298
Hey, hey, I don't have time

784
00:59:31.381 --> 00:59:32.924
Please hurry

785
00:59:33.008 --> 00:59:34.009
Hang on, please, Mr.

786
00:59:36.845 --> 00:59:37.846
shoot

787
00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:39.097
Wow

788
00:59:46.396 --> 00:59:48.982
The lunar eclipse is coming to an end soon.
Why aren't you coming?

789
00:59:49.691 --> 00:59:50.900
Yeon will come

790
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.987
I keep getting a bad feeling

791
00:59:55.238 --> 00:59:57.240
Where did the first mountain god disappear?

792
00:59:58.199 --> 00:59:59.200
Stop it now

793
00:59:59.284 --> 01:00:00.910
It's out of your hands

794
01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:02.787
If you don't want to lose not only your clairvoyance but also yourself

795
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:03.872
please stop

796
01:00:04.372 --> 01:00:05.415
you are hurt

797
01:00:16.176 --> 01:00:17.177
Go quickly!

798
01:00:31.483 --> 01:00:32.734
Am I too late?

799
01:00:32.817 --> 01:00:33.860
no

800
01:00:33.943 --> 01:00:35.403
Very precise timing.

801
01:00:36.905 --> 01:00:37.906
Muyoungah

802
01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:40.658
Muyoungah

803
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:42.535
Muyoungah

804
01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:51.294
The god of contempt
You came to keep your promise

805
01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:55.965
Maybe

806
01:00:58.927 --> 01:01:00.011
Can you save me?

807
01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:03.640
The soul hasn't left this world yet.

808
01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:06.434
Shall I call you?

809
01:01:09.938 --> 01:01:10.980
what?

810
01:01:11.564 --> 01:01:13.024
Save your wishes

811
01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:15.068
you are still

812
01:01:15.652 --> 01:01:17.070
Because you will get lost

813
01:01:23.118 --> 01:01:24.619
Because I will find my way

814
01:01:26.037 --> 01:01:27.205
Please

815
01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:28.456
Shoot!

816
01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:34.838
Go quickly

817
01:01:35.046 --> 01:01:36.131
I'll take charge of this place

818
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.716
Thank you, Mooyoung Cheon

819
01:01:53.273 --> 01:01:54.274
Let me ask you one thing

820
01:01:56.234 --> 01:01:57.235
Why did you save me?

821
01:01:58.361 --> 01:02:00.655
Do you need a reason?
We save each other

822
01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:06.327
We're friends again now

823
01:02:18.756 --> 01:02:19.757
thank you

824
01:02:44.365 --> 01:02:45.742
Quickly

825
01:02:59.547 --> 01:03:01.132
Uh, honey, the kids are here.

826
01:03:01.424 --> 01:03:03.134
You both had a hard time until the end.

827
01:03:03.218 --> 01:03:04.594
- Wow
-Elderly

828
01:03:05.136 --> 01:03:06.304
I was indebted to you a lot

829
01:03:09.057 --> 01:03:11.809
Ah, so
Has Joseon been liberated?

830
01:03:19.275 --> 01:03:20.527
Go

831
01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:23.488
Are your eyes okay?

832
01:03:23.571 --> 01:03:25.073
Do you resent me?

833
01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:28.660
I did a lot of bad things to you and Muyoung.

834
01:03:29.369 --> 01:03:31.913
Ah, I will take care of that resentment.
Grandma is out

835
01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:35.667
Tsk, I didn’t do it because I liked it.
I'm going crazy, even covering up my heart's burden.

836
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.252
Let me ask you just one question

837
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:39.921
I tell you guys

838
01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:41.798
Were you a good parent?

839
01:03:42.715 --> 01:03:43.883
It can't be

840
01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:48.054
But

841
01:03:48.471 --> 01:03:50.431
All three of us really liked Grandma.

842
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:55.979
Hey, it's a kite

843
01:03:56.062 --> 01:03:57.105
Only 2 minutes left

844
01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:07.991
I haven't been able to say hello to Rangi yet.

845
01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:14.747
Lee Yeon, I have to go.

846
01:04:33.933 --> 01:04:35.018
Yiyeon!

847
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:43.735
Langa

848
01:04:46.821 --> 01:04:47.947
This doesn't make sense

849
01:04:49.657 --> 01:04:50.867
i won

850
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.578
Even without you

851
01:04:54.746 --> 01:04:56.414
Now I fight bravely and well

852
01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.584
So I'm really okay

853
01:05:00.543 --> 01:05:02.128
I really want to tell you this

854
01:05:07.592 --> 01:05:08.843
Well done

855
01:05:08.926 --> 01:05:10.261
I knew it would

856
01:05:11.929 --> 01:05:12.930
And this

857
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:16.059
This isn't a big deal

858
01:05:16.601 --> 01:05:18.144
They say it's something that brings good luck

859
01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:21.105
Don't forget me

860
01:05:31.282 --> 01:05:32.408
Of course

861
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.787
He is my one and only younger brother.

862
01:05:37.747 --> 01:05:39.916
I tried to send it to you with a smile, but

863
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:41.918
sorry

864
01:05:44.128 --> 01:05:45.171
the promise

865
01:05:45.254 --> 01:05:47.423
I don't think I can keep it

866
01:05:54.263 --> 01:05:55.390
Are you a kid?

867
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.020
I'll go

868
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:38.224
goodbye

869
01:06:38.933 --> 01:06:39.976
brother

870
01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:47.900
I'll go

871
01:07:17.346 --> 01:07:18.973
Did Yeon arrive safely?

872
01:07:21.684 --> 01:07:22.852
maybe

873
01:07:25.313 --> 01:07:26.564
where are you going?

874
01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.777
Anywhere is good

875
01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:32.987
Hongju: If it's the era you live in

876
01:07:33.863 --> 01:07:34.864
Do you want to go together?

877
01:07:36.949 --> 01:07:37.992
uh

878
01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:42.163
I'd like to

879
01:07:43.873 --> 01:07:46.083
For a while, I was a wandering lawmaker.
To try to live a little

880
01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:49.170
Congressman?

881
01:07:49.378 --> 01:07:50.671
Even at the moment of dying

882
01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:53.674
Hongju, your face is the only thing that lingers in my mind.

883
01:07:54.717 --> 01:07:55.718
So I decided

884
01:07:58.012 --> 01:07:59.138
At least once

885
01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:02.892
Hongju As the Cheon Muyoung you know
I want to live

886
01:08:04.519 --> 01:08:05.686
no one

887
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:06.938
nothing

888
01:08:08.314 --> 01:08:10.691
No need to cut
Until such a world comes

889
01:08:13.277 --> 01:08:14.278
Are you coming back?

890
01:08:15.112 --> 01:08:16.239
Of course

891
01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:20.034
No matter how hard I struggle...

892
01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:21.285
from me

893
01:08:25.456 --> 01:08:26.916
Because you won't go that far

894
01:09:12.587 --> 01:09:13.671
This

895
01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:16.007
Lee Yeon will tell you as she goes.

896
01:09:27.476 --> 01:09:30.271
I learned from my sisters
You embroidered it yourself.

897
01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:57.256
Once upon a time

898
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.967
The dog you loved the most
I've torn it up and eaten it

899
01:10:01.552 --> 01:10:02.720
you that day

900
01:10:02.803 --> 01:10:05.264
I was sore that it took at least 4 weeks for my anterior teeth to come out.

901
01:10:07.016 --> 01:10:10.019
At that time the girl
With a face that only knows itself in the world

902
01:10:10.978 --> 01:10:12.855
To protect me and Muyoung

903
01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:14.899
I often risked my life

904
01:10:16.275 --> 01:10:17.568
It's the same even when you get older

905
01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:22.031
you still have to protect someone
fighting

906
01:10:22.907 --> 01:10:24.951
That's a bit of an eldest daughter complex.

907
01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:27.995
It was quite reassuring from the perspective of the victim.

908
01:10:29.497 --> 01:10:31.123
Thank you so much, Hongju.

909
01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:34.794
Knowing your heart

910
01:10:35.169 --> 01:10:37.546
Please forgive me for being shameless until the end.

911
01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:42.426
at least because of me
I hope you don't get hurt

912
01:10:44.178 --> 01:10:46.263
I enclose this bribe.

913
01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:25.219
Yeon left

914
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.515
It's like an era has come
It seemed like it was gone

915
01:11:31.308 --> 01:11:34.103
Surprisingly, the world hasn't changed much

916
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:36.063
Outside, outside

917
01:11:36.147 --> 01:11:38.274
They say a new governor of Joseon has taken office.

918
01:11:38.607 --> 01:11:40.067
Outside, outside

919
01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.319
Extra, extra!

920
01:11:42.403 --> 01:11:44.447
They say a new governor of Joseon has taken office.

921
01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:46.157
Extra, extra!

922
01:11:49.994 --> 01:11:51.120
What are we?

923
01:11:51.454 --> 01:11:52.747
- Listen carefully.
- Yes

924
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.290
Food shouldn't get cold

925
01:11:54.373 --> 01:11:55.624
- Yes
- Where are you?

926
01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.293
- Chungmuro.
- Chungmuro

927
01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:58.377
Jingogae

928
01:11:58.461 --> 01:11:59.503
- And you?
- Seodaemun

929
01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:00.671
you hand

930
01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:03.299
Let's go!

931
01:12:03.966 --> 01:12:05.885
National delivery!

932
01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:07.261
delivery!

933
01:12:08.387 --> 01:12:09.805
It's us who have changed

934
01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:16.312
here
We will build a Korean school.

935
01:12:21.776 --> 01:12:23.944
Where does it hurt? Let's see

936
01:12:25.446 --> 01:12:26.447
Are you faking it?

937
01:12:26.947 --> 01:12:28.199
I need to spit, spit.

938
01:12:28.282 --> 01:12:29.283
I need to have a sneeze.

939
01:12:29.366 --> 01:12:32.578
- They say I'm faking it, they say I'm faking it
- Oh my, come.

940
01:12:33.079 --> 01:12:34.538
They say I'm faking it

941
01:12:49.053 --> 01:12:50.679
Are you giving it to us as military funds?

942
01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:52.973
All of this?

943
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:56.352
Even when lighting a fire
If you put in large firewood first, the fire will not burn.

944
01:12:56.936 --> 01:12:58.479
There has to be a light

945
01:12:59.647 --> 01:13:00.815
try hard

946
01:13:13.619 --> 01:13:15.037
- one
- one

947
01:13:17.206 --> 01:13:18.499
- two
- two

948
01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:21.210
Huh? boss

949
01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:23.045
Have you been there?

950
01:13:26.173 --> 01:13:27.508
again, one

951
01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:29.051
one

952
01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.471
- two
- two

953
01:13:34.014 --> 01:13:35.432
- three
- three

954
01:13:38.269 --> 01:13:39.603
Yes, mermaid girl

955
01:13:40.396 --> 01:13:42.648
Well, about my family
Did you hear anything?

956
01:13:44.316 --> 01:13:46.485
As for our family, that is.

957
01:13:46.569 --> 01:13:48.529
Among the four great mountain gods,

958
01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:51.657
Who produced this Baekdudaegan Mountain God
As a prestigious family...

959
01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.617
No, you say the same thing several times

960
01:13:56.203 --> 01:13:58.205
I only did it 13 times, shit, oops

961
01:13:58.622 --> 01:13:59.957
Oh, spit it out

962
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.208
- Oh, that
- child

963
01:14:01.292 --> 01:14:02.418
- Well, everything there is...
- child

964
01:14:02.668 --> 01:14:05.921
Myoyeonggak’s new guest quarters are
Struggling with withdrawal symptoms

965
01:14:07.214 --> 01:14:09.508
As if I were repaying a debt from my childhood.

966
01:14:09.592 --> 01:14:11.010
Although I am taking care of my older brother,

967
01:14:11.635 --> 01:14:13.387
It doesn't seem like I particularly dislike it.

968
01:14:19.977 --> 01:14:21.145
Bring me more rice

969
01:14:21.562 --> 01:14:22.646
yes

970
01:14:27.151 --> 01:14:29.195
What should I do, boss, my binge eating has gotten worse.

971
01:14:30.154 --> 01:14:32.364
Lee Yeon is gone and you’re lonely.

972
01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:36.368
yesterday
You slaughtered a cow and ate it.

973
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:43.375
It's because of the shock of heartbreak
Although there were rumors

974
01:14:46.212 --> 01:14:48.005
It would be a mistake to believe so.

975
01:15:16.242 --> 01:15:17.993
That one

976
01:15:18.077 --> 01:15:20.454
Are you the newly appointed Governor-General of Joseon?

977
01:15:29.922 --> 01:15:31.006
Let's step on it

978
01:15:48.524 --> 01:15:49.858
The place you left

979
01:15:50.734 --> 01:15:52.361
You said time passes differently, right?

980
01:15:54.405 --> 01:15:55.489
you are now

981
01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:57.658
What time zone are you walking in?

982
01:15:58.701 --> 01:15:59.785
Yuna

983
01:17:32.002 --> 01:17:33.253
Am I too late?

984
01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:39.968
no

985
01:17:40.636 --> 01:17:41.970
I knew you'd come back

986
01:17:42.846 --> 01:17:44.223
As always

987
01:17:46.308 --> 01:17:47.309
I missed you

988
01:17:48.018 --> 01:17:49.061
Like crazy

989
01:19:24.698 --> 01:19:26.241
This was Joseon?
