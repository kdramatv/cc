﻿1
00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.000
Shinigami mercenary group

2
00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.169
It's five, not four.

3
00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:05.837
So where are you now...

4
00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:09.090
No way

5
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.842
What are you doing?

6
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.552
Let’s go to the captain quickly.

7
00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:15.514
Ah

8
00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.525
The mercenary group is four again.

9
00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.236
The leader is a powerful illusionist

10
00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:33.865
before he joins
If I don't find my body...

11
00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:37.953
let's catch it

12
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.622
Gumiho and the Mountain Gods

13
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.832
What?

14
00:01:42.457 --> 00:01:44.292
- why?
- Ushiuchibo dies

15
00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:45.710
It happened to me too

16
00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:48.046
I only took one treasure.

17
00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:51.633
What would the captain say?

18
00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:55.262
It's scary when the boss is angry

19
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.390
Let's get together first

20
00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:04.813
From now on you guys

21
00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:08.400
Wait a minute

22
00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:09.985
What about guardian stones?

23
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.947
You said you were bullied by those guys?

24
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.240
Did you get robbed?

25
00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:17.117
Shouldn’t I be asking that?
uh?

26
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.451
What happened to my guardian stone? uh?

27
00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:24.499
why? what?

28
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.167
Isn’t the guy who got robbed a fool?

29
00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:28.253
It's you

30
00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.880
Huh?

31
00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:32.549
Give it to me

32
00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.926
- What?
-Give me my treasure.

33
00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.262
Ah, they said catching the mercenary group comes first!

34
00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:38.346
- Where did you put it?
- Hey, hey, hey

35
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.056
- What's wrong with you? Oh, it's mine!
- Give it to me quickly.

36
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.516
- No, it's mine, it's mine.
- Huh? Give it to me quickly

37
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.976
Where are you touching?

38
00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:50.525
Why are they fighting among themselves?

39
00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.402
What do you know?

40
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.321
Nyudo will be in charge of the nine-tailed fox.

41
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:55.405
you are a girl

42
00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:57.741
I'm over there

43
00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.037
I told you it was mine

44
00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:08.919
You came

45
00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.475
What is that again?

46
00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:31.775
Your opponent is me

47
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:34.152
Come

48
00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.654
This one is pretty even too.

49
00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:39.699
Sorry, Yuki is not a playboy!

50
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.167
Yuki-onna

51
00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.461
I already know your talent.

52
00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:24.911
I’m jealous of that guy’s body too

53
00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:44.681
IC

54
00:04:46.016 --> 00:04:47.017
Mr.

55
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.187
Why, why, why, why, why?

56
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.273
Hey, idiot

57
00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:55.066
- I'm Newdo, Newdo.
- Newdo

58
00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:57.068
stay with us

59
00:04:57.444 --> 00:04:58.528
That guy is a nine-tailed fox!

60
00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:01.448
Lie, I'm not stupid!

61
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:03.283
Oh, you fool, you fool

62
00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:08.621
Yuna, cut it down

63
00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:19.799
No way

64
00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:22.635
ice

65
00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:32.729
Yuna

66
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.272
Why you?

67
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.275
It's not Lee Yeon

68
00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:40.278
Shinigami mercenary group Nyudoda

69
00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.016
thank you

70
00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:12.227
Everyone can leave

71
00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:33.206
Enjoy

72
00:06:49.097 --> 00:06:50.849
Why?

73
00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.017
Why isn't it happening?

74
00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:56.146
Please eat it too, quickly.

75
00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.480
You were hurt a lot.

76
00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.607
no need

77
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.109
Eat! kinda

78
00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.778
Only if the boss survives will the wife survive too.

79
00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:06.906
I, Gu Shin-ju
Because you risked your life to protect me

80
00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:09.701
So damn it! Eat some, mr, tsk

81
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.220
Ah, Mr.

82
00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:33.433
please

83
00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:36.227
please wake up

84
00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:44.736
Ah, then

85
00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:47.238
So this is our side?

86
00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:48.573
I told you earlier, Mr.

87
00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:49.657
What?

88
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.035
That Newdo from earlier is a nine-tailed fox?

89
00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:54.162
Yeah, I'm Newdo

90
00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.040
Hongjoo

91
00:07:57.373 --> 00:07:59.500
Muyoung, please hold on just a little longer.

92
00:07:59.584 --> 00:08:01.044
It's 3 to 1, give up

93
00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:03.546
He was pretty strong

94
00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:07.383
Come on

95
00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:08.593
oh

96
00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:20.355
Got it

97
00:08:21.064 --> 00:08:22.065
Got it

98
00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:26.194
i hate you

99
00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:29.614
I’ll especially freeze it to the core of your lungs.

100
00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:02.897
dare

101
00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:05.984
You hurt Yuki!

102
00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:08.319
That guy

103
00:09:08.403 --> 00:09:09.654
How did I make the ice...

104
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.741
Aren’t you fed up?

105
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.410
That can't be possible

106
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.325
It'll take some time

107
00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:57.285
Because my body is not healthy due to the poison,

108
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:18.306
Huh? He uses fire, right?

109
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:19.766
Ah, I want that too

110
00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:21.934
So my trick didn't work, Newdo!

111
00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:23.978
Switch bodies with that guy

112
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:26.564
AC

113
00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:30.818
Before that, let’s destroy this body first.

114
00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:33.279
Kid, it’s a bit of a waste.

115
00:10:36.407 --> 00:10:37.408
Damn it, Mr.

116
00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:41.454
IC

117
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.707
Hurry up, melt down quickly.

118
00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:49.670
No, no, no.

119
00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:58.471
It's now

120
00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:26.499
Ah, how dare you!

121
00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:28.126
I found it

122
00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:29.544
my body

123
00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:34.590
Omg, here we go again, hold on tight

124
00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:40.138
please move

125
00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:45.017
Yuna

126
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:02.827
New way, new way!

127
00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:16.549
Muyoungah

128
00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:17.800
It's okay

129
00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:54.712
Are you awake?

130
00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:56.756
Am I not dead?

131
00:12:57.798 --> 00:13:00.009
In the nick of time, it’s this world

132
00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:04.722
Are you hurt because of me?

133
00:13:05.348 --> 00:13:06.891
In such a mess

134
00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:08.476
That's enough

135
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:11.020
Because you woke up

136
00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:12.605
That's enough

137
00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:20.112
I was scared

138
00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:22.990
I'm afraid I'll never see you again

139
00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:24.575
You promised

140
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.036
I will follow you to the afterlife

141
00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:30.498
I love you

142
00:13:37.046 --> 00:13:38.047
What?

143
00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:41.342
I love you, Ranga

144
00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:02.613
Ah, all three of them are a mess.

145
00:14:04.574 --> 00:14:06.742
Still

146
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.953
we won

147
00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:42.945
I'm back, it's the hotel.

148
00:14:46.657 --> 00:14:48.743
It was a really creepy night

149
00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:52.705
First, go to Myoyeonggak
Let's treat the wound first

150
00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:54.165
Wait a minute

151
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.791
Rangi

152
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.585
I need to check with Rangi first.

153
00:14:57.668 --> 00:14:58.669
Just a moment

154
00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:07.762
All the yakshas have disappeared

155
00:15:09.764 --> 00:15:11.390
Ah, bastard

156
00:15:11.724 --> 00:15:12.808
I knew it would

157
00:15:22.068 --> 00:15:23.903
Huh?

158
00:15:24.362 --> 00:15:25.863
What's for lunch today?

159
00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:34.038
Boss, I got a reservation call.

160
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.207
No guests this week

161
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:38.626
Say you got stabbed by your boss.

162
00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:40.044
Are you a group guest?

163
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.921
organization?

164
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:43.422
How many people?

165
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.841
organization?

166
00:15:46.342 --> 00:15:48.969
♪ The group should get it again ♪

167
00:15:49.387 --> 00:15:50.805
Is that bastard Cheon Muyoung here?

168
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.682
Wow

169
00:15:53.182 --> 00:15:54.684
There was a reason for that

170
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:57.311
What is the situation, freezing to death?
I almost died because of that kid.

171
00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.313
I'll take care of it

172
00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:01.816
Never let me go alive

173
00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:03.943
- Then I won't stay still.
- Uh

174
00:16:06.654 --> 00:16:08.197
Oh, who on earth is this?

175
00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:09.949
- what?
- Yashas

176
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:11.367
The one who swept it away in one go

177
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.829
Oh, there was one more guy.
It was probably him.

178
00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:16.831
Shinigami mercenary leader

179
00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:21.127
Hey, you blood

180
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.461
Huh? IC

181
00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:25.172
Oh, is this an additional wound?

182
00:16:29.677 --> 00:16:30.845
- Ranga
- Huh?

183
00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:35.725
Why don't you have a shadow?

184
00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:38.227
What are you talking about?

185
00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:44.608
The sun is so bright...

186
00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:50.990
Guys

187
00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:53.701
Oh, I'm surprised, why?

188
00:16:53.784 --> 00:16:54.869
Do you guys remember this?

189
00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:56.704
How did we get back to Myoyeonggak?

190
00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:58.247
What are you talking about out of the blue?

191
00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.540
say it!

192
00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:01.000
fight all night

193
00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.918
Back to room 404...

194
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:07.465
Huh? How did you get here?

195
00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:09.258
Why don't I remember anything? uh?

196
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.342
Wait a minute

197
00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:11.594
Be quiet.

198
00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.266
Can you hear me?

199
00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:19.477
this music sound

200
00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:27.526
Why is that, why is it in my room?

201
00:17:28.486 --> 00:17:29.528
It's not Myoyeonggak

202
00:17:30.613 --> 00:17:31.614
What?

203
00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:33.657
us

204
00:17:35.618 --> 00:17:37.286
I'm still in room 404 of the hotel.

205
00:17:58.474 --> 00:17:59.517
IC

206
00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:09.652
- Ah
- Who are you?

207
00:18:17.993 --> 00:18:18.994
hypnotism association

208
00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:22.540
Ah, ah, ah, say it with words, with words
I am the 4th generation reader in our family.

209
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.338
I am the leader of the Shinigami mercenary group.

210
00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:32.550
It's Satori

211
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.638
From now on, you guys

212
00:18:38.013 --> 00:18:40.432
I can't even take a step out of this room

213
00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:43.269
until death

214
00:18:57.116 --> 00:18:58.117
Try it

215
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.368
Oh, before that

216
00:19:00.744 --> 00:19:01.745
your treasure

217
00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:03.622
give it to me

218
00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:05.916
crazy guy

219
00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.167
You're laughing

220
00:19:09.086 --> 00:19:12.172
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

221
00:19:19.388 --> 00:19:20.389
Yuna

222
00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:21.473
Are you crazy?

223
00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:22.766
Nothing to be surprised about

224
00:19:24.727 --> 00:19:25.811
This guy from the beginning

225
00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:27.813
It was under my illusion.

226
00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:32.568
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

227
00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:37.406
Ah, why are you in such a hurry?

228
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.789
- Yuna
- Uh, what is it?

229
00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.126
What have I done?

230
00:19:49.209 --> 00:19:51.921
I woke you up because I had something special to show you.

231
00:19:54.882 --> 00:19:55.883
I have

232
00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:59.845
I hope you guys are at each other's throats.

233
00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:04.558
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

234
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.237
Muyoung, don’t do that, okay?

235
00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.281
Hongju!

236
00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:20.366
No way, huh?

237
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.451
Stop it

238
00:20:22.534 --> 00:20:23.702
It's no use

239
00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:25.913
They've already fallen under my spell.

240
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:27.206
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

241
00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:28.958
‘Ichi, Ni, San’

242
00:20:30.668 --> 00:20:31.919
Guys

243
00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:33.003
please

244
00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:39.343
How do you feel?

245
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:47.101
That sucks.

246
00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:53.941
How can you have this skill?

247
00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:56.402
our mercenary group
You killed two of them, right?

248
00:20:56.485 --> 00:20:57.820
stop

249
00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:00.948
Because I gave you everything, including my treasures.

250
00:21:02.157 --> 00:21:03.617
please stop

251
00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:05.786
good

252
00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:08.288
Joseon's mountain god pleading

253
00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.125
But what can I do?

254
00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:14.795
Not a single one on my battlefield

255
00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:16.755
Have you never been sent alive?

256
00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:27.224
- stop
- Are you surrendering?

257
00:21:28.642 --> 00:21:29.643
no

258
00:21:30.978 --> 00:21:31.979
Long live

259
00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:33.230
What are you saying?

260
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.651
Long live

261
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.321
Long live

262
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.324
crazy

263
00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:46.952
What is it? what are you doing?

264
00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:51.040
Freeze

265
00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:53.167
What are you doing now...

266
00:22:03.469 --> 00:22:04.803
I don't know about you

267
00:22:05.721 --> 00:22:07.931
Gumiho also has similar abilities.

268
00:22:12.686 --> 00:22:14.188
From now on you guys

269
00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:17.941
If I shout three cheers
The guy who appears in front of you is the enemy.

270
00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:19.651
Without even asking

271
00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:21.111
Don't even argue

272
00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:22.863
Do it

273
00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:42.591
Muyoungah

274
00:22:42.674 --> 00:22:44.218
Hongjoo

275
00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:48.680
Never ignore Joseon’s mountain spirit again.

276
00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:51.809
Kid

277
00:22:52.684 --> 00:22:54.103
Drag it to the rooftop and throw it away

278
00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:10.828
Hey

279
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.247
You guys just jump together

280
00:23:13.747 --> 00:23:14.748
yes

281
00:23:21.588 --> 00:23:23.632
What is it? Cheon Moo-young!

282
00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:36.186
hey!

283
00:23:38.272 --> 00:23:41.024
Mr.

284
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.645
At the Peninsula Hotel
Someone died?

285
00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:23.233
How dare someone stay in my hotel...

286
00:24:23.317 --> 00:24:24.943
Um, what about Ginko’s wedding?

287
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.361
honey

288
00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:28.530
Where people died
How do you celebrate it?

289
00:24:30.949 --> 00:24:31.950
I'm fine

290
00:24:35.787 --> 00:24:36.914
The more you do it, the more you have to show it.

291
00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:38.624
‘Bando Hotel is alive and well’

292
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:41.501
‘Our Dawara family
'I'm not shaken'

293
00:24:41.585 --> 00:24:42.920
Well then!

294
00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:45.005
Reporters are blocked

295
00:24:45.088 --> 00:24:46.924
All you have to do is get rid of the body!

296
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.594
Now he seems like my own child

297
00:24:58.477 --> 00:25:02.147
At my wedding
As well as key figures of the Government General

298
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:05.025
Known as the noblest of Joseon
All pro-Japanese people will attend.

299
00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:07.152
Are you really having a wedding?

300
00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:11.657
Gather them all in one place

301
00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:13.116
Pang

302
00:25:14.534 --> 00:25:15.786
I'm blowing it away

303
00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:45.691
Here is the custom suit
They say it’s the best in Gyeongseong.

304
00:25:46.942 --> 00:25:48.277
Business is over

305
00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:52.072
Do you know who I am?

306
00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:55.200
My bride is a regular here.

307
00:25:55.534 --> 00:25:56.660
Tawara Ginko

308
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.371
Ah

309
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:01.873
I heard a lot of words

310
00:26:02.165 --> 00:26:04.167
The wedding is this Sunday, right?

311
00:26:04.626 --> 00:26:05.794
I'm trying to fit into some formal clothes.

312
00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:09.339
It's an honor

313
00:26:10.132 --> 00:26:12.718
She’s such an attractive woman, right? long nose

314
00:26:14.386 --> 00:26:16.013
Where is it like that
Did you like it?

315
00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:18.598
Even if I step on it, it burns even if I step on it

316
00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:20.934
You look just like a Joseon girl

317
00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:23.854
From the perspective of stepping on

318
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:26.523
And it's so thrilling

319
00:26:28.775 --> 00:26:30.694
That's why I really like Joseon

320
00:26:35.282 --> 00:26:36.283
laugh a little

321
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.081
Smile

322
00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:48.420
Gyeongseong 4th Branch of the Liberation Volunteer Corps

323
00:26:48.503 --> 00:26:49.755
Right?

324
00:26:52.382 --> 00:26:54.259
entering Manchuria
Most of the military funds

325
00:26:54.593 --> 00:26:56.470
moving through you

326
00:26:58.764 --> 00:26:59.765
Why are you so surprised?

327
00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:03.643
As of today, branches 1, 2, and 3 have disappeared.

328
00:27:04.936 --> 00:27:07.272
All members of the organization were killed

329
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.741
But

330
00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.660
Why did they leave it here?

331
00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:27.501
If you want to kill me, kill me

332
00:27:27.584 --> 00:27:28.877
um

333
00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:32.756
That's not fun.

334
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.968
tell my bride

335
00:27:37.803 --> 00:27:38.804
dare

336
00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:42.224
Don't have any hope

337
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:44.142
I

338
00:27:44.518 --> 00:27:45.936
I know everything

339
00:27:50.524 --> 00:27:51.733
Please take care of your formal clothes.

340
00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:53.902
It's so loud

341
00:28:07.457 --> 00:28:08.500
“Oriental Theater”

342
00:28:14.172 --> 00:28:15.257
child

343
00:28:15.966 --> 00:28:17.759
- The movie wasn't that good, was it?
- Yes

344
00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:20.011
Still outside like this

345
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.265
Going on a date
How long has it been? Has it been 300 years?

346
00:28:23.348 --> 00:28:24.516
- Honey
- Huh?

347
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.977
I ate last time
Um, can you buy me some shaved ice?

348
00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:28.437
- Shaved ice?
- Yes

349
00:28:28.812 --> 00:28:30.605
Okay, just wait a moment.

350
00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:32.107
Yeah

351
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.381
I have to go

352
00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.758
I have to go to my brother.

353
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:03.847
Muyoung!

354
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:06.641
Muyoung! Hey, Muyoung!

355
00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:08.268
Come to your senses
uh?

356
00:29:08.685 --> 00:29:10.645
Muyoung, Muyoung!

357
00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:15.025
It was the Great King who looked after Cheon Mu-young, right?

358
00:29:15.108 --> 00:29:16.193
Uh huh

359
00:29:16.568 --> 00:29:17.861
Looking after my back

360
00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:20.906
such a political statement
It's not right

361
00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:24.034
I was just doing business purely.

362
00:29:24.367 --> 00:29:25.619
business, um

363
00:29:25.702 --> 00:29:26.703
Shut up!

364
00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:28.705
'Shut up...'

365
00:29:29.372 --> 00:29:31.958
You idiot, shut your mouth!

366
00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:34.753
There is definitely a seniority order in the afterlife!

367
00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:37.088
Then

368
00:29:38.423 --> 00:29:40.425
I have to slander King Yeomra.

369
00:29:40.926 --> 00:29:42.135
Don't brag!

370
00:29:44.054 --> 00:29:47.307
I'm really pure, huh?

371
00:29:50.644 --> 00:29:51.645
Pure?

372
00:29:51.728 --> 00:29:54.356
Isn’t the world such a mess these days?

373
00:29:54.689 --> 00:29:56.149
The innocent dead
How excited are you?

374
00:29:56.233 --> 00:29:57.901
It's like this

375
00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:00.403
Even if it turns over once

376
00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:02.030
It won't be bad

377
00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:06.117
the world

378
00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:07.577
Flip it over?

379
00:30:11.373 --> 00:30:12.374
Muyoung

380
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.585
What is the reason you came to this era?

381
00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:17.087
You too

382
00:30:18.004 --> 00:30:19.130
Isn’t there something you can point out?

383
00:30:21.258 --> 00:30:22.259
He is

384
00:30:23.093 --> 00:30:26.555
He died, I saw it with my own eyes

385
00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:37.190
Who are you?

386
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.443
He was raised like his own child.

387
00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:42.070
Please take care of me

388
00:30:42.153 --> 00:30:44.072
I feel like my body is in good health.

389
00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:47.742
I wonder if I'll have to pay an invoice like this...

390
00:30:48.201 --> 00:30:49.202
Even if it looks like this

391
00:30:49.703 --> 00:30:51.371
They are descendants of tigers from Mt. Baekdu.

392
00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:54.249
It will definitely happen

393
00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:58.461
What does the police chief say?

394
00:30:59.838 --> 00:31:00.839
I'm here to warn you

395
00:31:01.256 --> 00:31:03.258
He says he knows everything

396
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.342
What about bombs?

397
00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:05.635
I wasn't caught

398
00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:07.721
I'm anxious

399
00:31:08.597 --> 00:31:10.390
Wouldn't it be better to change your plans?

400
00:31:10.724 --> 00:31:12.851
No, this is your only chance.

401
00:31:13.184 --> 00:31:14.185
I have to push

402
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:16.730
The organization is disintegrating, you can't do it alone.

403
00:31:18.565 --> 00:31:19.566
Isn’t there one?

404
00:31:21.318 --> 00:31:23.153
The perfect support group for this job

405
00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:25.905
You're so colorful

406
00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:27.657
In a time travel of about a month

407
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:29.534
How many times are you going to face death?

408
00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:35.206
Excuse me

409
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.084
Marriage?

410
00:31:38.668 --> 00:31:39.961
I know what that guy is

411
00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:41.838
I know, I know I'm not human

412
00:31:42.297 --> 00:31:43.381
Why on earth do you know?

413
00:31:43.465 --> 00:31:45.967
I'm going to set off a bomb at my wedding.

414
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:47.302
Then what about Eunho?

415
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.305
Since the start of volunteer activities
I'm prepared for that much

416
00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:52.724
No, well, women who look like this
Is life all or is it all?

417
00:31:53.183 --> 00:31:54.851
Eun-ho, let’s say he sacrifices his life.

418
00:31:55.143 --> 00:31:56.645
But would a monster that size die from a bomb?

419
00:31:56.728 --> 00:31:57.729
So

420
00:31:58.063 --> 00:31:59.147
I need you, my lord

421
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.231
When is the wedding?

422
00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:01.858
This Sunday at 6pm

423
00:32:02.776 --> 00:32:04.653
Some guy's wedding is being held at night?

424
00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:08.073
The Governor-General completed his inspection of Gyeonggi Province.
I'm going to attend the wedding.

425
00:32:09.949 --> 00:32:11.326
Wait, if it's Sunday

426
00:32:12.077 --> 00:32:13.078
two days later

427
00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:14.663
Is it a lunar eclipse that day?

428
00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:16.956
- A lunar eclipse?
- Mr. Eunho

429
00:32:17.248 --> 00:32:18.792
Sorry, I can't go that day.

430
00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:21.586
I want to go

431
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:26.007
- Lee Yeon
- I don't know what we did since ancient times.

432
00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:29.511
Congratulations and condolences are like swords to each other.
Aren’t we the kind of people who take care of each other?

433
00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:31.680
- huh?
- You are also involved in Gusinju’s independence movement.

434
00:32:31.763 --> 00:32:32.764
You said you were against it?

435
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:34.474
- why?
- But I

436
00:32:34.557 --> 00:32:37.018
To your prospective groom
I have some debt that needs to be repaid.

437
00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:38.770
the wedding

438
00:32:40.772 --> 00:32:42.565
I'll make it the funeral home of the century

439
00:32:49.823 --> 00:32:52.283
The Shinigami mercenaries were defeated.

440
00:32:52.826 --> 00:32:54.119
To the nine-tailed fox

441
00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:56.287
What about the treasure?

442
00:32:56.538 --> 00:32:57.539
I missed it

443
00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:02.335
The best talent
I sent five

444
00:33:02.544 --> 00:33:05.046
I missed the nine-tailed fox's head and treasure.

445
00:33:05.588 --> 00:33:06.589
What is a loss?

446
00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:08.258
It's because the mercenaries let down their guard.

447
00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:11.553
Because I think like that
I'm playing with the nine-tailed fox.

448
00:33:13.138 --> 00:33:16.558
- He is very good at trickery.
- No

449
00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:18.852
It's not a trick or anything.

450
00:33:20.812 --> 00:33:25.275
Send the president of Myoyeonggak to me.
From the time we lured the mercenary group to the hotel

451
00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:27.652
He was drawing a picture

452
00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:30.280
A picture that will shake things up

453
00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:32.115
You're overestimating your enemies.

454
00:33:33.199 --> 00:33:34.576
When it comes to war

455
00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:38.329
A guy who knows how to respect others
I'm going to win

456
00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:43.668
If I were a nine-tailed fox

457
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.171
Indeed

458
00:33:47.422 --> 00:33:49.090
How to fight back?

459
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.473
Now we're shaking things up here too.

460
00:34:09.277 --> 00:34:11.362
Hey, my feet are numb.

461
00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:14.032
Hang in there

462
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.035
No, the wedding hall
They said they were going to attack me

463
00:34:17.118 --> 00:34:19.454
Why are you sitting there making dumplings?
Are you going to fight this?

464
00:34:19.954 --> 00:34:21.456
I won't be here in two days

465
00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:24.334
I mean, what are you doing in the meantime?

466
00:34:25.126 --> 00:34:27.045
- My body is still a mess.
- Hey

467
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.756
We ended up fighting until the end.

468
00:34:30.006 --> 00:34:33.176
For a day or so with my one and only younger brother
Can I make some dumplings?

469
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.221
Chi

470
00:34:36.888 --> 00:34:39.557
What kind of guy says goodbye with dumplings?

471
00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:41.976
It's sad

472
00:34:42.685 --> 00:34:43.686
If it's too grandiose

473
00:34:46.314 --> 00:34:47.315
Even without me

474
00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:51.277
I just made dumplings like this
Think about where you went on a trip

475
00:34:55.031 --> 00:34:56.699
I'll live just fine without you

476
00:34:57.909 --> 00:35:01.496
After being together for a month
You're the type that gets really sick of me

477
00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:03.706
I always get into accidents and get hurt.

478
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.166
deceiving me

479
00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:06.626
I don't like you either

480
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.002
I'm not a picky eater

481
00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:09.087
I'm mad at my brother

482
00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:13.049
I set a curfew, but once
I can't see you coming in properly, ah

483
00:35:13.258 --> 00:35:14.259
I have bad sleeping habits

484
00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:16.219
- Picky eater
- drug addict

485
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.934
yes, that's how you do it

486
00:35:26.437 --> 00:35:27.856
If you miss me by any chance

487
00:35:29.357 --> 00:35:31.317
I only remember how much I hate it like now

488
00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:33.820
Because I will too

489
00:35:41.786 --> 00:35:42.787
Let's promise, we

490
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.373
To never cry

491
00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:49.043
See me off with a smile until the end

492
00:35:52.338 --> 00:35:53.339
promise

493
00:35:54.632 --> 00:35:55.633
I'll do it

494
00:35:57.635 --> 00:35:59.554
- Come quickly.
- Oh, I don't like it!

495
00:35:59.637 --> 00:36:01.681
Why don't you wash up like this?
Wash it to get better quickly

496
00:36:01.764 --> 00:36:02.849
- Oh, it stings.
- I washed everything now too.

497
00:36:02.932 --> 00:36:04.726
- It's okay, it's okay, sit down quickly.
- Oh, honey.

498
00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:06.060
- Take off your clothes, kid, it's cold.
- Don't bite yourself.

499
00:36:06.144 --> 00:36:08.062
Don't bite yourself

500
00:36:08.146 --> 00:36:09.522
Wait, hey!

501
00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:11.065
Hey, wash yourself!

502
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.318
Eating for over a thousand years

503
00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:15.486
You play really well, our Lee Yeon.

504
00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:16.863
me

505
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.115
This is the first time I’ve seen our boss smile like that.

506
00:36:21.868 --> 00:36:23.369
- Look at this.
- The day after tomorrow

507
00:36:23.453 --> 00:36:25.246
Are we going to never see each other again?

508
00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:29.834
Yeah

509
00:36:30.418 --> 00:36:31.669
forever and ever

510
00:36:35.423 --> 00:36:36.841
What if you don’t like it?

511
00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:39.427
Hey, Lee, hey!

512
00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.811
Is this still not gone?

513
00:36:50.355 --> 00:36:51.356
uh

514
00:36:52.398 --> 00:36:53.399
That's right

515
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.234
Because you have a pure nature

516
00:36:55.318 --> 00:36:56.986
You'll get lost.

517
00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:02.784
It's finding its way
Hope this helps

518
00:37:03.284 --> 00:37:06.663
I don't know what this is, but it's a gift from God.
Well, isn’t that a good thing?

519
00:37:07.288 --> 00:37:09.415
Give me my gift, cell phone or something

520
00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:10.792
He said he would give it to me if I stayed with him for a month.

521
00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:12.710
Oh my, I forgot.

522
00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:18.257
Tsk, now

523
00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:21.886
But I'll give you this, but I can't use it here.

524
00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:24.555
No batteries, no base stations.

525
00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:26.224
Did you scam me again?

526
00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:29.352
So I have something else prepared

527
00:37:29.644 --> 00:37:30.979
Ta-da

528
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.481
Gold axe?

529
00:37:33.564 --> 00:37:35.775
Hey, what do you think? Look at this, it’s really cool, huh?

530
00:37:36.067 --> 00:37:37.902
If you take it out like this when fighting,

531
00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:39.320
I'm so angry

532
00:37:39.404 --> 00:37:40.488
It’s like a trendsetter and it’s crazy.

533
00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:42.615
Fool, how weak is gold?

534
00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:43.700
It's plating

535
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.744
Ugh

536
00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:48.329
Wow

537
00:37:53.418 --> 00:37:57.547
Hey, just a month ago
I said, ‘If I meet you, I will kill you.’

538
00:38:01.676 --> 00:38:03.344
The world is

539
00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:05.471
That's how they usually stab me in the back.

540
00:38:06.097 --> 00:38:07.390
I worked hard to collect coupons

541
00:38:07.473 --> 00:38:09.600
Chinese restaurant suddenly changes name

542
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:13.146
The stock information my friend told me is
It's such a disaster

543
00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:14.939
What are you saying?

544
00:38:17.942 --> 00:38:19.902
Even if the whole world turns on you

545
00:38:20.319 --> 00:38:21.779
Whether a lover or a family member

546
00:38:22.321 --> 00:38:24.240
As long as there's just one good guy next to me

547
00:38:24.907 --> 00:38:26.242
No one fell down

548
00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:29.162
It means living well.

549
00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:31.998
Be brave even without me

550
00:38:32.582 --> 00:38:33.583
with your mermaid princess

551
00:38:37.503 --> 00:38:39.297
I don't know, I'm going to sleep.

552
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:11.662
It's okay

553
00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:14.999
You'll be okay.

554
00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:41.400
When did you wake up?

555
00:39:42.485 --> 00:39:43.486
just now

556
00:39:47.907 --> 00:39:49.617
now
Does it make you laugh?

557
00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:51.619
The boss came back from the dead.

558
00:39:53.037 --> 00:39:55.081
There is no reward in dying or coming back to life.

559
00:39:57.125 --> 00:39:58.209
I lost my treasure

560
00:39:58.292 --> 00:40:00.128
Is treasure a problem now?

561
00:40:00.586 --> 00:40:02.505
What is it that causes my body to become like this?

562
00:40:05.383 --> 00:40:06.759
I won't die easily

563
00:40:07.093 --> 00:40:09.011
You're holding me back like this

564
00:40:09.095 --> 00:40:10.096
How do I die?

565
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:12.932
promise

566
00:40:13.266 --> 00:40:14.350
I won't get hurt again

567
00:40:16.227 --> 00:40:18.938
I'd rather get hurt
Because I don’t mind dying!

568
00:40:19.021 --> 00:40:20.022
Why die, man?

569
00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:22.400
you are mine

570
00:40:30.408 --> 00:40:32.160
don't cry

571
00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:38.332
When the year comes, let’s take the kids to the hot springs.

572
00:40:44.213 --> 00:40:45.423
Plum Sister

573
00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:49.093
The sisters say they have something to say

574
00:40:51.637 --> 00:40:52.722
Do it yourself first

575
00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:54.849
you do it first

576
00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:56.934
So

577
00:40:57.018 --> 00:41:00.313
Trying to kill that girl in the hotel

578
00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:02.398
My sister pushed me away

579
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.983
sorry

580
00:41:04.066 --> 00:41:05.568
and thank you

581
00:41:06.068 --> 00:41:08.279
Because I didn't tell you,

582
00:41:08.362 --> 00:41:11.282
The sisters said they were too scared.

583
00:41:17.538 --> 00:41:19.165
The world is not easy, is it?

584
00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:22.668
Under our boss, not a person
Seeing all sorts of things

585
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.755
But I'm in your hands
At least I don't want to get blood on my face

586
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:29.842
It's difficult once
It gets easier the second time

587
00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:32.929
My brother said that

588
00:41:38.142 --> 00:41:40.061
sister

589
00:41:42.772 --> 00:41:44.398
Boss, isn’t it medicine? give it

590
00:41:44.649 --> 00:41:46.234
we will do it

591
00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:49.779
I was really indebted to you.

592
00:41:56.118 --> 00:41:58.955
It’s like a bundle of stories.
I won't ask

593
00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:01.040
instead

594
00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:02.750
Can you sell me something?

595
00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:04.627
this store

596
00:42:06.254 --> 00:42:07.546
It's going to go out of business soon.

597
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.175
Business seems to be going well, but why...

598
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.551
like that

599
00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:15.346
It's the era.

600
00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:39.912
Maybe

601
00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:42.915
Can you deliver?

602
00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:48.004
Those are pretty shoes

603
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:51.090
Who sent it?

604
00:42:51.173 --> 00:42:52.717
I won't reveal my name

605
00:42:53.884 --> 00:42:55.803
He asked me to just tell you this.

606
00:42:57.388 --> 00:42:59.015
‘The shoes are expensive and pretty.’

607
00:42:59.473 --> 00:43:02.351
‘It looks just right to pop my toes.’

608
00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:04.937
The path I have walked all my life

609
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.231
It was all on my way to you

610
00:43:08.274 --> 00:43:09.442
my misfortune

611
00:43:12.987 --> 00:43:15.239
I ran away because I was afraid it would spread to you.

612
00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:18.826
I didn't get that far

613
00:43:20.995 --> 00:43:21.996
So Hongjoo.

614
00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:24.498
wear these shoes

615
00:43:25.499 --> 00:43:27.168
By the time the calluses are gone

616
00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:32.381
Please think about me a little too

617
00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:41.599
It fits my feet perfectly.

618
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.478
Didn't you say anything about where you were going?

619
00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:47.480
There wasn't

620
00:43:51.108 --> 00:43:52.109
It's okay

621
00:43:53.194 --> 00:43:54.195
from me

622
00:43:55.696 --> 00:43:57.448
Because you won't go that far

623
00:44:07.458 --> 00:44:08.459
It's delicious too

624
00:44:14.924 --> 00:44:16.425
Ta-da, it’s pretty, right?

625
00:44:18.052 --> 00:44:19.053
Muyoung bought it for me.

626
00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:22.264
Looks like a watermelon from Mudeung Mountain

627
00:44:23.182 --> 00:44:24.183
Do you want to fight?

628
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:27.061
I leave tomorrow

629
00:44:29.814 --> 00:44:30.898
What if I miss the lunar eclipse?

630
00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:32.817
You can't go forever, right?

631
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:36.237
I think I'll just crush the moon

632
00:44:37.905 --> 00:44:40.199
I will go to both sides of the sky too
I have to go

633
00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:44.829
But is it more calm than you think?

634
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:46.831
I was quickly robbed by Muyoung.

635
00:44:50.042 --> 00:44:51.043
Actually

636
00:44:51.419 --> 00:44:53.295
If I just have the guardian stone, I can go home, right?

637
00:44:54.338 --> 00:44:57.133
I'm going to grab the head of the Governor-General before I go.

638
00:44:57.216 --> 00:44:58.843
Police chief?

639
00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:01.345
Let's do it together

640
00:45:04.265 --> 00:45:06.142
I'm the only one who lived through these times

641
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:08.686
you were on drugs

642
00:45:09.145 --> 00:45:10.438
Muyoung turned into a stone.

643
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.981
I

644
00:45:12.982 --> 00:45:13.983
Do you think you haven't fought?

645
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.321
They must have fought

646
00:45:20.489 --> 00:45:21.740
To die alone

647
00:45:22.241 --> 00:45:24.201
No matter how hard I struggle, they

648
00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:27.580
Regardless of whether it is an animal or a human
Going hunting

649
00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:29.874
Blood flows like a river in the mountains and streams of Joseon

650
00:45:32.293 --> 00:45:33.419
Nothing has changed

651
00:45:38.007 --> 00:45:39.008
Hongjoo

652
00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:41.093
i know the future

653
00:45:42.303 --> 00:45:43.554
What happens to Joseon?

654
00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.559
I'm dying of curiosity, so don't tell me

655
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.604
Because I hate foul play

656
00:45:54.398 --> 00:45:57.693
Well, no matter what I do
Will the future be much different?

657
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.571
Still I

658
00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:02.823
right now in my place

659
00:46:03.282 --> 00:46:04.867
I'll do what I can

660
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.496
As the last mountain god of Joseon

661
00:46:10.164 --> 00:46:11.499
I want to shake together

662
00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:14.335
you leave

663
00:46:15.753 --> 00:46:16.754
What's left is me

664
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.341
Take me out

665
00:46:35.147 --> 00:46:36.232
-The eyebrows...
- Are you okay?

666
00:46:36.315 --> 00:46:37.358
- Boy, really.
- Look, look.

667
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:39.151
What are you two doing again?

668
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:45.741
Oh my, who is this handsome guy?

669
00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:50.079
Remember, men break up first
Second is fashion, third is these eyebrows.

670
00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:54.083
You are a very sophisticated man from the future.

671
00:46:56.043 --> 00:46:57.044
But

672
00:46:57.127 --> 00:46:59.922
After you go
Who trims my eyebrows?

673
00:47:00.256 --> 00:47:03.425
I'm in that world
Miyeon, I will definitely find you

674
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:06.095
We're friends

675
00:47:09.265 --> 00:47:10.391
This is really...

676
00:47:11.141 --> 00:47:12.351
Hey Jindo dog

677
00:47:13.644 --> 00:47:14.645
Where are you going?

678
00:47:14.979 --> 00:47:16.313
I'm going to buy seolleongtang for the boss.

679
00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:20.859
Have a glass of sikhye and go.

680
00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:24.113
thank you

681
00:47:25.573 --> 00:47:26.782
Boss, you like it, right?

682
00:47:30.244 --> 00:47:31.412
Am I right?

683
00:47:31.495 --> 00:47:34.957
Somehow in the morning
The boss was crying loudly in his room.

684
00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:37.918
Oh, that, that
Well, you misheard that.

685
00:47:38.002 --> 00:47:40.588
I also open my ears like this
I heard it clearly

686
00:47:40.713 --> 00:47:42.965
Oh, it's not really

687
00:47:56.687 --> 00:47:57.688
brother

688
00:48:06.822 --> 00:48:07.823
What about the treasure?

689
00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:13.704
Are you asking that first? regretfully

690
00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:20.502
Are you hurt a lot?

691
00:48:24.923 --> 00:48:26.050
It's no big deal

692
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:36.810
But this is all I could find

693
00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:38.479
When I feel better

694
00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:41.774
I'll also bring the guardian stone from Lee Yeon.

695
00:48:41.857 --> 00:48:42.941
When did you leave, Lee Yeon?

696
00:48:43.275 --> 00:48:45.861
- tomorrow
- We don't have time, let's do it now.

697
00:48:46.695 --> 00:48:47.696
Now?

698
00:48:48.572 --> 00:48:50.157
With just this gold chuck?

699
00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:51.617
What if I fail?

700
00:48:51.867 --> 00:48:53.535
It's not your fault

701
00:48:54.078 --> 00:48:55.204
It's my destiny

702
00:49:04.088 --> 00:49:05.089
brother

703
00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:07.341
Please answer just one thing

704
00:49:07.966 --> 00:49:09.760
What do you want to do first when you come back to life?

705
00:49:10.344 --> 00:49:13.263
Muyoung you
What did you come here for?

706
00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:14.640
my dream

707
00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:17.059
With my brother

708
00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:22.815
Living like a normal person

709
00:49:24.483 --> 00:49:25.901
in a normal house

710
00:49:27.277 --> 00:49:28.821
Driving a normal car

711
00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:32.366
What should I eat for lunch tomorrow?
We worry together

712
00:49:36.412 --> 00:49:38.747
With my brother on the weekend
I'm going to the bathroom

713
00:49:40.124 --> 00:49:41.125
really

714
00:49:44.044 --> 00:49:45.838
very very ordinary

715
00:49:47.381 --> 00:49:48.757
like a normal family

716
00:49:54.388 --> 00:49:55.389
So bro

717
00:49:58.225 --> 00:49:59.643
Please come back to me

718
00:50:03.897 --> 00:50:04.898
Don't hesitate

719
00:50:05.357 --> 00:50:06.900
You mean it was stolen?

720
00:50:10.738 --> 00:50:11.864
Oh, tell me honestly

721
00:50:12.573 --> 00:50:13.574
What is this all about?

722
00:50:14.158 --> 00:50:16.076
At this point, I don't think it's a coincidence

723
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.580
I found this guardian stone
Coming to this era

724
00:50:20.247 --> 00:50:23.292
Everything that came into my hands was gold.

725
00:50:47.107 --> 00:50:49.276
What is this? You don't have a face

726
00:50:50.277 --> 00:50:51.278
In the first place

727
00:50:52.863 --> 00:50:55.574
The mountain god was not four, but one.

728
00:50:58.619 --> 00:50:59.620
The first mountain god?

729
00:51:03.582 --> 00:51:06.877
But I like this guy
They say monsters were born in this land?

730
00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:08.420
They say he died at the hands of King Yeomra?

731
00:51:09.463 --> 00:51:10.547
he dies

732
00:51:11.673 --> 00:51:13.550
The great king used that power

733
00:51:13.634 --> 00:51:17.554
Divide it into 4 jewels
They were sealed in different time periods.

734
00:51:18.013 --> 00:51:19.932
The guardian stone and gold scale are also part of it.

735
00:51:22.518 --> 00:51:23.727
So

736
00:51:24.394 --> 00:51:26.563
The guardian stone was in the future I came from

737
00:51:26.897 --> 00:51:28.023
Geumcheok was here?

738
00:51:30.192 --> 00:51:31.193
it is

739
00:51:32.152 --> 00:51:33.946
They shouldn't exist in the same era

740
00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:37.032
like a magnet
Because we attract each other

741
00:51:37.324 --> 00:51:39.284
To become one like the first time

742
00:51:40.244 --> 00:51:42.746
Tsk, I have the guardian stone.
Just go back to the future and that's it

743
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.831
What are you worried about?

744
00:51:43.914 --> 00:51:45.624
The gold chuck that Cheon Mu-young took

745
00:51:46.166 --> 00:51:50.212
Muyeong with a golden chuck
Trying to wake something up

746
00:51:50.796 --> 00:51:52.756
I know, he's my brother.

747
00:52:06.895 --> 00:52:07.896
My brother

748
00:52:09.356 --> 00:52:10.357
No?

749
00:52:13.527 --> 00:52:14.528
If not my brother, who else...

750
00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:18.782
No way

751
00:53:38.111 --> 00:53:40.447
No, Mooyoung.
You can't wake it up!

752
00:53:45.994 --> 00:53:47.120
Then we have to stop it.

753
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:48.372
Why are you just watching?

754
00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:49.873
Now he

755
00:53:50.624 --> 00:53:52.334
Because I'm just an empty vessel

756
00:53:53.043 --> 00:53:54.544
That's the only way

757
00:53:54.878 --> 00:53:56.296
To catch him

758
00:53:57.047 --> 00:53:58.882
We need to wake him up.

759
00:53:59.383 --> 00:54:01.510
What makes something so dangerous, huh?

760
00:54:06.223 --> 00:54:09.393
Because that's my duty to protect this era

761
00:54:09.476 --> 00:54:10.602
Then what about Muyoung?

762
00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:12.020
Who protects him?

763
00:54:12.396 --> 00:54:14.106
It seems like I forget sometimes.

764
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.941
Grandmother

765
00:54:16.775 --> 00:54:18.151
We're not your grandma's chess game

766
00:54:18.902 --> 00:54:19.903
It hurts when you get hurt

767
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.948
To a grandmother who was like a parent to me
When you are abandoned, you get hurt.

768
00:54:23.031 --> 00:54:24.866
The bastard that the old woman turned into stone!

769
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.287
wants to live

770
00:54:29.621 --> 00:54:31.832
Even if I beg for time
He wants to live!

771
00:55:00.152 --> 00:55:01.153
It's a gift

772
00:55:06.074 --> 00:55:07.075
Paper crane?

773
00:55:14.207 --> 00:55:16.376
all one hundred
I closed it while thinking of you

774
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.420
Then they say love will come true

775
00:55:22.966 --> 00:55:23.967
forever

776
00:55:28.805 --> 00:55:30.182
I always just get it

777
00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:35.020
To you too

778
00:55:36.605 --> 00:55:37.731
To Lee Yeon too

779
00:55:48.742 --> 00:55:50.035
Please pack me a bowl of seolleongtang here.

780
00:55:50.452 --> 00:55:51.453
Here too

781
00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:54.498
Give me a bowl each, okay? We do the calculations together

782
00:55:55.665 --> 00:55:57.709
- Boss, it’s been a while.
- Yes

783
00:55:58.001 --> 00:55:59.127
Oh, are you really following me?

784
00:56:00.837 --> 00:56:01.880
But why do I do the calculations?

785
00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.758
i have no money

786
00:56:05.092 --> 00:56:06.551
You were fired from your part-time delivery job at this house.

787
00:56:07.219 --> 00:56:08.512
I don't have either

788
00:56:08.595 --> 00:56:11.973
The leader is a robber and arsonist.
Even pickpocketing is banned

789
00:56:12.766 --> 00:56:13.767
Really

790
00:56:31.118 --> 00:56:32.828
Mr. Jae-yu, would you like to have a bowl too?

791
00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:39.334
I can't because I'm giving it to my boss.

792
00:56:39.709 --> 00:56:40.710
You have to eat it warm.

793
00:56:44.047 --> 00:56:46.216
Ah, that Jindo, the dog, Mr. Lee.

794
00:56:46.758 --> 00:56:48.176
I only know my master

795
00:56:49.094 --> 00:56:51.388
A very passionate woman

796
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:07.404
Oh, no, no, no.

797
00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:19.040
You promised

798
00:57:20.417 --> 00:57:21.418
I'm coming back

799
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:25.589
Why did you promise me?

800
00:57:32.888 --> 00:57:35.265
Why did you leave me alone?

801
00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.729
There's no one next to me anymore

802
00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:45.150
I only have a brother

803
00:57:46.776 --> 00:57:48.528
No, no, no.

804
00:57:48.987 --> 00:57:51.907
No, no, no!

805
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:55.327
no!

806
00:57:57.287 --> 00:57:59.998
No, no, no.

807
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.251
Muyoungah

808
00:58:16.431 --> 00:58:17.432
brother

809
00:58:28.777 --> 00:58:29.778
You did it, bro.

810
00:58:32.864 --> 00:58:34.866
Bro, you did it

811
00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:39.329
We did it, bro.

812
00:58:41.581 --> 00:58:42.582
brother

813
00:58:45.502 --> 00:58:46.711
you did it

814
00:58:46.795 --> 00:58:47.879
Brother, thank you

815
00:58:48.296 --> 00:58:49.381
For coming back

816
00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:52.300
Thanks, bro

817
00:58:53.009 --> 00:58:54.010
For living

818
00:59:12.946 --> 00:59:14.030
Don't die, Cheon Moo-young

819
00:59:14.698 --> 00:59:15.699
Not yet

820
00:59:16.157 --> 00:59:17.158
No way

821
00:59:18.827 --> 00:59:19.828
brother

822
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:22.205
I'm suffocating

823
00:59:23.164 --> 00:59:24.374
not your brother

824
00:59:24.874 --> 00:59:25.875
Huh?

825
00:59:35.802 --> 00:59:38.305
Thank you for your hard work, Northern Mountain God.

826
00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:41.891
Your role ends here.

827
01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:20.972
Doesn’t your body feel strong?

828
01:00:22.932 --> 01:00:24.434
Because my heart stopped

829
01:00:25.852 --> 01:00:26.853
I

830
01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:29.314
What on earth woke me up?

831
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.984
People called me the first mountain god

832
01:00:34.944 --> 01:00:38.615
The reason your brother went crazy
Because of me

833
01:00:38.907 --> 01:00:41.910
How to save my brother
It was I who told you

834
01:00:43.912 --> 01:00:45.538
I had to find my scattered strength

835
01:00:47.707 --> 01:00:49.542
Isn’t it already dark before your eyes?

836
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.628
It's the light of death

837
01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.340
You look good there

838
01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:07.769
Is this the end?

839
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.731
in a place where there is no one

840
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.527
With no one to mourn for

841
01:01:16.986 --> 01:01:18.238
Dying like that

842
01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:20.698
Is it my ending?

843
01:01:22.325 --> 01:01:23.326
ruined

844
01:01:25.745 --> 01:01:27.205
Where did it go wrong?

845
01:01:29.624 --> 01:01:31.626
The Cheon Muyoung you know
What kind of person are you?

846
01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:34.003
You wanted to be a congressman, not a mountain god.

847
01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:37.298
alive and breathing
Because I saved even a single blade of grass

848
01:01:38.049 --> 01:01:39.717
Even though you stood up when you got hurt

849
01:01:40.301 --> 01:01:41.719
If Yeon and I get hurt

850
01:01:42.595 --> 01:01:43.847
I used to cry sadly

851
01:01:47.267 --> 01:01:48.560
We were young then

852
01:01:49.894 --> 01:01:51.229
Because I changed

853
01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:54.107
Ta-da

854
01:01:57.068 --> 01:01:58.069
Still Hongjoo

855
01:02:00.113 --> 01:02:01.114
In the world

856
01:02:02.323 --> 01:02:03.741
There are some things that don't change

857
01:02:07.287 --> 01:02:08.538
I miss you

858
01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:12.792
finally
It's okay just once

859
01:02:32.437 --> 01:02:33.563
I want to live too

860
01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:48.745
Muyoung, Cheon Muyoung!

861
01:02:52.165 --> 01:02:54.125
Hey, can you hear my voice?

862
01:02:54.959 --> 01:02:56.294
Come to your senses, okay?

863
01:02:56.628 --> 01:02:57.629
Muyoungah

864
01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:09.307
Wake up, Cheon Muyoung

865
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:13.061
You have to fight, with me

866
01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:16.356
You couldn't even get revenge on me.

867
01:03:18.274 --> 01:03:19.275
Yeon-i

868
01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:22.362
Why do you feel like crying like this?
Is he making an expression?

869
01:03:27.033 --> 01:03:28.952
Muyoungah

870
01:03:31.955 --> 01:03:32.956
I won't die

871
01:03:34.207 --> 01:03:35.291
you can't die yet

872
01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.380
So don't be harsh
Wake up, you bastard!

873
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:50.181
What should I do! uh?

874
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:52.475
I told you

875
01:03:56.646 --> 01:03:58.064
There were many sins

876
01:03:58.314 --> 01:03:59.440
don't apologize

877
01:03:59.774 --> 01:04:00.858
I won't accept it

878
01:04:02.235 --> 01:04:04.862
If you go like this
What, do you think I will forgive you?

879
01:04:05.113 --> 01:04:06.114
Don't be funny! seed

880
01:04:06.322 --> 01:04:07.323
Hongju

881
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:09.951
protect me

882
01:04:34.517 --> 01:04:35.518
wake up

883
01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:37.979
wake up

884
01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:41.816
don't die

885
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:45.236
Don't die, Muyoung.

886
01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:51.117
don't die

887
01:04:52.285 --> 01:04:53.286
maybe

888
01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:54.370
Muyoungah

889
01:04:54.746 --> 01:04:56.289
Maybe it was there

890
01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.042
my family

891
01:05:00.877 --> 01:05:02.295
my real brother

892
01:05:06.507 --> 01:05:08.593
Park Ga-bun Saiso

893
01:05:08.926 --> 01:05:11.137
I have a pretty norigae

894
01:05:11.596 --> 01:05:14.932
- Park Ga-bun Saiso
- Hold this for a moment.

895
01:05:15.016 --> 01:05:16.017
Where are you going?

896
01:05:16.643 --> 01:05:17.644
I'll be right back

897
01:05:44.087 --> 01:05:45.296
With this

898
01:05:45.838 --> 01:05:47.715
That man is

899
01:05:48.174 --> 01:05:51.219
I'm a kid going on a long journey
What is the strongest?

900
01:05:58.476 --> 01:05:59.519
Langa

901
01:06:01.187 --> 01:06:02.188
Langa!

902
01:06:11.656 --> 01:06:12.657
who are you?

903
01:06:20.415 --> 01:06:23.501
hi?
Mermaid girl who tastes good and is good for you

904
01:06:56.868 --> 01:06:57.869
Muyoungah

905
01:07:54.133 --> 01:07:55.134
Jaeyuya

906
01:07:57.303 --> 01:07:58.304
Jaeyuya

907
01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:07.980
Judging by the amount of blood loss, it is not a fatal wound.

908
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:10.107
I was taken alive

909
01:08:10.191 --> 01:08:11.192
Who did it?

910
01:08:22.787 --> 01:08:23.913
A mercenary group

911
01:08:24.455 --> 01:08:25.456
I'm alive

912
01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:47.019
- Ranga
- It's because of me.

913
01:08:47.687 --> 01:08:49.480
I shouldn't have left you alone

914
01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:51.440
I

915
01:08:51.858 --> 01:08:53.067
I was away

916
01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:56.612
Let go of this, it hurts.

917
01:08:56.988 --> 01:08:58.072
Pathetic, isn’t it?

918
01:08:59.115 --> 01:09:00.783
I can't protect anyone

919
01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:05.413
Neither a human nor a nine-tailed fox, just half a person

920
01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:09.417
Why was I born like this?

921
01:09:10.835 --> 01:09:11.919
Langa, stop

922
01:09:12.879 --> 01:09:13.880
go

923
01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:15.798
You won't be here in a few hours anyway.

924
01:09:15.882 --> 01:09:17.216
How can I go on if you do this?

925
01:09:17.884 --> 01:09:19.468
Don't worry and go

926
01:09:20.636 --> 01:09:22.263
To your house where a human woman is waiting

927
01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.056
from the beginning

928
01:09:25.933 --> 01:09:27.768
There was no one like me in your options.

929
01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:30.646
in my body now
Do you know how many knife marks there are?

930
01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:34.233
I got stabbed so hard that it doesn't even hurt anymore!
But

931
01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:37.778
Even if only a thorn gets stuck in your hand, it hurts me

932
01:09:38.362 --> 01:09:39.822
When I think about leaving you behind

933
01:09:40.281 --> 01:09:41.699
I'm going crazy too

934
01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:48.164
I don't even have a girlfriend

935
01:09:50.333 --> 01:09:51.626
Without you too

936
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.461
I...

937
01:09:57.173 --> 01:09:58.883
I promise

938
01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:00.968
I won't leave you alone

939
01:10:03.346 --> 01:10:04.472
promise

940
01:10:08.017 --> 01:10:09.018

941
01:10:10.519 --> 01:10:11.520

942
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.066
so i can fight

943
01:10:57.566 --> 01:10:59.610
If you don't find the treasure today

944
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.861
hostage dies

945
01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:03.197
He's fighting a battle of brains

946
01:11:03.656 --> 01:11:04.991
Our weakness is time

947
01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:07.535
Save the kids within the time limit

948
01:11:07.618 --> 01:11:09.036
Gotta catch them

949
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.288
Are you really weak?

950
01:11:11.914 --> 01:11:13.290
Jae-yu, Jae-yu!

951
01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:16.252
You're going on a rampage

952
01:11:16.335 --> 01:11:17.962
Will Joseon change?

953
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:19.380
Is this some kind of example?

954
01:11:19.463 --> 01:11:21.257
I will fight until the end

955
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.425
like i trust you

956
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.968

957
01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.137
The owner of this land
