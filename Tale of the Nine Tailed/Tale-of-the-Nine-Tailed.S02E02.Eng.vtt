﻿1
00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:05.504
Where is your hometown?

2
00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:06.880
Is this your first time in Joseon?

3
00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:08.590
How is your family? What about your wife?

4
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.217
아, 배고프다

5
00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:11.635
비켜

6
00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:13.804
개새끼가, 씨

7
00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:16.556
걸리적거려

8
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.026
아, 무지하게 머네

9
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.361
어, 여기

10
00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:51.550
뭘 봐?

11
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.471
Hey, didn't you learn how to live socially?

12
00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:00.433
Okay, cigarettes?

13
00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:02.769
hey!

14
00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:04.896
Where are you smoking now, Lee?
Don't you quit smoking?

15
00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.899
There are kids and dogs here.
Do you want to fight me?

16
00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:09.901
Hey, didn’t you learn how to live socially?

17
00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:12.404
- Turn it off quickly, turn it off quickly.
- Huh?

18
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.785
sorry for yelling

19
00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:24.499
I almost missed the train

20
00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.216
It’s an important day, so please be nice.

21
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.593
yes

22
00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.013
I have to be pretty today

23
00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.599
Oh, be nervous.

24
00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.769
Hmm, it would be pretty, right?

25
00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.289
Ah, Lee Yeon
Where on earth are you? seed

26
00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.583
Ah, leaving me alone in this era
Didn’t you go home alone?

27
00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:13.465
Hey there

28
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:15.800
Where is this train going?

29
00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:16.968
Manchuria

30
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.220
Where is Manchuria?

31
00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:21.056
It's the Gamo unit.

32
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.265
Sit down!

33
00:03:28.063 --> 00:03:29.064
Gamo unit?

34
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:30.607
Where have I heard this before?

35
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.609
Kwantung Army water supply unit

36
00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:35.612
A support unit that supplied water to the military.

37
00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:38.031
So it's not a dangerous place?

38
00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:40.283
lived

39
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.537
Unit 731 in Manchuria?

40
00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:52.837
It's truly beautiful

41
00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:54.589
Maybe

42
00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:56.424
Are you a movie star?

43
00:03:57.842 --> 00:03:59.052
It will be soon

44
00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:03.014
Opened by Sunwoo Ilbo
I'm going to the Miss Joseon pageant.

45
00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:04.891
What is that?

46
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.687
This is an event to select the most beautiful woman in Joseon.

47
00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.109
Now

48
00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:15.360
You eat it too

49
00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:18.446
If you like eggs, what are you doing?

50
00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.414
So

51
00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:30.542
My future self sent you here?

52
00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:33.628
you completed your mission

53
00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:36.631
I was much late than the scheduled time.

54
00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:38.341
my brother was dying

55
00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:39.968
Isn't it your choice?

56
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:43.179
Should I go back or stay here and save my brother?

57
00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:46.641
Let me go, okay?

58
00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:48.560
There's someone waiting for me

59
00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:50.478
Open it or try it

60
00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:57.277
Is there really no way to get home?

61
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.987
What

62
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:00.989
There is a way

63
00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:03.408
There isn't much

64
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.326
What is it?

65
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.745
Run an errand

66
00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:08.788
Then I'll tell you

67
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.335
On the train departing from Busan in the morning

68
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:16.254
Manpasikjeok was featured.

69
00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:21.843
It's like a full moon

70
00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.595
Why did it fall into their hands?

71
00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:26.222
It's even something that was sealed by the undressing faction.

72
00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.682
They say you broke that seal?

73
00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.851
They're not ordinary guys.

74
00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.478
If you play it right

75
00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.189
I could blow up an entire mountain

76
00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:38.151
1 hour to Gyeongseong

77
00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.153
Let’s get down and catch them before they scatter.

78
00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:44.032
It's in the same compartment as us now.

79
00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:47.035
You don’t know who it is?

80
00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:53.041
I see there are 7 Japanese in first class.

81
00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.710
Let's catch them one by one and beat them up.

82
00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:58.379
wait and see

83
00:05:58.755 --> 00:05:59.756
Why?

84
00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:03.009
The tunnel will come out soon

85
00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:05.512
No one came back alive?

86
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:07.555
In Unit 731

87
00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:11.476
please help me

88
00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:13.103
I need to get out of here

89
00:06:13.686 --> 00:06:14.979
I believe this guy

90
00:06:15.063 --> 00:06:16.314
Are you going to risk your life?

91
00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:17.857
I want to go

92
00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:20.485
My mom is very sick.

93
00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:21.945
I want to go too

94
00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.405
I don't want to live as a guest in Manchuria.

95
00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:26.241
Even if I die, I have to die in my hometown.

96
00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:28.409
Are you crazy? Then everything burns to death

97
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.122
All you have to do is open that door.

98
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:33.915
Moonman

99
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.880
Let's go, let's go!

100
00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:50.890
It's a tunnel soon.

101
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:16.791
- Hey, shake it all off!
- what?

102
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.127
what? what? Man, where are you touching!

103
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.628
-Who are you, Mr.
-Give me everything to eat!

104
00:07:20.712 --> 00:07:22.130
Ugh, hey, man

105
00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.257
Hey, Mr. Lee, where are you touching, keep touching me!

106
00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:26.551
Oh my gosh, Mr.!

107
00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.760
Ouch!

108
00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:30.013
It's fire, it's fire
Fire, fire!

109
00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:31.472
It's fire! It's fire!

110
00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.934
Fire, fire!

111
00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:36.019
Get out of the way!

112
00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:37.770
Get out of the way

113
00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:40.481
Now!

114
00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:50.116
Hey, hey, Mr. Lee, hey!

115
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.201
what?

116
00:07:51.284 --> 00:07:52.285
Do, do, thief!

117
00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:53.369
- He's a thief!
- Yayi

118
00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:54.495
- Hey, what is it?
- He's a thief!

119
00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:56.456
Hey, someone keeps touching me here too

120
00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:57.624
- Touch here too, huh?
- Our Boksil

121
00:07:57.707 --> 00:07:58.917
Our Boksil

122
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.043
Boksil!

123
00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:01.294
my bag!

124
00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:02.962
My treasure!

125
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.131
Hey
Someone is touching me here too

126
00:08:05.215 --> 00:08:06.257
Touch here too, huh?

127
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.468
Anyway, who is it? What kind of guy is this really?

128
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:11.846
my diamond ring

129
00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:15.350
Hey
Is this what you kids are like?

130
00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.810
Are you saying you need Manpasikjeok?

131
00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:20.855
It's my reward for saving my life.

132
00:08:21.773 --> 00:08:24.525
Foxes do return the favor.

133
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.110
yes

134
00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:37.205
What are you looking at! Sir, are you not going out?

135
00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:38.289
Get out, Mr.

136
00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:39.415
You guys don’t want to go out right away?

137
00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:41.542
What are you doing bitch? huh?

138
00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:44.712
me?

139
00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:47.632
She's pretty but she's good at fighting

140
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:48.800
Ah

141
00:08:55.014 --> 00:08:57.183
Huh? Don't intervene
I need to relax

142
00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:02.522
It's fun

143
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.565
next you

144
00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:07.777
1st class
I was robbed

145
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.362
- There's a riot in the cargo hold.
- What?

146
00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:11.364
Train blockade!

147
00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:13.616
From now on, no one can get off here.

148
00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:15.201
- Forward to you guys.
- Yes

149
00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:18.079
- You guys follow me.
- 'Hi'

150
00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:23.751
Now, let's go!

151
00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:28.589
Get it!

152
00:09:40.643 --> 00:09:42.854
Looks like I've been framed for robbery
Oh my

153
00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:44.897
Take your pick

154
00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:46.941
Hey, why did you steal that dog? uh?

155
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:49.110
And why is this smelly thing again?

156
00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:52.780
If our kids originally touched it,
I shave it to the point where I can't even remove the bones.

157
00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:54.907
Don't talk like you're proud

158
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:57.952
Uh, sorry, sorry.

159
00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:00.204
Oh, really, Mr.

160
00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:09.088
Hey, let's go, let's go!

161
00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:10.298
Let's go, let's go!

162
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:38.159
Did you hit me?

163
00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:40.870
me in today's world
It's a day that should be the prettiest

164
00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.247
The object belongs to the Empire of Japan.

165
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.374
Isn't it?

166
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:46.250
Is it Hongju’s?

167
00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:10.983
Is it pretty?

168
00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:12.735
Are you not human?

169
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:15.696
A monster that lives as a human
It's not just in Joseon.

170
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.031
Here!

171
00:11:17.115 --> 00:11:18.282
What are you doing you bastard?

172
00:11:24.038 --> 00:11:25.164
It's mine!

173
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.473
Hey, it's not like it's full.

174
00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.434
boss

175
00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:45.977
flute

176
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.228
I lost my flute.

177
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:48.646
What kind of guy are you?

178
00:11:48.729 --> 00:11:49.939
It's me

179
00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:03.703
welcome

180
00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:09.792
What are these?

181
00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:19.302
Long time no see, fox?

182
00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:26.976
No way, no way

183
00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:30.480
Ryu Hong-joo

184
00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:31.981
Why are you here?

185
00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:33.232
I missed you

186
00:12:34.108 --> 00:12:35.735
Have you still forgotten that human woman?

187
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:38.696
Take your hands off my thighs

188
00:12:39.864 --> 00:12:40.948
Are you still cautious?

189
00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:42.575
Are you an ally or an enemy?

190
00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:45.578
She will be your sister-in-law.

191
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:47.413
- Ah, Mr.
- Sister-in-law?

192
00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:49.540
Now stop bouncing and live with me

193
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:51.042
Huh?

194
00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.130
You said you came to look for this?

195
00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:01.344
Yes, Hongju.
I will receive this very gratefully.

196
00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:03.763
But you can't get married

197
00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:04.931
Why not?

198
00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:07.934
This marriage
There must be the consent of the parties

199
00:13:08.017 --> 00:13:09.227
I...

200
00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:12.355
Who are you to reject me?

201
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.607
Buy a dress for today

202
00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.025
I also do my hair

203
00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:17.735
Flowers too

204
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.529
Even the flowers are like this...

205
00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:21.822
But

206
00:13:22.907 --> 00:13:24.033
You embarrassed me

207
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.494
Rang, avoid it.

208
00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.829
Ugh, solve your own girl problems.

209
00:13:29.664 --> 00:13:31.207
Come find my wedding gift

210
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:32.416
yes

211
00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.460
and

212
00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:36.546
you come out

213
00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:54.855
That's right, I, I, I
That guy is him!

214
00:13:54.939 --> 00:13:55.940
That guy, that guy

215
00:14:01.737 --> 00:14:03.489
I was so excited because they wanted to die.

216
00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:04.574
Organize it quickly

217
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:08.828
Lee Yeon

218
00:14:21.757 --> 00:14:23.509
Ooh, ooh, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo

219
00:14:24.427 --> 00:14:25.678
Who is the instigator?

220
00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:28.514
- Please save me
- Blow, you bastard!

221
00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:33.060
No way

222
00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:44.447
It's been a while

223
00:14:44.864 --> 00:14:46.282
The crazy fox of Jiri Mountain

224
00:14:46.907 --> 00:14:48.034
appeared

225
00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:50.494
Why don't you just give it to me?

226
00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:53.497
What do you give me?

227
00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:56.000
You can give it to me once!

228
00:14:58.252 --> 00:14:59.253
I own a body

229
00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.589
That guy is dead!

230
00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:02.923
I know!

231
00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:05.801
Hongju!

232
00:15:07.053 --> 00:15:08.179
us

233
00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:10.640
Well, let's have a rational conversation, okay?

234
00:15:11.015 --> 00:15:13.643
You are still a former mountain god.

235
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.353
Well, to humans

236
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.313
If I cause damage like this, is this okay or not?

237
00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:19.690
No way

238
00:15:19.774 --> 00:15:20.775
That's right

239
00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:21.901
I will also speak rationally.

240
00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:23.402
Uh, say, say

241
00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:25.071
You do mine.

242
00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:26.238
no

243
00:15:26.614 --> 00:15:28.532
Didn’t we finish that conversation earlier?

244
00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:30.409
Did you criticize me twice today?

245
00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:39.502
Oh, really, please, be a little more rational!

246
00:15:39.794 --> 00:15:40.920
Ah, Chi.

247
00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:47.259
- Get out!
- Get out of the way, shit.

248
00:15:58.729 --> 00:15:59.730
What are you?

249
00:15:59.814 --> 00:16:00.940
It is a native Jindo dog.

250
00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:45.359
Boss! No, no

251
00:16:56.912 --> 00:16:57.913
No dogs!

252
00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.422
Oh my! Wow, Mr.

253
00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:09.550
Ah, uh, uh

254
00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:10.926
Hey, Hongju! for a moment!

255
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.511
Wait a minute

256
00:17:12.595 --> 00:17:14.388
Wait a minute, what

257
00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:19.226
IC

258
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.311
Huh?

259
00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:22.313
Ouch!

260
00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:02.812
IC

261
00:18:07.107 --> 00:18:08.150
I liked it

262
00:18:08.234 --> 00:18:09.318
No, something like that, something like that...

263
00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:11.362
you have a knife

264
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.031
What is it?

265
00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:15.699
Are you playing with me again?

266
00:18:15.783 --> 00:18:17.243
Ah, ah, no, don't lift, don't lift!

267
00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:18.327
Hey, hey, hey, Mr!

268
00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:45.020
uh? Hey, hey

269
00:18:46.397 --> 00:18:47.523
Uh, uh, huh?

270
00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:49.149
Hey, hey!

271
00:19:05.332 --> 00:19:06.500
hey! Langa

272
00:19:06.876 --> 00:19:07.877
Langa

273
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.086
kinda

274
00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:12.590
Me, me, Mr. Lee

275
00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:14.550
That ungrateful bastard!

276
00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:16.260
- Come visit me.
- Yes

277
00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:24.018
You really, Mr.

278
00:19:29.857 --> 00:19:31.233
Boy, really

279
00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:32.651
Wow, really

280
00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:34.737
Ouch!

281
00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:37.656
uh?

282
00:19:48.626 --> 00:19:50.169
hello

283
00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:11.523
What is it?

284
00:20:37.174 --> 00:20:38.300
The train stopped

285
00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:41.428
Now is your chance, let's go!

286
00:20:41.512 --> 00:20:43.055
Let's go!

287
00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:45.891
Come on, quickly!

288
00:20:57.111 --> 00:20:58.445
Mr.

289
00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:04.284
Oh, me, Mr. Lee, well, it's not a horror movie.

290
00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:08.580
Oh, really

291
00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:16.213
Hey, do you want to ride?

292
00:21:16.547 --> 00:21:18.757
Ugh, not ungrateful.

293
00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.053
Still cute?

294
00:21:24.722 --> 00:21:25.973
Quick!

295
00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:29.018
hey!

296
00:21:36.483 --> 00:21:37.526
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

297
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.153
Whoa, whoa

298
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.031
What is that girl?

299
00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:43.782
Are you stopping the train by force?

300
00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:47.036
Yes, among the four great mountain gods
In terms of strength, he is the top

301
00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:49.496
Oh, oh, let's never see each other again, oh

302
00:22:04.136 --> 00:22:06.346
We'll meet again soon, Lee Yeon

303
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.907
Are you here, brother-in-law?

304
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.991
Yeah

305
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.711
I heard you were arrested at the police station yesterday?

306
00:22:38.504 --> 00:22:39.505
Are we long nose?

307
00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:44.927
Are they saying I'm a bomb suspect or something?

308
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.345
Huh, really, it’s amazing.

309
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.430
Ah, I dare you to know which family you are from...

310
00:22:48.514 --> 00:22:50.182
It's not a long nose

311
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.561
The suspect has a gunshot wound to his left shoulder.

312
00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:03.028
Let's look at your shoulder.

313
00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:06.990
Honey!

314
00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.043
Look, what is a gunshot wound?

315
00:23:21.255 --> 00:23:22.673
The gunshot wound is gone.

316
00:23:23.465 --> 00:23:24.466
How?

317
00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:29.179
This country

318
00:23:29.638 --> 00:23:31.390
I will never be independent

319
00:23:31.473 --> 00:23:32.641
Bye

320
00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:35.102
You know when I say something like hurray, right?

321
00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.437
I would shoot my own child

322
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.484
I said something unnecessary
You've been making a fuss since morning.

323
00:23:42.568 --> 00:23:45.112
my son-in-law
I guess it was because I was worried.

324
00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:46.572
'Hi'

325
00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:02.171
no

326
00:24:03.797 --> 00:24:06.091
Where on earth have you gone, Lee Yeon?

327
00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:07.759
Oh, I'm hungry

328
00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:24.109
Hey there

329
00:24:24.693 --> 00:24:26.278
Well, if you don't mind...

330
00:24:27.613 --> 00:24:30.699
Wow, that
Looks like you're very hungry, huh?

331
00:24:30.782 --> 00:24:32.242
Come to work, come to work, come to work
Come to work, come to work

332
00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:33.577
- Wow
- Come on, Osh, come to work.

333
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.828
Uh, uh

334
00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:35.913
Now

335
00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:37.206
Come on, eat.

336
00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:38.415
uh

337
00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:42.711
In this era, people still have a passion for life.

338
00:24:48.383 --> 00:24:51.220
Ah, but excuse me
What are you doing?

339
00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:52.971
Ah

340
00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:54.097
So to speak

341
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:55.849
No difference between rich and poor

342
00:24:55.933 --> 00:24:59.228
They are the ones who dream of a fair and just world.

343
00:24:59.311 --> 00:25:00.646
Huh?

344
00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:05.692
They are beggars.

345
00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:08.362
It's difficult for them too...

346
00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:10.489
Uh, straight, yeah

347
00:25:12.491 --> 00:25:14.034
No, no, no
No, no, no

348
00:25:14.117 --> 00:25:16.161
Yes, I have to empty it and give it to you.
I have to empty it and give it to you, right?

349
00:25:27.547 --> 00:25:30.467
You think you did a good job, okay?

350
00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:33.720
- Come on, let's get started.
- Yes

351
00:25:33.804 --> 00:25:34.972
Well then, now

352
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.723
Now, these are shoes, shoes, yeah

353
00:25:36.932 --> 00:25:38.976
- Take that meat, meat, meat.
- meat, meat

354
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.353
There's something on your finger, take it out, take it out, take it out

355
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.233
Baby, good, good, good, good

356
00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:49.027
Oh, you picked a car?

357
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:52.364
Uh, well, just
I told myself to die and saved up my salary to buy it.

358
00:25:52.698 --> 00:25:54.199
Hey

359
00:25:54.408 --> 00:25:55.492
Are you saying you are a kite from the future?

360
00:25:55.575 --> 00:25:56.660
yes

361
00:25:56.743 --> 00:25:58.036
- By any chance...
- Ah

362
00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.621
Elderly people can't divorce, absolutely.

363
00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:03.625
I can never do it, never

364
00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:07.754
Where is the absolute? Mr.

365
00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.134
how do i get home

366
00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:14.052
The door that crosses time

367
00:26:14.428 --> 00:26:16.221
Open only on the day of the lunar eclipse

368
00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:17.723
When is that?

369
00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:19.266
29 days from now

370
00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:21.143
One month...

371
00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:25.480
I have to go home real quick
I'm worried about my wife.

372
00:26:25.814 --> 00:26:26.982
don't worry

373
00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:29.776
The future you came from and the time here
Because it flows differently

374
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:31.611
Even if I stay here for a month

375
00:26:32.195 --> 00:26:33.947
There is only
It only lasts a few days

376
00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:35.866
Yeah, that's good news.

377
00:26:35.949 --> 00:26:37.492
-What about the guardian stone?
- Uh

378
00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:39.828
here

379
00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:41.163
never lose it

380
00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:43.123
You can never go home without this.

381
00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:44.624
But who is the red-and-white masked guy?

382
00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:46.835
He also stole this guardian stone.

383
00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:48.795
They made my little brother a rag too

384
00:26:49.212 --> 00:26:51.882
That's what I'm worried about

385
00:26:53.425 --> 00:26:55.177
In a place where my eyes can't reach

386
00:26:56.803 --> 00:26:58.388
What's going on?

387
00:26:58.472 --> 00:27:01.266
Well, even with grandma’s clairvoyance
Is there something you can't see?

388
00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:04.019
I'll catch you, give me the money

389
00:27:04.102 --> 00:27:05.979
At least it's a car, ah, it's inconvenient

390
00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:21.578
What kind of coffin is this?

391
00:27:23.038 --> 00:27:24.373
Who died?

392
00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:27.084
no

393
00:27:28.293 --> 00:27:30.170
Who are you trying to kill?

394
00:27:32.381 --> 00:27:33.965
What is Mr. Muyoung’s identity?

395
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:37.010
How does a gunshot wound disappear in two days?

396
00:27:38.512 --> 00:27:41.848
He was a mountain god who ruled the northern forest.

397
00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:44.518
Ah

398
00:27:45.268 --> 00:27:46.520
He's a fun guy

399
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.731
Now

400
00:27:49.815 --> 00:27:51.358
I have now repaid my debt.

401
00:27:52.692 --> 00:27:53.735
That's right

402
00:27:56.154 --> 00:27:57.447
Now there's no debt between us

403
00:28:03.286 --> 00:28:04.413
Would you like to lie down?

404
00:28:06.873 --> 00:28:07.874
me?

405
00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:09.126
To measure the length

406
00:28:12.379 --> 00:28:13.463
What

407
00:28:13.672 --> 00:28:15.590
The lifesaver is asking for a favor.

408
00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:34.109
It feels so strange

409
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:35.735
How do you feel?

410
00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:36.903
Um...

411
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.322
Do you feel like you should leave a will?

412
00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:41.783
Leave it behind

413
00:28:41.867 --> 00:28:43.452
I think this is the last time

414
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.830
I had a sister who was one year older than me.

415
00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:50.208
To my father who is a traitor

416
00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.295
Under a snobbish mother

417
00:28:55.213 --> 00:28:56.965
You were the only one on my side

418
00:28:58.758 --> 00:28:59.759
I committed suicide

419
00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:03.180
instead of me
I got married to the Chief of Police Affairs at the Government General

420
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.350
I miss you

421
00:29:12.439 --> 00:29:13.565
I also had a brother

422
00:29:15.442 --> 00:29:18.320
Carrying me around so tiresomely
Treated me like a child

423
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:22.073
It seems like his back was really warm.

424
00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:24.534
I can't remember your face, now

425
00:29:24.743 --> 00:29:25.911
Is it past tense?

426
00:29:28.914 --> 00:29:30.123
dead

427
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.125
In the hands of my best friend

428
00:29:32.918 --> 00:29:33.919
Did you get revenge?

429
00:29:36.505 --> 00:29:37.797
I will take revenge

430
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:41.218
Until he takes away everything he holds dear

431
00:29:48.475 --> 00:29:49.851
we have the same goal

432
00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:11.456
Huh?

433
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:13.124
uh? my clothes

434
00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:14.501
Ah, Mr.

435
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:15.710
my wedding ring

436
00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:18.922
My limited edition sneakers!

437
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.311
No need to say anything

438
00:30:58.545 --> 00:30:59.546
What is it?

439
00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:01.006
I don't really like eggs

440
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:04.050
Are you a picky eater at that age? Pathetic guy

441
00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:07.929
What if

442
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.849
If the past changes, will the future change?

443
00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:12.350
Rangi comes back to life

444
00:31:12.434 --> 00:31:13.602
No matter what I do

445
00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:15.687
The reality you will return to does not change

446
00:31:16.187 --> 00:31:18.398
You are passing by this era
I'm just a stranger

447
00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:20.442
Although it exists

448
00:31:20.525 --> 00:31:22.027
It doesn't belong here

449
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.988
The time between Rang and me is
It's only one month

450
00:31:28.742 --> 00:31:31.161
Stay with me for just one month

451
00:31:35.624 --> 00:31:36.666
I don't like it

452
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.501
Ah, just say something about your thoughts.

453
00:31:38.585 --> 00:31:39.961
Even if I think about it a hundred times, I hate it

454
00:31:40.587 --> 00:31:41.838
I know who you are

455
00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:47.093
What are you talking about?

456
00:31:49.596 --> 00:31:50.930
No matter how you look at it

457
00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:53.308
I don't think this is the Lee Yeon I know.

458
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:55.435
Who are you?

459
00:31:55.518 --> 00:31:58.605
I saved you from dying
Who do you see in your eyes?

460
00:31:58.688 --> 00:31:59.773
ask again

461
00:32:01.775 --> 00:32:04.235
who are you

462
00:32:05.028 --> 00:32:08.198
While acting as a bandit
I saw a lot of things that came across the sea.

463
00:32:08.573 --> 00:32:09.741
I've never seen anything like this

464
00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:12.994
Why?

465
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.965
If you stay with me for just one month

466
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:28.510
I'll give you this cell phone

467
00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:29.678
Cellphone?

468
00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:31.971
With me in the future
If we stay together for just one month

469
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.431
What is it?

470
00:32:33.515 --> 00:32:35.433
- I'll give you this cell phone.
- Why are you here?

471
00:32:35.684 --> 00:32:36.851
It's not just this

472
00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:38.561
Hey, together

473
00:32:39.187 --> 00:32:40.814
You can take pictures too

474
00:32:41.356 --> 00:32:42.649
True

475
00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:45.527
I can also listen to the song

476
00:32:45.902 --> 00:32:48.321
It's the one and only treasure of this era.

477
00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:50.240
Do you want to do it or not?

478
00:32:50.949 --> 00:32:52.117
For reference

479
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.828
who am i
The answer is also contained here

480
00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:58.039
The choice is yours

481
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:13.513
Did you lose your Manpasikjeok?

482
00:33:14.514 --> 00:33:15.974
To Joseon Yokai?

483
00:33:17.517 --> 00:33:19.269
It was a level 1 or higher youkai.

484
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.491
Did I allow you to make excuses?

485
00:34:01.686 --> 00:34:04.314
Why were you defeated by the Joseon monster?

486
00:34:08.985 --> 00:34:11.946
There is only death for those who lose

487
00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:15.533
Please kill me

488
00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:26.586
Searching through the land of Joseon

489
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:29.672
Comparable to full-blown waves

490
00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:32.091
Come find new items

491
00:34:32.842 --> 00:34:36.387
That's you, the mainland's youkai

492
00:34:39.557 --> 00:34:42.519
This is why I came to this land

493
00:34:53.029 --> 00:34:54.197
Now

494
00:34:54.697 --> 00:34:56.366
Now, try this on.

495
00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.451
Ah, that

496
00:34:58.535 --> 00:34:59.994
Is there anything a little brighter? huh?

497
00:35:00.078 --> 00:35:01.079
The kid has a cool tone

498
00:35:01.538 --> 00:35:02.539
What tone?

499
00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:06.584
Baby, so what now?
Is there anything more bright like this?

500
00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:08.378
- Well, the color, something, that kind of feeling.
- Oh, yes.

501
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:10.922
Ah, to the barbershop and the clothing store.

502
00:35:11.005 --> 00:35:12.507
What is this all about?

503
00:35:12.882 --> 00:35:15.593
You are the leader of a bandit gang.
Are you going to advertise? huh?

504
00:35:15.677 --> 00:35:17.846
Because I change my style
How neat is it?

505
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.765
- What about this?
- Uh, uh, uh

506
00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:22.141
Ah, this is good

507
00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:24.227
The material is good, try it on quickly

508
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.603
Ah, quickly, quickly

509
00:35:27.814 --> 00:35:29.315
Lee Yeon, please wear one too.

510
00:35:29.774 --> 00:35:31.067
I already did it all

511
00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:32.819
Put this on the old lady who takes off her clothes.

512
00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:50.837
I'll whip you

513
00:35:52.255 --> 00:35:53.423
don't touch my body

514
00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.800
I'll teach you how to tie it.

515
00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.428
Put the wider side into the ring.

516
00:36:01.431 --> 00:36:02.432
yes

517
00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:04.642
Cross it down on the narrow side.

518
00:36:05.184 --> 00:36:07.478
Oh, not above, but below...

519
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:14.736
you do it

520
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:56.194
Done

521
00:37:04.118 --> 00:37:05.328
It suits you well

522
00:37:06.955 --> 00:37:09.207
I think it would be perfect if I just added one more thing.

523
00:37:11.668 --> 00:37:12.710
smile?

524
00:37:13.628 --> 00:37:15.546
Try smiling a little

525
00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:20.343
original

526
00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:22.053
I don't smile often

527
00:37:47.078 --> 00:37:48.329
Hey, you beggar!

528
00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.831
- uh? Where, where?
- Where, where, where?

529
00:37:49.914 --> 00:37:51.958
here!

530
00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:53.668
He said he was a beggar

531
00:37:56.421 --> 00:37:59.215
- Guys, I'm not a beggar.
- It's a beggar, right?

532
00:37:59.298 --> 00:38:00.383
It's a beggar, right?

533
00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:01.551
I'm not a beggar

534
00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.638
I'm not a beggar!

535
00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:07.682
uh?

536
00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:10.685
why?

537
00:38:11.102 --> 00:38:12.645
I thought I heard Shinju’s voice

538
00:38:17.608 --> 00:38:19.652
Where on earth is this guy?
What are you doing?

539
00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:32.707
10 matches

540
00:38:39.964 --> 00:38:41.049
Are you hiring a delivery person?

541
00:38:44.343 --> 00:38:46.637
Well, do you even know how to ride a bicycle?

542
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:49.390
Ah, well, let go of your hands
I'm riding it around

543
00:38:49.474 --> 00:38:52.226
You have to be strong to deliver.

544
00:38:59.108 --> 00:39:00.193
Ouch!

545
00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:07.909
Come here

546
00:39:08.326 --> 00:39:09.452
Is there no one there?

547
00:39:19.462 --> 00:39:21.005
Are you here, honey?

548
00:39:25.718 --> 00:39:27.386
Come in when I have something nice to say.

549
00:39:30.473 --> 00:39:32.058
Lang, Lang!

550
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:35.770
You were the owner of Myoyeonggak.

551
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:38.481
Thanks to you, I had a good rest.

552
00:39:40.608 --> 00:39:42.735
I think I was a bit harsh earlier.

553
00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:45.321
I'm so happy to meet you

554
00:39:45.655 --> 00:39:46.989
Have you lost your temper?

555
00:39:47.365 --> 00:39:48.991
No, whatever.

556
00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:50.618
You can fight with your friends

557
00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:51.828
You can keep staying here

558
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:53.121
i'm fine

559
00:39:53.204 --> 00:39:55.248
Stay, if you don’t want to see me going crazy.

560
00:39:56.082 --> 00:39:57.750
I kind of want to do that too.

561
00:39:57.834 --> 00:40:00.128
Well, I'm a bit of a hotel type person.

562
00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:02.296
- Then go.
- Really? Is that okay?

563
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.631
Tear down that hotel, whatever.

564
00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:08.344
Okay, I'll stay here.

565
00:40:08.427 --> 00:40:09.887
Really?

566
00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:11.889
I'll be really good to you

567
00:40:11.973 --> 00:40:13.099
Don't be nice to me

568
00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:15.601
Treat yourself the same as other guests
That's my condition

569
00:40:17.728 --> 00:40:18.729
ok

570
00:40:23.025 --> 00:40:24.652
Baby, what, promise, promise

571
00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:28.156
Oh my, it's crazy, really!

572
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:30.741
seal

573
00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:34.620
It's really my friend

574
00:40:36.455 --> 00:40:38.875
Wow, it's so cute I'm dying

575
00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:48.885
From now on
Monitor your every move

576
00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:53.097
What are you going to do with the author?

577
00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:56.350
Jaeyuya

578
00:40:57.977 --> 00:41:00.354
The prey I once captured
Have you missed it?

579
00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:03.399
I will have it

580
00:41:05.193 --> 00:41:07.528
Killed and stuffed
Even if I have resentment

581
00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:23.794
Oh my

582
00:41:27.465 --> 00:41:29.383
Oh my, cover it up well.

583
00:41:29.759 --> 00:41:30.885
Oh my

584
00:41:57.161 --> 00:41:58.496
I'll definitely go back

585
00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:16.555
Lee Yeon

586
00:42:18.724 --> 00:42:20.226
Mr. Yuri

587
00:42:40.204 --> 00:42:42.748
Oh, your boss
Is he such a great person?

588
00:42:43.332 --> 00:42:44.500
Don't you read the newspaper?

589
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:47.795
Among the gisaeng in Gyeongseong
There is no one as rich as our boss.

590
00:42:48.421 --> 00:42:50.381
Kimi, gold mine, private loan

591
00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:52.133
Everything you touch is a hit.

592
00:42:54.051 --> 00:42:55.553
Shall I shake it off?

593
00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:57.805
What do you say is the secret? huh?

594
00:42:58.222 --> 00:43:00.891
At the bottom of this castle
all information

595
00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:02.101
Myoyeonggak

596
00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:04.979
Specifically, through our boss.
You can think of it as carrying it out.

597
00:43:06.647 --> 00:43:08.399
Hong Joo is a source of information...

598
00:43:15.823 --> 00:43:18.159
Your father wants you to live a long time
Are you the one who sold it?

599
00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:20.411
I didn't sell it.

600
00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:23.497
My father also has a problem.

601
00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:24.874
Throw it away or sell it.

602
00:43:25.416 --> 00:43:28.461
Children who are poor yet kind
I like food that much

603
00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:30.588
I know what a flower garden the world is

604
00:43:32.757 --> 00:43:34.884
Because I taught you well
I'll at least make you do some chores.

605
00:43:34.967 --> 00:43:36.260
There are a lot of kids to do chores with.

606
00:43:36.344 --> 00:43:37.845
I won't

607
00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:40.181
I won't act like a fool and be nice.

608
00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:42.600
If you can't forgive your father

609
00:43:44.352 --> 00:43:46.520
I did it because I thought I was going to die.

610
00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:49.523
don't forgive easily

611
00:43:50.483 --> 00:43:51.484
Then the world

612
00:43:51.567 --> 00:43:53.861
You'll only be forgiven
You get to choose.

613
00:43:57.323 --> 00:43:59.200
Ah, where are you going? I've been looking for it for a while

614
00:43:59.283 --> 00:44:01.410
you again in the morning
Who are you harassing like that?

615
00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:03.079
Oh, is that you? uh

616
00:44:04.163 --> 00:44:06.165
Your name is now Jukhyang

617
00:44:06.248 --> 00:44:08.167
- Uh, porridge scent.
- Go see.

618
00:44:10.669 --> 00:44:11.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah

619
00:44:12.129 --> 00:44:13.381
Yeah

620
00:44:15.466 --> 00:44:16.467
Did you sleep well?

621
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.511
What is that useless cuteness?

622
00:44:18.594 --> 00:44:19.678
Please find me someone

623
00:44:19.762 --> 00:44:22.181
Wear this red and white mask
This guy showed up three days ago.

624
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:24.350
Sure, whatever

625
00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:26.227
- Really?
- There are conditions.

626
00:44:27.103 --> 00:44:29.522
Today in Gyeongseong
Is there an important event taking place?

627
00:44:29.939 --> 00:44:31.774
Take your money

628
00:44:32.316 --> 00:44:34.151
Who will be Miss Joseon?

629
00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:35.903
Take your money

630
00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:50.918
Wow, reporter.

631
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:52.211
It's been a while

632
00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:53.879
How is your father?

633
00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:58.801
huh?

634
00:45:02.763 --> 00:45:04.181
Hey Kiyuri

635
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:05.599
Why are you in this era?

636
00:45:05.683 --> 00:45:06.725
Did you come with Gu Shinju?

637
00:45:08.102 --> 00:45:09.478
You looked at the wrong person

638
00:45:11.397 --> 00:45:13.107
Sir, give it to me!

639
00:45:14.108 --> 00:45:15.776
- Mr. Yuri
- Give me the brat!

640
00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.861
No, no, no.

641
00:45:16.944 --> 00:45:18.154
No?

642
00:45:19.071 --> 00:45:20.072
Did you see me at Gyeongseong Station?

643
00:45:21.407 --> 00:45:22.408
This is my first meeting.

644
00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:31.417
Ah, a human face
I'm just taking pictures with Control C and Control V.

645
00:45:33.294 --> 00:45:34.920
They look very similar

646
00:45:36.714 --> 00:45:38.090
But who are you?

647
00:45:39.842 --> 00:45:41.552
That's the seat of Myoyeonggak Ryu's president.

648
00:45:41.635 --> 00:45:42.636
I am Ryu Hong-joo's pinch hitter

649
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.138
I went to find gold mine in Hongju.

650
00:45:49.435 --> 00:45:51.854
Well, you've been waiting a long time, right?

651
00:45:51.937 --> 00:45:53.147
Introducing

652
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.773
Become the most beautiful woman in Joseon

653
00:45:55.107 --> 00:45:56.734
These are the main characters!

654
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.610
Miss Joseon?

655
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.570
A gisaeng who was preparing for a competition

656
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.907
Breaking into a sleeping guest's room
I had an affair

657
00:46:45.115 --> 00:46:46.742
Biting off one arm on the way

658
00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.661
missing

659
00:46:48.744 --> 00:46:49.745
What about the guests?

660
00:46:49.828 --> 00:46:51.247
I barely survived

661
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:53.457
Give me your left arm, let’s go crazy

662
00:46:53.874 --> 00:46:56.544
Where have you heard this before?
Is it a repertoire?

663
00:46:56.627 --> 00:46:58.003
Abnormal appetite and

664
00:46:58.087 --> 00:46:59.088
lust

665
00:46:59.171 --> 00:47:00.548
Could it be three insects?

666
00:47:03.759 --> 00:47:07.137
If it's to the extent of causing harm to three insects,
I'm saying he's not an ordinary guy.

667
00:47:07.555 --> 00:47:09.431
Participation number 7

668
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.392
It's a place of beauty.

669
00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:14.562
Song Eun-sil, 22 years old, from Pyongyang.

670
00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:17.648
I usually listen to Schubert's music
They say they enjoy listening to it.

671
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:19.775
When you listen to Schubert's Wild Rose

672
00:47:19.858 --> 00:47:22.278
The collarbone
It's a little off horizontal, right?

673
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:25.155
Write
Oh, my earlobes are so poor

674
00:47:26.323 --> 00:47:28.826
The guests sat down trembling

675
00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:30.703
This is Wild Rose Song Eun-sil.

676
00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:32.705
Participation number 10

677
00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:35.499
I rode the train from Busan

678
00:47:35.916 --> 00:47:37.501
Yang Young-ae

679
00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.628
My future dream is to be a movie star.

680
00:47:40.045 --> 00:47:41.547
- Hey
- Aegyo-myeon Aegyo

681
00:47:43.924 --> 00:47:45.175
If it's a dance, it's a dance

682
00:47:45.259 --> 00:47:47.094
- Huh? Write
- With a shining smile

683
00:47:47.177 --> 00:47:48.762
- Where did you see that woman?
- All-rounder

684
00:47:48.846 --> 00:47:50.431
This is Yang Young-ae.

685
00:47:58.439 --> 00:47:59.481
What's the score?

686
00:47:59.857 --> 00:48:01.150
Take me out

687
00:48:01.233 --> 00:48:02.943
Well, it’s not like grading Korean beef.

688
00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:06.989
A lady from Busan
They say you're the prettiest

689
00:48:07.072 --> 00:48:08.949
Is that right, Busan?

690
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:12.953
A lot of people from Busan came, this is

691
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.256
The first event hosted by Sunwoo Ilbo

692
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.216
Peninsula Representative Beauty Contest

693
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:27.926
The Honorable Miss Joseon 1st Place

694
00:48:28.344 --> 00:48:31.180
Except for one person who abstained.
All judges unanimously

695
00:48:35.893 --> 00:48:37.645
This is Yang Young-ae from Busan.

696
00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:42.816
Yang Young-ae goes forward
It will be sponsored by Hwashin Department Store.

697
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.078
thank you so much

698
00:48:55.037 --> 00:48:57.623
I was against coming here, but

699
00:48:57.873 --> 00:48:59.041
with my family

700
00:48:59.124 --> 00:49:00.918
I want to share this joy

701
00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:03.253
uh

702
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.383
Ha, wow, is it this hot?

703
00:49:10.844 --> 00:49:11.929
I'm sorry

704
00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:16.558
To Hair Salon Director Seungja Choi

705
00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:20.229
I want to say thank you

706
00:49:24.525 --> 00:49:27.403
Oh, can I take off my clothes?

707
00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:30.572
Because my body is so hot

708
00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:37.037
Let's take a commemorative photo.

709
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:40.040
Okay, let's take a picture.

710
00:49:40.874 --> 00:49:42.251
one, two

711
00:49:57.725 --> 00:49:59.059
- What's wrong with you?
- Sister...

712
00:50:21.165 --> 00:50:22.166
Are you okay?

713
00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:30.340
AC

714
00:51:12.257 --> 00:51:15.719
Not Miss Joseon and the Myoyeonggak gisaeng.
There's more?

715
00:51:15.803 --> 00:51:17.262
I heard a rumor

716
00:51:17.471 --> 00:51:19.056
The beauties of Gyeongseong

717
00:51:19.139 --> 00:51:20.265
He changed like a yaksha

718
00:51:22.184 --> 00:51:24.603
Only targeting beautiful women?

719
00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:28.565
Then he must be

720
00:51:29.233 --> 00:51:30.234
Surely?

721
00:51:31.485 --> 00:51:32.736
He's such an ugly guy.

722
00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:37.241
Guess that now

723
00:51:37.616 --> 00:51:38.700
Are you a real detective?

724
00:51:38.784 --> 00:51:39.910
It's me

725
00:51:41.537 --> 00:51:43.247
Can’t you tell by looking at my costume? uh?

726
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:44.581
Anyone can see that he is a detective.

727
00:51:44.665 --> 00:51:47.584
By the way, he is also the person who saved your life.

728
00:51:51.129 --> 00:51:52.130
So

729
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:54.091
What are you curious about?

730
00:51:56.552 --> 00:51:58.387
link between yakshas

731
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.724
Everyone goes to the same beauty salon
I have visited

732
00:52:03.433 --> 00:52:04.685
Seungja Choi Hair Salon

733
00:52:05.352 --> 00:52:06.562
Okay

734
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:12.985
Oh, I don't like it!

735
00:52:15.404 --> 00:52:16.697
You're good at disguises, right?

736
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.074
Ah, as a human woman
You can never disguise yourself, you won't!

737
00:52:19.908 --> 00:52:20.951
hey

738
00:52:21.577 --> 00:52:24.371
If we solve this case
You can catch the guy who stabbed you.

739
00:52:24.913 --> 00:52:26.248
- Red and white mask?
- Yeah.

740
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:27.916
I decided to exchange it with that guy's information.

741
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.459
Are you going to get revenge?

742
00:52:31.712 --> 00:52:32.713
Who are we?

743
00:52:32.796 --> 00:52:36.216
The fox returns the favor
Pay off your debt properly

744
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.343
Okay, I'd like to go as a guest instead.

745
00:52:38.427 --> 00:52:39.428
I don't accept male guests

746
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:41.930
Ah, I don't want to turn into a woman.

747
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:45.350
you

748
00:52:46.226 --> 00:52:47.811
- I can do that.
- Huh?

749
00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.652
teacher

750
00:52:55.736 --> 00:52:57.237
Why are you calling me? Tsk

751
00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:58.363
I'm waiting.

752
00:52:58.447 --> 00:52:59.489
Oh, really

753
00:52:59.573 --> 00:53:00.866
No, to Seungja Choi’s hair salon.

754
00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:02.618
What do you mean by male employee?

755
00:53:02.701 --> 00:53:03.827
Go home, shit

756
00:53:03.911 --> 00:53:05.621
- Just take a look.
- No, he

757
00:53:05.704 --> 00:53:07.456
- Why am I acting like this this morning, really?
- Oh, quickly, quickly.

758
00:53:07.539 --> 00:53:08.665
Stay still! Tsk

759
00:53:08.749 --> 00:53:09.750
Wait a minute

760
00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:11.335
No, if you go and talk...

761
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.129
our hair salon
The male employee

762
00:53:14.212 --> 00:53:16.506
I will never pick you

763
00:53:22.512 --> 00:53:24.765
Well, that's perfect

764
00:53:36.485 --> 00:53:37.819
Ooh la la

765
00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:43.784
From the Louvre in Paris
sculpture handsome men

766
00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:50.666
It's a pity that men are envoys.

767
00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:52.918
let's go

768
00:53:59.257 --> 00:54:00.550
I passed.

769
00:54:03.887 --> 00:54:05.806
No, shampoo
The most popular procedure?

770
00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:06.932
Washing your hair?

771
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:08.892
Even though the price is a bit expensive

772
00:54:08.976 --> 00:54:11.228
Most of the guests
He's just coming for shampoo.

773
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:14.064
Oh my, I can just watch it at home, why bother?

774
00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:17.275
First, about 20 or 30 minutes.
Brush thoroughly.

775
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.860
- And then
- Oh, I know.

776
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:21.571
Well, take the shampoo
You can just massage the head.

777
00:54:21.655 --> 00:54:22.656
As tight as hand washing

778
00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:24.574
Oh, it's powerful.

779
00:54:31.498 --> 00:54:33.291
Are you asking me to have coffee now?

780
00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:35.585
This is a can of coffee

781
00:54:35.669 --> 00:54:37.254
This is a Ssanghwa car

782
00:54:37.337 --> 00:54:38.755
This is green tea

783
00:54:41.842 --> 00:54:45.178
Monsieur Lee gives me a ride
I want to have a strong cup of cafe.

784
00:54:48.015 --> 00:54:49.349
2 units

785
00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:51.393
2 to 2

786
00:54:51.977 --> 00:54:54.146
‘Oh, Mercy’

787
00:54:54.563 --> 00:54:55.605
Oh my, ma’am

788
00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:56.940
Yes?

789
00:54:57.024 --> 00:55:00.277
No, the mirror outside is broken.
What are you doing here if you’re not cleaning up quickly?

790
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.695
Sorry, Director.

791
00:55:01.778 --> 00:55:03.739
Always saying ‘I’m sorry’

792
00:55:04.489 --> 00:55:05.490
Oh my

793
00:55:05.574 --> 00:55:08.910
No, I opened a business here
How many mirrors were broken? How...

794
00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:10.287
Aunt

795
00:55:10.495 --> 00:55:12.122
Didn’t the lady do it?

796
00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:18.670
Is this your master bedroom?

797
00:55:18.754 --> 00:55:20.338
Do you know a bug called Samchung?

798
00:55:20.422 --> 00:55:22.174
Even the doctors at Gyeongseong University don’t know.

799
00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:24.926
Who says that?

800
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.553
He calls himself a detective.

801
00:55:26.887 --> 00:55:28.764
Write, was your name Lee Yeon?

802
00:55:31.892 --> 00:55:33.143
What is Samchung?

803
00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:36.480
Sit in my head
It's a bug that controls people.

804
00:55:37.064 --> 00:55:38.356
What are you controlling?

805
00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:39.983
physiological desire

806
00:55:40.317 --> 00:55:42.027
I want to eat, I want to have sex,

807
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.820
You're not moving it, right?

808
00:55:43.904 --> 00:55:45.363
No, the Eucharist is not transmitted.

809
00:55:46.364 --> 00:55:49.451
When the egg hatches inside the body
It becomes the host for the three insects.

810
00:55:49.534 --> 00:55:51.411
How do eggs get into the body?

811
00:55:51.912 --> 00:55:54.122
Eat it, drink it, or apply it to your skin.

812
00:56:02.255 --> 00:56:03.256
Is there anyone?

813
00:56:03.924 --> 00:56:04.925
I'm a guest

814
00:56:32.661 --> 00:56:33.662
Come again

815
00:56:33.995 --> 00:56:35.455
- Delivery!
- Oh my, oh my.

816
00:56:35.539 --> 00:56:36.748
Oh my, oh my

817
00:56:36.832 --> 00:56:38.333
- What?
- No, where is this?

818
00:56:38.416 --> 00:56:39.876
Just come in, with black hair

819
00:56:40.836 --> 00:56:42.420
You ordered cold noodles, cold noodles.

820
00:56:42.504 --> 00:56:43.713
Me?

821
00:56:44.131 --> 00:56:45.340
Oh no

822
00:56:45.423 --> 00:56:46.758
Oh, leave it outside the door.

823
00:56:46.842 --> 00:56:49.970
This is a sophisticated hair salon.

824
00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:51.513
Stinky

825
00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:56.434
Are all the mirrors broken?

826
00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.355
Come this way.

827
00:57:01.273 --> 00:57:02.357
Now

828
00:57:02.566 --> 00:57:03.859
Yes, please sit this way.

829
00:57:06.945 --> 00:57:09.823
Because you are my precious wife.
Please take care of me

830
00:57:09.906 --> 00:57:10.949
yes, yes

831
00:57:16.663 --> 00:57:17.914
What is this?

832
00:57:20.208 --> 00:57:21.585
Samchung, Samchung, Samchung

833
00:57:24.045 --> 00:57:25.213
Was the grandmother the host?

834
00:57:25.881 --> 00:57:27.299
It's a disguised youkai, right?

835
00:57:27.382 --> 00:57:30.719
Oh, my head is infested with lice these days.

836
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.638
This?

837
00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:37.058
child

838
00:57:37.142 --> 00:57:39.728
Please don't touch me, ma'am.

839
00:57:39.811 --> 00:57:42.814
We are natives of this town for 20 years.

840
00:57:42.898 --> 00:57:45.984
If you catch us, you can't do business here.

841
00:57:46.067 --> 00:57:47.777
Have you ever been hit by an axe?

842
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:50.238
Samchung, those ladies are sure!

843
00:57:50.322 --> 00:57:52.824
No, I'm just pointing it at you.

844
00:57:52.908 --> 00:57:54.993
Oh, the director or an employee is the culprit?

845
00:57:55.368 --> 00:57:56.620
The person I am in charge of is

846
00:57:56.703 --> 00:57:57.871
He's just a pathetic guy.

847
00:57:57.954 --> 00:57:59.539
Mine is just a chatterbox

848
00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:01.791
Then it's the director, let's step on it.

849
00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:05.670
When I heard it, I went to this house.
I heard there is something really useful?

850
00:58:06.838 --> 00:58:08.256
Wait a minute

851
00:58:12.427 --> 00:58:14.429
This is the cream.

852
00:58:14.512 --> 00:58:17.265
You put this cream on your face, right?

853
00:58:18.016 --> 00:58:19.309
Then the skin

854
00:58:19.392 --> 00:58:22.270
Like a Western European doll
It's turning white, this...

855
00:58:23.438 --> 00:58:24.481
What about Lee Yeon?

856
00:58:24.564 --> 00:58:25.899
I infiltrated the hair salon.

857
00:58:26.316 --> 00:58:27.400
It's worth seeing

858
00:58:27.943 --> 00:58:30.028
You searched the floor of Gyeongseong

859
00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:32.447
A guy named Hong Baek Tal came to visit me.

860
00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:34.491
Are you trying to help Lee Yeon?

861
00:58:34.574 --> 00:58:35.659
well?

862
00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:38.662
Should I help Lee Yeon or him?

863
00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:40.330
Spend some money if you need it

864
00:58:40.413 --> 00:58:41.915
How much is...

865
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:43.833
Of course

866
00:58:46.503 --> 00:58:48.421
Until I get the answer I want

867
00:58:51.883 --> 00:58:53.009
Oh, is it broken here too?

868
00:58:53.093 --> 00:58:54.761
There wasn't a single mirror in good condition.

869
00:58:55.971 --> 00:58:57.347
It's a mirror...

870
00:59:00.475 --> 00:59:02.435
- Boss
- Yes?

871
00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:04.145
Why not get a new mirror?

872
00:59:04.229 --> 00:59:06.481
The name is a beauty salon.
The mirrors are all broken

873
00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:07.607
Oh my, yeah

874
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:09.234
I'll take a look at the business.

875
00:59:09.317 --> 00:59:12.404
It's so trustworthy, please, please.

876
00:59:12.487 --> 00:59:13.780
Come on, let's go

877
00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:16.992
- Well, good job.
- Yes, yes.

878
00:59:17.409 --> 00:59:18.660
Come in, yeah

879
00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:21.871
Please go in

880
00:59:22.289 --> 00:59:23.581
no reaction

881
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.417
That

882
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.752
They even clean up after me for me.

883
00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:29.587
Why am I sorry?

884
00:59:29.671 --> 00:59:30.964
Please eat this

885
00:59:31.047 --> 00:59:32.299
Are these a group of magic bandits?

886
00:59:32.382 --> 00:59:33.383
yes?

887
00:59:33.466 --> 00:59:35.010
Was it poisoned there?

888
00:59:35.385 --> 00:59:37.012
Oh my, it's poison.

889
00:59:38.013 --> 00:59:39.389
Drink it first

890
00:59:41.641 --> 00:59:42.684
Uh, okay, thank you

891
00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:43.977
Okay, get off work, go.

892
00:59:44.436 --> 00:59:45.478
all the way

893
00:59:50.066 --> 00:59:51.359
Hey

894
00:59:52.652 --> 00:59:54.863
Come to work
I said it was a palm-sized cream.

895
00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:57.490
Oh, in the cream.
You mean you solved the three problems?

896
00:59:57.574 --> 00:59:58.908
Uh, check it out.

897
00:59:59.701 --> 01:00:00.827
Where are you going?

898
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:03.038
Uh, I have something on my mind.
I'll take a look around

899
01:00:05.582 --> 01:00:07.167
Who is it?

900
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.085
Hey, kid, hide for now, hide

901
01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:20.597
-Give me a bowl of cold noodles!
-The eggs arrived.

902
01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.975
- I came to look for a bowl of cold noodles...
- Fresh eggs arrived.

903
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:26.936
- Eggs
- Hey, I'm surprised, Mr.

904
01:00:27.312 --> 01:00:30.482
- Eggs
- Hey, you check, okay?

905
01:00:31.274 --> 01:00:34.194
If you don't even put out the dishes and just close the door,
What are you going to do with me?

906
01:00:34.819 --> 01:00:36.863
Despising and belittling people

907
01:00:44.496 --> 01:00:45.997
Hey, I guess the place is strange.

908
01:00:47.332 --> 01:00:48.416
What?

909
01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.335
I don't see any indigenous gods.

910
01:00:51.544 --> 01:00:53.963
It's a new building, I guess there's nowhere to stay.

911
01:00:55.256 --> 01:00:56.508
Hey, give me this

912
01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:58.676
You ordered your subordinates to
Get me a mirror.

913
01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:00.470
mirror?

914
01:01:02.222 --> 01:01:04.974
hair salon director
This cream is sold to special customers.

915
01:01:06.893 --> 01:01:08.561
My father owns a pharmaceutical company.

916
01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:09.687
Let’s find out the ingredients right away.

917
01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:12.357
That...

918
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.858
Take care of yourself

919
01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:16.736
Oh, you take care of all my worries?

920
01:01:18.446 --> 01:01:20.240
Ah, if you get hurt with that face

921
01:01:20.448 --> 01:01:22.283
That's because there's a guy who can start a game.

922
01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:28.498
Oh, really

923
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.041
Nothing came out of the cream?

924
01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.167
It didn't come out

925
01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:33.503
Oh, you crazy idiot, do that again, then?

926
01:01:35.672 --> 01:01:36.673
Let's do it again

927
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.180
Oh my, why are you here now?

928
01:01:44.264 --> 01:01:45.890
- Come quickly.
- Come in quickly.

929
01:01:45.974 --> 01:01:47.392
These are my friends

930
01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:50.854
What is it?

931
01:01:54.732 --> 01:01:57.235
Oh, well, wash your hair at home.

932
01:01:57.318 --> 01:01:59.696
Alo, Seungja Choi Hair Salon

933
01:01:59.946 --> 01:02:01.448
Oh my, ma’am

934
01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:04.451
What should I do? Reservations are full.

935
01:02:05.076 --> 01:02:06.202
What should I do?

936
01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:18.965
Lower it!

937
01:02:20.008 --> 01:02:21.134
Lower it!

938
01:02:24.637 --> 01:02:25.680
what?

939
01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:28.558
How dare you tell our boss
Are you asking me to carry the car?

940
01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:30.059
Just give me all of these!

941
01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:37.442
Hey, hey!

942
01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:38.526
Why, oh why?

943
01:02:39.694 --> 01:02:40.778
- Wow
- Oh, really.

944
01:02:44.115 --> 01:02:45.575
What about the mirror?

945
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.328
I'm ready, yeah

946
01:02:48.411 --> 01:02:49.787
- Now
- Here it is, brother.

947
01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:56.252
Huh?

948
01:02:56.336 --> 01:02:57.962
I told you to get a full-length mirror, right?

949
01:02:58.963 --> 01:02:59.964
Now

950
01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:03.718
Just take three steps back

951
01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:06.221
I can see my whole body

952
01:03:08.014 --> 01:03:09.390
Ah

953
01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:12.977
But why is it like this?
Are you being held? yes?

954
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:15.230
How strong are they?

955
01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:17.941
I'm not caught, go to the temple, please

956
01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:20.443
So what are we doing?

957
01:03:21.778 --> 01:03:23.863
Just give orders.

958
01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:25.198
Boss!

959
01:03:26.115 --> 01:03:28.243
Well, maybe he's a rickshaw puller or something.

960
01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:31.829
Yes!

961
01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:53.101
Hey, you can't kill him!

962
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.769
Oh, bother

963
01:04:26.426 --> 01:04:27.677
Langa!

964
01:04:44.152 --> 01:04:45.862
No, did you suddenly go crazy?

965
01:04:47.155 --> 01:04:48.281
It was shampoo

966
01:04:48.948 --> 01:04:51.451
Someone used shampoo last night
Three worm eggs were released.

967
01:04:51.534 --> 01:04:53.703
Neither the director nor the employees
Who are you?

968
01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:55.163
Ah, how do you solve it?

969
01:05:03.296 --> 01:05:04.631
- Is that you?
- don't go!

970
01:05:06.382 --> 01:05:07.634
Even if you look like that, you are a native god.

971
01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:13.931
mirror

972
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:17.810
Why are you taking the side of humans?

973
01:05:18.144 --> 01:05:20.021
Why!

974
01:05:35.745 --> 01:05:36.913
Oh, put it away

975
01:05:37.622 --> 01:05:39.457
This guy didn't do this alone.

976
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.003
Are you King Jo?

977
01:05:44.087 --> 01:05:46.255
Do you know me?

978
01:05:46.339 --> 01:05:47.882
Daughter-in-law burned to death in the furnace

979
01:05:48.966 --> 01:05:50.051
He's the first King of the Joseon Dynasty.

980
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:52.637
don't look

981
01:05:52.887 --> 01:05:55.306
no matter how
Even if the child is sad, it’s okay

982
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.935
As a guardian deity of this complex,
What are you going to do if I let you sit down? Tsk

983
01:05:59.435 --> 01:06:00.561
Why did you solve Samchung?

984
01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:03.106
I was living quietly, but

985
01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:05.692
I built this beauty salon with mirrors everywhere

986
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:08.820
In the past, you served me
Things that were hidden even in the mirror

987
01:06:08.903 --> 01:06:11.406
So, did you take your anger out on pretty girls?

988
01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:12.657
Even the stove and furnace

989
01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.200
I destroyed everything

990
01:06:14.283 --> 01:06:15.368
Now...

991
01:06:17.662 --> 01:06:19.122
Now I don't even raise the purified water

992
01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:25.920
i have the future
I know how to see

993
01:06:27.296 --> 01:06:31.259
Even after 50 years
There are no stoves left in Gyeongseong.

994
01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:33.886
What about the embers?

995
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.179
Well, gas stove.

996
01:06:35.263 --> 01:06:36.305
Anyway, there is such a thing.

997
01:06:36.389 --> 01:06:37.598
Aren’t you going to cook rice?

998
01:06:37.682 --> 01:06:38.725
That, instant rice

999
01:06:39.016 --> 01:06:40.351
It’s delicious too, kid.

1000
01:06:40.435 --> 01:06:42.186
What kind of appetite are you looking at, kid?

1001
01:06:46.441 --> 01:06:47.525
Times are changing

1002
01:06:47.608 --> 01:06:48.860
changed

1003
01:06:49.152 --> 01:06:50.194
You too have to choose

1004
01:06:50.278 --> 01:06:52.989
Will we learn to live in harmony or will we disappear?

1005
01:06:54.157 --> 01:06:55.158
Oh, you're not going to kill me?

1006
01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:57.869
Ah, because they are inherently conservative.

1007
01:06:57.952 --> 01:07:00.538
These native gods are also like this
It takes time to adapt

1008
01:07:00.747 --> 01:07:02.457
Ah, why are you like this?

1009
01:07:05.293 --> 01:07:06.419
Where did you get Samchung?

1010
01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:07.920
who gave it to me

1011
01:07:08.004 --> 01:07:09.297
Find my territory

1012
01:07:09.714 --> 01:07:11.257
- Who?
- I told you not to say it.

1013
01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.675
Then die

1014
01:07:15.887 --> 01:07:17.054
ride

1015
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.681
It was a man wearing a mask.

1016
01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:20.850
Hong

1017
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:25.229
Baektal

1018
01:07:36.449 --> 01:07:39.619
I made you die if you open your mouth

1019
01:07:40.328 --> 01:07:41.454
red and white mask

1020
01:07:42.997 --> 01:07:44.415
Who are you?

1021
01:08:00.848 --> 01:08:03.976
What survived the three insects?

1022
01:08:04.435 --> 01:08:05.895
You are the only one

1023
01:08:09.982 --> 01:08:11.901
I will make you a complete yaksha.

1024
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:40.513
Hongju?

1025
01:08:40.763 --> 01:08:41.848
Red and white mask

1026
01:08:43.808 --> 01:08:44.976
You mean it was you?

1027
01:08:58.739 --> 01:09:00.032
Nothing has changed?

1028
01:09:04.871 --> 01:09:06.163
Why are you wearing a red and white mask?

1029
01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:10.376
-Why did you...
-Hong Joo-ya

1030
01:09:10.793 --> 01:09:12.670
I am no longer the Cheon Muyoung you knew.

1031
01:09:13.462 --> 01:09:14.881
It's the same with Lee Yeon.

1032
01:09:22.597 --> 01:09:23.598
I missed you

1033
01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:36.152
I can't believe you came back alive

1034
01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:40.531
I can't believe it

1035
01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.544
Ugh, ah, my shoes, Mr.

1036
01:09:54.086 --> 01:09:56.005
Hey, look!

1037
01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:58.382
Look look

1038
01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:01.218
Passed, uh

1039
01:10:01.302 --> 01:10:02.470
Okay, next

1040
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.682
- Come finish.
-Why, let's go?

1041
01:10:09.477 --> 01:10:11.228
What's going on?
Why did it become like this?

1042
01:10:11.312 --> 01:10:13.064
next, next, now

1043
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.650
How did you know?

1044
01:10:16.275 --> 01:10:18.152
If you burn mugwort, the three insects will run away.

1045
01:10:18.361 --> 01:10:19.362
I didn't know

1046
01:10:19.445 --> 01:10:22.073
bitter, natural ingredient insect repellent

1047
01:10:22.323 --> 01:10:24.617
Well, even if Samchung did it himself,
I thought it was a bug

1048
01:10:27.703 --> 01:10:28.788
Can't you get kicked out?

1049
01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:30.790
Ah, this kid

Lee Yeon

1063
01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:45.281
Mr. Lee

1064
01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:49.535
Where have you been all this time?

1065
01:11:49.869 --> 01:11:51.203
Why did you leave me?

1066
01:11:51.287 --> 01:11:52.288
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1067
01:11:52.371 --> 01:11:55.207
I deliver several times a day, Mr.

1068
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:56.333
Do you know?

1069
01:11:56.417 --> 01:11:57.918
- You worked hard, you worked hard.
- That's it, bro.

1070
01:12:02.298 --> 01:12:03.382
Lee Rang?

1071
01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:04.675
Gusinju

1072
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:09.013
Brother

1073
01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.599
to death
I missed you, brother.

1074
01:12:11.682 --> 01:12:13.017
- I
- Ah!

1075
01:12:14.185 --> 01:12:15.728
Where is this pretending to be friendly?

1076
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:16.937
Oh, you're a kid

1077
01:12:17.021 --> 01:12:19.315
Oh my, baby, oh my

1078
01:12:19.398 --> 01:12:22.693
I'm trying to do this
I came here to see my brother.

1079
01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:26.947
I worked so hard for this

1080
01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:29.200
You worked hard, you worked hard

1081
01:12:31.535 --> 01:12:32.536
let's go

1082
01:13:46.861 --> 01:13:49.697
The guys I used to know
I don't think so.

1083
01:13:50.322 --> 01:13:51.574
‘It’s not Lee Yeon’

1084
01:13:51.657 --> 01:13:52.658
So what is it?

1085
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:54.702
Go to Lee Yeon
show me your pretty eyes

1086
01:13:54.785 --> 01:13:56.620
What you shouldn't see
I feel like I've seen it

1087
01:13:58.164 --> 01:13:59.290
Just one word

1088
01:13:59.373 --> 01:14:01.250
I can be on your side

1089
01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:03.377
What's beyond that mask?

1090
01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.461
Did you see it?

1091
01:14:04.545 --> 01:14:05.921
I have a bad feeling

1092
01:14:06.005 --> 01:14:08.007
You're forever stuck in the past

1093
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.091
Please save me!

1094
01:14:09.175 --> 01:14:11.510
everything you care about
You'll see me dying

1095
01:14:11.594 --> 01:14:13.387
Red and white mask, this bastard

1096
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:15.222
I will never leave you alive

1097
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:18.017
Go and meet the monsters on the floor of Gyeongseong.

1098
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.351
Come and spread the word.

1099
01:14:20.603 --> 01:14:22.146
Lee Yeon said she was blind.
