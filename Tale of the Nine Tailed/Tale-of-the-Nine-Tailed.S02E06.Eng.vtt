﻿1
00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:58.330
Cheon Moo-young?

2
00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:00.499
Muyoung?

3
00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:03.627
yes, it's me

4
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.795
How did you get here...

5
00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:05.962
Did you come back alive?

6
00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:09.549
Don't be funny

7
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:11.927
Muyoung died, I saw it.

8
00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:14.971
What are you?

9
00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:18.433
It's me

10
00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:21.436
your friend muyoung

11
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:27.317
This is it

12
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:29.611
It's proof that we three together are one.

13
00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:32.823
The one who betrayed

14
00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.033
die by my hands

15
00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:36.535
What if I lose it?

16
00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.329
I'm going to feed you deer poop.

17
00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:41.998
deer poop, deer poop
deer poop, deer poop

18
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.753
Why do you have it?

19
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.884
I hate eating deer poop.

20
00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.429
This doesn't make sense

21
00:01:56.513 --> 00:01:57.514
I missed you

22
00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:03.478
Ah!

23
00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:11.069
Are you wearing a red and white mask?

24
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:14.322
What do you mean?

25
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:20.787
You are still the same

26
00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:22.539
Still like fire

27
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:23.874
Who are you?

28
00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:30.130
I have now become the target of the Governor-General.

29
00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.340
My identity too

30
00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.384
I can't hide it anymore

31
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:36.052
please punish me

32
00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.013
Because of me, my brother

33
00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:40.015
No, I

34
00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:42.642
I put my boss in danger.

35
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:44.144
don't cry

36
00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:46.646
In this era, parasitic

37
00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:48.690
It should be a weed, not a flower

38
00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:54.779
Even if you spray pesticide, shake it off and get up

39
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.284
I'll keep that in mind

40
00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.874
Jaeyu, from now on
Keep an eye on the movements of the Governor-General

41
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.084
never

42
00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:10.670
Don't get hurt

43
00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.048
Yes, I will do as you ask.

44
00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:24.267
Now our Myoyeonggak

45
00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.353
What happens?

46
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:28.813
you guys do nothing
Do business as if nothing happened

47
00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:31.858
I will protect Myoyeonggak

48
00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.196
Boss, outside right now...

49
00:03:40.617 --> 00:03:41.910
What are you doing now?

50
00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:08.603
please stop

51
00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.157
I said let's see and see.
Who do these people think are bastards?

52
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.117
Ryu Hong-joo

53
00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.203
Are you crazy?

54
00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.290
Wouldn't it be better not to?

55
00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.376
I don't know, but you've hit a vital point

56
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.836
Besides

57
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.296
It's the sword of the mountain god, right?

58
00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.510
What do you want to do, you?

59
00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:25.472
There are two Lee Yeon?

60
00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.265
Really

61
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.933
Opium dealer in Manchuria

62
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.728
Hey, I got caught.

63
00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:33.855
But

64
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:37.025
I’m really Lee Yeon too, right?

65
00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.276
Just

66
00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.737
He just doesn't belong in this era

67
00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:54.000
Yeon shed a lot of blood.

68
00:05:56.127 --> 00:05:57.962
Our Muyoung is
How did he come back alive?

69
00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:00.507
The one who killed the undressing group
There's no way to revive it

70
00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:02.008
I'm a principled person

71
00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:03.426
me too

72
00:06:04.344 --> 00:06:06.012
I'm looking for an answer too

73
00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.764
who woke me up

74
00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:11.935
Perhaps neither alive nor dead
who am i

75
00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:14.646
you guys

76
00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.397
The day to elect the Four Great Mountain Gods

77
00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:18.691
What happened?

78
00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:20.235
say!

79
00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:22.362
What did you do?
Is our relationship broken?

80
00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.197
i killed it

81
00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.992
Muyoung’s brother

82
00:06:30.453 --> 00:06:31.454
crazy...

83
00:06:38.378 --> 00:06:39.420
But

84
00:06:42.257 --> 00:06:43.675
I don't regret it

85
00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:48.763
Shut up

86
00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:58.565
me

87
00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:02.652
You can't die here.

88
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.034
I really have to go back

89
00:07:10.702 --> 00:07:12.412
My breathing is getting harder.

90
00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:13.913
What should I do?

91
00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:15.957
What can save Yeoni now?

92
00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:20.128
It's only you

93
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.146
"Gyomyeonok Naengmyeon"

94
00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:40.106
I thought it was closed?

95
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.608
Should we go somewhere else?

96
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.817
no

97
00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:44.944
I eat where I want to eat

98
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.202
Bring me two bowls of cold noodles here.

99
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.745
Business is over

100
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.330
I don't accept guests

101
00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:00.543
cold noodles

102
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:24.609
Are you full after eating like that?

103
00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:26.486
I'm full

104
00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.990
the man is covered with a veil
I like women

105
00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:32.909
I eat as much as birdseed

106
00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:35.870
I don't even go to the bathroom

107
00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:40.875
Why?

108
00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.168
What's on my face?

109
00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:46.798
The more I look at it, the more interesting it gets.

110
00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:50.843
Me?

111
00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:53.930
I thought you were a clerk at a clothing store.
A mermaid in disguise

112
00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:56.975
poor legs
I thought it was half of it

113
00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:58.226
Surprisingly, he is the king of destruction

114
00:08:58.309 --> 00:08:59.394
King of Destruction?

115
00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:01.062
You destroy everything with your song

116
00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:02.855
That voice

117
00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:04.399
Did you get it from your mother?

118
00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:08.653
i hate my voice

119
00:09:09.612 --> 00:09:12.490
people happy
I sing because I want to make it for you.

120
00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:15.076
Sometimes without even knowing
After doing something like that...

121
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.911
Don't say you're full

122
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.121
That's good

123
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.206
fighting the world

124
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.250
That you have the power to protect yourself

125
00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:24.627
Is that so?

126
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.963
Then

127
00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:28.923
I will protect you and me

128
00:09:31.592 --> 00:09:33.636
Why are you protecting me?

129
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.221
um

130
00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:37.265
Because there are still five wishes left?

131
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.352
Than it looks
What a persistent woman.

132
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.023
calculate here

133
00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:04.375
Go in

134
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:06.127
Aren’t you going to take me there?

135
00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.006
Does this also count as a wish?

136
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.674
No, I'm going to use it sparingly.

137
00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:15.386
sleep well

138
00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:17.263
uh

139
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:08.439
"Obok Goods Store"

140
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.417
What made you like this

141
00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:30.878
A nine-tailed fox?

142
00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:32.213
yes

143
00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:34.215
He was a disguised person.

144
00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:36.342
President Myoyeonggak is also part of the same group.

145
00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:38.302
Let’s sweep it away right away.

146
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.891
Leeyeon

147
00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:47.812
Good

148
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.816
A monster worth using in Joseon

149
00:11:52.733 --> 00:11:55.027
It's overflowing.

150
00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:03.703
Tell them to hurry up the development of the gold mine.

151
00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:07.498
Are you going to leave Myoyeonggak alone?

152
00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:09.667
war is raging

153
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.919
Expanding military budget comes first

154
00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:13.963
we are

155
00:12:14.672 --> 00:12:16.382
go to the lab

156
00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.261
become a new prey

157
00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:22.263
We have secured the Joseon monsters

158
00:12:26.517 --> 00:12:28.519
not prey

159
00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:35.151
The weapons of war of our empire

160
00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:37.737
Yes!

161
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.289
Did you find out?

162
00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:51.167
Myoyeonggak right now
I don't think they'll attack.

163
00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:52.502
What about the police chief?

164
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.755
Take only one henchman
What kind of laboratory are you going to?

165
00:12:55.963 --> 00:12:56.964
Lab?

166
00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:58.049
What is that?

167
00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:59.884
That's...

168
00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:09.310
It's top secret so I don't know the details.

169
00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:12.396
However, those who were caught there
There is a rumor that he is not human.

170
00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.168
Let me introduce you

171
00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:35.586
New member of our organization

172
00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:37.547
Oh!

173
00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:41.384
Oh, are these people Eunho’s gang members?

174
00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:43.344
Let’s start with the goods imported from Manchuria.

175
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.350
This is me
Is this something you received from Gyeongseong Station?

176
00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:51.519
Real bomb?

177
00:13:51.978 --> 00:13:52.979
You know?

178
00:13:53.187 --> 00:13:55.523
Bringing in bombs
Possession is also a felony.

179
00:13:56.107 --> 00:13:57.191
So from now on

180
00:13:57.733 --> 00:13:59.193
Everyone needs to protect each other

181
00:13:59.819 --> 00:14:01.237
Even if I get discovered by chance

182
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.530
I

183
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.156
He'll claim he was the sole offender.

184
00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:05.908
me too

185
00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:07.159
Me too

186
00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:10.454
This is it

187
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.415
Liberation Volunteer Corps

188
00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:17.545
What is the date of the rebellion?

189
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:20.965
Instructions will come from Manchuria soon.

190
00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:24.260
Oh, excuse me for a second.

191
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.101
Why are you here?

192
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:33.686
I am the gatekeeper of Samdocheon.

193
00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:36.314
I have seen countless deaths, but

194
00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.107
This is not it

195
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.026
From war to torture to forced labor

196
00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:42.403
To be trampled like that
These are not the lives born

197
00:14:42.612 --> 00:14:43.946
Do you know the elders of the undressing group?

198
00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:46.949
I'm so excited about not interfering in human affairs.

199
00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:49.118
It's a secret

200
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.703
fact

201
00:14:51.162 --> 00:14:53.039
I also came without Lee Yeon’s knowledge.

202
00:14:53.372 --> 00:14:54.373
Welcome back

203
00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:57.209
The name is a Joseon Yokai.

204
00:14:57.293 --> 00:15:00.463
I lost my country
You can't just suck your fingers, can you?

205
00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:03.382
cool

206
00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:04.884
comrades

207
00:15:33.746 --> 00:15:35.498
Cheon Mu-young’s talent is still the same.

208
00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.292
I'll wake up in half a day.

209
00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:40.378
Why did you save me?

210
00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:44.799
You said you died because of him

211
00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.469
I want to put everything back in its place

212
00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:51.806
I dragged Yeon back to the past.

213
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:52.890
In place?

214
00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:01.565
My family and the forest I ruled

215
00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:03.734
I'll get it all back

216
00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.904
For that, I need Yeon.

217
00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.782
This friend

218
00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:12.493
There is no connection between 1938 and
I have it

219
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.121
What does it mean?

220
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.041
you will soon find out

221
00:16:21.544 --> 00:16:23.295
You don’t know that you are wearing a red and white mask, right?

222
00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.133
Shhh

223
00:17:04.336 --> 00:17:06.338
W, Yuna, I’m scared

224
00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:09.091
They say a monkfish appears in this forest.

225
00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:10.634
You know?

226
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.387
People and animals are just eaten.

227
00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:18.684
Hey, don't bother Muyoung.

228
00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:22.188
The old lady from the Talui faction must have known, right?

229
00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:23.689
We ran away

230
00:17:23.773 --> 00:17:24.940
Let's go back now

231
00:17:25.024 --> 00:17:27.443
If you run away from home, you have to face the end.

232
00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:29.195
Give up everything you have

233
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:38.621
Hongjoo

234
00:17:38.704 --> 00:17:40.039
Are you here to open a tavern?

235
00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:42.333
I can't stand being hungry

236
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.293
What is that?

237
00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:46.921
You have to study writing every day

238
00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:48.547
Anyway, Cheon Mu-young

239
00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:51.258
Are you a crock?

240
00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:52.802
I don't know anything else

241
00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:54.470
I have to change my insides every day

242
00:17:55.513 --> 00:17:56.514
and

243
00:17:58.182 --> 00:17:59.767
Yes, salty

244
00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.311
The grandmother of the undressing group
It's a comb I love so much.

245
00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:04.063
It's revenge for bullying us.

246
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:18.202
This is it

247
00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:20.371
It's proof that we three together are one.

248
00:18:22.164 --> 00:18:23.541
The one who betrayed

249
00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:25.793
die by my hands

250
00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:27.294
What if I lose it?

251
00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:30.172
I'm going to feed you deer poop.

252
00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:32.758
deer poop, deer poop
deer poop, deer poop

253
00:18:56.907 --> 00:18:57.950
Yuna, I'm sorry

254
00:19:01.662 --> 00:19:03.038
I want you

255
00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:06.709
It doesn’t matter whether it’s Lee Yeon’s past or future.

256
00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:10.379
I love you in my own way

257
00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:13.215
Muyoungil

258
00:19:14.383 --> 00:19:15.509
I will protect it

259
00:19:17.595 --> 00:19:19.805
Between us
Even if it gets tattered

260
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.106
New gisaengs are coming?

261
00:19:29.732 --> 00:19:30.733
In this situation?

262
00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:34.278
Until the boss orders
Myoyeonggak is open for business as usual.

263
00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:37.907
How many are coming?

264
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.909
There are six candidates

265
00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:42.077
The boss said he would meet and decide.

266
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:44.830
How old are you? Are you pretty?

267
00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.916
Oh no, except for our boss.

268
00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.709
You hate all pretty women

269
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.962
Shut up, you're the exception

270
00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:53.714
you

271
00:19:53.797 --> 00:19:55.966
Standing in front of the door
Report on the kids' condition

272
00:19:56.592 --> 00:19:57.593
yes

273
00:20:15.152 --> 00:20:16.236
What is this?

274
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.947
It's kind of an invitation

275
00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:20.741
If you bury this in an inconspicuous place,

276
00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:22.493
That guy will come back on his own feet.

277
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:24.954
If you want to fix your body, grab it

278
00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:26.163
That?

279
00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:27.915
it is

280
00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:29.416
Boy, I guess I'm too kind

281
00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:32.586
Close again

282
00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:38.676
How can someone like that?

283
00:20:39.218 --> 00:20:40.219
Whether you like it or not

284
00:20:40.844 --> 00:20:41.845
no

285
00:20:41.929 --> 00:20:43.013
Sore

286
00:20:43.472 --> 00:20:45.432
Can I catch him with this body?

287
00:20:45.641 --> 00:20:47.893
Isn’t there a way to take it with my own hands?

288
00:20:52.106 --> 00:20:53.232
A guest is coming

289
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.401
Yuna

290
00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:57.903
In this dangerous match

291
00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:00.531
Please be my chess piece

292
00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:34.481
Wow, pretty

293
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.621
Strange?

294
00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:53.292
Why seven and not six?

295
00:22:07.514 --> 00:22:08.599
honey

296
00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:29.328
The ice melts like snow in your mouth?

297
00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:30.788
yes?

298
00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:32.039
This is shaved ice

299
00:22:32.122 --> 00:22:34.124
It's uproar in Gyeongseong.

300
00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:37.294
Have you been wandering around every night eating this?

301
00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:39.880
The line must be so long

302
00:22:41.715 --> 00:22:43.926
Do you think they sell shaved ice at good quality stores?

303
00:22:45.844 --> 00:22:48.931
Whatever you plan, do it in moderation.

304
00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:52.226
History is made by humans
not us

305
00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:54.269
We are the gods of Joseon

306
00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:56.647
Has there ever been a death without a story on this earth?

307
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.732
Even after going through the Japanese invasion and turmoil, I woke up

308
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.611
It will happen

309
00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:07.074
Ai!

310
00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:08.867
Are they back again?

311
00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:11.245
Hey, those idiots, Mr.

312
00:23:11.328 --> 00:23:13.163
To our land that has been preserved for thousands of years

313
00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:14.623
-Why are they...
- I go and

314
00:23:14.706 --> 00:23:15.999
I'll scold you and come back.

315
00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:18.210
They're all dead, Mr. Lee.

316
00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:20.546
Native gods say they don’t know me

317
00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:22.714
The breakaway faction must retreat!

318
00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:24.716
Go away! Go away!

319
00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:27.386
♪ Ari Arirang ♪

320
00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:28.846

321
00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:31.932

♪ Arari came out ♪

324
00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:42.067
Hey, take off your clothes.
Please let me meet you, okay?

325
00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:44.987
Ah, hey, our personality.
Is it because you don’t know?

326
00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:47.322
If you keep doing this, you will get hit by lightning.

327
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:51.034
If you get hit by lightning, you get hit!

328
00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:53.704
Oh, no, why are they pushing the forest?

329
00:23:53.787 --> 00:23:56.290
digging into the ground
I'm taking down the jangseung.

330
00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:59.751
No, alive or dead
People who don't know whether they are alive or dead

331
00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:01.336
It's the placenta

332
00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:03.255
Oh my, it's sad

333
00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:15.225
Huh?

334
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.274
louder

335
00:24:31.116 --> 00:24:32.492
Are you awake, honey?

336
00:24:32.576 --> 00:24:33.702
to?

337
00:24:34.036 --> 00:24:35.370
Hey

338
00:24:35.454 --> 00:24:37.664
You skewer me like a chicken skewer

339
00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:39.791
What? self?

340
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.752
In the meantime
Who was it that betrayed me?

341
00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:43.253
What are you skipping?

342
00:24:43.337 --> 00:24:45.380
Did you get so excited about the fake theme?

343
00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:47.966
If you peel it back, it's all there.

344
00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:49.927
fish oil, seeds

345
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.637
What did you do while I was sleeping? uh?

346
00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:53.931
I did something

347
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.351
I'm not

348
00:25:00.103 --> 00:25:01.230
No way...

349
00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:08.820
Is he really Cheon Mu-young?

350
00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:11.740
I really came back alive

351
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.244
uh

352
00:25:15.327 --> 00:25:16.578
I heard that rumor

353
00:25:16.662 --> 00:25:18.538
In the test to select the Four Great Mountain Gods

354
00:25:18.622 --> 00:25:20.624
Without cutting even a single monster
I heard you passed?

355
00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:22.626
You just had treatment? why?

356
00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:24.044
um

357
00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.296
You want to eat it raw?

358
00:25:26.588 --> 00:25:27.673
You eat it raw.

359
00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:32.636
Born only once every hundred years
The owner of that rare blood?

360
00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:34.263
When you go, draw some blood and go.

361
00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.597
You can sell it to me

362
00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:37.891
How much will you give me?

363
00:25:37.975 --> 00:25:39.726
Baby, let me cum, Lee Yeon said she was your friend.

364
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.019
Hey

365
00:25:41.895 --> 00:25:44.690
What is this, what are you doing?
She's completely identical to Lee Yeon.

366
00:25:45.607 --> 00:25:47.985
Because we don’t look alike at all? apologize

367
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.112
Huh? Lee Yeon

368
00:25:51.196 --> 00:25:52.197
Are you okay?

369
00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.117
Talk to me

370
00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.165
Still can't believe it?

371
00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:05.085
no

372
00:26:06.295 --> 00:26:07.337
believe it

373
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:08.714
That you are Muyoung

374
00:26:11.133 --> 00:26:13.969
But I need to know this

375
00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:16.638
Why did you come to me at this time?

376
00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:18.307
how did you find me

377
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.642
Why did you come?

378
00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:22.811
um

379
00:26:26.898 --> 00:26:27.899
This

380
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.241
What is this?

381
00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:40.037
Just in case you knew better

382
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.580
uh

383
00:26:41.997 --> 00:26:43.874
Because I say this
Do you want it?

384
00:26:50.964 --> 00:26:51.965
Just kidding

385
00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:53.383
I don't need this

386
00:26:58.513 --> 00:26:59.598
How did I find it?

387
00:27:02.184 --> 00:27:03.602
half of my body

388
00:27:09.274 --> 00:27:10.984
It's still like a stone

389
00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:18.283
I don't know who saved me, but

390
00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:21.411
The curse of the Talui faction
I don't think I could escape

391
00:27:25.332 --> 00:27:27.834
I wonder if there is a cure
I went to the monsters' pawn shop

392
00:27:28.585 --> 00:27:29.669
I met them

393
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.798
Raccoon couple?

394
00:27:33.256 --> 00:27:34.299
Have these been released?

395
00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:35.926
I heard about you there

396
00:27:37.344 --> 00:27:38.720
I came straight here

397
00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:47.687
Welcome, my friend.

398
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.529
Why don't you go see the old lady in the dressing room?

399
00:27:55.612 --> 00:27:58.031
Put your body back to normal

400
00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:00.826
Would you forgive me?

401
00:28:01.243 --> 00:28:03.370
The mountain god who slaughtered the mountain he ruled

402
00:28:06.456 --> 00:28:07.457
Why did you do that?

403
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:09.084
Because I want to save my brother

404
00:28:12.754 --> 00:28:14.756
Even if I have to exchange everything I care about

405
00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:23.140
the picture is good

406
00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:26.893
Let's both change our clothes and look nice

407
00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:28.353
Why the clothes?

408
00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:30.147
Let's play, the three of us

409
00:28:30.564 --> 00:28:31.940
Just like in the old days, without thinking

410
00:28:32.023 --> 00:28:33.150
Oh, hey there

411
00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:35.527
Yesterday, that was for the two of us
Did you put a knife in it?

412
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.112
If you want to crack it, crack it

413
00:28:37.904 --> 00:28:39.030

00:29:19.988 --> 00:29:21.323
You said you never learned to play the piano?

418
00:29:21.406 --> 00:29:23.700
I don't know, I just pressed what I heard.

419
00:29:24.326 --> 00:29:25.619
Lang, you must be a genius.

420
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.998
Well, since I was young
I often heard that sound

421
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:31.082
I learn everything quickly

422
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:33.418
cute

423
00:29:33.502 --> 00:29:35.045
I am the leader of a bandit gang.

424
00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:36.755
Sowon, go to sleep and get rid of this.

425
00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:40.759
Let's continue

426
00:29:44.888 --> 00:29:46.014

Who are you?

445
00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:09.908
Oh, be surprised.

446
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.370
sister

447
00:32:13.453 --> 00:32:14.829
The kitchen lady said the soy sauce tastes strange.

448
00:32:14.913 --> 00:32:16.039
What chapter?

449
00:32:16.122 --> 00:32:18.083
Soybean paste, red pepper paste, soy sauce, all

450
00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:32.597
Is it true?

451
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:35.100
The taste has changed, like it's gone bad

452
00:32:35.183 --> 00:32:38.311
If something goes wrong at home
They say the taste of soybean paste changes.

453
00:32:38.395 --> 00:32:40.021
You don't say things like that carelessly.

454
00:32:40.605 --> 00:32:41.648
Did you get dirty when soaking it?

455
00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:43.775
You picked me without hands and soaked them.

456
00:32:44.693 --> 00:32:46.152
I went through the exam well.

457
00:32:46.236 --> 00:32:47.779
Ah, but why do you do that?

458
00:32:50.699 --> 00:32:52.200
Wow

459
00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:21.312
Is there anyone there?

460
00:33:25.608 --> 00:33:26.943
Have you not seen my tune?

461
00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:29.946
Kookhee sister?

462
00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:31.614
Have you lost your ring?

463
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.703
But there
How did you get in?

464
00:33:37.162 --> 00:33:38.538
Can you help me find it together?

465
00:33:38.913 --> 00:33:40.123
It's something precious.

466
00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:49.841
Oh, huh?

467
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.801
Isn't this it?

468
00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:53.011
Where are you looking?

469
00:33:53.928 --> 00:33:55.096
Just a little closer

470
00:33:56.514 --> 00:33:57.724
closer

471
00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:10.153
Uh, sister

472
00:34:10.236 --> 00:34:11.237
Kookhee unni...

473
00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:12.739
What am I?

474
00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:16.159
You were just under the floor.

475
00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:17.660
What are you talking about?

476
00:34:18.203 --> 00:34:19.829
Wow

477
00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:21.831
Did the young kid see something wrong in broad daylight?

478
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.590
thank you

479
00:34:34.844 --> 00:34:35.887
let's go

480
00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:41.017
He's like this again

481
00:34:41.893 --> 00:34:43.436
Hey, go, go, go

482
00:34:43.645 --> 00:34:45.730
No, well, I'm going to watch a movie.
Dressed up like this

483
00:34:45.814 --> 00:34:47.148
Come this far and...

484
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:57.992
What is it?

485
00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:11.214
Oh, why?

486
00:35:12.173 --> 00:35:13.842
Give it to me!

487
00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:19.347
Ah, let's be quiet, there.

488
00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:24.185
I wish I had given it to you earlier.

489
00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:45.999
- Are you crying?
- Wow

490
00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:53.882
um

491
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.596
There is such a thing

492
00:36:42.847 --> 00:36:43.848
What is it?

493
00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:45.058
- Oh, what is it?
- Oh, it's raining.

494
00:36:45.141 --> 00:36:46.309
No, why is it raining suddenly?

495
00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:48.269
- Oh, really, oh my!
- hey!

496
00:36:48.353 --> 00:36:51.147
As long as he runs
Is it really that serious?

497
00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:53.691
Because I hate getting my fur wet

498
00:36:55.902 --> 00:36:57.028
What do you think?

499
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.821
What about Lee Yeon who took off her mask and met her?

500
00:37:01.407 --> 00:37:03.785
Still honest and wise

501
00:37:04.118 --> 00:37:05.370
You're so confident

502
00:37:06.621 --> 00:37:08.373
It's just the way I liked it

503
00:37:19.217 --> 00:37:21.511
Wow, the raindrops are thick.

504
00:37:21.594 --> 00:37:22.762
Hey

505
00:37:23.638 --> 00:37:25.139
Ah, let's write it together

506
00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:26.849
I don't want you to be the only one caught in the rain

507
00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.977
Then you get one arm wet

508
00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:32.355
You haven't changed?

509
00:37:32.438 --> 00:37:33.690
Ah, sir, ah

510
00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:35.066
Hey, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

511
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:36.776
- Oh, really, Mr.
- Hey, Lee Yeon

512
00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:38.444
Hey, stick, stick

513
00:37:38.528 --> 00:37:40.863
Huh? Even if it gets a little wet
Originally, it was shared between the three of us.

514
00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:42.782
He hasn't changed either

515
00:37:55.962 --> 00:37:57.755
‘At Cheolsu and Younghee’s house’

516
00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:59.590
‘The distance to the bakery is 10km’

517
00:37:59.841 --> 00:38:02.093
‘Withdrawal at a speed of 5 km per hour’

518
00:38:02.176 --> 00:38:04.262
‘Younghee moves at a speed of 3 km per hour’

519
00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.722
‘I walked towards the bakery’

520
00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:09.392
'To meet at 2 p.m.
Cheolsu and Younghee'

521
00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:11.394
'What time did each person leave?'

522
00:38:12.103 --> 00:38:14.856
Let's review what we learned last time.

523
00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:16.774
What kind of bread do you two eat?

524
00:38:16.858 --> 00:38:18.234
If it's morel bread, I won't go out.

525
00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:19.610
castella

526
00:38:19.694 --> 00:38:22.405
Ha, I can't stand castella.

527
00:38:24.157 --> 00:38:25.533
Is Cheolsu handsome?

528
00:38:25.616 --> 00:38:28.453
He's handsome, young, and has a car.
I am a cultural homeowner.

529
00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:30.747
Then I can't leave until 2 o'clock.

530
00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:32.040
I have to stop by the hair salon.

531
00:38:34.333 --> 00:38:35.960
Are there any students who solved the problem?

532
00:38:36.961 --> 00:38:38.796
Departure at 12pm

533
00:38:39.797 --> 00:38:42.091
Younghee, it’s 10:40 a.m.

534
00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:43.885
Correct answer

535
00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:45.720
Jukhyang never went to school, right?

536
00:38:50.516 --> 00:38:51.934
Should we try solving another problem?

537
00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:56.189
'The bread factory workers
There were a total of 40 people including men and women.'

538
00:38:56.272 --> 00:38:58.524
'The number of bread factory men this year is
'How many people?'

539
00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:00.693
18 people

540
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.361
Correct answer

541
00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:05.073
‘Younghee went to the bakery.
'How long did it take to get there?'

542
00:39:08.034 --> 00:39:09.368
32 minutes

543
00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:10.661
Correct answer

544
00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:12.205
Wow

545
00:39:12.955 --> 00:39:15.333
Jukhyang is good at studying.

546
00:39:20.463 --> 00:39:21.464
Huh?

547
00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:23.257
Teacher, I think the fire is going out.

548
00:39:23.633 --> 00:39:25.343
Well, that's all for today.

549
00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:27.678
Shall we have a glass of Cheongju each?

550
00:39:27.762 --> 00:39:28.930
yes

551
00:39:29.013 --> 00:39:30.848
- I'm excited.
- Wow

552
00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:32.809
Jukhyang goes to sleep

553
00:39:32.892 --> 00:39:33.976
yes

554
00:40:01.462 --> 00:40:02.880
salty

555
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.302
Huh?

556
00:40:09.262 --> 00:40:10.429
Is there a power outage?

557
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.431
It happens again

558
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:15.893
Ah, it's like this all the time

559
00:40:15.977 --> 00:40:18.104
- Go back.
- Oh, I hate it.

560
00:40:18.354 --> 00:40:19.355
I'm sleepy

561
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.525
- Thank you, Mr. Plum.
- Yes

562
00:40:23.568 --> 00:40:27.655
Oh, in the blackout
I like playing in corners.

563
00:40:28.281 --> 00:40:29.407
- Right, right?
-What is nooknori?

564
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:32.160
A game where you summon the ghost living in the corner.

565
00:40:32.827 --> 00:40:34.620
When you meet a ghost

566
00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:37.498
My future self, sir.
They say they will let you know

567
00:40:39.167 --> 00:40:40.585
Sounds fun.

568
00:40:40.668 --> 00:40:42.378
Shall we give it a try?

569
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:43.504
I do it, I do it

570
00:40:46.632 --> 00:40:49.135
When starting
To participate in the game

571
00:40:49.218 --> 00:40:50.595
say your name loudly

572
00:40:50.678 --> 00:40:52.221
When it's over, name it backwards

573
00:40:52.305 --> 00:40:54.932
At first it's 'Eun-ho', at the end it's 'Ho-eun'

574
00:40:55.308 --> 00:40:58.269
When the person behind you taps your back
I'll move seats one by one

575
00:41:00.062 --> 00:41:02.023
It's just spinning around.

576
00:41:02.481 --> 00:41:03.482
It's bland

577
00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:07.737
Then in his place
If someone stands still and doesn't move

578
00:41:07.945 --> 00:41:08.946
They say that's a ghost

579
00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:10.907
The most important thing

580
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.075
When playing in the corner
You must never say anything.

581
00:41:14.035 --> 00:41:15.369
Then let’s begin, Kook Hee.

582
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:17.663
Eunho

583
00:41:18.497 --> 00:41:19.790
- plum blossom
- orchid

584
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:32.154
Huh? what?

585
00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:37.994
one, two

586
00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:41.455
three

587
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.582
four

588
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.002
Five?

589
00:42:47.378 --> 00:42:48.838
There are five people in this room

590
00:42:50.673 --> 00:42:52.216
Can't we stop now?

591
00:42:53.551 --> 00:42:54.844
I'm scared

592
00:42:56.262 --> 00:42:57.847
not me

593
00:42:58.055 --> 00:42:59.557
There's someone else in this room right now

594
00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:03.269
Turn on the lights!

595
00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:12.403
- uh?
- uh? teacher

596
00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:13.696
Huh?

597
00:43:13.779 --> 00:43:14.780
teacher

598
00:43:14.864 --> 00:43:16.365
You disappeared

599
00:43:16.907 --> 00:43:18.784
The teacher is gone

600
00:43:29.503 --> 00:43:31.213
Oh, that's right, Hongju.
Do you remember that?

601
00:43:31.422 --> 00:43:32.715
Did he fall into the back yard a long time ago?

602
00:43:34.508 --> 00:43:36.344
Hey, suddenly?

603
00:43:36.677 --> 00:43:37.803
I remember

604
00:43:37.887 --> 00:43:40.723
We covered our eyes and played hide and seek

605
00:43:41.057 --> 00:43:42.350
You saved Muyoung.

606
00:43:42.433 --> 00:43:44.268
On both sides of the world, I’m the kid who didn’t cry

607
00:43:44.769 --> 00:43:46.437
That night, I covered myself with a blanket and cried.

608
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.105
Ah, these are real

609
00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:50.232
With someone else's painful past

610
00:43:50.316 --> 00:43:53.569
I've been suffering from tuberculosis since that day, huh?

611
00:43:55.571 --> 00:43:56.572
IC

612
00:43:57.782 --> 00:43:59.533
Oh, what does he do? Asiatic black bear

613
00:43:59.617 --> 00:44:01.911
He was a very honest and quiet kid.

614
00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:03.579
You didn't know he would become one of the Four Great Mountain Gods.

615
00:44:03.913 --> 00:44:06.957
Ah, that friend is now in the future

616
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:08.918
Part-time job in a folk village...

617
00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:11.170
I'm working, work, yeah

618
00:44:11.629 --> 00:44:12.630
What kind of country?

619
00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:16.008
What bar?

620
00:44:18.844 --> 00:44:20.054
What bar?

621
00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:24.558
But I feel a little strange

622
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:27.728
The three of us like this
I never thought we would drink together

623
00:44:28.229 --> 00:44:30.439
That too in 1938

624
00:44:31.857 --> 00:44:34.068
Have I ever made a wish like that before?

625
00:44:36.237 --> 00:44:38.572
'Time goes on like this
'I wish it would stop'

626
00:44:38.989 --> 00:44:40.491
Please for the three of us

627
00:44:42.243 --> 00:44:43.953
Please don't take anything away from me

628
00:44:50.126 --> 00:44:52.002
My wishes didn't come true

629
00:44:54.338 --> 00:44:55.339
Damn it

630
00:44:57.425 --> 00:44:59.093
Oh, I ran out of alcohol.

631
00:45:01.011 --> 00:45:02.430
I will make that wish come true

632
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.181
I'll be right back

633
00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:18.529
How have you been?

634
00:45:18.821 --> 00:45:19.989
In the future world?

635
00:45:21.198 --> 00:45:22.199
I watched Yeon.

636
00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:26.328
In that era, Yeoni
He had so many things

637
00:45:28.873 --> 00:45:30.958
Working under an old woman from the Talui faction

638
00:45:31.876 --> 00:45:33.794
Family and friends by my side

639
00:45:34.962 --> 00:45:36.547
And to the woman I love

640
00:45:51.228 --> 00:45:52.521
Not Yeon.

641
00:45:53.856 --> 00:45:54.899
tell me your story

642
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:56.192
About me?

643
00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:11.582
Because I’m in the middle of it, I’m passionate too
It's awesome, and really sturdy, right? 3 barrels...

644
00:46:11.665 --> 00:46:13.417
Just like an iron knife...

645
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.252
Brother

646
00:46:20.049 --> 00:46:21.842
literally just
Are you designing the action?

647
00:46:21.926 --> 00:46:23.552
- Right? This is now
- Yes, that's right.

648
00:46:23.636 --> 00:46:25.095
where are you fighting
I think it would be good

649
00:46:25.179 --> 00:46:27.515
magic painted
That dull blade that won't sharpen...

650
00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:29.433
I

651
00:46:30.935 --> 00:46:32.228
So so so much

652
00:46:33.979 --> 00:46:37.358
So so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much
I'm living so well

653
00:46:43.822 --> 00:46:45.199
Thank goodness

654
00:47:00.506 --> 00:47:03.592
Plum seeds, orchid seeds
Where is everyone?

655
00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:12.810
Where is everyone?

656
00:47:14.728 --> 00:47:15.771
plum seed

657
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.835
Hey there

658
00:47:48.721 --> 00:47:50.139
Ha, it's dead

659
00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:56.478
Hey there

660
00:47:56.562 --> 00:47:57.855
Hey, is there anyone here?

661
00:47:59.773 --> 00:48:00.774
Hey there

662
00:48:01.275 --> 00:48:02.610
Hey there!

663
00:48:03.694 --> 00:48:05.571
There's someone here, over there!

664
00:48:05.988 --> 00:48:07.573
Is there anyone? hey!

665
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:09.074
Do you know what you guys did?

666
00:48:09.408 --> 00:48:10.534
I'm sorry

667
00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:13.120
We're just having fun...

668
00:48:13.203 --> 00:48:14.913
What? fun?

669
00:48:15.873 --> 00:48:19.001
Of all that nonsense
It's calling out the most poisonous things!

670
00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:20.628
I really didn't know

671
00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:23.672
Mr. Eunho
What happened?

672
00:48:25.215 --> 00:48:26.300
I'll take care of it

673
00:48:26.925 --> 00:48:28.177
I go to my room and get some rest.

674
00:48:30.763 --> 00:48:32.431
Ah, go

675
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:40.564
Why do people keep doing that?
Might be creating a dangerous game, huh?

676
00:48:41.357 --> 00:48:43.233
Well, is it a nook game or a self-immolation sabani?

677
00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:44.818
They said they couldn't handle it

678
00:48:44.902 --> 00:48:46.570
Curiosity about an unfamiliar world, well.

679
00:48:46.654 --> 00:48:48.322
Hey, I'm pissed

680
00:48:48.739 --> 00:48:51.575
What a swollen bastard
How dare you in my area

681
00:48:52.368 --> 00:48:55.371
Living in a corner or threshold
Isn’t it like Ji Bakryeong?

682
00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:57.873
It must have been as twisted as possible
I'm not that strong

683
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:01.085
This is my first time seeing a human captured.

684
00:49:01.752 --> 00:49:03.462
Yeah, catch it and ask, whatever.

685
00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:04.672
'Why did you do that?'

686
00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:07.424
- Oh, it's annoying, ugh.
- Ah, Mr.

687
00:49:10.386 --> 00:49:11.470
Go slowly

688
00:49:11.553 --> 00:49:12.638
So impatient...

689
00:49:14.765 --> 00:49:15.933
it came

690
00:49:18.185 --> 00:49:19.311
Sore

691
00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:21.980
Why did you take a human woman?

692
00:49:23.148 --> 00:49:24.775
Hey, is there anyone here?

693
00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:42.960
Let's play in the corner?

694
00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:45.129
Seonwoo Eunho wants you to save that woman?

695
00:49:45.212 --> 00:49:46.422
The page numbers have to match.

696
00:49:46.922 --> 00:49:48.924
Ah, I'm really scared of ghosts.

697
00:49:49.007 --> 00:49:50.300
Ah

698
00:49:51.135 --> 00:49:53.846
The mountain god in front of me
There are three of us, so don’t be rude.

699
00:49:53.929 --> 00:49:56.348
We are in Baekdudaegan
Do you think I got killed while playing golf?

700
00:49:56.432 --> 00:49:57.933
Why don't Hong Joo leave?

701
00:49:58.517 --> 00:49:59.768
I don't even know who the other person is yet

702
00:49:59.852 --> 00:50:02.813
Thank you for your concern
this is my home

703
00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:04.273
I protect myself

704
00:50:07.776 --> 00:50:09.278
I guess you don't have to worry about me at all?

705
00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:11.780
start

706
00:50:12.698 --> 00:50:13.907
Just show up

707
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:15.200
I cut it right away

708
00:50:17.745 --> 00:50:19.413
Then, secure your positions.

709
00:50:19.496 --> 00:50:21.415
Until he comes out
no one can tell

710
00:50:21.498 --> 00:50:22.583
Uh oh

711
00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:24.209
Especially the person behind me

712
00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:28.630
our children

713
00:50:28.714 --> 00:50:31.717
Beat it quickly
Let’s have some hangover liquor with fried rice.

714
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.968
Ah, yes, yes

715
00:50:33.427 --> 00:50:35.137
Then say each person’s name.
Let's start

716
00:50:36.764 --> 00:50:37.806
Gusinju

717
00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:40.392
- Cheon Mu-young
- Lee Yeon

718
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:42.144
Ryu Hong-joo

719
00:50:56.575 --> 00:50:59.453
Mr. Eunho
Where on earth has it gone?

720
00:50:59.536 --> 00:51:02.539
This isn't my first time playing in the corner.
Why does this happen?

721
00:51:02.623 --> 00:51:05.000
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps to death

722
00:51:05.959 --> 00:51:07.169
Let’s start by sprinkling salt

723
00:51:11.048 --> 00:51:13.383
sister

724
00:51:17.346 --> 00:51:18.680
I'll go and come back

725
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.272
Guys, open the door.

726
00:51:28.857 --> 00:51:29.900
Just come in

727
00:51:30.317 --> 00:51:31.902
I have no hands

728
00:51:31.985 --> 00:51:34.863
Ah, this sister is salt
Did you bring it in sacks?

729
00:51:39.576 --> 00:51:40.577
why?

730
00:51:41.703 --> 00:51:42.830
I don't think so

731
00:51:42.913 --> 00:51:44.039
What?

732
00:51:44.122 --> 00:51:45.374
What are you doing?

733
00:51:45.457 --> 00:51:47.334
open it, quickly

734
00:51:48.794 --> 00:51:50.462
It's not Plum Sister

735
00:51:50.796 --> 00:51:51.922
Huh?

736
00:51:52.256 --> 00:51:54.007
Oh, no way

737
00:52:21.118 --> 00:52:22.536
Ah, there we are.

738
00:52:22.953 --> 00:52:25.539
Did I say your name backwards earlier?

739
00:52:26.373 --> 00:52:27.499
I forgot

740
00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:28.709
Oh, what should I do?

741
00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:30.627
corner play

742
00:52:30.711 --> 00:52:32.337
It's not over yet

743
00:52:56.612 --> 00:52:58.488
came

744
00:53:02.117 --> 00:53:03.452
What do you do with the lights off?

745
00:53:06.038 --> 00:53:07.039
Are you Lang?

746
00:53:07.122 --> 00:53:09.124
What are you doing at night when you can't sleep?

747
00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:11.293
Hey, turn on that light

748
00:53:11.376 --> 00:53:12.461
That's not your brother, that's it

749
00:53:12.544 --> 00:53:13.795
Is it him?

750
00:53:13.879 --> 00:53:16.465
I'm sure
Cut it down, Lee Yeon, quickly!

751
00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:21.553
No!

752
00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:24.640
Ah, Mr.

753
00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:26.266
Langa

754
00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:27.768
Oh, you're not crazy, this is

755
00:53:29.645 --> 00:53:30.646
sorry

756
00:53:31.396 --> 00:53:33.398
Oh, sorry, I thought it was him again.

757
00:53:35.317 --> 00:53:37.361
- Hey, Cheon Muyoung, you were...
- Why me?

758
00:53:37.444 --> 00:53:38.862
He said he was sure?

759
00:53:41.156 --> 00:53:43.200
I start playing in the corner
Didn't say a word

760
00:53:44.576 --> 00:53:45.577
Huh?

761
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:53.001
definitely not you
It was him?

762
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.628
Why do you think it's me?

763
00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:59.299
I'm sorry for what the two of you said.

764
00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:01.677
Where did boss Hongju go?

765
00:54:14.606 --> 00:54:15.774
sister

766
00:54:15.857 --> 00:54:17.192
Did you see anything outside?

767
00:54:17.484 --> 00:54:18.944
A little while ago...

768
00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:22.322
Didn't you see it?

769
00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:26.410
listen

770
00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:34.793
I'm so scared I'm dying

771
00:54:47.014 --> 00:54:48.056
no

772
00:54:48.432 --> 00:54:50.267
This wasn't what I wanted

773
00:54:50.726 --> 00:54:51.810
Hongjoo

774
00:54:51.893 --> 00:54:52.978
Hey, Cheon Muyoung

775
00:54:53.478 --> 00:54:54.730
Muyoung!

776
00:54:57.315 --> 00:54:58.358
Look at this

777
00:54:58.734 --> 00:55:00.110
All the salt turned black

778
00:55:04.448 --> 00:55:05.824
we thought wrong

779
00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:07.659
It's not just a ghost

780
00:55:09.411 --> 00:55:11.204
If you can catch Hongju, you're a monster.

781
00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:13.206
At least he lived much longer than us

782
00:55:13.874 --> 00:55:15.667
Until the first rooster crows today

783
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:17.252
Never move a single step in the room

784
00:55:24.259 --> 00:55:25.427
Ah, indeed

785
00:55:25.844 --> 00:55:27.220
Uh, uh, uh

786
00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:28.889
I found a witness

787
00:55:28.972 --> 00:55:31.141
- Cat?
- Oh, it's Gu Shinju's specialty.

788
00:55:33.351 --> 00:55:34.394
What do you say?

789
00:55:35.062 --> 00:55:36.855
They say he came in among the gisaengs who came during the day.

790
00:55:37.064 --> 00:55:38.065
wearing old straw sandals

791
00:55:38.565 --> 00:55:40.358
What kind of guy are you?

792
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.402
What kind of guy are you?

793
00:55:43.612 --> 00:55:44.738
uh?

794
00:55:46.198 --> 00:55:47.199
why?

795
00:55:47.699 --> 00:55:48.825
what? tell me

796
00:55:49.159 --> 00:55:50.160
Jang Sanbeom

797
00:55:52.412 --> 00:55:53.705
‘Jangsanbeom’

798
00:55:53.997 --> 00:55:55.999
For some reason, he imitated the voice like that.

799
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:57.918
It's quite a big deal, isn't it?

800
00:55:58.001 --> 00:55:59.461
Hongju doesn't have much time right now.

801
00:55:59.836 --> 00:56:01.171
We don't know anything about him

802
00:56:01.713 --> 00:56:03.090
Let's start by finding a way to catch him.

803
00:56:04.049 --> 00:56:05.133
Let's find out

804
00:56:07.135 --> 00:56:08.428
Jangsanbeom?

805
00:56:13.308 --> 00:56:14.684
Hey, Langa

806
00:56:15.268 --> 00:56:16.394
Let's borrow some of your kids, okay?

807
00:56:16.603 --> 00:56:17.604
You don’t like it?

808
00:56:18.063 --> 00:56:19.523
I'll buy you cold noodles, 10 bowls

809
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.317
Did you eat cold noodles?

810
00:56:23.443 --> 00:56:24.528
Hey, come on!

811
00:56:25.445 --> 00:56:26.613
What do you want?

812
00:56:26.696 --> 00:56:28.031
huh? Talk to me, okay?

813
00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:31.785
Then go get your friend's blood.

814
00:56:31.868 --> 00:56:32.953
Are you a mosquito?

815
00:56:33.036 --> 00:56:34.746
- Don't hate it.
- No, okay, okay.

816
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.123
Okay

817
00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:37.749
I'll talk to you carefully

818
00:56:44.714 --> 00:56:45.841
Boss!

819
00:56:56.393 --> 00:56:58.311
no

820
00:56:58.395 --> 00:57:00.188
I told you not to do that when you appeared, right?

821
00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:04.234
I will correct it!

822
00:57:04.317 --> 00:57:06.444
But, hey

823
00:57:06.528 --> 00:57:08.363
What did you call me for?

824
00:57:11.908 --> 00:57:12.951
you

825
00:57:15.871 --> 00:57:17.497
Are you going to back out of the deal?

826
00:57:17.581 --> 00:57:18.707
Jang Sanbeom

827
00:57:19.791 --> 00:57:21.918
The Western Mountain God Liu Hongzhu was taken away.

828
00:57:22.002 --> 00:57:23.044
What?

829
00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.421
What is that?

830
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.964
Didn’t you bring it on yourself?

831
00:57:27.674 --> 00:57:29.551
Hongju is not the only one, Hongju...

832
00:57:29.634 --> 00:57:31.803
The situation is really bad

833
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.556
God, huh?

834
00:57:34.764 --> 00:57:37.225
Deals with God are non-refundable.

835
00:57:39.144 --> 00:57:40.770
Even if it's a long way

836
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.191
Please tell me the way
Where should I go, please!

837
00:57:44.274 --> 00:57:45.817
The path of the wicked

838
00:57:46.067 --> 00:57:48.904
Even the world’s undressing faction
It's a place you can't pry into

839
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:52.616
Don't go!

840
00:57:54.784 --> 00:57:56.953
do nothing

841
00:57:58.496 --> 00:57:59.706
Why?

842
00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:00.957
yes?

843
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:05.545
In your eyes

844
00:58:05.754 --> 00:58:07.464
I see endless darkness

845
00:58:08.632 --> 00:58:11.718
There are people like you in that world
It's perfect to be eaten

846
00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:16.598
Even if I die, I will come back alive

847
00:58:17.974 --> 00:58:19.351
Save Hong Joo

848
00:58:23.563 --> 00:58:24.814
Like that

849
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.733
Well, you fool.

850
00:58:38.328 --> 00:58:42.123
Got bitten by Jang Sanbeom
She is the only woman who came back alive.

851
00:58:42.207 --> 00:58:44.376
Was the old lady captured by Jang San-beom?

852
00:58:45.835 --> 00:58:47.295
our sisters

853
00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:51.132
Just that, four people.

854
00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:52.676
It was the winter solstice day.

855
00:58:53.134 --> 00:58:55.762
The night was so long that I played in a corner.

856
00:58:55.845 --> 00:58:57.597
Yeah, well, the winter solstice is long, uh

857
00:58:57.681 --> 00:58:58.807
I accidentally

858
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:01.268
I said it...

859
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:02.686
So where were you taken?

860
00:59:03.436 --> 00:59:05.230
It was dark so I couldn't see much.

861
00:59:05.313 --> 00:59:06.815
AC, really

862
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.027
Besides me

863
00:59:11.444 --> 00:59:14.364
A lot of prostitutes were caught

864
00:59:15.156 --> 00:59:16.157
Sluts?

865
00:59:16.992 --> 00:59:18.034
Yeah

866
00:59:18.243 --> 00:59:20.704
They say they're all idiots

867
00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:25.959
uh, so like that
Are you only kidnapping women? uh?

868
00:59:26.042 --> 00:59:28.920
Ah, I'm looking for sex.
Why did you take the old lady away?

869
00:59:29.004 --> 00:59:30.338
When I was young

870
00:59:30.922 --> 00:59:34.509
She was the most beautiful woman in this village.

871
00:59:37.679 --> 00:59:39.889
Go out to the field and do this
If you are picking bean leaves

872
00:59:39.973 --> 00:59:43.893
Bachelors all over the neighborhood
Just give me acupuncture...

873
00:59:43.977 --> 00:59:45.353
Oh, stop, stop, stop

874
00:59:45.812 --> 00:59:46.896
Why is the condition like that?

875
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.982
A little, a little brainy
It comes and goes, yeah

876
00:59:49.065 --> 00:59:51.276
So, how did you come back alive?

877
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:53.820
I followed Ttoto

878
00:59:53.903 --> 00:59:55.488
Again? What is ttotto?

879
00:59:55.572 --> 00:59:56.865
Ah, so

880
00:59:56.948 --> 00:59:58.366
- Oh, that, over there...
- Uh

881
01:00:01.578 --> 01:00:02.704
child

882
01:00:02.954 --> 01:00:03.955
I don't remember

883
01:00:04.039 --> 01:00:06.249
Issi, oh, really, sir

884
01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:07.917
Have you seen Jang Sanbeom?

885
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:10.211
I, I saw, I saw

886
01:00:10.628 --> 01:00:11.629
What does it look like?

887
01:00:12.672 --> 01:00:13.673
Ah, there

888
01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:15.467
paper and brush

889
01:00:16.092 --> 01:00:17.177
paper and brush

890
01:00:30.106 --> 01:00:31.107
Oh, well

891
01:00:31.566 --> 01:00:32.567
Is this it?

892
01:00:35.487 --> 01:00:36.696
No, what, is this an ass?

893
01:00:40.367 --> 01:00:41.951
What is this, this, this?

894
01:00:42.202 --> 01:00:43.370
We again

895
01:00:43.912 --> 01:00:45.038
This again?

896
01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:49.167
Ah, the hoe
This is a cub that I brought to my house.

897
01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:51.669
Gya followed me a lot.

898
01:00:52.003 --> 01:00:53.129
Cat?

899
01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:58.551
uh

900
01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:01.262
Wow, it’s bitter, really.

901
01:01:01.471 --> 01:01:03.306
No, he was next to the warm furnace.

902
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.766
There was such a fuss about not coming out.

903
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:05.850
Why cats?

904
01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:08.103
Cats are spirits that can see ghosts.

905
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.563
He goes to the other side
It will open the way

906
01:01:11.648 --> 01:01:12.857
This is a weapon

907
01:01:13.483 --> 01:01:15.527
Grown by eating human blood and flesh
made of wood

908
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.362
Oh, hey, like Jangsanbeom

909
01:01:17.445 --> 01:01:18.905
There's nothing better than catching an old monster.

910
01:01:20.573 --> 01:01:22.700
Duduri? How did you get this?

911
01:01:24.452 --> 01:01:25.578
I also did some legwork.

912
01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.914
Okay, preparations are complete.

913
01:01:28.248 --> 01:01:30.250
Then now
All you have to do is wait for the sun to set

914
01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:33.378
Please take care of me

915
01:01:35.755 --> 01:01:37.590
Ah, when you go in
They said I might not be able to come out.

916
01:01:37.674 --> 01:01:38.675
Just send your friends

917
01:01:39.008 --> 01:01:40.260
I have to go

918
01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:41.845
Oh, why?

919
01:01:44.472 --> 01:01:46.558
Hongjoo would have done the same if it were me.

920
01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:48.518
Then, go with me instead of Cheon Mu-young.

921
01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:50.895
Others may not know, but you can’t do this.

922
01:01:51.271 --> 01:01:52.647
How can I let you go with that limb?

923
01:01:52.981 --> 01:01:53.982
Oh, do you believe that guy?

924
01:01:54.065 --> 01:01:56.484
Oh, sleep well and sleep.
It's been hundreds of years since we met

925
01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:01.030
Coincidentally

926
01:02:01.406 --> 01:02:03.450
Meeting the dead Muyoung again

927
01:02:03.783 --> 01:02:05.326
Jangsan Beom has appeared

928
01:02:06.703 --> 01:02:07.912
Even when playing in a corner

929
01:02:07.996 --> 01:02:10.290
Muyoung wanted to get rid of Hongju.

930
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:14.627
Are you saying that he brought Jang San-beom?

931
01:02:15.753 --> 01:02:16.880
well

932
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:19.257
Still, I want to believe him.

933
01:02:20.133 --> 01:02:21.426
Pathetic guy

934
01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:23.845
Oh, what if this is a trap?

935
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.305
at least

936
01:02:25.805 --> 01:02:28.433
Why did Muyoung come to see me?
You'll find out, right?

937
01:02:31.769 --> 01:02:33.938
You go and tell the old lady in the dressing room.

938
01:02:35.565 --> 01:02:36.691
Are you going to catch Jangsan Beom?

939
01:02:37.692 --> 01:02:39.486
It’s a place that even grandma’s clairvoyance can’t reach.

940
01:02:39.569 --> 01:02:40.570
You might worry about getting old

941
01:02:41.488 --> 01:02:43.114
Take care of yourself

942
01:02:43.198 --> 01:02:44.908
Please save Eunho too.

943
01:02:44.991 --> 01:02:46.451
Okay

944
01:02:46.659 --> 01:02:48.286
I am taking good care of Rang and the kids.

945
01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:05.094
It starts at 8 o'clock sharp

946
01:03:05.762 --> 01:03:06.971
uh

947
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.856
Hey, tie it up

948
01:03:18.608 --> 01:03:19.859
Are you on your way home?

949
01:03:21.277 --> 01:03:22.445
Just in case

950
01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:25.657
Thank you, for worrying about me too.

951
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.824
never die

952
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.245
You know? If you die in the other world
I can't even save my soul

953
01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:36.960
let's go

954
01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:49.639
I'll come back and buy you cold noodles.

955
01:04:53.328 --> 01:04:54.412
Hey

956
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.581
Hey

957
01:05:52.345 --> 01:05:53.346
Huh?

958
01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:54.472
Gwanghwamun?

959
01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:04.691
what?

960
01:06:04.982 --> 01:06:05.983
Joseon Dynasty?

961
01:06:06.567 --> 01:06:08.069
Anyway, let’s find Hongju first.

962
01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:11.239
Oh, really!

963
01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:16.577
Ah, where on earth did I find this?

964
01:06:23.418 --> 01:06:24.585
Hey, wait a minute

965
01:06:26.379 --> 01:06:28.589
- But isn't it a bit strange?
- what?

966
01:06:28.923 --> 01:06:31.509
No, let alone pretending to be popular.
There is no noise from life

967
01:06:33.594 --> 01:06:34.595
Hongjoo

968
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:37.640
Ryu Hong-joo!

969
01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:42.228
It doesn't work, let's spread out and search.

970
01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:05.710
Hey, Muyoung

971
01:07:06.169 --> 01:07:07.253
Muyoung Cheon

972
01:07:19.474 --> 01:07:20.975
- Are they all human?
- Uh

973
01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:23.269
How long do you think he's been dead?

974
01:07:28.524 --> 01:07:29.901
I think it's been three days at most.

975
01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:36.282
What is it?

976
01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:45.166
Who are you?

977
01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.919
answer me

978
01:07:51.047 --> 01:07:52.507
Who did this?

979
01:07:53.382 --> 01:07:55.927
Jang Sanbeom

980
01:07:58.596 --> 01:07:59.722
Do you know where he is?

981
01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:06.270
Where are you?

982
01:08:07.647 --> 01:08:09.690
Talk to me, we'll get you

983
01:08:15.071 --> 01:08:16.072
Do you want to get out of here?

984
01:08:17.907 --> 01:08:20.368
Can you take me there? To Jang Sanbeom

985
01:08:58.364 --> 01:08:59.407
What is it?

986
01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:00.700
Where did you go?

987
01:09:05.288 --> 01:09:06.581
Muyoungah

988
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:08.708
No, don't breathe!

989
01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:19.719
uh?

990
01:09:20.469 --> 01:09:22.305
uh? what's this?

991
01:09:22.597 --> 01:09:23.723
IC

992
01:09:23.806 --> 01:09:24.807
Hey, Muyoung

993
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:26.559
The line won't come loose

994
01:09:26.642 --> 01:09:27.852
Ah, Mr.

995
01:09:31.188 --> 01:09:33.107
Huh?

996
01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:41.908
Ah, no, no, no, no

997
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:43.659
Ah, uh, ah, uh...

998
01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:45.161
Ah, ladies

999
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.788
Let's say it in our own words, okay?

1000
01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:49.206
In words, please!

1001
01:10:02.803 --> 01:10:03.846
huh?

1002
01:10:05.264 --> 01:10:06.307
uh?

1003
01:10:07.308 --> 01:10:08.726
Hey, Muyoung

1004
01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:10.770
We're not dead, we're not dead

1005
01:10:11.145 --> 01:10:12.480
What is this?

1006
01:10:15.608 --> 01:10:17.234
This is fake blood, this

1007
01:10:18.069 --> 01:10:19.362
IC

1008
01:10:21.405 --> 01:10:23.115
Cut, okay!

1009
01:10:23.449 --> 01:10:25.409
Okay, let's move.

1010
01:10:25.493 --> 01:10:26.953
I'll go next in 10 minutes.

1011
01:10:34.794 --> 01:10:37.338
Hey, I have to change my outfit next.
Come quickly, quickly, quickly

1012
01:10:47.056 --> 01:10:48.349
What is this?

1013
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:27.054
But how is this possible?

1014
01:11:27.138 --> 01:11:28.264
uh?

1015
01:11:28.347 --> 01:11:29.932
In an old place called Jangsan

1016
01:11:30.016 --> 01:11:33.978
Very good at imitating others
There lived a tiger with a talent

1017
01:11:34.061 --> 01:11:35.688
This is the world you created

1018
01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:38.107
Then these are all my memories
Are you saying it was a stolen stage?

1019
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:39.316
Why is it spinning?

1020
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.693
I am Kim Doo-han.

1021
01:11:40.985 --> 01:11:42.528
Oh, I'm really crazy...

1022
01:11:42.611 --> 01:11:43.612
1 hour to go

1023
01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:45.156
You have to find Hongju inside.

1024
01:11:46.032 --> 01:11:48.284
this girl
Get it if you can

1025
01:11:49.326 --> 01:11:50.578
I'll kill you

1026
01:11:51.287 --> 01:11:53.330
- I...
- I'm telling you to cut off the silk thread.

1027
01:11:53.414 --> 01:11:55.499
Why can't I let this go?

1028
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:57.835
His purpose is

1029
01:11:57.918 --> 01:11:59.920
Like this between us
It was about making them fight.
