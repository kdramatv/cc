﻿1
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.170
Gwanghwamun?

2
00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:15.138
what?

3
00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:16.973
Joseon Dynasty?

4
00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:18.725
Anyway, let’s find Hongju first.

5
00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:21.770
Oh, really

6
00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:28.944
What is it?

7
00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:35.033
Muyoungah

8
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:36.535
No way

9
00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:37.828
don't breathe

10
00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:51.550
Uh, what is this? Hey, Mr. Lee

11
00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:53.093
Hey, Muyoung

12
00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.845
The line won't come loose

13
00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:55.929
Ah, Mr.

14
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.601
Hey, there, there, there
no, no, no

15
00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.646
No, ladies, let's say it in our own words.

16
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.898
Huh? With words! a little!

17
00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:25.667
Hey, Muyoung

18
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.544
We're not dead, we're not dead

19
00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:29.254
What is this? uh

20
00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:33.925
This is fake blood, this

21
00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:40.599
My expensive knife has become dull
It's too precious to throw away

22
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.601
yes

23
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.772
With this all-purpose knife sharpener

24
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:49.816
Just push and pull a few times

25
00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:52.652
Wow, you can make it look like a new knife.

26
00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:58.158
Cut, okay!

27
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:08.126
Hey there, next outfit.
I need to change, come quickly, quickly, quickly

28
00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:13.214
Okay, let's move.
The next scene will begin in 10 minutes.

29
00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:14.299
Give it to me

30
00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:18.053
‘Jang Sanbeom’s Bride’?

31
00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:20.639
It's a drama filming location.

32
00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.391
It's not even the Joseon Dynasty

33
00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:25.393
Is this the world that Jang Sanbeom created?

34
00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.896
First of all, in this crappy setting
Let's get out of there quickly

35
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.989
I don't know, is this a drama or a commercial?

36
00:03:38.073 --> 00:03:41.034
The script is shit, but they even say it's a page script.
IC

37
00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:42.911
A bowl of blood
Do you think you need more?

38
00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.412
Bring starch syrup and coloring

39
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.540
Look at the details

40
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.376
It really looks like a drama filming set.

41
00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:51.670
But how is this possible?

42
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.839
Even if it's a flying or crawling monster
You won't be able to travel through time

43
00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:57.258
Where on earth is Hong-joo?

44
00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:58.426
No way, Mr.

45
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.387
Hey, who is the heroine? Are you late again?

46
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.597
Yes, it's arrived now
yes, yes

47
00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:05.850
Oh, what if you are a top star?
Really, Mr. Lee, tsk.

48
00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:08.728
Ah, where should I go to find this again?

49
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.730
Hey, let's go over there.

50
00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:15.777
Hey, are you here?

51
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.531
uh?

52
00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:27.580
Hongjoo

53
00:04:28.748 --> 00:04:30.083
I'm really glad you're safe.

54
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:31.835
What is it?

55
00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:34.045
who?

56
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.505
Ah, man over here, over there.

57
00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:37.215
Number 4, number 5, yes

58
00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:41.428
Since when does a supporting role become a supporting role?

59
00:04:41.678 --> 00:04:42.762
You talked to me, right?

60
00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:44.639
- to?
- Oh, sorry, ah.

61
00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:46.266
Sorry, I'm a newbie.

62
00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.350
Oh, sorry.

63
00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.227
- Put it away.
- No, Hongju, that's not it.

64
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:50.645
- Hey
- I'll be out for a moment.

65
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.564
Oh, sorry, ah.

66
00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:55.608
It’s Hongju, right?

67
00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:57.277
Why don't you recognize us?

68
00:04:57.944 --> 00:04:59.362
Are you possessed by Jang San-beom?

69
00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.532
I can't do it.
Let's drag it out by force

70
00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:07.662
No, but Hongju is the main character.
Why am I a supporting character of a supporting character

71
00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:09.748
Why are you number 4 and I am number 5? uh?

72
00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:12.917
- Does it matter now?
- Then it’s not important? Oh my, Mr.

73
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:14.169
Jang Sanbeom, this bastard, really

74
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.173
Ready, action!

75
00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:23.344
uh?

76
00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:25.680
- Where and what is this again?
- Why are we here?

77
00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:27.474
Hey, you clothes

78
00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:28.933
Huh? Goddess

79
00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.269
Oh, what is this again, what is this? Mr.

80
00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:34.064
Who is there?

81
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.941
uh?

82
00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:38.526
Hongjoo

83
00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:43.948
- Ah...
-Hong Joo-ya

84
00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:45.950
- It's me, Muyoung.
- Muyoung

85
00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:47.744
- Muyoung?
- Your friend Cheon Mu-young

86
00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:49.746
Why can't you remember?

87
00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:51.164
me

88
00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:54.501
After falling into the lake
I got amnesia

89
00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:56.628
Wow, it's so varied, man.

90
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.505
Let’s get this shit over with and go quickly.

91
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.590
I won't go, I can't go

92
00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:02.092
Why can't I go?

93
00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:05.011
Because he is my only groom

94
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:08.848
Come to your senses, you bastard.

95
00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:10.517
You are now possessed by Jang San-beom.
Go quickly

96
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.227
Cut! NG!

97
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.853
- Oh, really.
- hey!

98
00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:15.188
What is that again?

99
00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:16.898
Which company are you from, huh?

100
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:19.150
How dare you
Are you hitting on an actress?

101
00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:21.444
Oh, what did you bring?

102
00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:23.196
- Yes, yes, sorry, yes.
- Oh, I'm so annoyed, really.

103
00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.572
Sorry, yeah
Let's go again, again

104
00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:26.282
Whose will it be?

105
00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:28.952
I won't go, I can't go

106
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.996
Because he is my only groom

107
00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:33.373
Is this the scene from earlier?

108
00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.457
I came back

109
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.877
- I heard you don’t do things like this!
- Cut! NG!

110
00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:40.088
I'm not going

111
00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:41.422
I can't go

112
00:06:41.506 --> 00:06:42.674
IC

113
00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:44.342
Cut! NG!

114
00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.345
I won't go, I can't go

115
00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:51.724
Because he is my only groom

116
00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:54.060
Boy, really, I'm going crazy.
Why are you still in the same place?

117
00:06:55.103 --> 00:06:56.104
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

118
00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:57.480
- I have a line.
- Huh?

119
00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.190
Because he is my only groom

120
00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:00.608
yes

121
00:07:00.817 --> 00:07:03.361
Jangsanbeom is stronger than us
It's true that it's beautiful

122
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.365
But we're here to save you

123
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:09.617
Why is the line like this? Really, Mr.

124
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.286
just read

125
00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:15.081
Muyoung, me
For Hongjoo’s happiness

126
00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:16.624
Shouldn't we leave?

127
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.712
Open the parenthesis and look at Hongju with a tearful face.
Close the brackets, Hongjoo, your seat is here.

128
00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.005
That's not it

129
00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:25.300
You may have been my friends

130
00:07:26.718 --> 00:07:27.719
you are fake

131
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:29.971
you are a villain

132
00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:34.350
I'm fake?

133
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.187
There were two Lee Yeon.

134
00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:40.565
The real one is an opium dealer in Manchuria

135
00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:41.983
There are two Lee Yeon?

136
00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:45.195
The real one is an opium dealer in Manchuria

137
00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:54.495
What is it? Is this line in the script?

138
00:07:55.622 --> 00:07:58.333
This guy, this is bigger than I thought
I think you know a lot about us.

139
00:07:58.416 --> 00:07:59.667
I have a bad feeling, let’s drag it out.

140
00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:08.176
The pain of letting them go

141
00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:10.762
I guess I should soothe myself with this makgeolli.

142
00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:18.561
Fermented using a long-term low-temperature aging method
The yeast is alive and

143
00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:20.688
No burps or hangovers?

144
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:24.984
Cut! okay!

145
00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:30.281
- Thank you for your effort
- Oh, it's so heavy it's killing me, really, ah, loosen it.

146
00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:35.161
- Don’t you guys hurry up?
- Oh, I'm hungry.

147
00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:37.080
- Oh, get out of the way, get out of the way quickly.
- What should I do?

148
00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:38.581
Hongju looks like that

149
00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:40.583
in our own strength
I can't get out of here

150
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.377
He's a lot stronger than I thought

151
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.338
Hey, it's just this damn filming set.
Let's burn it all down

152
00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:47.173
- Is it okay?
- Oh, it's okay.

153
00:08:47.257 --> 00:08:48.258
It's all like a mirage anyway

154
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.592
Scream

155
00:08:58.476 --> 00:08:59.477
Oh, what are you doing?

156
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.229
- I can't start a fire, you try.
- What?

157
00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:02.522
IC

158
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.610
Oh shit, what is this?

159
00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:09.279
Lightning and thunder and nothing happens?

160
00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:10.822
I guess the talents of the outside world don't apply.

161
00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:16.286
Oh, wait a minute.

162
00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.997
The title of this is ‘Jang San-beom’s Bride’.

163
00:09:19.622 --> 00:09:21.749
Then the bride is Hongju.

164
00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.252
Are you saying Jang Sanbeom is also in here?

165
00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:27.588
Let's catch him first.

166
00:09:32.385 --> 00:09:33.720
Yeon and Muyoung?

167
00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:36.222
No, I know where it is
Jump in fearlessly?

168
00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:39.392
-Where is it?
- Look

169
00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:41.728
This is this world and this is the afterlife

170
00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:44.022
The middle is the path of those who are deceived.

171
00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:46.149
At first glance
It may seem real, but

172
00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:48.860
thousands of years old
It is the home of monsters and a playground.

173
00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:51.738
Even gods like us
A place where you don't step in carelessly

174
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:53.406
Besides, it's Jangsanbeom.

175
00:09:53.906 --> 00:09:55.241
like that

176
00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:56.951
What exactly is he?

177
00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:59.412
imitator

178
00:10:08.296 --> 00:10:10.214
In an old place called Jangsan

179
00:10:10.631 --> 00:10:12.842
To imitate others
very talented

180
00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.260
There lived a tiger

181
00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:18.806
At first, I imitated the sounds of animals.
Next, people, finally

182
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.225
I started imitating the gods

183
00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:23.853
If it's God...

184
00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:25.688
I coveted the position of the mountain god.

185
00:10:26.773 --> 00:10:28.566
Jang Sanbeom
You wanted to become a mountain god?

186
00:10:28.858 --> 00:10:30.568
It's not just about imitating voices.

187
00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:33.696
The other person sees and hears
everything that is said

188
00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:36.282
Even memories can be imitated.

189
00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:39.535
Yeon, how are you going to come back?

190
00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:42.246
To Lee Yeon
I hung silk thread.

191
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.499
- Lee Rang is holding the thread.
- Did you clear the way?

192
00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:46.876
- These crazy guys.
- Why, why?

193
00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:50.004
They'll try to come over from that world.

194
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.215
This area is dangerous

195
00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:53.883
Yes?

196
00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:13.111
Hello, hello

197
00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:14.904
Old Shenju?

198
00:11:14.987 --> 00:11:16.572
Sir, he will come.

199
00:11:17.073 --> 00:11:18.157
What are you talking about?

200
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.201
I don't have time
From now on, listen to me carefully.

201
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.745
Put Lee Rang’s blood on the thread.

202
00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:24.205
Come on

203
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.973
Uh, I'm done.

204
00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:45.560
Well, now you're ready.

205
00:11:47.478 --> 00:11:48.479
Ready for what?

206
00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:50.815
That way
Ready to go

207
00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:54.944
It's not the old god

208
00:12:12.587 --> 00:12:13.588
Don't you accept it?

209
00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:15.131
Are you still on the phone?
I need to go

210
00:12:15.673 --> 00:12:17.884
Go to Irang and tell him clearly.

211
00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:21.846
By the way, you shouldn't get blood on the silk thread.
That's like inviting them over

212
00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:22.930
yes

213
00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:24.098
If you miss the silk thread

214
00:12:24.682 --> 00:12:25.850
The way back disappears

215
00:12:25.933 --> 00:12:28.019
I won't let you go, ever.

216
00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:34.692
Jangsanbeom?

217
00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:37.445
Was it a coincidence that the kids met him?

218
00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.614
It must have been Muyoung’s doing.

219
00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:42.533
To fix my body
Because you will need Jang Sanbeom

220
00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:47.705
About this mountain god
I don't even know what kind of resentment I'm harboring

221
00:12:47.997 --> 00:12:49.749
Honey, what about the kids?

222
00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:54.086
Yeon and Mu-young themselves
I have no choice but to realize

223
00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:56.881
Hongju in that world
To bring him back

224
00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.217
in the end

225
00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:02.637
That we have to save each other

226
00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:06.766
- I'll take it, yeah.
- Yes

227
00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:08.601
Ah, just a moment, a moment, a moment, a moment, write

228
00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:11.938
Well, who wrote this script?

229
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:13.940
The director wrote it himself.

230
00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:16.317
Ah, director

231
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:27.328
- Wow, our director.
- Yes

232
00:13:29.664 --> 00:13:30.748
Are you a Jangsanbeom?

233
00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:32.416
What are you talking about, man?

234
00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:35.294
If you don't know what I'm talking about

235
00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:37.255
Let's get it right first

236
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:39.882
What's wrong, man?

237
00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:47.056
Make sure to touch me

238
00:13:49.976 --> 00:13:52.061
Who wants you to write this script like this, huh?

239
00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:53.604
me, teacher

240
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.898
I just did what I was told.

241
00:13:55.982 --> 00:13:57.149
Who ordered it?

242
00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:59.235
Uh, well, I mean

243
00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:00.903
Who was it?

244
00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:04.282
Who is Jang Sanbeom?

245
00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:05.616
Jangsanbeom?

246
00:14:07.618 --> 00:14:10.496
uh? Hey, hey, hey

247
00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.971
Lang, are you there?

248
00:14:32.476 --> 00:14:33.477
divorce?

249
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.197
divorce?

250
00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.326
no

251
00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:49.744
Aren’t you Lee Yeon?

252
00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:50.953
That's me

253
00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:53.998
pull it, quickly

254
00:14:54.582 --> 00:14:55.666
Muyoung got hit

255
00:14:56.334 --> 00:14:57.752
What is the proof that you are Lee Yeon?

256
00:14:58.044 --> 00:14:59.503
I decided to buy you cold noodles

257
00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:01.505
No time, hurry up

258
00:15:39.877 --> 00:15:40.961
Where are you!

259
00:16:06.654 --> 00:16:08.572
If you play with food, good luck will run away.

260
00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:10.199
We'll eat it ourselves.

261
00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:15.079
Oh my, these days things are
There's nothing I can't say in front of a widow.

262
00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:22.545
What kind of person were you?
Sir, sir, sir,

263
00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:25.506
Better than rainbow rice cake on a lucky day

264
00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:28.050
They say a man’s heart is something that changes easily.

265
00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:31.846
He was a very consistent person to me.

266
00:16:32.221 --> 00:16:33.889
But how...

267
00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:38.018
I was pranked by a monster

268
00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:42.189
That person was so for me

269
00:16:43.566 --> 00:16:46.235
I couldn't protect him

270
00:16:49.655 --> 00:16:50.656
Yeohee

271
00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:53.117
you don't lose

272
00:16:55.035 --> 00:16:56.036
yes

273
00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:07.381
Uh, even if you look at it from the field

274
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.717
It's not a setting, is it?

275
00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:26.692
Is it you?

276
00:17:28.778 --> 00:17:30.362
- yes?
- Jang Sanbeom

277
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:32.782
I don't know what it is, but it's not me

278
00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.117
Originally, this genre was like this.

279
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:37.036
The first guy I met was the criminal.

280
00:17:37.369 --> 00:17:38.996
Plus, that fried rice you're eating

281
00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:42.500
That's when playing in the corner
Hongjoo was holding it.

282
00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:49.173
I just shared it with my sister over there...

283
00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:50.716
lie

284
00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:52.551
No

285
00:17:54.261 --> 00:17:56.013
Because it's not a lie

286
00:17:58.432 --> 00:17:59.433
Hongju?

287
00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:07.566
What are you?

288
00:18:11.487 --> 00:18:13.781
Since ancient times, I have been called an imitator.

289
00:18:14.949 --> 00:18:16.158
It can be anything

290
00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.334
How dare this bastard...

291
00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:33.592
Let's play more

292
00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:36.220
This is the world you created

293
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:52.444
- That...
- I stole some of your memories.

294
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.446
He died once during the Joseon Dynasty

295
00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.908
When I open my eyes, I see an unfamiliar future
No friends, no family, no one by your side

296
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.914
Was it television?

297
00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:07.418
You see the people in it
I started imitating

298
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.296
Crying and laughing falsely

299
00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:11.505
Shut up

300
00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:12.840
you are just like me

301
00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.092
- The same monster
- No!

302
00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:17.803
no

303
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:21.348
- I'm with a guy like you...
- You called me.

304
00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:24.810
This woman

305
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:30.524
I'm going to die because of you

306
00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:31.692
No way

307
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.987
Now there's no one left by your side, right?

308
00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:37.656
You'll be wandering in the dark forever, you

309
00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:40.659
Just like when I turned into a stone

310
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:50.294
Don't bother my friend with that face

311
00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:55.966
What are you doing?

312
00:20:00.846 --> 00:20:01.847
What is it?

313
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.432
Duduri doesn’t work?

314
00:20:09.063 --> 00:20:10.898
you talk about your friends
You know very little?

315
00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:13.859
Don't be rude

316
00:20:14.443 --> 00:20:17.529
I can't even show my face
I dare you to imitate others...

317
00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:23.869
You're still arrogant, Lee Yeon.

318
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.371
baekdudaegan mountain god

319
00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:29.249
I once wanted to be you

320
00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:32.169
I'm dead and I can't wake up

321
00:20:32.503 --> 00:20:34.630
you're just a clown

322
00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:36.799
Muyoungah

323
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.685
I'll give you just one hour from now

324
00:20:47.935 --> 00:20:49.645
this girl

325
00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:51.605
Get it if you can

326
00:20:54.483 --> 00:20:55.985
It's not you guys here

327
00:20:57.945 --> 00:20:59.154
i am god

328
00:21:06.537 --> 00:21:07.538
What is it?

329
00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.207
The background has changed, it’s Gyeongseong.

330
00:21:15.295 --> 00:21:16.296
another hour

331
00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:18.882
You have to find Hongju inside.

332
00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:21.719
How did you find him, man?

333
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.846
The fried rice that Hong-ju was eating

334
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.641
Did you say anything else?

335
00:21:29.476 --> 00:21:30.936
This guy is stealing our memories.

336
00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:35.899
Then this is it
Are you saying this is a stage created by stealing my memories?

337
00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:38.527
Because you and Hongju are in a future we've never seen before.

338
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:40.696
But Muyoung

339
00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:45.826
why my head
Wouldn’t it have worked on Jang San-beom?

340
00:21:50.456 --> 00:21:51.457
well

341
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.835
Is it because it's not the main body?

342
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.137
Are you a gang of mountain gods?

343
00:22:08.932 --> 00:22:09.933
uh

344
00:22:10.434 --> 00:22:11.977
That's right, but what are you guys?

345
00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:15.147
Who are you?

346
00:22:24.073 --> 00:22:25.074
Huh?

347
00:22:25.449 --> 00:22:26.533
I am Kim Doo-han.

348
00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:30.829
Kim Doo-han from Jongno

349
00:22:30.913 --> 00:22:31.914
No, Mr. Ahn Jae-mo.

350
00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:34.333
No way

351
00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:37.127
Oh, I'm so excited, Mr.

352
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.421
Hit it

353
00:22:39.797 --> 00:22:41.090
Suddenly?

354
00:22:45.677 --> 00:22:46.762
Done? uh?

355
00:22:47.638 --> 00:22:48.764
Why is it spinning?

356
00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:51.850
Why is it spinning?

357
00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:06.300
Both of them have terrible skills.

358
00:24:06.383 --> 00:24:07.968
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

359
00:24:09.887 --> 00:24:13.015
This fight
It's like I won

360
00:24:14.558 --> 00:24:17.644
I've already seen your moves
I was reading it thoroughly

361
00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:20.480
Come on

362
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.762
Ah, Mr. Why are you so good at fighting?

363
00:25:12.324 --> 00:25:13.742
Done again? It keeps going?

364
00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:29.716
I got hit for doing that
Are your teeth okay?

365
00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:34.179
Stop worrying about your teeth

366
00:25:34.263 --> 00:25:37.099
Because I have hard dental insurance.

367
00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:42.354
Of course, prosthetic treatment
Implants, bridges, dentures

368
00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:45.816
Dental treatment costs a lot of money
hard tooth insurance

369
00:25:57.953 --> 00:25:59.579
Where are you? Come out!

370
00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:14.261
boss

371
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.805
Please save me

372
00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:17.889
Who is it?

373
00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:20.767
Are you a vice-minister?

374
00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:22.894
yes

375
00:26:23.312 --> 00:26:24.313
It's me

376
00:26:32.154 --> 00:26:35.866
Please cut this thread.

377
00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:38.493
Tangled around my neck

378
00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:41.038
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

379
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:42.122
You're funny

380
00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:43.623
The height doesn't match

381
00:26:43.707 --> 00:26:45.292
please do this

382
00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:46.960
Stop it!

383
00:26:47.044 --> 00:26:48.128
Hey, you bastard!

384
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:50.839
- Rang, put down the skein of thread.
- Shut up!

385
00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:53.091
Let it go so you can live

386
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.844
Lee Yeon
I'm using it.

387
00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.346
Come to your senses, you're being exploited to your heart's content.

388
00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:58.555
I'll be left miserable again

389
00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:00.474
I'm telling you to cut off the silk thread.

390
00:27:00.557 --> 00:27:01.808
Oh, get out!

391
00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:19.326
I

392
00:27:20.702 --> 00:27:22.496
Why can't I let this go?

393
00:27:23.914 --> 00:27:24.998
Are you that?

394
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.834
My father was with a man
The thing that gave birth?

395
00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:30.837
Are you a fox too?

396
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:33.548
Whether you live as a human or a fox
It's your heart

397
00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:36.009
Remember this one thing, kid.

398
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:39.679
To the guy who doesn't save himself
There is no such thing as salvation

399
00:27:58.824 --> 00:28:00.617
Let's go together

400
00:28:02.327 --> 00:28:04.996
Let's go together, bro.

401
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.123
someday

402
00:28:08.917 --> 00:28:10.585
abandoned by human mother

403
00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:13.380
The hand that held my hand

404
00:28:15.882 --> 00:28:17.134
Because it’s annoyingly warm

405
00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:19.886
I like this

406
00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:22.764
Connected to Lee Yeon

407
00:28:24.474 --> 00:28:26.184
It felt like the last link.

408
00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:28.728
Don't miss it

409
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.940
No matter how wild you guys are

410
00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:33.692
never

411
00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:35.944
Never miss it!

412
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:44.953
The background changed again

413
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.457
Oh, it's a quiz show.

414
00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:51.877
He's switching TV channels

415
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.961
I'm playing a game

416
00:28:53.628 --> 00:28:55.380
Well, the rules are simple

417
00:28:56.631 --> 00:28:57.924
Win or lose

418
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.219
we have to do what we have to do
Moving on to the next step

419
00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:02.929
Are you going to play with that guy again?

420
00:29:04.055 --> 00:29:06.766
We just need to save Hong Joo
Well, is there another way?

421
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:09.102
Let's try it

422
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.981
Okay, who is it this time?

423
00:29:14.983 --> 00:29:16.985
Nice to meet you

424
00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.487
hello

425
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.863
hello

426
00:29:20.614 --> 00:29:21.615
hello

427
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.909
Nice to meet you, hello.

428
00:29:30.332 --> 00:29:31.333
Brother?

429
00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:33.043
You came to take the quiz, right?

430
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.212
Muyoung, I’m not your brother.

431
00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:38.381
kid, crazy

432
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.969
I'll kill you

433
00:29:43.261 --> 00:29:44.304
Oh my

434
00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:46.932
Oh, are you going to give up on the quiz?

435
00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:51.436
Even at this moment, my girlfriend
I must be dying

436
00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:53.438
Cheon Muyoung, no.

437
00:29:54.064 --> 00:29:55.106
Don't fall for that guy's provocation.

438
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.274
dare

439
00:29:57.984 --> 00:29:59.361
How dare you!

440
00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:00.737
Let's sit down

441
00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:02.822
Huh? I don't have time

442
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.665
Today's quiz show

443
00:30:11.748 --> 00:30:13.625
This is a special friend special.

444
00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:15.752
I'll ask you a question before the quiz.

445
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.337
The two of you

446
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.798
best friend
We were friends, right? But

447
00:30:19.881 --> 00:30:21.383
Why did you kill your friend's brother?

448
00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:32.519
Ah, this is too much

449
00:30:32.894 --> 00:30:34.396
Is this a sensitive question?

450
00:30:41.903 --> 00:30:43.113
no matter what happens

451
00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:46.032
Because we swore to protect each other

452
00:30:47.284 --> 00:30:50.954
That's what could protect Cheon Muyoung that day.
It was the only way

453
00:30:51.037 --> 00:30:52.914
Oh my

454
00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:54.291
Do you agree?

455
00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:34.539
brother

456
00:31:55.268 --> 00:31:56.519
something is wrong

457
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.271
This is not it

458
00:31:59.564 --> 00:32:00.690
don't kill me please

459
00:32:01.066 --> 00:32:02.192
No!

460
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:20.001
No, no, no

461
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.771
Do you agree with your friend?

462
00:32:43.483 --> 00:32:44.693
I can't agree

463
00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:47.404
Oh my, why?

464
00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:49.239
Your brother tried to kill you?

465
00:32:51.658 --> 00:32:52.659
You guys

466
00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:57.122
About my brother
Are you talking nonsense about what you know?

467
00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:58.832
- Stop it.
- It's because of you!

468
00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:02.669
I definitely asked for a chance, right?

469
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.672
My brother must have a reason for that.

470
00:33:07.132 --> 00:33:08.216
you didn't believe me

471
00:33:13.638 --> 00:33:14.639
Ah

472
00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:21.980
It was this

473
00:33:22.689 --> 00:33:23.857
What Jang Sanbeom wanted from us

474
00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:25.567
What?

475
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.360
This ridiculous TV show

476
00:33:27.444 --> 00:33:28.570
His purpose is

477
00:33:29.529 --> 00:33:32.073
It was to make us fight like this.

478
00:33:32.782 --> 00:33:34.576
Muyoung, that guy

479
00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:36.202
I'm afraid of the mountain god

480
00:33:36.494 --> 00:33:37.912
Oh my, can’t that be true?

481
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.876
you are out

482
00:33:47.172 --> 00:33:49.340
Hey, are you looking at me?

483
00:33:50.258 --> 00:33:51.718
We are your complex

484
00:33:52.427 --> 00:33:54.721
You are a mountain god who could not die

485
00:33:55.263 --> 00:33:56.848
The reaper came to cut off your head

486
00:33:58.266 --> 00:33:59.601
Prepare your will

487
00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:22.332
kill it

488
00:34:22.832 --> 00:34:25.001
Boss!
Child, please cut the silk thread for me!

489
00:34:25.084 --> 00:34:26.294
The one who dies is Lee Rang.

490
00:34:26.377 --> 00:34:28.546
- Yes? boss!
- What should I do? I can’t eat cold noodles.

491
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.341
Shut up, everyone, shut up!

492
00:34:36.095 --> 00:34:37.138
Are you inside?

493
00:34:37.388 --> 00:34:38.389
I'm Yeohee

494
00:34:42.185 --> 00:34:43.186
Don't be funny

495
00:34:43.728 --> 00:34:45.063
Do you think I will be fooled again?

496
00:34:45.355 --> 00:34:48.608
uh?
I made some yacham to give to you.

497
00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:50.568
You're such a bastard! Get the hell out of here!

498
00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:00.662
Come in, I'm waiting

499
00:35:01.287 --> 00:35:03.373
Don't come, that's not me!

500
00:35:04.082 --> 00:35:05.250
I told you to come in

501
00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:08.461
don't come
If you come in, I'll kill you.

502
00:35:10.588 --> 00:35:11.798
Going in?

503
00:35:14.801 --> 00:35:18.137
Because I don't need anyone like you
Go, please!

504
00:35:42.787 --> 00:35:43.788
are you okay?

505
00:36:02.765 --> 00:36:04.017
I told you not to come in

506
00:36:05.435 --> 00:36:06.519
You promised

507
00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:09.898
You say I will protect you

508
00:36:12.734 --> 00:36:13.735
Uselessly

509
00:36:14.694 --> 00:36:16.112
I'm in debt again

510
00:36:20.408 --> 00:36:22.160
Pay me back all at once this time

511
00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:26.122
How?

512
00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:53.668
You know,

513
00:37:54.544 --> 00:37:57.797
Until now I
Jang Sanbeom looked into my head

514
00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.507
I thought you made this TV show?

515
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:00.800
however?

516
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.677
Because my taste is romantic comedy

517
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.388
That famous
Haven’t you seen ‘The Wild Man’?

518
00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:06.848
What do you want to say?

519
00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:10.560
me

520
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.395
Can I trust you?

521
00:38:15.273 --> 00:38:16.357
If you don’t believe me, cut me

522
00:38:19.485 --> 00:38:21.738
- Are you going to die here?
- instead

523
00:38:21.821 --> 00:38:23.197
Even if I die, I will save Hong Joo

524
00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:26.159
Something like my life
It doesn't matter at all

525
00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:34.167
What did you want to check?

526
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:37.086
Is this the Cheon Muyoung I know?

527
00:38:39.255 --> 00:38:40.256
The answer is

528
00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:42.800
Did you find it?

529
00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:44.844
Yeah

530
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.306
You risked your life to save Hongju.

531
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.059
He's still the Cheon Muyoung I know.

532
00:38:51.142 --> 00:38:52.727
no matter what you think of me

533
00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:56.939
I have no intention of giving up on you and Hongju.

534
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.361
To you

535
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.532
I really wanted to hear that
There was a moment

536
00:39:24.842 --> 00:39:26.094
It's a puff, here too

537
00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.848
This is too blatant
Isn’t it ‘Hansel and Gretel’?

538
00:39:30.932 --> 00:39:32.058
What if Hong Joo left it behind?

539
00:39:33.768 --> 00:39:35.061
Okay, let's go.

540
00:39:35.895 --> 00:39:37.688
Now that the witch has appeared...

541
00:40:14.475 --> 00:40:15.893
After the wedding is over

542
00:40:17.103 --> 00:40:18.479
you forever

543
00:40:18.813 --> 00:40:20.523
will be my bride

544
00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.981
the bride and groom
meaning oneness

545
00:41:02.315 --> 00:41:04.650
I will offer a joint ceremony.

546
00:41:28.758 --> 00:41:29.759
Drink it

547
00:41:30.885 --> 00:41:31.886
If you drink this

548
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:34.764
forever in the memories you want

549
00:41:36.224 --> 00:41:37.391
I can buy it

550
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.181
Hongjoo

551
00:42:19.392 --> 00:42:21.143
Hongju, you're safe.

552
00:42:21.227 --> 00:42:23.312
-Are you hurt anywhere?
- Hey, no, don't go!

553
00:42:28.693 --> 00:42:30.194
Come to your senses, Ryu Hong-joo

554
00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:32.613
My eyes are out of focus

555
00:42:35.283 --> 00:42:37.159
I already got married

556
00:42:42.123 --> 00:42:43.124
Was it you?

557
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.043
she is now
Those who belong to this world

558
00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:49.130
I am Jang Sanbeom's bride.

559
00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:50.631
Don't be funny!

560
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.601
Because you want to kill me

561
00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:05.271
You'll have to cut this woman down first.

562
00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:06.355
Or

563
00:43:07.273 --> 00:43:10.026
Either wander around in this evil world forever

564
00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:11.444
i'm going home

565
00:43:11.986 --> 00:43:13.696
I decided to eat cold noodles with my younger brother.

566
00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:17.366
Muyoungah

567
00:43:17.742 --> 00:43:18.743
pull out the sword

568
00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:21.454
We have to catch Hongju like that guy said.

569
00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:23.039
Catch Jangsanbeom

570
00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:29.420
i can't do it

571
00:43:31.964 --> 00:43:32.965
we have to do it

572
00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:34.342
Only we can do it

573
00:43:34.967 --> 00:43:36.093
Let’s take Hongju out.

574
00:44:25.017 --> 00:44:26.018
I promise

575
00:44:26.477 --> 00:44:27.561
I am Lee Yeon

576
00:44:27.645 --> 00:44:30.314
No matter what happens with this sword
I will protect you guys

577
00:44:30.398 --> 00:44:31.482
Just trust me

578
00:44:31.565 --> 00:44:34.693
fool
We protect each other

579
00:44:35.277 --> 00:44:38.572
I, Hongju, for Yeon and Muyoung.

580
00:44:39.198 --> 00:44:40.199
hundreds on this knife

581
00:44:40.282 --> 00:44:42.201
수천의 피라도 묻히겠습니다

582
00:44:42.535 --> 00:44:43.536
um

583
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.329
i have nothing

584
00:44:45.788 --> 00:44:49.166
no one cuts
I wish I could protect you

585
00:45:27.455 --> 00:45:28.456
let's swear

586
00:45:28.914 --> 00:45:31.792
no matter what happens to us
Let's protect each other

587
00:45:53.939 --> 00:45:56.650
- It's okay.
- Hey, don’t bother Muyoung.

588
00:45:58.861 --> 00:45:59.862
I can't do it.

589
00:46:01.322 --> 00:46:03.115
Even if I die, I can't cut you down

590
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.213
I came back because of you

591
00:46:18.964 --> 00:46:20.716
I'm alive because of you

592
00:46:21.759 --> 00:46:22.927
Hongjoo

593
00:46:33.687 --> 00:46:34.688
die

594
00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:40.945
Stop it, Hongjoo.

595
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:43.781
stop please

596
00:46:47.993 --> 00:46:49.078
Stop it

597
00:46:50.913 --> 00:46:52.373
come with us

598
00:47:32.955 --> 00:47:36.333
Wow, how ugly it is

599
00:47:36.834 --> 00:47:37.835
no

600
00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.962
Do you still think something like that would work?

601
00:47:43.132 --> 00:47:44.258
Take my breath away

602
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.266
Am I going to die?

603
00:47:54.018 --> 00:47:55.019
Just in this place

604
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.397
And in the hands of an irreplaceable friend?

605
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.149
I'm not scared at all

606
00:48:01.233 --> 00:48:02.234
dying by your hands

607
00:48:05.362 --> 00:48:06.405
Even if I die

608
00:48:07.948 --> 00:48:09.491
You must live, Hongju.

609
00:48:11.243 --> 00:48:12.828
Be sure to come back alive

610
00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:15.289
to where you need to be

611
00:48:30.804 --> 00:48:31.930
This is it

612
00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:34.266
It's proof that we three together are one.

613
00:48:42.816 --> 00:48:43.817
Hey

614
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:46.612
I'm like Muyoung

615
00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:48.572
I have no intention of dying by your hands.

616
00:48:53.744 --> 00:48:55.621
Come back, Ryu Hong-ju.

617
00:48:56.372 --> 00:48:57.748
Come back, be with us

618
00:49:00.542 --> 00:49:02.920
Hey, what are you doing? Mr. Lee

619
00:49:03.295 --> 00:49:04.296
let's go together

620
00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:08.258
As always

621
00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:10.052
the three of us together

622
00:49:19.645 --> 00:49:20.646
Hey

623
00:49:22.564 --> 00:49:23.982
Don't make Hongju cry

624
00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:26.443
don't do it

625
00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:28.570
Don't make Hongju cry!

626
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.115
uh? Hey guys, run away

627
00:49:38.122 --> 00:49:39.164
don't do it

628
00:49:39.957 --> 00:49:41.792
- Don't make Hongju cry!
- Stop it!

629
00:49:43.836 --> 00:49:44.962
Better bite me!

630
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:54.596
Muyoung!

631
00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:12.823
Hongjoo

632
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:14.032
Come to your senses

633
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.493
Come with us, okay?

634
00:50:25.335 --> 00:50:27.838
Kill them, kill them both!

635
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.593
uh!

636
00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:54.740
no

637
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.242
Why are you...

638
00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:04.291
Dare me
You mean they treated you like a puppet?

639
00:51:09.254 --> 00:51:12.591
Ai, such a crazy bitch.

640
00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:21.058
Don't curse at Hongju.

641
00:51:26.313 --> 00:51:28.148
Ouch!

642
00:51:32.736 --> 00:51:34.863
When we are three
I've never lost

643
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:56.301
You're still hurt because of me

644
00:51:56.844 --> 00:51:57.970
As long as you are safe

645
00:51:59.304 --> 00:52:00.681
I'm done with that.

646
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.475
There's no time, let's hurry

647
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:05.936
Wait a minute

648
00:52:19.157 --> 00:52:21.577
Where are we?

649
00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:23.537
Don't play in the corner
I lost my memory

650
00:52:25.038 --> 00:52:26.039
Mr. Muyoung Cheon

651
00:52:26.123 --> 00:52:27.749
Let's go out and talk in detail.

652
00:52:27.833 --> 00:52:29.543
- Let's go
- Let's go

653
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:34.172
be careful

654
00:53:08.415 --> 00:53:09.625
Oh my

655
00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:12.002
Oh, well, I don't have a car.

656
00:53:12.252 --> 00:53:13.879
I don't have a taxi and it's driving me crazy, really.

657
00:53:13.962 --> 00:53:16.298
♪ Buckwheat jelly ♪

658
00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:18.842
Uh, taxi, taxi, taxi...

659
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.387
Myo, let’s go to Myoyeon-gak, Myoyeon-gak.

660
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:23.472
- Yes?
- Myoyeonggak

661
00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:25.474
Myoyeonggak, Myoyeonggak, let’s go!

662
00:53:25.557 --> 00:53:26.558
departure

663
00:53:27.142 --> 00:53:28.143
Myoyeonggak

664
00:53:36.777 --> 00:53:37.778
That

665
00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:39.321
Where did you get those shoes?

666
00:53:41.114 --> 00:53:43.158
A bachelor gave it to me as a gift.

667
00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:44.743
A gift?

668
00:53:45.202 --> 00:53:47.871
probably did a good job
will think

669
00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:55.295
You think ‘I did a good thing’, yes?

670
00:54:07.516 --> 00:54:08.517
Hey

671
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:09.810
You know me, right?

672
00:54:11.603 --> 00:54:12.604
Wow

673
00:54:12.688 --> 00:54:13.772
That's you, right?

674
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:21.655
uh? hey! You, Mr. Lee

675
00:54:21.738 --> 00:54:22.990
- Come here, you bastard.
- Don't call me!

676
00:54:24.866 --> 00:54:25.867
Oh, I really...

677
00:54:26.868 --> 00:54:29.705
Hey

678
00:54:35.043 --> 00:54:38.046
Son of a thief
Give me my shoes and wedding ring!

679
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.966
This is something that was honestly stolen from me!

680
00:54:41.049 --> 00:54:42.050
This damn bastard is noisy!

681
00:54:45.721 --> 00:54:48.306
This muscle, boss!

682
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.934
Why are you looking for your leader here?
You perverted bastard!

683
00:54:54.521 --> 00:54:55.522
How to get out?

684
00:55:03.363 --> 00:55:04.364
This way

685
00:55:16.543 --> 00:55:17.544
Come

686
00:55:33.727 --> 00:55:34.895
- Go in
- quickly

687
00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:40.192
Muyoungah

688
00:55:40.817 --> 00:55:42.027
Cheon Moo-young!

689
00:55:42.569 --> 00:55:43.570
Wait a minute

690
00:55:44.404 --> 00:55:45.405
Muyoung!

691
00:56:05.217 --> 00:56:06.718
What about Lee Yeon?

692
00:56:13.975 --> 00:56:15.268
the door is closed

693
00:56:17.854 --> 00:56:20.232
Why did you leave it behind? Why did you come back!

694
00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:21.358
We definitely came together!

695
00:56:22.859 --> 00:56:23.944
They're all here...

696
00:56:25.403 --> 00:56:26.404
Muyoung Cheon

697
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.031
That's what he did

698
00:56:28.657 --> 00:56:30.033
I did it on purpose

699
00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.621
No way...

700
00:57:11.449 --> 00:57:12.576
It was you

701
00:57:15.871 --> 00:57:17.539
Bringing in Jang Sanbeom

702
00:57:18.123 --> 00:57:19.124
It was you

703
00:57:21.501 --> 00:57:22.502
I needed this

704
00:57:23.378 --> 00:57:25.505
Essence of a monster that is thousands of years old

705
00:57:27.132 --> 00:57:29.301
It's like a tonic for my body.

706
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:57.996
finally

707
00:58:00.415 --> 00:58:02.125
I finally got my body back

708
00:58:03.627 --> 00:58:04.628
Leeyeon

709
00:58:05.086 --> 00:58:06.379
Are you wearing a red and white mask?

710
00:58:06.796 --> 00:58:08.048
I'm a red and white mask

711
00:58:08.506 --> 00:58:10.342
Throwing you into this era

712
00:58:10.634 --> 00:58:12.677
You and your brother again and again

713
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:13.845
What I tried to kill

714
00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:15.680
It's all me

715
00:58:16.556 --> 00:58:17.807
I hoped not

716
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:21.311
I hope it's not just you

717
00:58:21.394 --> 00:58:23.230
I lost everything because of you

718
00:58:23.813 --> 00:58:26.149
My family, my friends, and the mountains I ruled!

719
00:58:28.276 --> 00:58:29.778
And even myself

720
00:58:29.861 --> 00:58:31.404
Eating for over a thousand years

721
00:58:32.197 --> 00:58:34.532
I really don't like people who only blame others.

722
00:58:34.824 --> 00:58:35.825
Leeyeon

723
00:58:36.826 --> 00:58:37.827
you can't go home

724
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.373
And the woman I love again
We won't be able to meet each other

725
00:58:41.915 --> 00:58:43.291
Muyoung Cheon

726
00:58:59.975 --> 00:59:01.518
I'll kill you

727
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:03.228
If that's your wish

728
00:59:11.653 --> 00:59:15.532
I thought he had a dirty look for some reason.
I knew it would be like this

729
00:59:16.074 --> 00:59:17.117
Langa

730
00:59:19.244 --> 00:59:21.079
I told you not to trust that guy, right?

731
00:59:21.162 --> 00:59:23.748
I'm fine, you're dangerous, avoid

732
00:59:26.209 --> 00:59:29.045
Don't touch it, you'll kill it

733
00:59:29.129 --> 00:59:31.006
What can a half nine-tailed fox do?

734
00:59:32.173 --> 00:59:34.217
To kill that thing
You'll have to kill me first.

735
00:59:34.301 --> 00:59:35.302
my brother

736
00:59:35.802 --> 00:59:37.429
Just touch the tip of a hair

737
00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:40.765
My brother chopped it up

738
00:59:41.933 --> 00:59:43.727
So these two are brothers, right?

739
00:59:56.406 --> 00:59:58.116
Shall I tell you a funny story?

740
00:59:59.326 --> 01:00:00.327
You are

741
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:09.294
Why doesn’t Cheon Mu-young kill me?
You just went, right?

742
01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.005
It must have been a golden opportunity

743
01:00:15.216 --> 01:00:16.384
What did they say to you?

744
01:00:18.219 --> 01:00:19.220
Sapsori

745
01:00:20.597 --> 01:00:22.307
Let's go, buy me cold noodles

746
01:00:25.477 --> 01:00:28.063
Hey, did you come running because you were worried about me?

747
01:00:28.563 --> 01:00:30.231
Wow, that's nonsense

748
01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:32.150
Oh my

749
01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:33.943
I only have my younger brother, ah

750
01:00:34.027 --> 01:00:35.528
Wow, it's heavy.

751
01:00:36.404 --> 01:00:37.822
Oh, walk straight

752
01:00:38.073 --> 01:00:41.368
AC, what kind of body is this? Ugh

753
01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:09.145
Jang Sanbeom

754
01:01:11.815 --> 01:01:12.982
I called you in

755
01:01:13.483 --> 01:01:14.484
That's it

756
01:01:15.652 --> 01:01:17.695
I didn't know it was coming for you
I'm sorry, Hongju.

757
01:01:19.072 --> 01:01:21.282
What else?
Why don't you confess quickly?

758
01:01:22.492 --> 01:01:23.743
Did you get what you wanted?

759
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.580
What are you going to do now?

760
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:29.666
I'll get my brother back

761
01:01:31.626 --> 01:01:32.961
You mean your dead brother?

762
01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.462
no matter what you say

763
01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:38.049
Lee Yeon and I risk our lives
there will be a fight

764
01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:41.219
Beat it away

765
01:01:42.846 --> 01:01:45.014
No matter how bad you are
You don't suit being a villain.

766
01:01:51.855 --> 01:01:53.648
Can't you just stay by my side?

767
01:01:54.399 --> 01:01:55.525
To Muyoung, whom I loved

768
01:01:55.942 --> 01:01:56.943
Hongjoo

769
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.573
No one else knows

770
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.742
don't shake me

771
01:02:06.953 --> 01:02:08.163
If you shake it...

772
01:02:19.174 --> 01:02:22.051
Hey, Mr. Lee, I’m a little narrow!

773
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.928
What are you talking about?
I'm broad, Mr.

774
01:02:24.179 --> 01:02:25.346
What is it? What are you talking about, Mr.

775
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:26.431
Erase everything

776
01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:30.351
Mr. Jae-yu

777
01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:31.769
I guess he went somewhere far away?

778
01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:33.521
What are you doing in my room?

779
01:02:33.605 --> 01:02:36.441
Our room now, okay?

780
01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:37.692
I got permission from above

781
01:02:37.775 --> 01:02:39.402
- Who's up there?
- President Hongju

782
01:02:39.486 --> 01:02:40.612
Oh my

783
01:02:40.695 --> 01:02:42.739
I'm snoring
I was kicked out by Lee Yeon.

784
01:02:42.822 --> 01:02:44.324
Hey, hey, are you snoring too?

785
01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:45.575
- I'll come over.
- Huh? nose

786
01:02:45.658 --> 01:02:47.619
- I told you not to!
- 아이

787
01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:50.288
진짜, 이렇게 치사스럽소
이렇게, 이렇게

788
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:52.499
재유 씨, 소지품 조심해
이 새끼 이거 도둑놈이야

789
01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:53.708
야, 이 새끼야

790
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.835
난 내 직업에 자부심을 가진 놈이야

791
01:02:56.085 --> 01:02:57.879
If it's not you, you're a loser

792
01:02:57.962 --> 01:02:59.088
Two minutes!

793
01:02:59.506 --> 01:03:00.715
Well, fighting is good.

794
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:02.842
please don't talk to me

795
01:03:04.469 --> 01:03:05.470
What is it?

796
01:03:05.678 --> 01:03:06.971
It looks like it's a prickly pear.

797
01:03:08.389 --> 01:03:09.390
Hey, what is MBTI?

798
01:03:10.016 --> 01:03:11.559
- yes?
-What is Envite?

799
01:03:11.643 --> 01:03:12.894
MBTI

800
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:14.771
Should I stand up?

801
01:03:15.897 --> 01:03:16.898
Chinese!

802
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.608
Ah, Chinese?

803
01:03:21.027 --> 01:03:23.404
- Please save me!
- Is there anyone there?

804
01:03:23.988 --> 01:03:25.740
Honey, where on earth is this?

805
01:03:25.823 --> 01:03:27.659
- What crime have we committed?
- Shhh

806
01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:28.743
someone is coming
someone is coming

807
01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:33.998
What about youkai? How many did you secure?

808
01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:37.043
The number is not small
Most are weak entities.

809
01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:40.880
To send to war
We need to complete the experiment as quickly as possible.

810
01:03:40.964 --> 01:03:42.507
increase the number of catches

811
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:50.306
Bring in stronger guys

812
01:03:51.266 --> 01:03:53.726
Things called Joseon monsters
You're more cunning than you think

813
01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:56.729
They are so good at hiding that it is their home.

814
01:04:00.191 --> 01:04:01.901
Shinigami mercenary group

815
01:04:04.779 --> 01:04:05.780
call them

816
01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:07.699
shinigami

817
01:04:08.408 --> 01:04:09.492
A mercenary group?

818
01:04:10.785 --> 01:04:12.829
on the floor
It is true that they are the most talented people, but

819
01:04:12.912 --> 01:04:14.455
They are out of control

820
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:17.875
I'm in control

821
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.631
Still...

822
01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:27.969
It's an experiment
What does this mean?

823
01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:29.804
i hate it

824
01:04:30.263 --> 01:04:31.764
I need to get out of here

825
01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:35.685
Please save me

826
01:04:35.768 --> 01:04:36.769
Please save me

827
01:04:37.812 --> 01:04:39.105
Mr.

828
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:46.321
I can't forgive

829
01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:47.780
Muyoung Cheon

830
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:17.060
I have a funny story
Would you like one?

831
01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:18.936
You are

832
01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:21.439
I die before living for less than a hundred years

833
01:05:22.857 --> 01:05:24.025
2020

834
01:05:25.693 --> 01:05:27.695
Becoming a sacrifice to replace your brother

835
01:05:30.865 --> 01:05:33.993
You will die after being used to your heart's content throughout your life.

836
01:06:18.413 --> 01:06:20.707
Gyeongseong floor searched as if to grab it

837
01:06:20.957 --> 01:06:22.917
Find out what kind of guy he is doing

838
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.794
Your younger brother must be very busy right now?

839
01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.629
Why make a bet like that?
Risk your life carelessly!

840
01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:27.922
me too

841
01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:30.633
- Because I want to live
- If I win

842
01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:32.885
Give him his life back

843
01:06:33.344 --> 01:06:36.180
The spirit of Joseon
Must be uprooted

844
01:06:36.556 --> 01:06:37.849
I just can't do it.

845
01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:39.308
We're on the same side

846
01:06:39.642 --> 01:06:40.810
let me help you

847
01:06:41.352 --> 01:06:43.604
How many of these are there?
Do you want to get out alive?

848
01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:45.732
Because it will be a bloody night
