WEBVTT

﻿1
00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.916
Well, that's perfect

2
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.000
Ah, indeed

3
00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:03.794
Where is it?

4
00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:05.754
Guardian stone

5
00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:08.173
Geumcheok

6
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:13.720
It's because I'm worried

7
00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:16.348
I heard everyone will be coming soon?

8
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:18.809
red and white mask

9
00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:20.560
Governor General's Office

10
00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.187
I don't want to get caught up, I

11
00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:28.401
Okay, then I'll take Su Ho-seok and
I will leave Myoyeonggak with my gold chucks.

12
00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.280
So

13
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.282
Where are you?

14
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:52.634
that

15
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:55.679
Did you hide it in my room?

16
00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.431
At Myoyeonggak
Is there anywhere safer than here?

17
00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:07.607
That

18
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.110
Will you give it to me?

19
00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.240
my time travel

20
00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.661
It started with this guardian stone

21
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.621
Hongjoo

22
00:02:21.705 --> 00:02:23.540
I can't go home without this

23
00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:24.624
So

24
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.751
Those who block my path

25
00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:28.503
Anyone will wipe it out

26
00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:31.172
- Is that even me?
- Even you

27
00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:34.885
Can you handle it?

28
00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:39.097
I'm going to the Peninsula Hotel

29
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.765
Whether it’s Cheon Mu-young or the Governor-General’s Office

30
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.101
Tell this to the niggas that want it

31
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.561
I'm at the Peninsula Hotel.

32
00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:47.522
I don't even avoid it

33
00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.399
Because I won't hide

34
00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:01.828
Hey, Cheon Muyoung

35
00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:05.874
It's good to sell, are you over drinking, are you?

36
00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:07.834
Lee Yeon, how did you get here...

37
00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:10.378
Okay, let's get it right

38
00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.093
This bastard, Mr.

39
00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.720
Ah, Mr.

40
00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:05.016
Ah, Mr.

41
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.687
How do you feel?

42
00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:12.232
At one time, I did my best
With the hands that lifted each other up

43
00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.359
It feels like we're beating each other to death

44
00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:15.652
Are you here to preach?

45
00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.113
I came to check

46
00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:20.115
How would I feel if this happened?

47
00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:21.908
Well, it's not as refreshing as I thought.

48
00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:23.743
It's the same for both of us

49
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.580
Hey, give me a drink.

50
00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:28.999
What?

51
00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:32.210
By the way, I left behind all the treasure you are looking for.

52
00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:33.878
Safety first

53
00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:44.723
A guest has arrived

54
00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:46.975
Who?

55
00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.185
Long time no see, monsters

56
00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.819
The president of Myoyeonggak took the initiative to bring down the Government General
You are looking for me

57
00:04:57.902 --> 00:04:59.362
Four kids I couldn't see

58
00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:00.864
They're moving around Gyeongseong, right?

59
00:05:00.947 --> 00:05:02.073
It's called shinigami

60
00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:03.241
Shinigami?

61
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.161
It means ‘god of death’.

62
00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:08.955
- Uh, I don't like it.
- Together

63
00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:12.375
Why did you come to me instead of going there?

64
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.295
You called me in

65
00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:19.007
Oh, after all
They said he was a Joseon informant.

66
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.009
What is your business?

67
00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:24.721
Well, I'm a mercenary and I'm not interested.

68
00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:28.349
Are you looking for guardian stone and gold?

69
00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:31.895
If you help me get it

70
00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:34.147
- What do you want for me?
-What do you want?

71
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.315
With Myoyeonggak

72
00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:37.901
Don't touch my kids

73
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:41.404
To protect Myoyeonggak
I will hold hands with you

74
00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:44.074
What is Joseon’s mountain god like?

75
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.077
I don't fight losing battles

76
00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:54.709
just ask once

77
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.711
Do you want to do it?

78
00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:58.213
Do you want to stop?

79
00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:15.855
With guard stone and gold chuck
You want to bring your brother back to life?

80
00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:19.275
- Crazy guy
-Your brother died in 2020, right?

81
00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:22.862
At that time, if you
I wish I had that thing

82
00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:25.073
What choice did you make?

83
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.616
I think I was shaken

84
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:29.452
But

85
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.081
Even if that moment comes again
I'll make the same choice

86
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.377
While gaining strength and becoming virtuous,
I'll be waiting for reincarnation

87
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.795
Well, I haven’t tried it for a day or two.

88
00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:40.672
A stubborn guy

89
00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:43.883
That's it

90
00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:46.094
Because that's why I became a mountain god

91
00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:49.806
Even if there are two sides of the sky, I don’t cross the line

92
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.725
Turned into a stone
If you can't die or live for hundreds of years,

93
00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.727
That kind of thing is useless

94
00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:57.814
It's the path you chose

95
00:06:58.982 --> 00:07:01.985
Breaking the taboo
If the entire mountain was annihilated

96
00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:04.154
I should have been prepared for that much.

97
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:07.490
I'm prepared

98
00:07:08.324 --> 00:07:09.325
Then and now

99
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:11.202
That's it then

100
00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:13.079
you

101
00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:14.497
Doing my best

102
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:16.833
Take the guardian stone and the golden chuck from me.

103
00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:19.127
And save your brother

104
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:27.927
I risk my life to protect the treasure

105
00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:29.429
Because I will fight with you

106
00:07:34.392 --> 00:07:35.602
We drink together

107
00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:38.688
Today will be the last day?

108
00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:44.694
Had a good drink

109
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:51.659
I'm going to the Peninsula Hotel.

110
00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.119
Let me ask you one thing

111
00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:58.291
What was I to you?

112
00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:01.920
As you know

113
00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:04.047
I was a perverse child, wasn't I?

114
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.424
Only I know

115
00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:08.843
I learned it from you

116
00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:12.180
How to fight to protect someone

117
00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.725
I wanted to become a mountain god like you

118
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:19.312
It's fun

119
00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:22.774
To you at that time
It always seemed to shine

120
00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:24.234
you are fearless

121
00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.444
I decided everything myself

122
00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:27.820
you

123
00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:30.240
it was my dream

124
00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:32.408
So I guess we were friends

125
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.501
Going

126
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.604
Treasure to the Government General
Are you going to hand it over?

127
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:03.064
Am I crazy?

128
00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:05.566
the treasure is mine

129
00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:08.987
Why did you hold hands with him?

130
00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:11.030
Buy some time

131
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:13.408
While I take the treasure

132
00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:14.701
Sleep a little

133
00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:15.910
Could I have been deceived?

134
00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:19.038
no
He's stronger and smarter than you think.

135
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:20.540
I might get hit

136
00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:22.959
Is the treasure worth it?

137
00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:24.919
As well as the Governor-General

138
00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:26.671
Even Lee Yeon and Muyoung
By turning it into an enemy...

139
00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:27.755
Jaeyuya

140
00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:30.216
If it comes into my hands

141
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.927
Yeon can't go home

142
00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:36.347
What to say

143
00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.350
with a guardian stone

144
00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:42.437
Let’s leave this awful era too

145
00:09:42.854 --> 00:09:44.355
Jumping into a new world

146
00:09:44.897 --> 00:09:46.107
So from now on

147
00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:49.861
Let's go into the eye of the typhoon

148
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:02.832
Dad

149
00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.210
Where have you been?

150
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.464
I got a set of clothes tailored at the department store, ah.

151
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.426
I also bought my dad’s tie.

152
00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:15.011
Good

153
00:10:15.386 --> 00:10:17.889
I'm going to wear that to your wedding.

154
00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:19.265
my wedding?

155
00:10:20.725 --> 00:10:21.726
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.978
Get married, quit being a reporter

157
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:26.564
Who am I marrying?

158
00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:27.982
your brother-in-law

159
00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:31.361
The ceremony is this Sunday.

160
00:10:32.653 --> 00:10:33.654
I'm crazy

161
00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:35.448
You must be crazy, Dad.

162
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.201
Sister, to that person
I committed suicide after getting married.

163
00:10:42.038 --> 00:10:43.539
answer me

164
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:50.254
A bomb exploded at Gyeongseong Station
The day the military commander died

165
00:10:50.588 --> 00:10:51.672
Where have you been?

166
00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:01.099
Answer me!

167
00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:04.560
You asked because you knew.

168
00:11:05.937 --> 00:11:08.231
That's right, I was there.

169
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.445
Even if there are only two girls

170
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.031
didn't miss

171
00:11:18.074 --> 00:11:19.158
honey

172
00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.285
Honey, honey, please

173
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.870
please say it in words

174
00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:33.047
in my family

175
00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:35.383
There are no hurrayers!

176
00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.183
Why did you do that?

177
00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.227
I did everything for you

178
00:11:46.853 --> 00:11:47.979
The independence movement

179
00:11:50.857 --> 00:11:51.983
No, huh?

180
00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:53.734
Answer me, no!

181
00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.028
Mom, I'm sorry

182
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.032
It's a long nose

183
00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:03.077
It's not long nose

184
00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:05.955
my name is

185
00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:07.874
Sunwoo Eunho

186
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:16.883
What was the outcome of the experiment?

187
00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:20.219
There are no survivors yet

188
00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:22.722
What lasted the longest
It's only about two days

189
00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:24.223
All my eardrums burst

190
00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:25.600
ear saw tree

191
00:12:26.517 --> 00:12:27.518
Is it because?

192
00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:28.853
yes

193
00:12:36.444 --> 00:12:38.070
By injecting sap from the tree

194
00:12:38.571 --> 00:12:40.156
It's messing with their heads.

195
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.491
The problem is

196
00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:45.411
I can hear the sound of whistling in my ears
die

197
00:12:46.454 --> 00:12:47.455
sorry

198
00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:51.292
If the results of the experiment
If you can't pay it

199
00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:52.919
The next test subject is

200
00:12:55.171 --> 00:12:57.215
Akira you will be

201
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:00.801
I will definitely make it successful

202
00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:08.559
Did you call me?

203
00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:12.313
I have a new mission

204
00:13:12.813 --> 00:13:14.398
Bring the treasure from the nine-tailed fox

205
00:13:15.107 --> 00:13:16.359
I'll bring you treasure

206
00:13:16.817 --> 00:13:19.612
Can I have that nine-tailed fox?

207
00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:23.658
It's nonsense

208
00:13:24.075 --> 00:13:25.159
Did you see it up close?

209
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.411
How was it?

210
00:13:28.037 --> 00:13:29.038
head

211
00:13:29.747 --> 00:13:31.249
He's a tight-lipped guy.

212
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:32.959
It's a losing battle no matter who sees it.

213
00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.419
In an instant, he grabbed hold of the flow and shook it.

214
00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:36.921
He is the mountain god of Joseon.

215
00:13:38.673 --> 00:13:39.757
Can you deal with it?

216
00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:42.510
Please leave it to me

217
00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:47.765
He's going to the Peninsula Hotel.

218
00:13:48.182 --> 00:13:49.433
‘Hi’!

219
00:13:50.768 --> 00:13:51.769
"Gyomyeonok Naengmyeon"

220
00:13:58.067 --> 00:14:00.444
how dare you
Are you asking the owner of Samdocheon to come and go?

221
00:14:01.612 --> 00:14:03.155
Have a bowl of cold noodles

222
00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:05.324
Come on, eat it.

223
00:14:15.793 --> 00:14:16.794
What do you think?

224
00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:19.714
It's nice because it's cool

225
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.051
What is my intention?

226
00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:25.636
Japanese monsters

227
00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:28.264
Our indigenous gods are drying up the seeds.

228
00:14:29.557 --> 00:14:32.476
Do you think my clairvoyance is just decoration?

229
00:14:35.229 --> 00:14:36.230
Be honest.

230
00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:39.066
Even the old lady is going crazy with frustration, right?

231
00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:42.486
Why did I get trampled by these guys?
Heaven and earth are turning into a wasteland

232
00:14:42.862 --> 00:14:44.280
Just sit and watch

233
00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:49.201
We do not intervene in human affairs

234
00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.371
That's the principle

235
00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:56.751
But as the grandmother said
I don't belong here, do I?

236
00:14:57.293 --> 00:15:00.046
I'm just a traveler passing through this era

237
00:15:02.757 --> 00:15:04.175
What are you going to do again?

238
00:15:04.258 --> 00:15:05.509
Japanese monsters

239
00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:07.887
I'll sweep it all up before I get home

240
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.642
I'm just quietly holding my breath
I can just go back, but how...

241
00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.352
Because it’s something only I can do

242
00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:16.687
It's what I had to do

243
00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:20.024
Grandmother

244
00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.985
I owe this era

245
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.657
Then I understand it was allowed.

246
00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:35.456
Was this it?

247
00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:41.253
me in the future
The reason Yeon was sent to this era

248
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.267
This scenery will soon be goodbye

249
00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.989
Are you suddenly going to a hotel? I am?

250
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:11.075
There's no need to follow me

251
00:16:11.534 --> 00:16:12.535
What?

252
00:16:12.618 --> 00:16:15.871
I'm aiming for gold with Su Ho-seok.
Everyone will flock there

253
00:16:16.288 --> 00:16:17.707
It's safer to stay away from me now

254
00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:19.583
Ugh

255
00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:21.752
- child
- I'm annoyed.

256
00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:23.713
You and I are half a nine-tailed fox
Are you ignoring me?

257
00:16:24.964 --> 00:16:26.841
- I?
- But why?

258
00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:29.593
Is there no way you can lean on me just once?

259
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.598
Ah, I want to lean on you

260
00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:36.100
I'd like to

261
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.769
you are here now
It's my only weakness

262
00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:41.522
If you get hurt again, I'll go crazy

263
00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.860
Carrying on your back
I'm not a child

264
00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:47.903
at least

265
00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:50.906
Let me decide the path I will take

266
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.621
Ah, there isn't much time left to go back.
Don't regret it later

267
00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.167
Oh, okay, let's go together, okay?

268
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.544
- Hey, stick with it, huh?
- Oh, okay.

269
00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:05.463
Lee Yeon

270
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:06.922
- Oh, go to the temple, please.
- Huh?

271
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:12.052
good

272
00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:14.555
Even if I go when I go
Are you going to have a farewell party?

273
00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:16.056
- Hongju?
- Yes

274
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.141
And this

275
00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.060
About the Japanese monsters you mentioned
This is information I researched.

276
00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:21.312
uh

277
00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:27.651
-Why me?
- I started from the beginning.

278
00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:29.987
I chose you as my marriage partner, but

279
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.697
Your sister said it herself

280
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:33.157
I will get married instead of you

281
00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.993
Where did you hear the rumor?

282
00:17:36.452 --> 00:17:37.870
Your sister knew

283
00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:39.997
I

284
00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:42.041
That I'm not a good guy

285
00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:44.418
So your sister got married?

286
00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:46.378
instead of me

287
00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:48.422
I guess he wanted to protect his only younger brother.

288
00:17:48.631 --> 00:17:49.632
in the end

289
00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:51.342
I couldn't even save my life

290
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.261
You killed it, right?

291
00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:10.653
your sister

292
00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:13.656
I saw something I shouldn't have seen

293
00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:19.578
That's why he died

294
00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:22.748
I'll kill you

295
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.631
the new bride
If I carry something like this, can I use it?

296
00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:32.716
Even if I die, I won't marry you

297
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.517
You will do it

298
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.531
Oh, why is your face like that?

299
00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:58.409
I failed in the preliminaries of the singer contest

300
00:18:58.492 --> 00:18:59.577
Why you?

301
00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:03.581
With a gisaeng from Pyongyang
They say an actress who advertises soap was chosen.

302
00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:08.460
They said they were selecting a new singer

303
00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:17.887
ride

304
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.805
I don't feel like watching a movie right now

305
00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:22.516
Not a movie

306
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.351
Let's go see something else

307
00:19:30.733 --> 00:19:31.734
It's the sea

308
00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:40.534
After a while
Do you smell the sea?

309
00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.000
Is it that good?

310
00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.254
I missed you

311
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.176
Even in my dreams, in my ears
So much so that I can hear the sound of the waves

312
00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.138
How did you come up with all this?

313
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.890
I don't know much about women

314
00:20:03.557 --> 00:20:05.768
'Don't mermaids miss the sea?'

315
00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.270
I sometimes

316
00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:10.606
Just like I want to go back to the forest where I was with Lee Yeon.

317
00:20:16.654 --> 00:20:18.822
Are you eliminated from the preliminaries or something?
I forgot everything

318
00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:24.578
Let's walk together

319
00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:34.713
Do you have to fight?

320
00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:37.174
Because I’m different from you, I hate Joseon.

321
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.260
Born as a half monster

322
00:20:40.928 --> 00:20:42.262
I don’t have any particularly good memories

323
00:20:43.222 --> 00:20:44.223
But

324
00:20:44.932 --> 00:20:46.475
In this land like war

325
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.602
For the first time, I have something I want to protect.

326
00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:52.982
Then let's fight together

327
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.818
- You can't
- Ranga

328
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.695
If something happens to you, I

329
00:20:58.779 --> 00:20:59.780
I can't live even a day

330
00:21:00.197 --> 00:21:02.199
I almost died countless times so far

331
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.368
I survived every time

332
00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:08.163
As long as Lee Yeon is by my side, I will never die.

333
00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:11.041
That's what it's like to have brothers

334
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:15.587
Hmm, I had a family once too.

335
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.426
I'll do it for you, family.

336
00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:22.928
Really?

337
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.348
When this is over

338
00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:28.100
Quit the magic band

339
00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:29.893
I think I'll find something else to do

340
00:21:32.688 --> 00:21:33.689
What

341
00:21:34.565 --> 00:21:35.816
Should I just start a record label?

342
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.361
Is it real?

343
00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:15.939
what? What should I sell?

344
00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:18.108
Myoyeongakpyo Brunch

345
00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:21.904
To increase your sales, diversify your menu.

346
00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:23.697
I get the impression that this place is hip
You say I have to give it to you?

347
00:22:23.781 --> 00:22:24.782
He also delivers

348
00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:26.575
We are a high-end restaurant

349
00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:28.327
In the future I came from

350
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.079
Michelin restaurants

351
00:22:30.162 --> 00:22:31.371
We deliver everything

352
00:22:31.455 --> 00:22:32.539
Who does the delivery?

353
00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:33.624
Who does the delivery?

354
00:22:35.042 --> 00:22:36.585
Take the kids from our magic band and use them.

355
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:38.212
Being quick on your feet is the best

356
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:39.963
Are you going to quit the Magic Bandits?

357
00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:41.340
Oh well, I'm thinking

358
00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:43.717
Oh my, that’s amazing. Now, why don’t we have a drink?

359
00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:46.929
Fish oil, good, fish oil, good

360
00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:56.939
Who came during the day?

361
00:23:00.818 --> 00:23:02.236
I had a drink with Lee Yeon.

362
00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:03.487
What?

363
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.696
to declare war

364
00:23:05.948 --> 00:23:07.324
Now we're real enemies

365
00:23:07.407 --> 00:23:08.909
Don’t be shaken, Muyoung.

366
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.372
If it felt like it would shake
I didn't even come this far

367
00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.249
kill Lee Yeon

368
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.251
I have to get my hands on the treasure

369
00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:19.837
But bro

370
00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:23.257
Long time ago

371
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:27.219
Why did you try to kill me?

372
00:23:27.302 --> 00:23:29.471
I told you, I was out of my mind

373
00:23:29.805 --> 00:23:30.931
It's the work of the undressing group.

374
00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:33.183
The power of our tiger clan
To prevent it from growing bigger

375
00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:35.435
- To annihilate us...
- No, I don't understand.

376
00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.479
How much the grandmother of the Talwipa cared for me.

377
00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:40.357
If that was sincere
Would they have turned you into a stone and thrown it away?

378
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.234
Hostages were needed from the beginning.

379
00:23:42.609 --> 00:23:44.570
I took you as a mountain god and raised you.

380
00:23:47.322 --> 00:23:48.323
Okay

381
00:23:48.991 --> 00:23:50.117
I will get it back

382
00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:52.578
everything we lost

383
00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:54.872
That's my brother

384
00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:58.167
I'll bring it

385
00:23:59.168 --> 00:24:00.335
Guardian stone and gold chuck

386
00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:16.143
Uh, move over, it's my place.

387
00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:18.312
Oh, what are we going to do?

388
00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:19.730
There are a lot of seats in the back

389
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:25.110
departure

390
00:24:26.612 --> 00:24:28.447
Wasn’t last night’s farewell party?

391
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.909
I've been thinking about it all night
I couldn't let it go like this

392
00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:33.577
My heart hurts

393
00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:35.120
What are you doing?

394
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.456
What about Myoyeonggak?

395
00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:38.707
temporary closure

396
00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:40.250
Everyone will come to the hotel

397
00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.878
I reserved your room too.

398
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.048
let's go

399
00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:48.050
“Peninsula Hotel”

400
00:25:01.772 --> 00:25:04.066
I'll check in
I'm watching

401
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:07.694
Oh, wow, it’s better than I thought?

402
00:25:10.948 --> 00:25:11.949
What is your name?

403
00:25:12.532 --> 00:25:13.533
Don't you know me?

404
00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:14.952
Ryu Hong-joo

405
00:25:16.954 --> 00:25:18.705
There are 10 people and 4 rooms, right?

406
00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:20.082
Yeah

407
00:25:21.458 --> 00:25:22.876
Give me a room that is all adjacent to each other.

408
00:25:23.627 --> 00:25:25.170
That upstairs is nice too.

409
00:25:26.797 --> 00:25:27.798
Oh, sorry.

410
00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:32.386
What is this?

411
00:25:33.845 --> 00:25:35.138
‘Hypnotism secret’?

412
00:25:35.555 --> 00:25:38.433
It is the best hypnotism association in Joseon.

413
00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:39.768
Ah, this book

414
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:42.604
Our Chairman
This is a book that reveals the secrets of heaven.

415
00:25:42.854 --> 00:25:44.523
buy me this

416
00:25:45.357 --> 00:25:46.358
It's all a scam, man

417
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:47.609
It's not a scam

418
00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:49.278
If you master hypnosis

419
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.154
cure all diseases

420
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.282
I also talk to ghosts

421
00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:56.910
In the dry sky
It could cause lightning to strike

422
00:25:56.994 --> 00:25:57.995
Oh my

423
00:25:58.078 --> 00:25:59.621
There's a guy here who really knows how to do that.

424
00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:01.290
- Yes?
- Something like this

425
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.000
Who believes it?

426
00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:04.626
Ah, good work

427
00:26:20.684 --> 00:26:21.852
stop

428
00:26:24.438 --> 00:26:26.857
Oh, you ignorant bastard, shoes.

429
00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:29.901
Why are you swearing all of a sudden?

430
00:26:29.985 --> 00:26:32.487
No, not an insult, shoes, shoes

431
00:26:32.904 --> 00:26:34.531
When entering the hotel
Taking off your shoes

432
00:26:34.614 --> 00:26:36.158
It’s manners, you know?

433
00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:40.537
I knew it all too!

434
00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:46.877
- what?
- Hey, hey.

435
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.880
Huh? boss, boss, boss

436
00:26:51.048 --> 00:26:52.883
child

437
00:26:52.966 --> 00:26:54.176
Why are you taking your shoes off?

438
00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:56.053
Hey, is this your first time coming to the hotel?

439
00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:58.180
yes?
Isn’t this etiquette?

440
00:26:58.263 --> 00:27:00.557
Look, everyone is wearing them except you.

441
00:27:01.308 --> 00:27:03.060
- Hey, who said that?
- Gusinju

442
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.688
Such a bastard!

443
00:27:06.938 --> 00:27:07.939
Come to work!

444
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:10.150
Guys

445
00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:15.322
The nine-tailed fox brothers

446
00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:18.575
- Room 304
- Yeah, what about you?

447
00:27:19.618 --> 00:27:20.619
Room 301

448
00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:24.039
See you later, baby

449
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.501
let's go

450
00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:30.462
I came with a very deliberate plan.

451
00:27:30.879 --> 00:27:33.632
Don't let down your guard
Because it will be a bloody night

452
00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:48.897
Let’s go to the Bando Hotel.

453
00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:01.618
"Obok Goods Store"

454
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:04.204
How about me?

455
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.248
Yuki, pretty

456
00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:08.166
What, they say they’re all pretty?

457
00:28:09.543 --> 00:28:12.045
Is there anything a little bit raunchy and bold?

458
00:28:12.129 --> 00:28:15.006
I’m going to meet a scary handsome monster today
I'm going to the hotel

459
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.425
you guys

460
00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:18.385
What is it?

461
00:28:18.677 --> 00:28:19.678
What is it?

462
00:28:20.053 --> 00:28:21.221
It's a youkai just like you

463
00:28:22.514 --> 00:28:24.516
What about the woman’s body?

464
00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:31.523
Rumbling gaksi

465
00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:35.610
It's so loud

466
00:28:36.611 --> 00:28:37.988
What are you talented at?

467
00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:40.949
Bar, sewing

468
00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:43.160
Food is everything

469
00:28:43.493 --> 00:28:44.744
Shall I drag you along?

470
00:28:47.664 --> 00:28:50.667
Oh, did I practice singing too much?

471
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.002
I feel like my throat will be torn apart

472
00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:00.510
boss

473
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:03.054
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?

474
00:29:03.138 --> 00:29:04.973
I almost got caught by a Japanese monster

475
00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:06.683
Japanese Yokai?

476
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:10.437
For the time being, don't go out carelessly.

477
00:29:13.815 --> 00:29:14.941
Where have they gone?

478
00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:17.277
Everyone flocked to the Peninsula Hotel.

479
00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:18.945
Peninsula Hotel?

480
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:20.447
Rangi is there

481
00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:22.866
I'll go out for a bit.

482
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.701
You can't go

483
00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:26.786
Yeohee!

484
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.836
Ah, a bed, a hotel bed!

485
00:29:35.754 --> 00:29:37.088
- Wow
- Wow, awesome.

486
00:29:37.172 --> 00:29:39.216
There is precious soap in the room.

487
00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:41.718
Can you just get some soap? How much is the rent here?

488
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:42.886
How much is it?

489
00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:45.055
That’s a month’s wage for an average waitress.

490
00:29:52.771 --> 00:29:53.772
What is this?

491
00:29:54.523 --> 00:29:58.443
Is it kimchi? Ah, sister
Who brings kimchi to the hotel?

492
00:29:58.735 --> 00:30:00.028
I heard they only sell lamb dishes.

493
00:30:00.111 --> 00:30:01.530
I took it just in case.

494
00:30:01.863 --> 00:30:05.825
Oh, I don't know.
If we are treated like countrymen too

495
00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:08.537
Hey, hey, hey, hey

496
00:30:09.287 --> 00:30:10.580
Hey, this is theft.

497
00:30:10.664 --> 00:30:12.541
my job is theft

498
00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:14.668
- Baby, let go!
- what are you doing?

499
00:30:15.252 --> 00:30:17.420
Let go, I'm doing my thing.

500
00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.842
Don't do it, don't do it, stop it

501
00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:25.845
Oh, leave it, picture, picture, uh

502
00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:27.597
Oh, hey, but why doesn't this come off?

503
00:30:27.681 --> 00:30:29.516
Hey, this isn’t an amenity!
really

504
00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:31.268
I'm going to go to the boss's room.

505
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:32.352
Jae-yu, help me!

506
00:30:35.522 --> 00:30:38.400
Let it go, let it go, let it go

507
00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:41.194
Hey

508
00:30:41.653 --> 00:30:43.238
Don't forget what we came here for

509
00:30:44.614 --> 00:30:45.865
Do you think I'm a fool?

510
00:30:46.783 --> 00:30:47.784
uh

511
00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:57.544
I brought you Mananguk Porridge.

512
00:30:57.627 --> 00:30:58.628
Was this a good thing?

513
00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:02.966
If you know that I emptied Myoyeonggak
I won't sit still at the Governor General's Office.

514
00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:05.844
You guys are right next to me

515
00:31:05.927 --> 00:31:07.178
What do you plan on doing?

516
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:11.349
Our Yeon and Mu-young got into a fight.

517
00:31:11.808 --> 00:31:13.018
I have to run away with the treasure.

518
00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:15.520
Until then

519
00:31:15.895 --> 00:31:17.147
you go out and have some fun

520
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:29.993
- What is it?
- Invite

521
00:31:30.076 --> 00:31:31.328
As for our association...

522
00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:32.412
Go away

523
00:31:42.714 --> 00:31:43.715
Leeyeon

524
00:31:45.008 --> 00:31:46.051
It's over now

525
00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:49.554
newdo

526
00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:51.723
New too!

527
00:31:52.182 --> 00:31:55.393
- Let's go catch it quickly.
- Let's go, let's go!

528
00:31:55.477 --> 00:31:57.729
The task is
It starts when the sun goes down

529
00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.731
It's the captain's order.

530
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.694
Then should I get some sleep?

531
00:32:40.063 --> 00:32:41.064
Langa

532
00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:43.566
Do you want to come with me?

533
00:32:44.943 --> 00:32:45.944
Where?

534
00:32:46.236 --> 00:32:48.279
Where I came from, the future of Joseon

535
00:32:49.948 --> 00:32:52.033
There are no gunshots and no war.

536
00:32:52.283 --> 00:32:53.284
Why do they

537
00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:54.494
I can't go

538
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.831
It's because of the mermaid girl.

539
00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.378
Be nice to me

540
00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:04.838
the mermaid girl

541
00:33:05.338 --> 00:33:07.507
Risk your life and protect me till the end

542
00:33:08.216 --> 00:33:09.676
Gumiho's first love

543
00:33:09.926 --> 00:33:12.011
Because it will be your first and last love

544
00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:18.059
Tsk, ay

545
00:33:19.644 --> 00:33:21.062
Now, this

546
00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:24.399
I was going to give it to you before I left.

547
00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:32.157
Ring?

548
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.241
yes

549
00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:35.869
This is a wedding gift from my brother.

550
00:33:36.494 --> 00:33:37.495
The two of us share one by one

551
00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:49.883
A lot of uninvited guests came

552
00:33:54.053 --> 00:33:56.473
Among these
How many of you will survive?

553
00:33:57.724 --> 00:34:00.351
In your eyes
Does this guy seem so merciful?

554
00:34:09.444 --> 00:34:10.987
Ah, it's fun, it's fun

555
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.197
Yes? Just one more time, one more time

556
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.073
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta
- Ah, I feel bad, I can’t do it.

557
00:34:14.157 --> 00:34:16.075
- Hey, no, Jae-yu, why are you like this?
- uh? child

558
00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.869
No, this guy

559
00:34:17.952 --> 00:34:21.289
‘Erebeta’ is so fun
It's burned down ten times.

560
00:34:21.372 --> 00:34:22.457
This, this, this

561
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.125
You're weaker than you look

562
00:34:24.209 --> 00:34:25.460
- Huh?
- You came to listen to the lecture, right?

563
00:34:26.002 --> 00:34:28.463
- No?
- Oh, come now.

564
00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:30.882
Drinks are provided for free

565
00:34:31.382 --> 00:34:32.550
Hypnosis?

566
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.429
If nosebleeds were free
Shall we drink a glass each? yes?

567
00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:38.181
What are you eating?

568
00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.516
- Come in.
- Eat, eat, eat

569
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.142
Yeah, eat it, over there.

570
00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:43.019
You can sit over there.
at the end

571
00:34:43.102 --> 00:34:45.730
Huh? You're all here, okay?

572
00:34:45.814 --> 00:34:46.940
- Shhh, shh, shh
- Okay.

573
00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:48.483
The lecture has started

574
00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:54.489
Who am I?

575
00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:58.243
He serves as the president of the Joseon Hypnotism Society.
Christian Park

576
00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:00.495
Rendezvous like this

577
00:35:00.578 --> 00:35:03.248
It's really nice to meet you.

578
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:09.671
you

579
00:35:10.088 --> 00:35:12.841
Olympic torch bearer

580
00:35:13.383 --> 00:35:15.301
In the midst of enthusiastic support

581
00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:16.845
right now

582
00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:20.390
torch painter

583
00:35:20.765 --> 00:35:23.184
It's being delivered

584
00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:36.114
Now, now, now

585
00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:41.327
As you can see, hypnosis is
It's not the same technology

586
00:35:41.411 --> 00:35:42.745
It's not magic

587
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:46.541
I came over from Europe
Psychiatry!

588
00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:51.170
Now, now, now

589
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:58.177
In a state of hypnosis

590
00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.971
Anything goes

591
00:36:00.889 --> 00:36:02.223
not me

592
00:36:02.307 --> 00:36:03.933
I also become me

593
00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:06.144
- Huh?
- That's all done well.

594
00:36:06.227 --> 00:36:07.228
Sigh, what do you know?

595
00:36:07.437 --> 00:36:09.939
Came from Europe
They say it’s a new type of medicine.

596
00:36:10.023 --> 00:36:11.024
Now

597
00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:13.109
Anyone want to try it yourself?

598
00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:14.944
Me, yes?

599
00:36:18.698 --> 00:36:21.075
These beautiful mademoiselles

600
00:36:21.492 --> 00:36:23.870
What should I transform it into?

601
00:36:30.752 --> 00:36:33.421
From now on, take your valuables with you.
Put it here!

602
00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:35.131
- What's all the fuss about?
-If you hide even one thing

603
00:36:35.214 --> 00:36:37.091
I'll pluck the branches off

604
00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:38.927
Baby, call the police

605
00:36:40.094 --> 00:36:41.930
This guy's brother is a salty guy

606
00:36:42.013 --> 00:36:43.473
- Sure, Mr.
- Mr.

607
00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:46.142
Take it as an example
Just cut off one finger.

608
00:36:46.225 --> 00:36:47.518
Oh my, these crazy bitches.

609
00:36:47.602 --> 00:36:49.062
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

610
00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:50.813
What's wrong with you, are you drunk? uh?

611
00:36:51.981 --> 00:36:53.983
- Please save me
- Uh, go in, go in.

612
00:36:54.067 --> 00:36:55.151
- Really
- Oh, they must be drunk.

613
00:36:55.234 --> 00:36:56.653
I must have been drunk, sorry, sorry

614
00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:57.904
This is our area.

615
00:36:58.863 --> 00:37:01.324
Our boss is a bitch
It's not my place to step forward

616
00:37:01.407 --> 00:37:03.409
- Is it a joke?
- Don't intervene.

617
00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:04.744
- Sure
- Huh?

618
00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:05.912
I can hit the ball and throw it away

619
00:37:05.995 --> 00:37:07.163
Hey, do you have any cigarettes?

620
00:37:07.914 --> 00:37:09.916
- You, what?
- No blood on your head, what?

621
00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:11.209
Did you see it?

622
00:37:11.292 --> 00:37:14.003
I wonder if the blood has dried or not
Did you see my head cut off?!

623
00:37:14.504 --> 00:37:16.547
Man, these guys must be crazy as a group.

624
00:37:16.631 --> 00:37:18.591
Oh, I really like these
I can't lose them all

625
00:37:18.675 --> 00:37:19.676
Hey, hurry up and call Hongju, Hongju.

626
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:21.719
- Uh, Hongju, Hongju, Hongju
- Hey, you guys just come to Hongju.

627
00:37:21.803 --> 00:37:24.472
Huh? What are you smoking?

628
00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:26.307
- Really, Mr. Lee.
- Hey, there isn't any.

629
00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:27.600
Hey, Jae-yu, Jae-yu

630
00:37:27.684 --> 00:37:29.894
- Hey, stop it, Mr.
- Re-use, re-use, re-use

631
00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:32.689
Hey, come out.

632
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:36.567
- Huh?
- Hello

633
00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:45.618
floats

634
00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:49.497
Floating, floating, floating, floating, floating, floating

635
00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:50.790
Do you levitate?

636
00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:53.876
Oh, that's strange.

637
00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:57.505
Somehow today
I'm hypnotized by this.

638
00:37:57.588 --> 00:37:58.673
Why doesn't this work?

639
00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.591
I hope

640
00:38:01.217 --> 00:38:02.552
Maybe you wrote too much?

641
00:38:04.012 --> 00:38:06.472
Anyway, this hotel.

642
00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:09.017
As you said, it’s because the land is expensive.

643
00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:11.853
It blows so loudly that it kills me

644
00:38:11.936 --> 00:38:13.980
our chairman

645
00:38:14.063 --> 00:38:17.525
You cheated and really made a profit.

646
00:38:17.608 --> 00:38:19.819
- I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
- Now, it floats, it floats.

647
00:38:19.902 --> 00:38:21.320
Now, it's floating, it's floating, it's floating, it's floating

648
00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:22.488
- It floats, it floats.
- Floating, floating, floating

649
00:38:22.572 --> 00:38:23.865
It floats, it floats

650
00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:27.910
Are you the one who played a prank on my subordinate?

651
00:38:27.994 --> 00:38:29.954
Oh my, how dare some guys do this...

652
00:38:30.038 --> 00:38:31.664
Speak, Speak

653
00:38:31.748 --> 00:38:33.666
What are you again? what?

654
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.043
Say it with words, with words

655
00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.544
I am the 4th generation reader in our family.

656
00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:37.628
Wow

657
00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:40.089
Well, I guess it's hypnosis or something, so figure it out quickly.

658
00:38:40.757 --> 00:38:43.259
Now, now

659
00:38:43.593 --> 00:38:45.303
Look at this watch carefully.

660
00:38:45.386 --> 00:38:46.554
Why?

661
00:38:46.888 --> 00:38:48.056
Are you going to hypnotize me too?

662
00:38:48.139 --> 00:38:50.475
Son of man, you are afraid of me.

663
00:38:50.558 --> 00:38:52.310
Why am I afraid of you?

664
00:38:52.393 --> 00:38:56.522
Because I lost my courage through hypnosis
3, 2, 1, bam!

665
00:38:58.149 --> 00:38:59.150
Oh, oh!

666
00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.818
Oh, oh, oh!

667
00:39:00.902 --> 00:39:02.570
Fish oil! Really, shit, shit.

668
00:39:02.653 --> 00:39:05.948
Tsk, do you think that would work on me?
release it quickly

669
00:39:10.703 --> 00:39:11.704
Hmm

670
00:39:11.996 --> 00:39:14.874
As if it was a sunny day, I went to the hotel
Even all kinds of miscellaneous merchants are struggling.

671
00:39:14.957 --> 00:39:15.958
Miscellaneous merchant?

672
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.251
There is such a thing

673
00:39:19.629 --> 00:39:20.755
Are you ready?

674
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.007
What are you here to do? Even you

675
00:39:25.426 --> 00:39:26.427
We're on the same side

676
00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:29.514
Let me help you find your treasure.

677
00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:31.224
no, you're out

678
00:39:32.725 --> 00:39:33.726
I don't want you to get hurt

679
00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:36.145
Thank you for your concern

680
00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:39.440
I told you not to tell me this or that, right?

681
00:39:42.527 --> 00:39:44.278
Anyway, how do I get the treasure?

682
00:39:44.654 --> 00:39:46.572
There is no way Yeon will give it to me obediently.

683
00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:49.325
I have a plan

684
00:39:50.993 --> 00:39:51.994
What plan?

685
00:39:54.622 --> 00:39:55.623
When the sun sets today...

686
00:40:08.636 --> 00:40:09.637
Did you hear about Muyoung?

687
00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:13.266
Tonight at this hotel
No matter what happens, don't get involved.

688
00:40:15.184 --> 00:40:16.394
Take care of your soup porridge

689
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:18.855
Can you take me too?

690
00:40:24.318 --> 00:40:25.528
Don't risk your life carelessly

691
00:40:26.988 --> 00:40:28.865
If you find someone worthy, do it then.

692
00:40:40.126 --> 00:40:41.544
Oh, I'm sorry.

693
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.740
Are you guys here to hang out?

694
00:41:10.823 --> 00:41:12.325
It was a disaster caused by excessive greed.

695
00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:13.701
Right, hmm

696
00:41:13.784 --> 00:41:14.911
That's right

697
00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:16.704
Is there anyone suspicious in the hotel?
I was trying to check...

698
00:41:17.455 --> 00:41:18.539
Hey, take off your makeup

699
00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:20.708
Erase it quickly, I don’t want to see it

700
00:41:23.127 --> 00:41:25.213
Oh, go over there and take it off, kid...

701
00:41:28.049 --> 00:41:29.050
Everyone gather around

702
00:41:32.386 --> 00:41:34.597
As expected, they gathered together aiming for the treasure.

703
00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:36.474
As well as Japanese monsters

704
00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:38.392
Hongju and Muyoung

705
00:41:39.977 --> 00:41:41.562
- What about Hongju?
- With Muyoung earlier.

706
00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:43.522
After meeting once
You didn't come out of your room.

707
00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:46.067
-What about Muyoung?
-I went out a little while ago.

708
00:41:47.568 --> 00:41:49.779
-Where?
- I don't know that.

709
00:41:50.196 --> 00:41:51.489
Japanese monsters

710
00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.783
After entering the room
No movement yet

711
00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:55.409
Uh, okay

712
00:41:55.493 --> 00:41:58.913
Our first goal is
Also known as Shinigami Mercenaries

713
00:41:58.996 --> 00:42:01.457
Fortress Gyeongseong is being devastated.

714
00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.541
These are Japanese monsters

715
00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:05.670
Hotel Room 404

716
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.340
It's been a while for me too
Would you like to relax a little?

717
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.301
no

718
00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:14.845
- I hunt alone.
- What?

719
00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:17.181
When we investigated
These are quite strong monsters.

720
00:42:17.265 --> 00:42:18.266
I can't do it alone

721
00:42:18.933 --> 00:42:21.185
Besides, just in case
Even those damn mountain gods jump in.

722
00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:24.063
Four Japanese monsters and two mountain gods
It's a 6 to 1 fight

723
00:42:25.481 --> 00:42:28.150
That's the real goal of this operation.

724
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.071
I understand.
No way, okay?

725
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.784
As you say, the mercenary group is strong.

726
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.577
One night alone

727
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:40.579
It might be too much to deal with four people.

728
00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:42.581
But what if

729
00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:46.836
Hongju and Muyoung

730
00:42:49.255 --> 00:42:50.381
What if you're on our side?

731
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:52.633
So this

732
00:42:53.092 --> 00:42:56.137
If it becomes a fight between mercenaries and mountain gods

733
00:42:56.846 --> 00:42:58.973
Like a mercenary group
These guys are obsessed with treasure.

734
00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:00.349
Cheon Mu-young is trying to kill you.

735
00:43:00.433 --> 00:43:02.435
President Hong Joo
Myoyeonggak is the top priority.

736
00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:04.437
There's no way I can openly argue with the Governor-General.

737
00:43:04.687 --> 00:43:05.855
How is that possible?

738
00:43:07.273 --> 00:43:09.233
'Cause I'm gonna make it happen

739
00:43:11.986 --> 00:43:13.112
When are you going to start?

740
00:43:13.404 --> 00:43:14.405
When Cheon Muyoung comes back

741
00:43:29.003 --> 00:43:30.629
I'll let you eat as much as you want today

742
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.562
Why are you here?

743
00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:48.439
Is your comrade dead too?

744
00:43:48.522 --> 00:43:51.567
Ah, that's, ah, it's a bit long to explain.

745
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.069
What happened to you?

746
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:54.862
that's not the problem

747
00:43:54.945 --> 00:43:56.197
Comrade Seonwoo Eunho is in danger.

748
00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:59.241
To the police chief
It seems like they are trying to force me to get married.

749
00:43:59.658 --> 00:44:01.285
Director of the Government General’s Police Department?

750
00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:03.204
He knows everything

751
00:44:05.164 --> 00:44:06.165
Shhh

752
00:44:06.248 --> 00:44:07.583
Do you know?

753
00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:08.667
It's not

754
00:44:09.377 --> 00:44:12.463
Don't hesitate and let it in.
It won't be long before the dead start pouring in.

755
00:44:12.546 --> 00:44:13.672
yes honey

756
00:44:34.068 --> 00:44:35.361
Wear this and go

757
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.029
The road that goes beyond Samdocheon

758
00:44:38.364 --> 00:44:39.407
It's very cold

759
00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.034
Who are your comrades?

760
00:44:44.078 --> 00:44:45.079
whoever i am

761
00:44:46.705 --> 00:44:48.999
The fact that we were together for Joseon

762
00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:51.335
There is no change

763
00:44:52.378 --> 00:44:54.547
I am not able to see the independence of Joseon.

764
00:44:56.173 --> 00:44:57.383
It's just pitiful

765
00:44:59.593 --> 00:45:00.719
You had a hard time

766
00:45:10.813 --> 00:45:11.814
Are you crying?

767
00:45:12.148 --> 00:45:14.692
The god who governs death
You sent a human?

768
00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:18.195
That's right

769
00:45:20.531 --> 00:45:23.409
I hope I get used to it now

770
00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:33.294
It's a tough time

771
00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:36.839
To gods and humans

772
00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:39.175
But you still fall for it

773
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.597
Yeon will do it

774
00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:46.682
What?

775
00:45:47.141 --> 00:45:49.810
Yeon? You allowed it?

776
00:45:52.146 --> 00:45:55.107
That's right
The world will turn upside down

777
00:45:56.192 --> 00:45:57.276
Still, once

778
00:45:58.319 --> 00:45:59.445
I want to walk

779
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.117
Chosun wins

780
00:46:31.894 --> 00:46:33.312
Cheon Muyoung is here

781
00:46:36.065 --> 00:46:39.860
Shinju, you go out now and come at 7 o'clock sharp.
Turn off all the hotel electricity

782
00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:40.945
Why electricity?

783
00:46:41.028 --> 00:46:42.279
Do not allow other guests to leave the room

784
00:46:43.113 --> 00:46:44.281
Innocent people shouldn't get caught up.

785
00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:45.366
yes

786
00:46:47.493 --> 00:46:48.494
What about the treasure?

787
00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:50.871
Yeah, it's here.

788
00:46:52.164 --> 00:46:55.459
I bring Ryu Hong-joo and Cheon Mu-young to room 404.
Can’t I just drag him in? you are looking for

789
00:46:56.168 --> 00:46:57.169
But

790
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.129
Don't fight them directly

791
00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:01.924
if
If you think something like that will happen...

792
00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:03.926
Okay, I'll avoid it at all costs.

793
00:47:05.261 --> 00:47:06.262
Hey

794
00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:08.764
I just want your boss’s nose to bleed

795
00:47:09.265 --> 00:47:10.349
Am I blind?

796
00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:11.934
I understand

797
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:48.679
Lee Yeon, you are in room 404.

798
00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:49.763
Heung

799
00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:16.308
Langa

800
00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:18.852
How much did you find?

801
00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:20.729
Why are you here?

802
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:22.940
Japanese monsters came to the junk shop

803
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:25.734
What? Are you hurt anywhere?

804
00:49:26.276 --> 00:49:27.277
I'm fine

805
00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:28.779
They all came here

806
00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:31.865
Because I'm worried about you, I

807
00:49:32.991 --> 00:49:34.243
you shouldn't be here

808
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.333
No way

809
00:50:04.732 --> 00:50:05.733
Guest?

810
00:50:47.608 --> 00:50:50.110
They were definitely here

811
00:50:51.153 --> 00:50:52.613
I never went out

812
00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:46.625
Among the youkai, there is one who uses illusions.

813
00:51:51.505 --> 00:51:52.756
Where are you?

814
00:51:53.882 --> 00:51:55.133
This damn guy

815
00:52:18.198 --> 00:52:21.076
Ah, in this expensive room
What's with the power outage?

816
00:52:23.453 --> 00:52:24.538
What are you talking about?

817
00:52:29.793 --> 00:52:32.754
sister
My sister goes and asks me to change the room.

818
00:52:53.191 --> 00:52:54.776
The hallway light went out

819
00:53:08.957 --> 00:53:09.958
Hey there

820
00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:11.877
Is the power out in that room too?

821
00:53:32.064 --> 00:53:34.316
- Oh, why is it so dark?
- Uh, be careful.

822
00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:35.859
be careful

823
00:53:48.538 --> 00:53:49.665
Uh, uh, Chairman.

824
00:53:55.963 --> 00:53:57.130
- What's going on?
- Shhh

825
00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:59.341
They react to sound

826
00:53:59.424 --> 00:54:00.926
What was that girl just now?

827
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.761
Yasha

828
00:54:04.262 --> 00:54:06.306
eating people
You mean a ghost?

829
00:54:06.765 --> 00:54:08.433
Oh, why is that in the hotel?

830
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.895
you guys will be okay

831
00:54:12.187 --> 00:54:13.271
until I call

832
00:54:13.897 --> 00:54:15.190
Never leave this room

833
00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:07.534
Oh, sorry.

834
00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:08.618
- Please wait a moment.
- Get out of the way

835
00:55:10.746 --> 00:55:11.747
What is that?

836
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:12.914
Are you okay?

837
00:56:00.545 --> 00:56:02.380
What on earth is that monster?

838
00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:05.634
for 15 days

839
00:56:06.051 --> 00:56:08.386
Humans who grew up eating only the blood and flesh of yakshas

840
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.808
When you are human, your memories disappear.
Just like the Yasha

841
00:56:13.642 --> 00:56:15.560
I just became a bloodthirsty monster

842
00:56:15.644 --> 00:56:17.479
Dear people
What if I sacrifice it?

843
00:56:17.813 --> 00:56:19.815
-If the old lady from the clothing group finds out...
- I take care of everything.

844
00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:22.651
You didn't know until the end

845
00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:28.406
That's the room, Yeon

846
00:57:47.068 --> 00:57:48.820
AC, where are you?

847
00:57:49.863 --> 00:57:50.864
Wow, really

848
00:57:57.746 --> 00:57:59.539
You came alone, Hongju?

849
00:58:01.625 --> 00:58:02.626
this forest

850
00:58:03.585 --> 00:58:04.586
Did you do this?

851
00:58:05.212 --> 00:58:06.213
not me

852
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:07.964
There is an uninvited guest in the hotel

853
00:58:08.048 --> 00:58:09.299
I don't know if I have time for this

854
00:58:09.925 --> 00:58:11.760
You don't even know what happened to your brother

855
00:58:13.678 --> 00:58:15.764
What did you do to her, huh?

856
00:58:16.848 --> 00:58:19.017
- I released a yaksha at the hotel.
- Yacha?

857
00:58:19.768 --> 00:58:21.102
Your younger brother must be very busy right now?

858
00:58:21.186 --> 00:58:24.189
While the guests are turning into yakshas
I met my girlfriend

859
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.194
What are you doing, what are you doing?
Has it come to this?

860
00:58:29.277 --> 00:58:30.987
Because I have nothing to protect

861
00:58:32.405 --> 00:58:34.574
I want to go out and save your brother.
hand over the treasure

862
00:58:35.575 --> 00:58:36.993
- I don't like it
- What?

863
00:58:37.577 --> 00:58:39.287
It's only half, but he's a nine-tailed fox too

864
00:58:39.371 --> 00:58:41.581
as much as you think
not that weak

865
00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:43.708
Especially when you have a woman to protect.

866
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.421
Then I can't help it

867
00:58:49.506 --> 00:58:51.049
I didn't come to fight with you.

868
00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:53.969
What do you know? Whatever the order

869
00:58:56.304 --> 00:58:57.514
Come on

870
00:59:04.145 --> 00:59:05.146
Hibarida

871
00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:06.940
It's Hibari's crying sound.

872
00:59:08.483 --> 00:59:10.318
What was it in Korean?

873
00:59:10.402 --> 00:59:11.695
Skylark, you idiot.

874
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:15.532
Of course
Pick a picture like this

875
00:59:15.865 --> 00:59:17.409
I don't know where he is

876
00:59:17.492 --> 00:59:18.910
Lee Yeon must have been caught, right?

877
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:20.745
It's the captain's illusion.

878
00:59:21.496 --> 00:59:24.874
Even if it’s a nine-tailed fox that flies and crawls
I can't escape

879
00:59:26.543 --> 00:59:28.712
Let's go and catch the nine-tailed fox

880
00:59:29.587 --> 00:59:32.090
wait until the captain comes

881
00:59:34.217 --> 00:59:36.594
that
I only have one too

882
00:59:36.678 --> 00:59:38.430
Do you want the captain to have fun alone?

883
00:59:39.139 --> 00:59:40.181
I waited all day?

884
00:59:42.684 --> 00:59:44.144
The goal is not him

885
00:59:44.644 --> 00:59:45.854
It's a treasure he has

886
00:59:46.438 --> 00:59:47.522
That precious thing

887
00:59:47.605 --> 00:59:49.024
Do I have to hand it over to the Government General?

888
00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:51.901
we have to follow orders

889
00:59:51.985 --> 00:59:53.987
I'm a treasure and I don't care

890
00:59:54.738 --> 00:59:56.406
I want to play with the nine-tailed fox!

891
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.658
Reaching the captain?

892
00:59:59.159 --> 01:00:00.160
Mr. shamelessly

893
01:00:07.334 --> 01:00:08.418
Ushiuchibo

894
01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:11.379
Where are you going?

895
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.381
I need to pee

896
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:45.705
children

897
01:00:46.664 --> 01:00:47.791
the treasure is mine

898
01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:53.088
Wow, really

899
01:00:54.506 --> 01:00:55.507
Ugh, Mr.

900
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:11.147
Hey, hey, you go over there.

901
01:01:11.648 --> 01:01:13.316
Oh, am I your subordinate?

902
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.527
- Ugh, lump of complex, mr, ugh.
- Shut up, Mr.

903
01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:25.078
Hey, I'm a little sleepy

904
01:01:29.082 --> 01:01:30.083
Hey!

905
01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.376
sorry

906
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:34.462
Hey!

907
01:01:37.882 --> 01:01:38.967
Hongjoo

908
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.885
Hongju, why, why, why?

909
01:01:40.969 --> 01:01:43.346
I have legs
Oh, I guess I broke my leg

910
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.890
Are you hurt? Where, the bridge? ankle?

911
01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:49.102
Our Muyoung has a weakness

912
01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:50.186
sorry

913
01:01:58.653 --> 01:01:59.654
Thank you

914
01:02:03.575 --> 01:02:04.701
You, Mr. Lee

915
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:11.791
Hey, hey, hey, hey! you

916
01:02:15.253 --> 01:02:17.255
Hey, whose side are you on?

917
01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:19.549
Who just hit my forehead with a rock?

918
01:02:22.093 --> 01:02:23.678
Why is the tiger cub so timid?

919
01:02:24.929 --> 01:02:26.931
Hey, bring it

920
01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:28.391
It's fun

921
01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:30.226
You really want to give it a try, huh?

922
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.563
seed

923
01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:34.647
Guys

924
01:02:35.648 --> 01:02:36.649
don't breathe

925
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:38.151
Don't play tricks

926
01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:39.777
Ah, quickly, behind you!

927
01:03:28.868 --> 01:03:31.246
Finally, one person crawled out.

928
01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:05.572
hand over the treasure

929
01:04:05.655 --> 01:04:07.407
Yeohee

930
01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:09.242
Then these
I'll save your life

931
01:04:09.576 --> 01:04:10.577
you won't die

932
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.161
I won't let you do that

933
01:04:12.245 --> 01:04:13.496
After receiving the guy's call
The mercenaries will come

934
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.039
I'll be the bait

935
01:04:15.123 --> 01:04:16.165
It's my heart

936
01:04:16.249 --> 01:04:17.834
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

937
01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:19.127
pistil of iris flower

938
01:04:19.586 --> 01:04:20.587
That works?

939
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:21.671
It's in the hotel restaurant.

940
01:04:22.213 --> 01:04:23.506
Now, here too,

941
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.591
I'm shaking it

942
01:04:24.674 --> 01:04:26.551
Strangely, I have a bad feeling

943
01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.429
- Are you the boss?
- I like you.

944
01:04:30.138 --> 01:04:31.931
- What?
- can change body

945
01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:33.725
It means youkai

946
01:04:33.808 --> 01:04:35.018
Got it

947
01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:37.604
Joseon’s mountain gods, etc.
It's nothing
