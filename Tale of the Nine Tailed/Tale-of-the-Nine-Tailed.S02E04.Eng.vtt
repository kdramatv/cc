﻿1
00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:07.756
Why can't Rang wake up? huh?

2
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.133
Does it hurt a lot? It doesn't hurt at all

3
00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:12.385
When I see it, you're awake now, huh?

4
00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.346
You're pretending to sleep because you're embarrassed.

5
00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.348
I'm pretending to sleep because I'm embarrassed.

6
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.559
I'll get some ice water.

7
00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:21.311
Oh my, it must be heavy.

8
00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:23.104
- It's okay.
- Wow

9
00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:24.481
You've been through a lot, huh?

10
00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:32.405
Hey, hey, hey, wake up
Wake up, ah, quickly, quickly

11
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:34.825
Mr. Lee, aren’t you waking up?

12
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:36.785
Ah, I even practiced my lines.
This is really

13
00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:38.620
- Let's go to the rehearsal, okay?
- Is that so?

14
00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:42.082
what?
The other person is a mermaid?

15
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:47.003
Huh, from the prestigious nine-tailed fox family.
The other person is seafood, does that make sense?

16
00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:50.882
Again, it starts again
As soon as you open your mouth, you say, ‘My family.’

17
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:54.135
Produced as one of the four great mountain gods
A prestigious family, blah blah blah, always!

18
00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.137
You bastard, how did I raise you?

19
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.597
This bastard, huh?

20
00:01:58.098 --> 00:01:59.307
Where are you rebelling, you bastard!

21
00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:04.062
we just
Brother, can’t you let me love you?

22
00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:05.856
This bastard, huh?

23
00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:08.149
- How did I raise you?
- Wow

24
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:10.151
You both get out, get out!

25
00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.444
Okay, okay, okay

26
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:12.904
Come and see

27
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.451
Are you awake?

28
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.624
As you can see, it's fine.

29
00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:30.964
Do you still have a slight fever?

30
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:34.593
Don't touch me

31
00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:37.762
What was the purpose of jumping into the well?

32
00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.556
you were dying

33
00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.559
I ended up with useless debt

34
00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.686
In times like that, I just say thank you.

35
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.898
A fox has to repay the favor whether he likes it or not.

36
00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.691
Especially when it comes to life

37
00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:51.860
What do you want?

38
00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:54.029
Well, I

39
00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:59.743
I want to love

40
00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:03.455
It was quite natural.

41
00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:05.832
Because it's half

42
00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:09.210
Both humans and monsters
Even my dark history that I always criticized

43
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.670
This is the end

44
00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:13.590
Finally me too
True love...

45
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:14.799
I'm out of my mind

46
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:16.009
Is this not working?

47
00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.385
Do I look like a matchmaker?

48
00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.179
I couldn't even understand what was being said

49
00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.722
Just tell me who you want to kill

50
00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:22.015
Because I might blow up a village.

51
00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:23.808
Oh, that's enough

52
00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.271
Then will you grant my wish?

53
00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:29.648
wish?

54
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.442
About seven little things?

55
00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:41.868
Are you crying?

56
00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:45.997
Thrown in 1938
You've been through so much trouble.

57
00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:50.627
But I hope you come here for the first time
I think you did well.

58
00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:52.545
I see you like this too

59
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:54.130
A

60
00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:56.675
That's right

61
00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.929
Rangi is alive and having a normal relationship.

62
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.305
start a family

63
00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:06.476
Living normally
I've wanted it so many times

64
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.228
The problem is

65
00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:12.023
The parties involved are not in a relationship.
I have never held a woman's hand

66
00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:13.108
I was born solo.

67
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.734
Well, is there any way?

68
00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:15.819
Well, first of all, I

69
00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:17.988
By fortune telling on the name
Let’s look at the compatibility scores between the two.

70
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.781
Boy, none of that is right.

71
00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:21.157
The name divination is science

72
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:22.993
Me and my honey got 99 points

73
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.161
Hey, but why do me and Jia get 25 points?

74
00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:27.956
Hehe, this couple too

75
00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.332
I only got 23 points

76
00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:30.625
Look, Mr.

77
00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:31.793
IC

78
00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:33.878
IC, tsk.

79
00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:36.256
I miss our Jia too

80
00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:37.632
Are you worried?

81
00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.676
The elder Hyeonuiong is watching over you, right?

82
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.512
before coming
There was a rainy season forecast in Seoul.

83
00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:45.890
Our Jia

84
00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:48.435
I always lose my umbrella

85
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.440
alone without me
I don't know if it's raining or not

86
00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.192
Huh?

87
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.111
huh? What a cuckoo?

88
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.030
I know the cuckoo

89
00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:06.244
cuckoo

90
00:05:06.327 --> 00:05:07.412
What are you doing there?

91
00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:08.496
- Oh my...
- Huh?

92
00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:11.916
Hello, my boss and brother.

93
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.877
You leave the gate
Does it really have to appear like this?

94
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.464
‘The magic bandits are known as
'I'm not going through this gate.'

95
00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:19.257
- Our boss said...
- Wow

96
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.508
Come down quickly, come down, come down

97
00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:24.888
Hey, so did you do any research?

98
00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:27.098
So, this

99
00:05:27.182 --> 00:05:29.225
to our kids
I turned it around

100
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:30.435
Then?

101
00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:32.979
Behind Chosun Bank

102
00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:34.647
There is a cultural mansion.

103
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:37.859
Became rich through gold mining
It's the house of a guy named Park Ga.

104
00:05:44.157 --> 00:05:45.742
Hongbaektal commits robbery?

105
00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:48.119
Do you know the 7 largest gold mining conglomerates in Gyeongseong?

106
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.124
Just target those people
I've already robbed six houses.

107
00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.543
What was stolen?

108
00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:57.462
That's strange

109
00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:00.799
Money, gold bars, something, land documents
Leave all these precious things behind

110
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:02.300
They say he only took the trash box with him.

111
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.053
Refuse?

112
00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:16.439
Not here either?

113
00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:29.410
- Oh my, oh my.
- gold, gold

114
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:30.662
It's gold!

115
00:06:44.592 --> 00:06:46.803
This is the so-called ‘King of Gold Mines’.

116
00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:48.138
This is Seonwoo-chan’s house.

117
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.722
Who is the landlord?

118
00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:50.890
Business trip to Gyeonggi-do

119
00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:53.560
Currently, only my wife and daughter are at home.
It is assumed that there is

120
00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:54.894
Yeah, that's great.

121
00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:57.355
You go in and steal some trash.

122
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.274
Me?

123
00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:01.901
For the rest of my life, I only wear other people’s panties
This guy has never stolen anything?

124
00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:04.279
So do I do it? huh?

125
00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.739
I am a former mountain god by name.

126
00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:10.243
Go into that house and steal the treasure chest.

127
00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.162
Does that make sense? uh?

128
00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:14.038
Ah, I hate it

129
00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.416
Just lurked
If the red and white masks come, hit them.

130
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.501
I will wear a red and white mask and have things.

131
00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.586
Go quickly and come back

132
00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.921
Oh, well
If you're always at a disadvantage, they say you're a former mountain god.

133
00:07:22.672 --> 00:07:23.673
Ugh

134
00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:39.063
Well, there's no one there, so just keep going.

135
00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:40.273
I...

136
00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:43.902
Huh? Ah, oh, anyways
I watched too many movies

137
00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:20.355
Put both hands above your head

138
00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:22.941
Just turn around

139
00:08:27.654 --> 00:08:29.364
That's not it, yeah

140
00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:31.532
Honey!

141
00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:34.494
Mr. Yuri? Are you looking for me?

142
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:37.080
Don't make a fuss

143
00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:38.331
It hurts

144
00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:41.376
I even suffered from domestic violence myself.
You missed me

145
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:42.669
What does this look like?

146
00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:43.920
this?

147
00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:46.422
the beginning of our love

148
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:51.261
When we first met, he was like this
You threatened me with a gun, like this

149
00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:52.345
Just give me a kiss here

150
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.474
Yuri, please hug me just once.

151
00:09:01.062 --> 00:09:02.689
There was a robber in my house
Do you think this is your first time?

152
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:04.524
you are thirty-sixth

153
00:09:05.316 --> 00:09:06.442
Isn't it Mr. Yuri?

154
00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.027
My name is Seonwoo Eunho.

155
00:09:09.153 --> 00:09:12.407
The woman who made a hole in your body
Know your name in order

156
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:14.367
I'm sorry

157
00:09:16.953 --> 00:09:18.746
Are you sorry? what?

158
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.749
I’m doing this because I like it too

159
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:22.875
It's not really!

160
00:09:58.453 --> 00:09:59.454
let's go

161
00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:03.124
You can run like that even after being shot?

162
00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:17.430
Hongjoo

163
00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:19.766
It blooms only in the boiling hell of fire.
It's a fever

164
00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:22.560
Ah

165
00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:24.437
My body got warmer

166
00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:28.066
There is only Grandfather Hyeonuiong, really.

167
00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:30.693
Ugh, the kid who likes knitting so much

168
00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:33.321
Why do you keep making yourself
Are you punishing and harassing me?

169
00:10:35.406 --> 00:10:37.325
I feel like that's the only way I'm alive.

170
00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.577
Are you still having trouble sleeping these days?

171
00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:41.704
Are you dreaming of your younger brothers?

172
00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:42.955
them

173
00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:46.667
Even in my dreams, only I am waiting

174
00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:50.380
I am also in the mouths of my dead brothers.
Boil the raw rice and salt it.

175
00:10:51.422 --> 00:10:53.007
I never abandoned you

176
00:10:57.011 --> 00:10:58.721
Even if I die soon, I want to tell you that.

177
00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:03.518
I'm always too late

178
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.106
Even we who are called gods

179
00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:11.401
Everyone has someone
I live by letting go

180
00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:13.569
I lost my son too

181
00:11:15.363 --> 00:11:17.115
I endured it while raising you guys, I

182
00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:21.285
Yeon, Muyoung and you

183
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.875
Grandfather says that if Yeon and Muyoung fight,
Who will you side with?

184
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:33.256
Well, it's really difficult.

185
00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:35.633
I liked Yeon from the beginning, right?

186
00:11:35.842 --> 00:11:37.677
But I can’t abandon Muyoung again.

187
00:11:38.302 --> 00:11:39.512
wounds on his body

188
00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:42.473
They all got hurt on my behalf.

189
00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:48.688
They were really good kids

190
00:11:49.647 --> 00:11:50.940
But why?

191
00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.152
They both

192
00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:59.449
I don't think they're the guys I used to know.

193
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:07.415
Hey, come quickly

194
00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:10.334
In that house

195
00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.170
There's a girl who looks just like Yuri.

196
00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:13.754
Oh, that reporter from Sunwoo Ilbo? I saw it too

197
00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:15.840
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Hey, is that her house?

198
00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:17.091
- How do I know?
- Mr. Lee, what about the red and white mask?

199
00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:19.218
He was here earlier.

200
00:12:20.845 --> 00:12:21.846
IC

201
00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:41.365
Do you have good strength?

202
00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:53.920
Is the balance good?

203
00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:18.569
But I guess you don’t have much experience in hand-to-hand combat?

204
00:13:19.487 --> 00:13:21.239
IC

205
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.992
Why? Well, do you have any other talents?

206
00:13:28.412 --> 00:13:29.830
IC

207
00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:39.924
Oh, let's take a look at my stalker's face, okay?

208
00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:50.059
Ai, is this monster using memorization?

209
00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:56.023
hey!

210
00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:09.996
You must have tried to kill me twice?

211
00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:13.207
My brother did very well today
'Cause you caught me

212
00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:23.968
Get it!

213
00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:26.846
There is no way to go that way!

214
00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:32.935
boss!

215
00:15:29.617 --> 00:15:30.660
What are you guys?

216
00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:32.203
With the gold he gave me

217
00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:34.538
I bought enough food for the whole village.

218
00:15:34.622 --> 00:15:35.706
Well done

219
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.541
- Wow, Mr.
- It's a human shield.

220
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:39.168
What on earth is that kid?

221
00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:40.961
He went this far
Is it something that should be shrouded in mystery?

222
00:15:41.337 --> 00:15:42.588
Take off the mask, whatever.

223
00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:45.007
Ugh, it's no use.
He's not here anymore

224
00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:46.467
What about things?

225
00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:55.893
It's shit

226
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.731
I'll go find it soon, Lee Yeon

227
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:10.449
Like this

228
00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:12.243
Huh?

229
00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:24.088
This is a genuine product that is quite valuable.

230
00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:26.716
Yes, it's a gem

231
00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.969
Oh, what the heck is that kid?
What were you looking for?

232
00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:31.178
Wait a minute

233
00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:33.806
last one

234
00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:36.600
Oh, where are you getting it from?

235
00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:51.699
what's this?

236
00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:54.910
uh? Uh, sir, is this really gold?

237
00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:56.203
Is it really gold?

238
00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:58.164
What, is it good?

239
00:16:58.247 --> 00:17:00.332
Ah, why, there’s that legend, right?

240
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.419
‘He who finds gold, raises the dead,
'I will make a name for myself'

241
00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:05.838
With this
If you measure the length and width of a corpse,

242
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:08.174
Even the dead come back to life
That's the treasure, yeah

243
00:17:08.257 --> 00:17:10.092
No, such a precious treasure.
Why are you stuck here?

244
00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:13.095
Ah, well, what is it used for?
You didn't know, well

245
00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:14.722
Uh, there was a rumor a few years ago.

246
00:17:15.181 --> 00:17:17.767
In a gold mine in the north
They said they found the king of Silla’s golden chest.

247
00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:20.436
Ha, I thought it was a rumor.

248
00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:23.856
It is a treasure that revives the dead...

249
00:17:24.732 --> 00:17:27.818
Who is Red and White Mask trying to save?

250
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.706
It's been a while

251
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:42.750
Grandmother

252
00:17:44.627 --> 00:17:46.170
Did I show up too quickly?

253
00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:49.632
Cheon Mu-young goes on a rampage
I tried to watch more

254
00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:53.385
It's been a while since I've seen the real thing, so I'll just use it as an excuse

255
00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:54.887
Aren’t you even giving me a cup of tea?

256
00:17:56.722 --> 00:17:58.182
What kind of person is the old lady?

257
00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:01.852
Growing up in my grandmother's hands and dying in my grandmother's hands

258
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.938
I was a little confused

259
00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:09.276
Am I not a typical bureaucrat?

260
00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:16.075
I raised you guys because I needed it.
removed when necessary

261
00:18:16.158 --> 00:18:17.701
I like it because it’s simple and clear.

262
00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:20.955
Thanks to you, no matter what I do
I think I'll feel at ease

263
00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:23.123
I'm here to make you uncomfortable, you idiot.

264
00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:35.636
The reason I leave you alone
There is only one

265
00:18:37.263 --> 00:18:38.430
I couldn't find the answer

266
00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.933
The guy that the old lady made out of stone
How did you come back alive?

267
00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:44.979
Who dares to rule over
Shaking the boundary between this world and the afterlife

268
00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:50.442
Our Muyoung has changed a lot

269
00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:54.530
Open both eyes straight
I know how to attack me

270
00:18:54.822 --> 00:18:55.865
you

271
00:18:57.658 --> 00:18:58.742
You abandoned me

272
00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:05.249
The guy who decided to play a villain

273
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:10.212
Such a hurt face
Is it okay if I do it?

274
00:19:13.007 --> 00:19:14.341
So

275
00:19:18.012 --> 00:19:19.597
You needed a mask.

276
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.975
Why did you come to this era?

277
00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.227
For what?

278
00:19:28.939 --> 00:19:30.232
Bring my brother back to life

279
00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:34.820
I lost it to you and Lee Yeon
To get everything back

280
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:38.699
To do something bad

281
00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:41.785
Eat well and go

282
00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:52.087
My body isn't perfect yet.

283
00:19:58.302 --> 00:19:59.386
you will regret it

284
00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:03.307
At this place today
You didn't kill me, you saved me

285
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.499
As you said
I looked into Lee Yeon’s whereabouts.

286
00:20:28.582 --> 00:20:31.293
A strange sighting in Gunsan
One came out

287
00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:36.048
Yeah?

288
00:20:37.257 --> 00:20:38.258
Okay

289
00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:53.273
You worked hard

290
00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.984
What are you going to do if grandma sees it?

291
00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:56.360
We already met

292
00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:57.903
Ta-da

293
00:20:58.862 --> 00:20:59.947
Now, tofu

294
00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:02.616
Chi

295
00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:17.131
Even now it feels like a dream

296
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.341
Having you Hongju next to me

297
00:21:22.344 --> 00:21:23.429
Can I be honest?

298
00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:24.513
huh?

299
00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:26.390
I'm unfamiliar with you

300
00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:31.270
I think it's the Muyoung I know.
I don't think so

301
00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:34.440
What kind of person is the Cheon Muyoung you know?

302
00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:39.820
You wanted to be a congressman, not a mountain god.

303
00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:42.948
Even a single living, breathing blade of grass
Because I saved it

304
00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:45.451
When you got hurt, you stood up

305
00:21:45.784 --> 00:21:49.663
If Yeon and I get hurt
I used to cry sadly

306
00:21:51.331 --> 00:21:52.374
Now I

307
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.086
What does it look like?

308
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.379
I can't see you

309
00:21:58.338 --> 00:21:59.631
Even though we're this close

310
00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:02.634
I don't know who you are

311
00:22:05.345 --> 00:22:06.472
Something like a mountain spirit

312
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:10.851
I shouldn't have done it

313
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:13.062
just

314
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.189
I'll just be by your side as Cheon Muyoung

315
00:22:17.274 --> 00:22:19.526
At some point, the dream you all dream
It was my dream

316
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.278
Are you planning to kill Yeon?

317
00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:22.571
then?

318
00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:25.741
Are you going to kill me?

319
00:22:31.914 --> 00:22:34.124
you guys already
You guys dragged me into a dog fight.

320
00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.461
I'm the one who just quietly watches
That's not true

321
00:22:38.378 --> 00:22:39.421
You know better than anyone else, right?

322
00:23:10.077 --> 00:23:11.286
Hey, what is it?

323
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:13.288
They say if you measure it horizontally and vertically, it will come back to life?

324
00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:14.915
Is this a rare treasure? uh?

325
00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:17.376
Let's see if there's a separate manual, okay?

326
00:23:17.835 --> 00:23:20.587
If the guardian stone of Samdocheon leaves its place,
It's just a rock.

327
00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:25.467
Yeah, now that I think about it

328
00:23:26.426 --> 00:23:27.970
This is how it started, huh?

329
00:23:29.138 --> 00:23:30.681
Stones that create a barrier

330
00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.559
A treasure that awakens the dead

331
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.644
What were you doing?

332
00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:36.937
This is a gold chuck.

333
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.897
Since the Japanese colonial period
never been seen

334
00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:41.608
Since then
It's something that has disappeared from the world.

335
00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:43.735
So you time traveled

336
00:23:46.488 --> 00:23:48.031
Let's wait and see

337
00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:50.075
Yes?

338
00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:51.660
I'll come back for you, man

339
00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:01.461
What is it? Why are you suddenly saying this?

340
00:24:02.004 --> 00:24:04.131
That mermaid lady
He asked me to ride a horse.

341
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.385
Oh my, from the first date
Isn’t the progress too fast?

342
00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:09.845
Oh, hug me from behind like this

343
00:24:09.928 --> 00:24:12.264
Oh my, oh my, baby, so fast

344
00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:15.267
Don't worry about road traffic laws
I can't stop my passion

345
00:24:16.643 --> 00:24:17.811
So hot, your tits

346
00:24:18.187 --> 00:24:19.188
What are you babbling about?

347
00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:20.898
I'll show you the passion of a magic bandit leader.

348
00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:22.774
Hing, clang, clang, clang

349
00:24:24.776 --> 00:24:25.819
Should I kill him?

350
00:24:25.903 --> 00:24:26.987
Let's run away

351
00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:56.892
handsome, you

352
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.518
What is his name?

353
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.020
Uh, Lee Yeon

354
00:25:00.646 --> 00:25:01.688
Is that your brother’s name?

355
00:25:02.522 --> 00:25:03.732
Because he rides rough

356
00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:06.276
But why?

357
00:25:07.194 --> 00:25:09.571
Because my legs are originally tails

358
00:25:09.655 --> 00:25:11.073
I can't walk or run for long periods of time.

359
00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:13.742
It was a wish

360
00:25:14.952 --> 00:25:17.746
free on horseback
Running through the fields

361
00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:20.958
No, if you want to enjoy the speed
How about taking a car?

362
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:23.335
No, it has to be

363
00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:28.173
Physical contact is essential when riding a horse.

364
00:25:29.007 --> 00:25:32.344
The body temperature you feel behind your back is
It makes a man's heart flutter

365
00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:36.890
We inevitably fall in love today

366
00:25:38.392 --> 00:25:40.102
Do not place your center of gravity forward

367
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.437
I told you to maintain your posture, maintain your posture, right?

368
00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:43.522
posture?

369
00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:45.440
Head, shoulders, and hips
Exact date!

370
00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:46.608
Date, ah!

371
00:25:46.692 --> 00:25:48.777
with a strange sound
do not provoke speech

372
00:25:48.986 --> 00:25:50.362
Because animals have sensitive ears

373
00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:53.198
Hey, my legs hurt so much.

374
00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:55.575
Are your thighs trembling?

375
00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:57.828
Now, imagine

376
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.122
Now across from me
The enemy is coming for your head

377
00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:01.623
Is it time to talk so leisurely?

378
00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:04.835
Are we in a battle setting?

379
00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:12.801
Don't be afraid, be strong

380
00:26:14.553 --> 00:26:15.637
center of gravity behind

381
00:26:48.628 --> 00:26:49.755
You're quite talented, aren't you?

382
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.631
really?

383
00:26:52.341 --> 00:26:54.760
Do you want to join our magic bandit?

384
00:26:54.843 --> 00:26:56.219
I'd make a pretty good fighter

385
00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:03.518
Boy, really

386
00:27:03.602 --> 00:27:05.645
Are you missing that already? A

387
00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:06.813
Chi

388
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.733
No, what the heck are these
Where are you going to ride the horse?

389
00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:10.942
- uh?
- It's me

390
00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:13.153
Well, every time we go on a date
Are you going to follow me?

391
00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:14.446
You must be doing well

392
00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:21.036
his wedding

393
00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:22.496
Well, wouldn’t it be better to do it at a hotel?

394
00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:24.456
Well, wouldn’t a small wedding be better?

395
00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.625
What are you talking about? I'll do my best at everything

396
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:30.295
Ceremony hall and Sudmedo
The singer also sings the congratulatory song very loudly.

397
00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:32.130
- Let me sit alone too!
- Yeah, yeah.

398
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.387
What is it?

399
00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:43.058
- huh?
-Oh my god

400
00:27:45.352 --> 00:27:47.437
- Baby
-I'm alive.

401
00:27:49.064 --> 00:27:51.149
Yes, Dunga, Dunga, Dunga

402
00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:54.277
Dunga, Dunga, Dunga, Dunga

403
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:56.405
Such a pretty baby
Who abandoned you?

404
00:27:56.613 --> 00:27:59.449
This swaddling cloth is made of the finest silk and gold silk.

405
00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:01.076
It's a baby at home.

406
00:28:01.743 --> 00:28:03.662
Just by looking at it, he is the child of a concubine!

407
00:28:03.954 --> 00:28:07.040
Because it's a girl
Maybe it was abandoned? like me

408
00:28:07.124 --> 00:28:09.126
It must be the result of Western-style free love.

409
00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:10.961
Ah, it's a trend these days, huh?

410
00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:13.171
Now, now, now

411
00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:15.549
I'm not curious at all
I listened carefully to your opinions

412
00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:17.884
So what are you going to do?
Are you guys going to raise it?

413
00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:21.638
This is definitely a gisaeng house.
If the boss knows, I'm going to hit him.

414
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:23.390
Did you hear?

415
00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:25.142
Quickly put it back in its place

416
00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:27.018
No, it's not possible.

417
00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:28.103
What is that?

418
00:28:28.687 --> 00:28:30.480
It means ‘a child who brings good luck’.

419
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.774
The child abandoned in front of the house
Because it's a piece of luck

420
00:28:32.858 --> 00:28:35.110
Accepting it without throwing it away
It's our custom.

421
00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:36.194
Did you hear?

422
00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:38.572
I will take care of you until you find your parents.

423
00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:40.365
Hey!

424
00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:53.170
Do you want to eat?

425
00:29:07.225 --> 00:29:08.226
how is it?

426
00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:10.395
Yeah, it's worth eating.

427
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.564
What food do you like?

428
00:29:13.064 --> 00:29:15.192
I can't really tell

429
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:17.861
If I had to choose, it would be cold noodles.

430
00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:20.739
What is your ideal type?

431
00:29:21.406 --> 00:29:22.991
Ideal type?

432
00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:28.747
So, like your favorite food
The person you like

433
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:32.626
Ah, if that's the case, he's stronger than me.

434
00:29:35.253 --> 00:29:37.631
Let's somehow find something in common

435
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.133
What are your hobbies?

436
00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:42.511
Is this a robbery these days?

437
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:48.099
Why are you doing this?

438
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.477
I think Lee Yeon will hate it

439
00:29:52.521 --> 00:29:54.981
Your relationship with me is more complicated than it looks, bro.

440
00:29:55.357 --> 00:29:57.400
I've never even seen the face of my father.

441
00:29:58.777 --> 00:30:02.489
My human mother called me a monster

442
00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:05.200
Lee Yeon was my only family

443
00:30:05.575 --> 00:30:08.954
I was captivated by a human woman
They threw me away like trash

444
00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:11.331
But you still have family by your side

445
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:16.002
What about your parents?

446
00:30:17.629 --> 00:30:19.089
No, why don't you go back to the sea?

447
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.799
You can live as a mermaid

448
00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:25.887
I like Gyeongseong
I like singing on stage

449
00:30:28.014 --> 00:30:30.058
The twinkling lights of the club

450
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:32.644
-The voices of people chattering...
- Don't be mistaken.

451
00:30:34.229 --> 00:30:36.147
It's like a place for a half monster to live.

452
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.483
not on this earth

453
00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:42.904
Going

454
00:31:22.527 --> 00:31:25.113
I’m even raising this right now
Are you going to die so hard?

455
00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:27.032
I actually hate human children

456
00:31:27.115 --> 00:31:30.076
Lie, how much is our Suo?
I followed you

457
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.161
Who is Suo?

458
00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:32.287
Okay, okay, that's it.

459
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.164
You quickly put it in the baby box.

460
00:31:34.456 --> 00:31:35.832
There’s nothing like that here, right?

461
00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:37.626
I made my kids do it
How about selling it?

462
00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:39.002
- A
- very in pairs

463
00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.545
These guys are going to be in big trouble.

464
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:42.297
He doesn't even look human at all.

465
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.506
Are we human?

466
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.343
No, that's not mamma

467
00:31:46.426 --> 00:31:49.095
you mean
I told you to lift weights, huh?

468
00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:51.181
hungry? Mamma?

469
00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:52.682
Tskcha

470
00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:54.809
I'll take the baby formula and
I'll buy some diapers

471
00:31:54.893 --> 00:31:55.894
Huh?

472
00:31:55.977 --> 00:31:57.812
Hey, let's go together

473
00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.023
I'm in town too, yeah
I have some urgent business to do over there.

474
00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:02.025
Oh, do you want to die?

475
00:32:02.108 --> 00:32:03.443
I'll be back soon

476
00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:05.195
Mamma

477
00:32:05.654 --> 00:32:06.780
Mr.

478
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.282
Hey, yo, yo, uh, uh, what should I do?

479
00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:10.992
Let's get rid of it without a word.

480
00:32:11.284 --> 00:32:12.410
That's not possible

481
00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:16.915
How about losing it naturally?

482
00:32:27.384 --> 00:32:30.553
I'm sorry it happened like this
This is all for you, huh?

483
00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:32.681
Meet good parents and grow up healthy

484
00:32:32.764 --> 00:32:34.140
Okay, okay, okay, uh

485
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:41.106
Huh?

486
00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:44.901
Wow, is this a snake strawberry?
Hong-joo is crazy.

487
00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:48.154
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay, just a little bit.

488
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.115
Why is he here?

489
00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:51.783
Did he come to visit?

490
00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.910
I can't even walk yet, so...

491
00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:55.787
- What kind of guy is this, Mr.
- child

492
00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:58.707
- Quickly before the Nine Gods come.
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, hey.

493
00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.251
fish oil, seeds

494
00:33:04.587 --> 00:33:05.922
Have a good life, okay?

495
00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:17.392
IC

496
00:33:32.157 --> 00:33:33.199
Hey

497
00:33:34.993 --> 00:33:36.745
Oh, hey, tell me

498
00:33:36.828 --> 00:33:38.455
How on earth did you come back? huh?

499
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:40.999
Is this person?

500
00:33:42.041 --> 00:33:43.334
Isn’t this a disguised monster?

501
00:33:43.418 --> 00:33:45.628
Uh, ah, really...

502
00:33:47.297 --> 00:33:48.673
Lee Yeon was an opiate addict?

503
00:33:49.382 --> 00:33:51.176
Yes, he was a complete wreck.

504
00:33:51.426 --> 00:33:53.344
In Gunsan
There was no monster I didn’t know.

505
00:33:53.845 --> 00:33:54.929
Have you seen it?

506
00:33:55.263 --> 00:33:56.347
You don’t even smoke.

507
00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:59.100
- Did you just quit?
- Wow, that can't be possible.

508
00:33:59.184 --> 00:34:01.895
A guy named Shinju came and brought it to me not long ago.
I went looking for some new opium.

509
00:34:02.604 --> 00:34:04.773
You were also victimized by Lee Yeon, right?

510
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:08.359
Well, it's not like I was harmed...

511
00:34:08.443 --> 00:34:09.527
This time we

512
00:34:09.611 --> 00:34:11.863
I created a group for victims of Lee Yeon.

513
00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:14.115
Uh, we meet three times a week.

514
00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:15.742
I also do psychological therapy.

515
00:34:15.825 --> 00:34:17.285
Those who were hit by Lee Yeon

516
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.871
Good for bruising and swelling
I also give you pumpkin juice.

517
00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:21.706
Was it right?

518
00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:24.918
yes

519
00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:28.046
I just said I don’t like this name.

520
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:30.340
Like this, like this
Like this, like this

521
00:34:30.715 --> 00:34:31.716
What's your name?

522
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.511
- It's an embryonic sound.
- 'Ahm'

523
00:34:35.512 --> 00:34:36.805
Lee Yeon's girlfriend's name

524
00:34:37.472 --> 00:34:40.058
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

525
00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:46.397
in the world
Is this the name you hate the most?

526
00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:48.233
So

527
00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:51.236
Where was the last time you saw Lee Yeon?

528
00:34:56.074 --> 00:34:58.409
Lee Yeon took the train to Manchuria?

529
00:34:59.577 --> 00:35:00.995
I guess it got off at Gyeongseong?

530
00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:04.123
It roughly coincides with the time I left Gunsan.

531
00:35:06.084 --> 00:35:07.168
Jaeyuya

532
00:35:08.169 --> 00:35:09.546
Go get some opium.

533
00:35:14.384 --> 00:35:15.885
What is it?

534
00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:18.972
this spot on the forehead

535
00:35:20.974 --> 00:35:22.016
It's the Big Dipper

536
00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:23.768
So?

537
00:35:23.977 --> 00:35:25.562
It's a star that rules death

538
00:35:25.895 --> 00:35:27.605
It is also the star that governs wealth.

539
00:35:27.689 --> 00:35:30.400
Bitter, ayu, I guess I'm anxious, yeah

540
00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.819
Even if I throw it away
It's the same thing that keeps coming back

541
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.282
Yes, yes, why, why are you crying?

542
00:35:37.615 --> 00:35:38.658
I don't know, I don't know

543
00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:40.535
Don't cry, stop, okay?

544
00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:42.203
You little human being

545
00:35:42.412 --> 00:35:43.955
If you want something, tell me straight

546
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.583
Ugh, does that make you speechless?

547
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.251
Anyway, you too

548
00:35:49.002 --> 00:35:50.378
eh, eh, eh

549
00:35:50.879 --> 00:35:52.839
Hey, don't cry, I'll give you this, okay?

550
00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:54.299
Stop crying

551
00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:57.844
- Let’s hit him and knock him out.
- child

552
00:36:00.388 --> 00:36:02.473
And then the kid dies

553
00:36:02.932 --> 00:36:06.019
Hey, over there, well, over there
No opium or sleeping pills or anything like that, huh?

554
00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:08.271
uh? stopped

555
00:36:08.563 --> 00:36:09.564
Huh?

556
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.322
Keep holding it

557
00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:21.993
Oh my, my

558
00:36:23.745 --> 00:36:25.121
Huh? Hey, hey, hey

559
00:36:25.413 --> 00:36:27.081
Boy, boy is it wet

560
00:36:27.332 --> 00:36:28.374
I guess it was cheap

561
00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:30.126
- Oh, it's dirty.
- You know I have tuberculosis.

562
00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:31.419
Oh, you guys brought it here.

563
00:36:31.669 --> 00:36:32.754
I'm not

564
00:36:33.588 --> 00:36:35.757
Let's make a bet, let's bet on single-minded parenting.

565
00:36:38.843 --> 00:36:41.220
There are only two of you left.
I have four left, huh?

566
00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:46.976
It's not over yet

567
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.978
No, no!

568
00:36:53.775 --> 00:36:55.318
30 minutes, measure accurately!

569
00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:04.535
I have something to tell you

570
00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:07.664
I hate humans the most in the world

571
00:37:08.414 --> 00:37:11.501
can't do anything on its own
Inferior humans especially

572
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:16.422
It's no use pretending to be pitiful

573
00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:25.014
Don't cry, I'll eat you up

574
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.184
What's funny?

575
00:37:29.686 --> 00:37:30.937
Are you laughing at me?

576
00:37:34.148 --> 00:37:35.441
Ah, the view...

577
00:37:43.116 --> 00:37:44.158
Why is it so quiet?

578
00:37:50.415 --> 00:37:51.457
How did you sleep?

579
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.376
It's no big deal

580
00:37:56.546 --> 00:37:58.506
- What is that? You, Mr. Lee
- Oh, it's nothing.

581
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:59.632
- you
-No...

582
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.429
What should I do if I feed my child makgeolli? huh?

583
00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:06.305
fish oil, seeds

584
00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:09.600
emergency, emergency, emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency!

585
00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:11.561
Ah, why are you making a fuss again?

586
00:38:11.644 --> 00:38:12.854
Boss comeback!

587
00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:13.980
What, Hongju?

588
00:38:14.313 --> 00:38:15.314
Let’s take a look at Lee Yeon.

589
00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:17.567
Lee Rang, quickly take the child and escape!
Quickly, quickly, quickly

590
00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.651
Why?

591
00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:20.570
Hey, if we get caught, we'll all be kicked out!

592
00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:21.988
Oh, really, Mr.

593
00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:23.614
Ah, go, go, go

594
00:38:24.157 --> 00:38:25.199
- Ugh
- here

595
00:38:31.873 --> 00:38:34.459
About me
He is scarier than the red and white mask.

596
00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:35.710
Don't make enemies

597
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.003
What should I do?

598
00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:38.921
If you even pretend to like it
Can't you?

599
00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:40.006
No way

600
00:38:40.089 --> 00:38:41.507
Why? Is it just acting?

601
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:43.634
Because I know Hong Joo is sincere.

602
00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:47.972
Even if you turn him into an enemy
I don't want to cheat

603
00:38:48.306 --> 00:38:49.348
You're friends

604
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.311
True

605
00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:55.313
Sometimes it's so cool that there's no bottom or no end

606
00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:02.403
Ah, the smell, seed.

607
00:39:06.074 --> 00:39:07.075
Are you here?

608
00:39:07.408 --> 00:39:08.993
what? Do you take opiates?

609
00:39:09.494 --> 00:39:11.537
I heard it makes money
I'm thinking of selling some

610
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:13.706
Ha, are you a bully? uh?

611
00:39:14.207 --> 00:39:15.833
No matter how much money you like, don’t do that.

612
00:39:15.917 --> 00:39:17.126
Then I smoke, whatever.

613
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.837
huh? Ugh, is this really crazy?

614
00:39:20.129 --> 00:39:21.589
What are you going to do if you get addicted?

615
00:39:23.341 --> 00:39:24.842
- Oh, the smell.
-Your eyes are clear too.

616
00:39:25.051 --> 00:39:26.302
I can't even see the hand shaking

617
00:39:26.552 --> 00:39:28.596
Even when I smell it, I am not disturbed at all.

618
00:39:29.222 --> 00:39:30.389
What, why did you call me?

619
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.269
I have a question

620
00:39:35.895 --> 00:39:37.105
me too

621
00:39:37.855 --> 00:39:38.898
fairly

622
00:39:41.692 --> 00:39:43.194
Let’s ask each other three questions each.

623
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.031
What if I can’t answer the question?

624
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.033
Let’s take them off one by one

625
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.451
Ah, Mr.

626
00:39:52.495 --> 00:39:53.704
first question

627
00:39:55.665 --> 00:39:57.750
Do you remember the first time we met when we were kids?

628
00:39:59.669 --> 00:40:01.295
testing me

629
00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:04.173
So is opium?

630
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.968
Did you call me knowing something?

631
00:40:08.761 --> 00:40:10.096
How could I forget that?

632
00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:12.723
As soon as you saw me, you stabbed me.

633
00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:18.020
my turn

634
00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:21.065
You met that guy in the red and white mask, right?

635
00:40:22.275 --> 00:40:23.317
met

636
00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:24.569
Where is he now?

637
00:40:24.652 --> 00:40:27.029
One question at a time

638
00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:29.157
It's my turn

639
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:30.992
we swore

640
00:40:31.993 --> 00:40:33.744
Let's risk our lives to protect each other

641
00:40:35.204 --> 00:40:36.330
What if you break your promise?

642
00:40:37.582 --> 00:40:39.792
Even if we die, we die by each other's hands.

643
00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.002
Yuna

644
00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:45.756
I will keep that promise

645
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.259
Why did you choose that guy in the red and white mask over me?

646
00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:49.844
My choice isn't over yet?

647
00:40:50.928 --> 00:40:52.013
last question

648
00:40:57.143 --> 00:40:58.186
What am I to you?

649
00:41:01.105 --> 00:41:04.483
I can't give you the answer you want

650
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.987
To get you on my side

651
00:41:09.113 --> 00:41:11.365
I can't do anything like deceive you

652
00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:13.451
I won't do it even if I die

653
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.123
All you have to do is say one word.

654
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.375
It's so tight now and then

655
00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:23.961
Who is that guy in the red and white mask?

656
00:41:24.045 --> 00:41:25.171
Does he know me?

657
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.924
Maybe I know?

658
00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:38.684
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Now, now, now

659
00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:39.936
No way

660
00:41:40.144 --> 00:41:43.648
The more you wear, the prettier you are

661
00:41:44.273 --> 00:41:45.316
Ah, indeed

662
00:41:46.234 --> 00:41:48.277
And, yeah, this

663
00:41:48.361 --> 00:41:50.154
I don't know if I still like this

664
00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:51.948
I'm going

665
00:42:19.141 --> 00:42:20.309
Hongju, why are you crying?

666
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:23.688
I got a letter from home

667
00:42:23.771 --> 00:42:26.190
My youngest brother is very sick.

668
00:42:26.607 --> 00:42:28.776
Then go home
Talk to the old lady in the clothing group

669
00:42:29.277 --> 00:42:30.319
They say it didn’t work out

670
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.365
When I get out of here
Give up being a mountain god

671
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.784
Wow, you are the worst old woman in the world!

672
00:42:41.956 --> 00:42:43.249
Wait a minute

673
00:42:57.221 --> 00:42:58.806
Come on, snake strawberry.

674
00:42:59.807 --> 00:43:01.475
They say that when you eat it, all sad thoughts disappear.

675
00:43:02.935 --> 00:43:05.271
This is what snakes eat

676
00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:07.898
So I have to pluck one of my eyebrows and eat it.

677
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:09.859
Then the poison disappears.

678
00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:26.250
What do you think, am I right?

679
00:44:00.034 --> 00:44:01.118
Jaeyuya

680
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.412
yes

681
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:06.707
we are going to manchuria

682
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:08.751
pack your bags

683
00:44:10.419 --> 00:44:11.754
Okay, I'll take a picture.

684
00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:13.923
one, two, three

685
00:44:17.093 --> 00:44:18.302
“Jami Mine”

686
00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:21.180
Wow!

687
00:44:28.979 --> 00:44:29.980
Dad

688
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:32.775
Mom was crying and making a fuss.
I heard all my belongings were taken away.

689
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:34.693
Is that a problem now?

690
00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:36.821
A gold mine has exploded again!

691
00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:38.489
Put it on the front page of the newspaper

692
00:44:38.572 --> 00:44:43.536
Although Seon Woo-chan was robbed 36 times,
It's still alive and well

693
00:44:43.744 --> 00:44:46.831
The owner of a newspaper company controls the media
Are you using it for personal purposes?

694
00:44:46.914 --> 00:44:51.168
Governor General
It can also promote industrial deposit incentive policies.

695
00:44:51.252 --> 00:44:54.004
This is all for the country

696
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.841
There are over 5,000 mines under development.

697
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.928
They are very children and women.
The whole country is crazy about the gold mines, so

698
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.181
Now

699
00:45:04.932 --> 00:45:08.894
This is the era where gold makes money.

700
00:45:08.978 --> 00:45:10.187
President Seon Woo-chan

701
00:45:10.271 --> 00:45:12.189
Hello!

702
00:45:14.358 --> 00:45:15.651
lady

703
00:45:18.821 --> 00:45:20.030
I came from Jongno-ro

704
00:45:21.115 --> 00:45:22.158
What is it?

705
00:45:22.783 --> 00:45:25.077
Yes, recently
I heard an interesting rumor

706
00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:30.040
This Pyeongan-do Unsan Gold Mine
From Cheonan Jiksan Gold Mine to Gwangmyeong Gahak Mine

707
00:45:30.416 --> 00:45:33.461
Wherever this gold mine was struck
A man appeared

708
00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:34.920
Who?

709
00:45:35.296 --> 00:45:38.090
These Koreans do this
They say, ‘I looked down on you.’

710
00:45:39.258 --> 00:45:40.468
Look down on me?

711
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.428
He is a native god who brings wealth.

712
00:45:43.971 --> 00:45:46.807
Are you saying that we came to Ye because of that superstition?

713
00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:50.019
I know it's presumptuous, but

714
00:45:50.603 --> 00:45:55.274
Uh, he wears a hat and has a beard like a immortal.
Did you not see a man?

715
00:45:55.983 --> 00:45:58.152
Like a rabbit
I heard you carry a carrot in your mouth?

716
00:46:14.418 --> 00:46:15.419
Dad

717
00:46:18.547 --> 00:46:20.007
Hey, grab that.

718
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:22.343
Get it!

719
00:46:35.564 --> 00:46:36.649
Lee Rang!

720
00:46:39.485 --> 00:46:40.611
Lee Rang!

721
00:46:44.406 --> 00:46:45.407
Lee Rang!

722
00:46:55.459 --> 00:46:57.086
Now, take a walk!

723
00:46:57.419 --> 00:46:58.879
Well then again

724
00:46:59.129 --> 00:47:00.798
What happens?

725
00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:02.007
Now, where is it?

726
00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:04.176
-No!
- Oh, really!

727
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.220
Hey, my money!

728
00:47:06.303 --> 00:47:09.014
- Thank you, now.
- My money, oh boss!

729
00:47:11.642 --> 00:47:13.310
- I lost
- Boss, hurry...

730
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.397
Twelve in a year
In a previous year, there would be thirteen months

731
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.773
365 days a year

732
00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:19.817
Day after day, month after month
It's not coming

733
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.194
Don't say this or that.
Just pick one

734
00:47:22.278 --> 00:47:23.320
Is it over?

735
00:47:23.404 --> 00:47:24.905
- Number 2, this, this.
- Oh! I came, I came

736
00:47:26.073 --> 00:47:27.283
Uh, I need to find it.

737
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.410
- Now, is there anything? now?
- Number 2.

738
00:47:29.493 --> 00:47:30.536
Here we go

739
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.205
-Do you have number 1?
- what?

740
00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:35.583
Are you number 3?

741
00:47:35.874 --> 00:47:38.377
- Chi, that little thing is already acting up.
- Then, between number 2 and number 3...

742
00:47:38.752 --> 00:47:40.170
- Oh no, there isn't one.
- Let's go!

743
00:47:40.254 --> 00:47:41.297
It's in number 3

744
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.631
It's fake!

745
00:47:42.715 --> 00:47:44.008
- Chi
- Oh my, thank you.

746
00:47:44.216 --> 00:47:46.218
Now, hurry up, next edition, next edition

747
00:47:46.302 --> 00:47:48.971
Now, one cat becomes two cats
Two cats become four cats

748
00:47:49.054 --> 00:47:51.098
Four cats become eight cats
Eight cats become ten cats

749
00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:52.558
It's a hundred cat, look, look

750
00:47:52.891 --> 00:47:53.976
Where is it?

751
00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:56.061
- Okay, here we go. Where is it?
- Here.

752
00:48:00.858 --> 00:48:02.026
Now

753
00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:03.944
You again 3 times?

754
00:48:04.028 --> 00:48:05.112
- No. 3
- I'm sure.

755
00:48:05.195 --> 00:48:06.363
- Look
- Oh my.

756
00:48:06.447 --> 00:48:09.283
Now, is it number 2? Oh no, there isn't

757
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.368
It was number 3
Congratulations

758
00:48:11.869 --> 00:48:13.662
Uh, what's strange about this?

759
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.498
Are you hitting on me?

760
00:48:16.582 --> 00:48:17.916
Oh my, thank you

761
00:48:19.251 --> 00:48:20.919
Namdaemun, Dongdaemun
Where should we go?

762
00:48:21.003 --> 00:48:24.214
Pick, pick, pick and grab
Grab it, grab it, pick it, pick it and grab it

763
00:48:25.299 --> 00:48:26.383
I won't be fooled twice

764
00:48:27.718 --> 00:48:29.428
Now, try more, where, where?

765
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.848
Number 1?

766
00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:33.974
Uh, come on

767
00:48:34.058 --> 00:48:35.726
- This time I'll do it twice.
- Now

768
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.728
this time

769
00:48:37.936 --> 00:48:39.021
Let's go backwards

770
00:48:39.938 --> 00:48:42.024
Oh my, there isn't one

771
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:43.901
Not in number 2

772
00:48:43.984 --> 00:48:45.110
Oh my

773
00:48:45.194 --> 00:48:46.195
- It's in number 1.
- Hey!

774
00:48:46.278 --> 00:48:47.363
What are you?

775
00:48:47.863 --> 00:48:50.407
Well, now, thank you.

776
00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:51.700
Where have you gone?

777
00:48:51.992 --> 00:48:52.993
Now, where is it?

778
00:48:54.495 --> 00:48:55.579
- Number 2?
- Uh, number 2?

779
00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:56.747
- Yeah, yeah.
- No. 1, No. 1

780
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.583
- Now, number 1, number 1.
- I trust the baby and will give it number 2!

781
00:48:59.667 --> 00:49:01.085
Me too, number 2!

782
00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:02.503
ruler

783
00:49:02.586 --> 00:49:03.712
What does the kid know?

784
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:05.172
1 time!

785
00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:06.674
None

786
00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:08.467
In number 2

787
00:49:08.676 --> 00:49:09.677
There is

788
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.595
Congratulations, yes

789
00:49:12.054 --> 00:49:13.097
Now

790
00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:16.350
Kids go, kids go

791
00:49:16.433 --> 00:49:19.770
Now, this damn hand
Look where you are

792
00:49:20.521 --> 00:49:23.399
Now, just look at this guy carefully.
Everyone, your personality is changing.

793
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:24.650
Now, where is it?

794
00:49:25.234 --> 00:49:27.027
Now, where is it?

795
00:49:27.111 --> 00:49:28.320
Now, one more time

796
00:49:32.157 --> 00:49:33.492
Number 3?

797
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.328
Number 3

798
00:49:40.666 --> 00:49:42.042
Well, let's see

799
00:49:45.879 --> 00:49:46.880
Number 2

800
00:49:49.007 --> 00:49:50.718
None

801
00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:51.802
Hey!

802
00:49:53.512 --> 00:49:55.264
Wow, you really are a lucky baby.

803
00:49:55.639 --> 00:49:57.307
Lots of luck!

804
00:49:57.558 --> 00:50:00.060
Lucky one, lucky one!

805
00:50:04.022 --> 00:50:08.736
From fur to pearls to expensive bananas
What is this all about?

806
00:50:09.153 --> 00:50:10.612
I felt good so I spent some money

807
00:50:12.906 --> 00:50:13.991
What happened to you out there?

808
00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.951
Nothing happened?

809
00:50:20.038 --> 00:50:21.081
why?

810
00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.169
Oh my!

811
00:50:26.628 --> 00:50:27.796
What are you doing with all this? uh?

812
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.131
Hey, I won it.

813
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.258
Did you gamble in front of your child?

814
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:33.802
This kid is no joke
let's raise it

815
00:50:33.886 --> 00:50:35.095
Really?

816
00:50:37.055 --> 00:50:38.307
Hey, check this out.

817
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.975
Now we raise it

818
00:50:40.267 --> 00:50:41.977
Oh, my head, oh my, my head

819
00:50:42.895 --> 00:50:44.396
Oh, really

820
00:51:10.798 --> 00:51:13.008
What awaits in Manchuria?

821
00:51:13.091 --> 00:51:16.261
The person at Myoyeonggak
Are you saying it's Lee Yeon?

822
00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:18.806
What are you going to check?

823
00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:21.683
That Lee Yeon is not an opiate addict.

824
00:51:21.767 --> 00:51:23.310
What do you mean by that?

825
00:51:24.353 --> 00:51:25.813
I need to see it with my own eyes

826
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.232
Another nine-tailed fox said to have gone to Manchuria

827
00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:31.735
Hey there

828
00:51:33.153 --> 00:51:34.822
Why do you like Lee Yeon?

829
00:51:45.958 --> 00:51:48.168
When I was young, I played house once
I grew up not being able to do it

830
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.505
My life has always been a battle

831
00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:54.174
But if I'm with him
I feel comforted

832
00:51:57.845 --> 00:51:59.012
Isn't it strange?

833
00:52:00.138 --> 00:52:01.974
I don't know how to say a warm word

834
00:52:27.791 --> 00:52:28.834
brother

835
00:52:30.419 --> 00:52:31.420
How were you?

836
00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:41.597
Will I get scolded by my father?

837
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.100
So why are you running away?

838
00:52:45.475 --> 00:52:47.019
I'm like a mountain god
I don't want to be

839
00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:48.979
The sanshin should be done by my brother.

840
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.358
A child worthy of becoming a mountain god
It's the old man's choice to take off clothes.

841
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.737
I don't like fighting and I'm scared

842
00:52:59.406 --> 00:53:03.076
Our Muyoung is
I'm sure he'll be a great mountain god

843
00:53:04.453 --> 00:53:05.537
He's my younger brother.

844
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:28.518
Brother, I'm taking the right path
tell me you're on your way

845
00:53:30.854 --> 00:53:34.608
♪ In the front yard and the back yard ♪

846
00:53:34.691 --> 00:53:36.193
Hey, let's get some sleep, get some sleep

847
00:53:36.276 --> 00:53:41.073
♪ Birds and babies ♪

848
00:53:45.577 --> 00:53:47.412
Ah, why do you need a name?

849
00:53:47.496 --> 00:53:49.748
At least abandoned dogs
It has a name.

850
00:53:50.958 --> 00:53:54.002
Then it means ‘grow strong’.

851
00:53:54.086 --> 00:53:55.212
How about Kim Doo-han?

852
00:53:55.504 --> 00:53:56.672
Duhan, Duhan

853
00:53:56.755 --> 00:53:57.756
It's a girl.

854
00:53:57.965 --> 00:54:00.175
Should I make it a little hip?

855
00:54:00.258 --> 00:54:02.260
I'm also from the streets

856
00:54:02.344 --> 00:54:04.596
- Baduki
- Baduk, child

857
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.847
Please be sincere.

858
00:54:05.931 --> 00:54:07.849
Humans also live according to their own names.

859
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:11.353
Nine-tailed fox?

860
00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:12.813
Oh, oh!

861
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:15.732
Lee Yeon, named after Lee Rang’s last name
How about Lee Mi-ho?

862
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:19.903
‘Lee Mi-ho’?

863
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.699
Miho, Lee Miho

864
00:54:23.782 --> 00:54:25.283
Hey, Lee Mi-ho

865
00:54:31.373 --> 00:54:33.291
don't touch my body

866
00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:34.543
I think Miho likes it too.

867
00:54:35.002 --> 00:54:36.586
Miho!

868
00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:37.921
Hey, Gusinju

869
00:54:38.255 --> 00:54:39.381
you come to work

870
00:54:41.675 --> 00:54:44.553
Miho, Miho, Miho

871
00:54:50.976 --> 00:54:53.145
When you go back in a month
What are you going to do kid? uh?

872
00:54:53.228 --> 00:54:55.397
- Are you taking me with you?
- Is that okay?

873
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.234
Not even a single abandoned dog
I know very well that I'm the kind of person who can't get past it.

874
00:54:59.776 --> 00:55:04.197
But taking responsibility for humans
It's a completely different thing

875
00:55:05.782 --> 00:55:07.534
Do you hate our Miho that much?

876
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:10.078
It's not that I don't like it.

877
00:55:11.038 --> 00:55:12.956
I raised Rang

878
00:55:13.498 --> 00:55:18.128
He also created a magic bandit
It's all my fault for causing death.

879
00:55:18.754 --> 00:55:20.297
Because I couldn’t protect you till the end

880
00:55:20.964 --> 00:55:23.091
Lee Yeon, you did your best too.

881
00:55:23.175 --> 00:55:26.136
How to raise a child properly
find my parents

882
00:55:39.483 --> 00:55:41.109
Well, I did catch it first.

883
00:55:41.401 --> 00:55:43.236
It's torture, it's intimidation, and it doesn't work at all.

884
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.780
I just eat carrots all day.

885
00:55:46.031 --> 00:55:47.657
A guy like that is the king of Joseon?

886
00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:50.202
In gold mines all over the country
There was a sighting

887
00:55:51.286 --> 00:55:52.662
I don't know if it's contempt or what.

888
00:55:52.996 --> 00:55:55.040
He must be someone who knows how to tap into gold.

889
00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:57.918
Regardless of means or method
Make me open my mouth

890
00:55:59.377 --> 00:56:00.921
In order to expand military

891
00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:03.882
the only international currency
Securing gold is the top priority

892
00:56:04.216 --> 00:56:05.217
Yes!

893
00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:18.438
How
Are you under someone like that?

894
00:56:18.772 --> 00:56:20.649
Just a handful of power

895
00:56:21.274 --> 00:56:25.112
He's a guy who only vents to those who are weaker than him.

896
00:56:25.862 --> 00:56:28.907
He is a person who is easier to deal with than anyone else.

897
00:56:31.868 --> 00:56:32.911
What about your sister-in-law?

898
00:56:33.787 --> 00:56:38.083
In addition to the newspaper office, house, and tennis court,
No special movements yet

899
00:56:39.459 --> 00:56:41.962
Oh, you often stop by the second-hand goods store.

900
00:56:42.838 --> 00:56:44.131
Yeah?

901
00:56:51.096 --> 00:56:52.556
Look straight at the map!

902
00:56:53.473 --> 00:56:55.559
survive and survive
If you want, take a shot at the gold vein!

903
00:57:00.856 --> 00:57:04.234
What I do best
I'm cutting off people like you.

904
00:57:05.485 --> 00:57:07.362
Thank you for your hard work.

905
00:57:07.445 --> 00:57:09.114
Hey, you bastard!

906
00:57:18.957 --> 00:57:20.375
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

907
00:57:20.458 --> 00:57:22.210
tell me

908
00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:23.461
Tell me, huh?

909
00:57:23.545 --> 00:57:24.754
What do you want?

910
00:57:29.384 --> 00:57:31.178
Please find the child.

911
00:57:36.725 --> 00:57:38.143
- Over here!
- why?

912
00:57:38.643 --> 00:57:39.853
- Uh, what is it?
- No.

913
00:57:39.936 --> 00:57:41.688
Sir, find it quickly!

914
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:43.648
Search all over, Mr.!

915
00:57:59.748 --> 00:58:00.916
Is it an orphanage?

916
00:58:01.833 --> 00:58:05.420
It's called Jesaengwon, the Government General's office.
It's a facility that raises children without parents.

917
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.756
Oh, I told you not to send it.

918
00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:10.133
you take the kid
What a bastard,

919
00:58:10.592 --> 00:58:12.594
Hey Miho, how should I let you go?

920
00:58:16.765 --> 00:58:17.849
Well, did you see it?

921
00:58:18.642 --> 00:58:24.064
Ah, I'm looking for a child at Jongno Station.
The ransom could be as much as a house.

922
00:58:27.275 --> 00:58:29.319
Oh, if only I could catch the kid.

923
00:58:29.402 --> 00:58:32.530
It's a turnaround in your life!

924
00:58:36.868 --> 00:58:37.953
no

925
00:58:38.036 --> 00:58:39.204
- Write, yo, yo, yo...
- Huh?

926
00:58:39.287 --> 00:58:40.497
- uh? Here it is!
- uh?

927
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.706
That, that, that, that!

928
00:58:41.998 --> 00:58:43.208
Lee Yeon!

929
00:58:50.298 --> 00:58:51.299
There it is!

930
00:58:55.512 --> 00:58:56.721
- Mr.
- That's it!

931
00:58:57.347 --> 00:58:59.432
- Get it!
- Where are you, where are you?

932
00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:09.442
Get it!

933
00:59:09.859 --> 00:59:10.902
Let go!

934
00:59:19.703 --> 00:59:20.912
- Oh my...
- Oh, what should I do?

935
00:59:32.507 --> 00:59:33.967
Stand there!

936
00:59:34.259 --> 00:59:35.552
- Get it!
- Oh, it's him!

937
00:59:35.802 --> 00:59:37.053
- Oh, hold on!
- Get it!

938
00:59:47.272 --> 00:59:48.565
How old is your baby?

939
00:59:49.149 --> 00:59:50.692
Well, let's come

940
00:59:55.864 --> 00:59:56.906
Right?

941
00:59:57.324 --> 00:59:58.325
I guess that's right?

942
00:59:59.868 --> 01:00:01.036
baby let me just wait a minute

943
01:00:02.037 --> 01:00:03.079
Why are you doing that?

944
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.956
I think he's right

945
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.249
Get it!

946
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.754
Ha, Mr.

947
01:00:11.212 --> 01:00:12.464
Ah, there it is!

948
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:25.518
What are you doing?

949
01:00:26.102 --> 01:00:27.562
What are you doing?

950
01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.522
Stand there, man, uh!

951
01:00:41.076 --> 01:00:42.077
Get it!

952
01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.506
Get out!

953
01:00:54.714 --> 01:00:55.757
Oh, why, what!

954
01:00:56.007 --> 01:00:57.592
Have you guys never cried since you were born?

955
01:00:58.009 --> 01:00:59.469
Uh, sorry, sorry

956
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:05.016
Catch it!

957
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.481
Now, catch it!

958
01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.783
oh

959
01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:26.454
Now

960
01:01:27.414 --> 01:01:28.873
Just wait a moment

961
01:01:28.957 --> 01:01:32.127
I'll be right back, I'll be right back, I'll be right back

962
01:01:33.795 --> 01:01:34.838
Get it!

963
01:01:35.547 --> 01:01:38.091
Because of my child, I can do whatever I can.
I tried to refrain from violence

964
01:01:38.174 --> 01:01:39.634
Oh my, Mr.

965
01:01:48.726 --> 01:01:49.769
child

966
01:01:53.148 --> 01:01:54.315
Hey, Mr.

967
01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:02.991
‘Sumimasen, Sumimasen’

968
01:02:04.784 --> 01:02:07.078
'Sumimasen
Sumimasen'!

969
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.621
Shooting a gun while you have a child?

970
01:02:10.582 --> 01:02:12.208
What are you saying? Really, Mr.

971
01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:24.304
These cheap guys
Shooting a gun when you have a baby? uh?

972
01:02:25.013 --> 01:02:26.055
Miho!

973
01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:27.307
Miho!

974
01:02:29.893 --> 01:02:31.478
Miho

975
01:02:32.061 --> 01:02:33.188
Are you Miho?

976
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.397
uh?

977
01:02:37.233 --> 01:02:38.985
uh? Basket here?

978
01:02:40.487 --> 01:02:41.571
Hey, Mr. Lee

979
01:02:42.155 --> 01:02:43.198
Miho

980
01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:45.700
Miho, Miho!

981
01:02:45.783 --> 01:02:47.535
Miho!

982
01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:50.663
Where did you go?

983
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.667
Welcome

984
01:02:56.836 --> 01:02:58.213
Do you know who I am?

985
01:03:00.965 --> 01:03:02.133
To buy a set of clothes

986
01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:14.437
Just my taste

987
01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:15.647
Shook

988
01:03:21.277 --> 01:03:22.320
Huh?

989
01:03:26.824 --> 01:03:28.493
Please pay the cost of the clothes to Lee Yeon.

990
01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:41.464
Ugh

991
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.343
Wow, Miho

992
01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:49.055
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry

993
01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:02.026
Oh, I have a fever?

994
01:04:02.735 --> 01:04:03.945
Let's call the congressman

995
01:04:04.028 --> 01:04:05.822
No, there's no one I can trust

996
01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:09.117
Did you successfully control the Myoyeonggak employees?

997
01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:10.868
uh

998
01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:14.330
Ah, Miho.
Why does it hurt so much? huh?

999
01:04:20.253 --> 01:04:21.713
Wow, indeed, Mr.

1000
01:04:22.213 --> 01:04:23.339
Lower your fever

1001
01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:28.052
Was it like this even when I was sick?

1002
01:04:30.805 --> 01:04:32.557
When you were young, you often got sick

1003
01:04:32.807 --> 01:04:34.475
Do you know how much it hurt me?

1004
01:04:34.809 --> 01:04:36.686
I dug up and fed everything that was good for the body.

1005
01:04:37.103 --> 01:04:38.646
Chi, I don't remember

1006
01:04:38.855 --> 01:04:42.191
Hey, this is why I’m credited with raising a child.
They said there wasn't one, ah

1007
01:04:44.736 --> 01:04:47.196
Why did you pick me up?

1008
01:04:48.156 --> 01:04:49.741
You said you didn’t even know you had a younger brother?

1009
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.285
my father told me

1010
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.704
What?

1011
01:04:55.038 --> 01:04:56.039
When I was young

1012
01:04:56.456 --> 01:04:58.791
My father told the old woman of the Talui faction
You left me and ran away?

1013
01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:01.669
I lived without knowing whether I was alive or dead.

1014
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:03.671
He suddenly appeared one day and said that

1015
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.257
‘I forgot, but you probably have a younger brother.’

1016
01:05:07.008 --> 01:05:08.801
I will kill you if I meet you

1017
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.429
Dear bastard, let’s do this together.

1018
01:05:14.682 --> 01:05:17.352
What kind of guy was he? Father is a boy

1019
01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:19.479
I don't even know your face

1020
01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:24.984
Use it as a target for arrows and feed it poisonous mushrooms
Hang it on a rock and throw it into the river.

1021
01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:29.447
Your personality became that way
It wasn't a coincidence

1022
01:05:32.992 --> 01:05:34.911
Ah, why like this?
Is your fever not going down?

1023
01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:48.299
Oh, are you here?

1024
01:05:55.973 --> 01:05:57.183
Ah, Miho.

1025
01:06:08.403 --> 01:06:09.445
Um, huh?

1026
01:06:09.529 --> 01:06:11.197
My fever went down

1027
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.448
Oh, thank goodness

1028
01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:17.745
From now on, Miho’s childcare will be
I conduct it myself.

1029
01:06:21.165 --> 01:06:22.458
Oh, you're doing great.

1030
01:06:23.418 --> 01:06:25.294
As dust-free as possible, okay?

1031
01:06:25.378 --> 01:06:26.587
Uh, okay

1032
01:06:31.259 --> 01:06:32.885
Oh, you're doing great.

1033
01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:36.180
Something like a Hwatu card
Just put it away so he can't see it, okay?

1034
01:06:37.223 --> 01:06:40.059
Not a single speck of dust remains
Please take care to keep it clean

1035
01:06:40.143 --> 01:06:41.519
It's not good for your child's bronchi, okay?

1036
01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:43.187
yes

1037
01:06:44.731 --> 01:06:46.524
What is it? What is that smell?

1038
01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:48.860
What kind of bastard is this?

1039
01:06:49.694 --> 01:06:50.737
Give it to me for a moment

1040
01:06:51.446 --> 01:06:52.447
Don’t you smoke?

1041
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.531
Oh my, Mr.

1042
01:06:53.614 --> 01:06:54.699
Starting today, smoking is prohibited here.

1043
01:06:54.782 --> 01:06:55.783
Such a dog...

1044
01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:57.744
Use correct and kind words, tsk

1045
01:07:02.415 --> 01:07:04.375
Uh, is that lotion just for babies?

1046
01:07:04.876 --> 01:07:05.877
I don't know

1047
01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.336
Check if it contains parabens

1048
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.421
Yeah

1049
01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:10.423
Uh, organic, right?

1050
01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:12.008
What is organic?

1051
01:07:12.633 --> 01:07:13.634
Baby, it's done

1052
01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:17.889
Ah, ah, Miho

1053
01:07:18.306 --> 01:07:19.849
Let’s put all that on and eat this.

1054
01:07:20.475 --> 01:07:22.602
'Day Sun, Month Month'

1055
01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:24.395
Oh, put the kid down.

1056
01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:25.646
Then the child's habits worsened.

1057
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.774
This is the most important time to form attachment.

1058
01:07:27.857 --> 01:07:29.734
Don't criticize my educational philosophy

1059
01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:31.736
Me, me, 1,000-character sentence forever
Are you reciting?

1060
01:07:32.695 --> 01:07:33.780
Until Miho falls asleep

1061
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.532
I will send my Miho to Seoul National University.

1062
01:07:36.616 --> 01:07:38.659
Ah, there is no such thing as an ordeal.

1063
01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:40.828
‘Chalhan, want to come’

1064
01:07:40.912 --> 01:07:43.080
'It's hot, king of gals'

1065
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:45.374
‘Autumn weight, girdle’

1066
01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:47.794
Huh?

1067
01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:50.838
You like this kind of thing, huh?

1068
01:07:51.506 --> 01:07:53.758
Now

1069
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:32.964
It's like a ghost crying
Where did the clothes go?

1070
01:08:33.047 --> 01:08:36.008
I'm sure I hid it well here!

1071
01:08:36.384 --> 01:08:37.593
It's clothes with a password in it.

1072
01:08:37.885 --> 01:08:40.263
If exposed, the entire organization is at risk.

1073
01:08:40.346 --> 01:08:41.597
Ah, I mean

1074
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:45.518
What are you looking for?

1075
01:08:45.601 --> 01:08:46.644
Oh, Yeohee!

1076
01:08:46.727 --> 01:08:48.312
Did you see the floral shirt over here?

1077
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.481
Oh, that was sold yesterday.

1078
01:08:52.733 --> 01:08:54.110
To whom?

1079
01:08:54.777 --> 01:08:56.320
uh? How do you find baby powder?

1080
01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:57.738
Where do you want me to buy it?

1081
01:08:59.866 --> 01:09:01.367
Baby, I'm going to turn around

1082
01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:09.667
Hey!

1083
01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:11.460
Me?

1084
01:09:11.544 --> 01:09:13.588
That dress was custom-ordered by me, right?

1085
01:09:14.922 --> 01:09:16.007
Is it mine?

1086
01:09:16.299 --> 01:09:17.925
Oh, how much does it cost?

1087
01:09:18.175 --> 01:09:19.468
I'll give you whatever money you ask for.

1088
01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:21.429
Sorry, I don't sell it.

1089
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:26.058
I'm sorry

1090
01:09:26.142 --> 01:09:27.184
Are you that guy?

1091
01:10:16.776 --> 01:10:17.818
Look at this?

1092
01:10:34.794 --> 01:10:35.962
wow!

1093
01:10:47.723 --> 01:10:50.226
Let's see, seven dots on my forehead

1094
01:10:50.935 --> 01:10:52.436
- That's right.
- What are you guys?

1095
01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:54.939
I'm Jeong Dae-seung, a detective at Jongno Police Station.

1096
01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:57.108
- But, what?
-Give me the baby.

1097
01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:58.401
Huh?

1098
01:11:03.739 --> 01:11:04.991
- Go quickly.
- Wow

1099
01:11:07.743 --> 01:11:08.953
Wow

1100
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:11.914
It's so typical, ah

1101
01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:17.628
- Please save them.
- The kids come first.

1102
01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:18.963
Please save me

1103
01:11:19.046 --> 01:11:20.131
I can't help it, oh

1104
01:11:22.133 --> 01:11:23.175
Miho

1105
01:11:23.676 --> 01:11:24.677
child

1106
01:11:26.429 --> 01:11:27.430
- Mr.
- Yes

1107
01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:28.931
Oh, are you out of your mind?

1108
01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:30.975
Usually like this

1109
01:11:31.058 --> 01:11:33.894
The main characters are like idiots
Sometimes babies are taken away

1110
01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:36.063
But we are not ordinary people

1111
01:11:36.147 --> 01:11:37.148
What are you guys?

1112
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:40.651
Ah, well, sort of.
Should we call it the Green Mothers Association?

1113
01:11:41.944 --> 01:11:44.739
Anyway, today you
You're so fucked up

1114
01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:45.865
crazy guy

1115
01:11:47.074 --> 01:11:49.827
You should use kind and kind words in front of your child.

1116
01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:01.213
Shall I step on it?

1117
01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:03.674
Let's step!

1118
01:12:20.566 --> 01:12:21.692
Whoosh!

1119
01:13:01.857 --> 01:13:03.150
what?

1120
01:13:04.777 --> 01:13:05.903
This damn bloody thing?

1121
01:13:09.573 --> 01:13:11.158
The Governor-General proposed a deal.

1122
01:13:11.992 --> 01:13:13.119
If you don't take the baby...

1123
01:13:13.202 --> 01:13:14.578
Where is Hongju now?

1124
01:13:14.662 --> 01:13:16.080
I can't forgive

1125
01:13:16.497 --> 01:13:17.790
Photograph the location of the gold mine

1126
01:13:17.873 --> 01:13:19.208
It's gold dust!

1127
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.168
When you find the kidnapped orchid...

1128
01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:22.586
- Don't be scared.
- Lee Yeon!

1129
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.046
where the baby is
I said I would let you know

1130
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.131
Lee Yeon and I

1131
01:13:25.214 --> 01:13:26.423
You'll be fighting for your life

1132
01:13:27.341 --> 01:13:30.094
My precious friends
A war is about to start?

1133
01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:32.138
What are you?

1134
01:13:33.013 --> 01:13:34.140
grow
