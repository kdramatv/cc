﻿1
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.901
It's you.

2
00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:30.529
A Korean who threw a bomb at Gyeongseong Station

3
00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:31.780
Which organization is this?

4
00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:34.741
The military commander is dead.

5
00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.037
IC

6
00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:42.791
Wow

7
00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.419
This damn alarm, this
It rings even if it goes back in time

8
00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:48.839
Did you see it?

9
00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:52.092
The song came out of a box the size of a matchbox.

10
00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:53.426
What is it?

11
00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:56.054
Answer me!

12
00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:57.556
I'm going to school

13
00:01:58.473 --> 00:01:59.474
The box speaks

14
00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:01.268
Was there anyone inside?

15
00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:05.480
around here
Where is the best restaurant?

16
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:07.649
Hey, hey, hey

17
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.942
Wow

18
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.068
Don't move!

19
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:11.778
From earlier
What are you fussing about, huh?

20
00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:13.905
I didn't even take the CSAT because my bag strap was short?

21
00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:16.825
Oh, by the way
Have you guys seen my stuff?

22
00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:19.828
It's like a small rock.
It's very important to me, right?

23
00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.625
I told you not to move!

24
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.721
seed

25
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:39.639
There's a hole

26
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:42.601
It's a day trip, so I only have one set of clothes.

27
00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.906
Who are you?

28
00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:57.198
Speak in Korean

29
00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.784
Who, who are you?

30
00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:01.995
me?

31
00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:10.754
Joseon's nine-tailed fox

32
00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:19.596
Shoot! Shoot and kill!

33
00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:19.781
Give me the gun

34
00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:22.200
Oh, give it to me

35
00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:26.121
Stay still

36
00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:28.039
Don't even breathe

37
00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:50.895
Quit smoking, you little bastard!

38
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.362
I'm his older brother
Smoking is bad for you, right?

39
00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:07.495
No way

40
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:30.351
brother

41
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.895
Aren't you dead yet?

42
00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:03.843
Did you report it?

43
00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:07.138
Uh, the culprit of the Gyeongseong Station bombing incident
He's my brother.

44
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:09.015
Where did I see that I was the one who threw the bomb?

45
00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.683
네 존재 자체가 폭탄이잖아

46
00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:13.645
아, 얼굴만 봐도
속 터져 죽을 것 같아

47
00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:16.940
우리 랑이는 일제 강점기에도
변함없이 개새끼였구나

48
00:06:17.023 --> 00:06:18.650
가정 교육이 개판이라 그래

49
00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:25.490
당황스럽다고?

50
00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:27.033
I understand

51
00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:29.369
That's exactly how I feel right now

52
00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:36.876
Why did I live in Joseon during the Japanese colonial period?
Are they filming a fake western movie?

53
00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.170
Besides, my dead brother

54
00:06:39.254 --> 00:06:42.006
Why did you become a heavy smoker?
Are you exploring Gyeongseong?

55
00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:18.126
The original brothers Sairan
It's close to noir, but

56
00:07:18.793 --> 00:07:20.962
my family
To become soybean flour like this,

57
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:22.589
There is a more complicated story.

58
00:07:34.142 --> 00:07:37.020
I am a nine-tailed fox who loves humans

59
00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:40.607
I lost quite a lot because of that.

60
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.443
Because of just one human woman
Abandon your status as a mountain god

61
00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:44.569
Turn your back on the mountain, and...

62
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:45.987
yes

63
00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:47.989
abandoned you

64
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:53.828
long years
Even though we were enemies,

65
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.081
Did you miss me?

66
00:07:57.165 --> 00:07:58.166
Do you want to die, my brother?

67
00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:01.169
Crossing the line together
We made up passionately

68
00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:04.380
I have never
I never abandoned you

69
00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:07.133
We became brothers again

70
00:08:12.597 --> 00:08:13.598
Be sure to survive

71
00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:16.601
in 2020

72
00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:19.520
I died once

73
00:08:20.313 --> 00:08:21.439
I came back to life

74
00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:24.484
I became the person I had longed for so much, but

75
00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:28.655
I've been bothering you for a very long time

76
00:08:29.948 --> 00:08:31.199
I won't apologize

77
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.910
Still

78
00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:35.411
if you can

79
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.916
Let's meet again

80
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.381
brother

81
00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:51.511
With my younger brother
He sacrificed his life to save me

82
00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:54.097
You left me forever

83
00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:56.641
Why can’t Lee Rang be reincarnated?

84
00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:02.272
That's the law of the underworld, the law of the underworld

85
00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:04.065
Oh my, I always hear that damn law

86
00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:06.442
He died to save me, huh?

87
00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.532
He saved you
Are you asking because you don’t know how many people you killed?

88
00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:15.243
Okay

89
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.248
I'll hand over my custody so you can save Rang's life.

90
00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:23.418
They're sitting there talking about custody or something.

91
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:27.171
Man, I'm 1,600 years old
Do you need to change a diaper?

92
00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:30.341
What grandma tells you to do
I will do anything

93
00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:34.345
You finally changed your mind.

94
00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:40.685
Ugh

95
00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:46.774
You are the best performer
in retirement

96
00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:48.609
My hardships were not enough.

97
00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:50.862
‘On the condition that Lee Yeon is reincarnated with Lee’

98
00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:55.408
‘The monsters that disturb this world
‘I repay the favor by condemning’

99
00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:57.035
Sign it

100
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.202
Wait a minute

101
00:09:59.412 --> 00:10:01.331
What's wrong with the font below?
Why is this so small?

102
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.753
'The period as a nine-tailed fox is
‘Until the breakaway group orders’?

103
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:09.422
Is it a weapons contract?

104
00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:13.217
Insurance terms and conditions are like this
If you cheat on the consumer, you'll be punished a lot, right?

105
00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:14.677
you, you

106
00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:17.138
You don't have any presbyopia at all?

107
00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:19.807
Gumiho, okay

108
00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:23.061
I don't like immortality, no arms contracts

109
00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:26.147
Let me die on the same day as Jia

110
00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.649
That's my only condition

111
00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:33.654
A fox's mate will remain until he dies.
They say I won't abandon you

112
00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.033
Your pure love is still the same.

113
00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:57.887
The story has a happy ending
It seemed like it would end

114
00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:01.140
But

115
00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:04.811
Was it because of a lunar eclipse?

116
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:07.772
Or

117
00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:12.151
Came during a lunar eclipse
Was it the fault of an uninvited guest?

118
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:34.215
The border between this world and the next world

119
00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:37.343
Starting from the day when trouble occurred in Samdocheon,

120
00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.179
come out

121
00:11:40.263 --> 00:11:41.556
the world I belong to

122
00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:44.016
Everything started to twist

123
00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.103
It's mint chocolate, right?

124
00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.105
- Are you packing?
- I'm going to eat it today and then go.

125
00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:50.189
2

126
00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:52.400
I guess you eat it with your wife.

127
00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:00.366
- Yuna! Yuna, Yuna, Yuna
- Oh, what a surprise.

128
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.451
I'm in big trouble, I'm in big trouble

129
00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:02.869
What are you doing here?

130
00:12:04.162 --> 00:12:06.122
- Oh my god, what a guy.
- Ah

131
00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:09.917
He came wearing a red and white mask,
You stole the Samdocheon Guardian Stone, right?

132
00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:12.962
- What is that?
- It was on our roof.

133
00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:15.715
I mean the stone statue.
To protect the border between this world and the next world

134
00:12:15.798 --> 00:12:18.176
It is an item made by King Yeomra himself.

135
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:20.678
Ah, something so precious
Why don't you put it in the safe?

136
00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:21.762
Did you put it on the roof?

137
00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:24.849
Ah, because that guardian stone is the three-way barrier.

138
00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:27.310
- A barrier?
- Yes

139
00:12:29.228 --> 00:12:31.230
- Then, Samdocheon is now...
- Yeah.

140
00:12:31.314 --> 00:12:33.566
All the crazy people are gathering, just

141
00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:35.067
Hey, go fast, go fast

142
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:37.862
Wow, really

143
00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:40.823
Uh, baby, don't come here now
Uh, uh

144
00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:46.787
All I have to do is find the guardian stone, right?

145
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:49.373
Where did you run away? That thief

146
00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:51.918
Of course

147
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:57.298
Here?

148
00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:00.468
If you open this place, it's straight to hell.

149
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.677
Hwa-tang hell?

150
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.304
Ice hell?

151
00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:04.847
Not hell

152
00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:11.229
It’s been a while, T-shirt group!

153
00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:13.356
No, in Samdocheon

154
00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:16.108
- I've been doing it too long.
- Wow

155
00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.319
A lot of people came too

156
00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:21.948
Huh?

157
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.699
Gumiho's discharge day
I was going to give it to you

158
00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:26.118
clock?

159
00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:28.329
There will come a day when you will be blind and deaf

160
00:13:28.412 --> 00:13:29.413
Can't you hear?

161
00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:32.375
The take-off group!

162
00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:36.379
Oh, it hurts

163
00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:38.339
Look at this watch every time

164
00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:40.049
Don't forget you're on borrowed time

165
00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:43.553
‘Yes, stand’

166
00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:45.555
The take-off group!

167
00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:49.934
- Good
- Enter!

168
00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:52.395
Oh, I really

169
00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:56.732
go

170
00:13:58.317 --> 00:14:00.194
Find the guardian stone and come back before tomorrow.

171
00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:04.407
It's 5 a.m., before the sun rises.

172
00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:07.910
Ah

173
00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:09.579
How to get back?

174
00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:10.788
same cabinet

175
00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:17.920
It's exactly up to the hour.
If you don't come back in time, the door will be closed.

176
00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:20.423
Throw it all away

177
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:25.720
Go!

178
00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:28.973
I'll be back

179
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.066
Lee Yeon!

180
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:43.279
Hey Shinju

181
00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:44.447
What about Lee Yeon?

182
00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:47.950
- Hurry up!
- Oh, yeah.

183
00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:52.330
Here

184
00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:02.590
Ah, it's dazzling, Mr.

185
00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:09.305
What is it?

186
00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:11.349
Where are we again? uh?

187
00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:13.559
what?

188
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:16.437
what?

189
00:15:19.357 --> 00:15:20.358
no

190
00:15:22.902 --> 00:15:23.903
Oh, what?

191
00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:36.374
- Do you want to go to Mitsukoshi Department Store?
- It's so good.

192
00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:40.378
I just happened to fall short of 100 percent.
What are you buying?

193
00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:54.141
Extra, extra!

194
00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:56.143
Extra!

195
00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.020
Extra!

196
00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:00.815
‘13 years of digestion’

197
00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.902
1938?

198
00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:07.321
Japanese colonial period?

199
00:16:12.993 --> 00:16:15.371
Oh, I really do, Mr.

200
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.332
Wow, really

201
00:16:30.052 --> 00:16:31.053
Lee Yeon?

202
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.681
Rumbling gaksi?

203
00:16:33.764 --> 00:16:36.767
Oh, what's going on?
He didn’t come to Gyeongseong.

204
00:16:37.727 --> 00:16:39.395
Oh, me?

205
00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:42.481
Oh, I brought Shinju with me last year.
You went down to Gunsan, right?

206
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.567
What on earth are you doing there?

207
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.404
Oh, I was in Gunsan.
You're here now

208
00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:51.866
No, what, are you going to run a raw fish restaurant there?
I'm just doing business.

209
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:52.950
What time is it now?

210
00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:55.536
It's 1:10

211
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.123
Hey, you meticulous old lady.
They even set the time difference, huh?

212
00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:00.332
Jet lag?

213
00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:01.500
No, no

214
00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.461
Oh, I really do, Mr.

215
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.296
No, who is there?

216
00:17:06.046 --> 00:17:08.048
I'm wearing a mask and looking this way.

217
00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:28.587
Who are you?

218
00:18:39.557 --> 00:18:41.433
Ice cream!

219
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.979
Ah, pay to eat!

220
00:18:45.062 --> 00:18:46.063
Wow, like that

221
00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:53.696
I'm sorry

222
00:18:57.491 --> 00:18:58.492
What is it?

223
00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:01.829
Thief, thief!

224
00:19:33.611 --> 00:19:34.612
go

225
00:19:57.885 --> 00:19:59.386
What are they doing? catch

226
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.471
Protect the commander!

227
00:20:02.973 --> 00:20:04.058
IC

228
00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:11.482
Huh?

229
00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:18.739
Kiyuri?

230
00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:22.493
uh?

231
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.957
huh?

232
00:20:38.384 --> 00:20:41.470
IC

233
00:20:41.553 --> 00:20:43.681
Commander, Commander!

234
00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:46.600

235
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.727
Hurrah!

236
00:20:54.108 --> 00:20:55.359
Where's the bitch who threw the bomb?

237
00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:56.860
Find it, quickly!

238
00:20:58.821 --> 00:21:03.367
Viva! Viva!

239
00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:06.870

IC

242
00:21:18.632 --> 00:21:19.800
Hey

Hey, hey, hey, man! Hey, Mr. Lee

Shoot!

246
00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:54.626
Long live Korean independence!

247
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.962
Long live Korean independence!

you carriage, carriage

252
00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:18.776
Now, one, tea, tea!

253
00:22:30.662 --> 00:22:32.748
Hey!

254
00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:46.762
Run!

255
00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:01.151
what?

256
00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.402
Those aren't people

257
00:23:08.033 --> 00:23:09.034
Hey!

258
00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:16.917
Stand there, man!

259
00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:19.670
Don't come, come on!

260
00:23:31.974 --> 00:23:32.975
Hey!

261
00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:36.061
Whoa, whoa

262
00:23:41.024 --> 00:23:42.025
Boss!

263
00:23:43.652 --> 00:23:45.237
Boss, boss!

264
00:23:47.322 --> 00:23:48.323
boss!

265
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.373
How dare you touch my things?

266
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:03.338
boss

267
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:27.362
Langa

268
00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:28.780
Lee Yeon?

269
00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:30.616
You're alive.

270
00:24:33.076 --> 00:24:34.077
In this era you

271
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.538
I'm alive like this

272
00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:39.666
Die!

273
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.632
Thank goodness

274
00:24:47.257 --> 00:24:50.093
My heart is beating and I can breathe just fine.

275
00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:54.514
You're alive, my brother.

276
00:24:55.057 --> 00:24:56.058
Thank goodness

277
00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:57.434
Fuck off, you bastard.

278
00:24:57.643 --> 00:24:59.186
Where did you get any opium from?

279
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.066
I'm sorry

280
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:06.068
We don't have much time, Lang.

281
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.111
Bring your stuff

282
00:25:08.654 --> 00:25:09.655
W, W, W

283
00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:12.074
Here, here, here, now, now

284
00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:16.703
Yuck, wow, ah!

285
00:25:17.663 --> 00:25:20.415
Wow, I was motion sick

286
00:25:23.168 --> 00:25:24.169
Lee Yeon!

287
00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.338
Lee Yeon!

288
00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:31.385
Lee Yeon!

289
00:25:33.095 --> 00:25:35.305
Oh, how
Isn't there anyone passing by?

290
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.932
How far did you walk?

291
00:25:42.062 --> 00:25:43.772
hey! I!

292
00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:45.399
Stop, stop, stop

293
00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:48.110
- Can I ride?
- Ta

294
00:25:48.193 --> 00:25:50.279
Get on it? Okay, huh?

295
00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:07.379
What is this head shape?

296
00:26:07.462 --> 00:26:08.922
Don't touch me, I'll kill you.

297
00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:11.091
Are you the leader of a bandit group?

298
00:26:12.384 --> 00:26:14.052
Did you live like this all through the 30s?

299
00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:16.847
Yes, steal, take and kill

300
00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:19.766
it's my fault

301
00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:22.352
I also lost someone I loved

302
00:26:23.103 --> 00:26:24.855
I didn't have time to look back at you

303
00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:28.191
You know how disgusting it is right now, right?

304
00:26:29.985 --> 00:26:31.987
I know, but

305
00:26:32.904 --> 00:26:34.573
I really wanted to say this

306
00:26:40.203 --> 00:26:41.204
My brother

307
00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:43.707
I was very sorry

308
00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:50.630
release me

309
00:26:52.424 --> 00:26:55.052
I'm going to believe your bullshit now
You're trying

310
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.018
Are you okay, boss?

311
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.771
my blood relative

312
00:27:07.773 --> 00:27:09.232
Ah, somehow, yes?

313
00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:11.318
It was three o'clock

314
00:27:14.112 --> 00:27:15.113
Ah, Mr.

315
00:27:16.073 --> 00:27:17.949
Hey, what are they? I heard you’re not a person

316
00:27:18.992 --> 00:27:20.744
- pack of wolves
- Uh

317
00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:23.789
Originally our boss
It was separate

318
00:27:24.247 --> 00:27:26.458
To you and me in one shot
By all means, we...

319
00:27:27.084 --> 00:27:28.085
So you changed?

320
00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:30.379
But I like my boss better now.

321
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.297
Is Rangi being nice to you?

322
00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.508
No, still

323
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:38.387
We are going to join the magic band now.
It's a bunch of guys standing in line.

324
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.471
Why?

325
00:27:39.554 --> 00:27:41.181
Always take stolen items

326
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.185
They share it equally.
It's not easy, is it?

327
00:27:45.268 --> 00:27:46.353
Stop talking nonsense and get out

328
00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:47.437
yes

329
00:27:47.896 --> 00:27:49.689
IC

330
00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:52.484
Let's go, let's go

331
00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.532
take it

332
00:27:59.783 --> 00:28:01.034
I'll just have one drink

333
00:28:04.329 --> 00:28:05.705
What is that thing you were looking for?

334
00:28:09.668 --> 00:28:11.336
Things that shouldn't exist in this era

335
00:28:11.795 --> 00:28:13.130
I need to put it back in its place

336
00:28:16.466 --> 00:28:17.843
you'll never know

337
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.263
How long have I imagined this scene?

338
00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:23.723
how much i missed you

339
00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:27.477
drink

340
00:28:37.028 --> 00:28:38.363
I had so much to say to you

341
00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:40.782
Now it's just you

342
00:28:40.866 --> 00:28:43.577
Like this in front
I feel good just by breathing

343
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.789
Please say something

344
00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:50.459
After today

345
00:28:50.834 --> 00:28:53.003
You might not see me again for a while

346
00:28:54.337 --> 00:28:56.798
So
Whatever you want to say, say it

347
00:28:58.133 --> 00:28:59.134
Let's listen to your voice

348
00:29:05.098 --> 00:29:06.099
But

349
00:29:07.184 --> 00:29:08.560
What's that in your mouth?

350
00:29:10.812 --> 00:29:12.355
What do you have in your mouth?

351
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.741
Ah, me, you bastard.

352
00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:37.380
Come out!

353
00:29:37.923 --> 00:29:38.924
Hey, hey!

354
00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:55.607
drag me

355
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.858
my beer

356
00:29:58.985 --> 00:29:59.986
Mr.

357
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:03.615
Give me my beer, you bastard!
Ask for my beer

358
00:30:03.698 --> 00:30:05.367
My beer, my beer

359
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.745
Ouch, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

360
00:30:08.828 --> 00:30:09.913
It hurts, ouch

361
00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:15.168
Be careful with the fire, be careful with the fire
Be careful of fire, fire, fire

362
00:30:15.544 --> 00:30:17.462
What are you saying?
You crazy bastard, Mr.

363
00:30:24.094 --> 00:30:25.095
Be careful with fire

364
00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:01.923
Oh, you woke up.

365
00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:07.971
Who are you?

366
00:31:08.054 --> 00:31:09.055
'who are you?'

367
00:31:11.308 --> 00:31:15.437
You have money to pay for the drinks.
Ask for my beer

368
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.234
I have no money now

369
00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:22.736
I'll pay you back

370
00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:24.613
My name is Seonwoo Eunho.

371
00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:25.697
I'm a reporter at Sunwoo Ilbo.

372
00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:27.365
No, a person called a reporter

373
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:29.618
Why do you earn money in broad daylight?

374
00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:31.578
Are you being chased by armed detectives?

375
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:33.705
More than that, you smell like gunpowder.

376
00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:42.255
A woman who carelessly smells like gunpowder
don't save me

377
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.341
Can I drink it?

378
00:31:52.474 --> 00:31:53.892
Uh, uh, uh, um...

379
00:31:55.477 --> 00:31:56.478
What is your name?

380
00:31:58.813 --> 00:32:00.815
The name of the man who will pay the debt is
Don’t you need to know?

381
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.818
Muyoung, this is Cheon Muyoung.

382
00:32:09.282 --> 00:32:10.283
Are you a member of parliament?

383
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:14.537
I heard your skill in treating gunshot wounds was not average.

384
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:17.582
I'm just imitating it.

385
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:19.959
I'm thinking of trying to get money for the injured person's drinks.

386
00:32:21.795 --> 00:32:23.755
I saw a lot of scammers while working as a reporter.

387
00:32:24.964 --> 00:32:26.091
The teacher is not there

388
00:32:28.093 --> 00:32:29.260
Which way am I?

389
00:32:31.763 --> 00:32:34.391
Either very kind or not

390
00:32:34.683 --> 00:32:37.560
With petty criminals like fraudsters
So much that there is no comparison

391
00:32:39.312 --> 00:32:40.313
dangerous person

392
00:32:46.403 --> 00:32:47.612
It's a filming car, right?

393
00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.197
Secondary appearance?

394
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.075
I also worked part-time a long time ago.
I did it a few times

395
00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:54.744
But where is this car going?

396
00:32:55.328 --> 00:32:57.080
It's a place to go mining.

397
00:32:57.163 --> 00:32:58.164
Mine?

398
00:32:58.248 --> 00:32:59.958
Definitely not a mine

399
00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:03.253
Uh, they took me there because they said I would make money.

400
00:33:03.336 --> 00:33:06.715
Those who are cut off from the news, whatever.
Do you think it's just one or two?

401
00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:09.092
What's wrong with your forehead?

402
00:33:09.175 --> 00:33:12.345
Hmm, uh, that's right

403
00:33:12.429 --> 00:33:14.347
- He said he was going home.
- Is that right?

404
00:33:15.765 --> 00:33:19.352
No, it's violence against the performer.
This, ah, report this!

405
00:33:19.436 --> 00:33:21.646
There is also a human rights commission.
At least make a national petition

406
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.731
Be quiet!

407
00:33:32.407 --> 00:33:34.117
Oh, my arm is numb!

408
00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:38.580
what?

409
00:33:39.164 --> 00:33:41.499
Ah, really, you bastard.

410
00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:44.669
Wait a minute

411
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.921
Five o'clock?

412
00:33:47.547 --> 00:33:48.798
Oh, why did I sleep for three hours?

413
00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:57.223
Right from here

414
00:33:57.724 --> 00:33:59.601
This is the scene you first saw.

415
00:33:59.684 --> 00:34:00.727
It's you.

416
00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:37.472
It could have been avoided, right?

417
00:34:37.972 --> 00:34:38.973
Why didn't you avoid it?

418
00:34:39.057 --> 00:34:40.642
I think this is the only way to believe it

419
00:34:41.851 --> 00:34:43.311
My story of being sorry

420
00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:47.982
Now we are equal
We cut each other once.

421
00:34:48.942 --> 00:34:50.109
So

422
00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.737
Because I’m resentful
Don't waste time

423
00:34:53.029 --> 00:34:55.156
Stop being a bandit bandit.

424
00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:57.909
just a little bit

425
00:34:58.451 --> 00:35:00.286
Live a little happier

426
00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:04.040
Why do you always talk like someone is dying?

427
00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:06.084
You don't die like this

428
00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:07.168
I won't die

429
00:35:08.753 --> 00:35:10.839
But I have to go

430
00:35:11.798 --> 00:35:12.799
Where?

431
00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:17.637
Have a good life, you idiot.

432
00:35:18.346 --> 00:35:20.265
As if to show off

433
00:35:35.738 --> 00:35:37.323
Hey, you bad bastard.

434
00:35:37.407 --> 00:35:39.450
Are you just saying what you want to say?

435
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:42.203
Why do you show up as you please?
Pretend to be nice

436
00:35:42.287 --> 00:35:43.705
Why are you just throwing it away!

437
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.042
Who will abandon you?

438
00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:07.645
Langa!

439
00:36:16.404 --> 00:36:17.405
Langa

440
00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:20.992
you

441
00:36:21.618 --> 00:36:22.911
listen to me carefully

442
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.121
The fox

443
00:36:25.663 --> 00:36:26.664
I return the favor

444
00:36:27.415 --> 00:36:28.833
Take revenge too

445
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.543
Definitely!

446
00:36:35.465 --> 00:36:37.300
Lang, no, come to your senses.

447
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.719
Myoyeonggak

448
00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:41.304
To Myoyeonggak

449
00:36:43.848 --> 00:36:44.849
Langa

450
00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:46.809
Langa!

451
00:36:55.318 --> 00:36:56.319
identity card

452
00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:00.156
passed

453
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.996
Are you that bitch from earlier?

454
00:37:11.501 --> 00:37:12.919
You got the wrong person.

455
00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:21.427
No one can fool me about my sharp eyesight, huh?

456
00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:27.934
I am a person with a certain identity.

457
00:37:28.017 --> 00:37:29.769
It's not you that's important

458
00:37:30.812 --> 00:37:32.438
Lee, Jeong Dae-seung as a servant

459
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.065
Who am I?

460
00:37:34.941 --> 00:37:36.609
Ha, Jeong, Daeseung Jeong?

461
00:37:37.193 --> 00:37:39.195
How do I deal with people like you?

462
00:37:39.278 --> 00:37:42.198
Cutting the tendons of the whole body...

463
00:37:44.283 --> 00:37:47.161
He's good at torture
I am the one who even received a medal.

464
00:37:47.662 --> 00:37:49.789
Buy, buy, buy, buy, please save me

465
00:37:50.665 --> 00:37:51.749
I'm not really

466
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.379
I heard you got a gunshot wound on your shoulder

467
00:37:56.462 --> 00:37:57.630
I bet my dead parents

468
00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:00.383
No way

469
00:38:00.466 --> 00:38:01.467
Hey, Mr. Lee

470
00:38:05.763 --> 00:38:08.016
- Stay still!
- No, no!

471
00:38:11.644 --> 00:38:12.645
what?

472
00:38:16.774 --> 00:38:18.026
Ryuhei Kato

473
00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:20.361
He is the Director of Police Affairs at the Japanese Government General of Korea.

474
00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:31.205
What are you doing?

475
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.084
bomb incident suspect
I'm being interrogated

476
00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:36.669
Who is this person?

477
00:38:36.753 --> 00:38:38.963
I'm a reporter at Sunwoo Ilbo.

478
00:38:39.213 --> 00:38:40.256
I will reveal the background

479
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.011
That woman is Sunwoo Ilbo

480
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.556
- Yes?
- My father

481
00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:52.268
Tawara Show, CEO of Sunwoo Ilbo

482
00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:55.980
My mother is a Japanese noblewoman.

483
00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:57.523
Dawara Show

484
00:38:58.357 --> 00:39:01.027
The richest man in Gyeongseong
Are you talking about Seon Woo-chan?

485
00:39:09.368 --> 00:39:12.371
Your daughter is Tawara Kinko.

486
00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:14.457
For reference

487
00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:16.584
My sister-in-law

488
00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:22.590
sorry

489
00:39:22.673 --> 00:39:25.927
I guess I've lost my mind
Forgive me, lady.

490
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.011
wake up

491
00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:35.353
Me, me, my negligence
Do you understand?

492
00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:36.604
I understand

493
00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:38.439
But what should I do?

494
00:39:38.523 --> 00:39:40.775
I'm the type of person who has to repay my debt.

495
00:39:42.485 --> 00:39:44.821
Please cut the tendon

496
00:39:45.196 --> 00:39:46.197
right leg

497
00:40:02.338 --> 00:40:03.714
- Goodbye
- Uh

498
00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:06.968
I'm having a good time

499
00:40:19.188 --> 00:40:20.273
Where are you? huh?

500
00:40:20.648 --> 00:40:22.233
Where should I go? Mr.

501
00:40:24.902 --> 00:40:25.987
Excuse me

502
00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:29.490
Mr.

503
00:40:35.913 --> 00:40:37.039
good

504
00:40:47.175 --> 00:40:48.176
need to think

505
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.053
Why did Rangi ask me to come here?

506
00:40:52.471 --> 00:40:53.472
Excuse me

507
00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:01.856
의원이라도 불러 드릴까요?

508
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.441
What are you doing here?

509
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.444
With Myongwolgwan
This is the best restaurant in Gyeongseong.

510
00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:07.904
That's it?

511
00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:09.030
yes?

512
00:41:09.113 --> 00:41:10.114
Please look at him for a moment.

513
00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:25.129
Hey

514
00:41:28.674 --> 00:41:30.259
Are you the same old man from a while ago?

515
00:41:34.347 --> 00:41:35.348
Excuse me

516
00:42:05.753 --> 00:42:06.754
It's family.

517
00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:10.800
If you sacrifice your daughter
Can I buy more?

518
00:42:10.883 --> 00:42:12.260
father

519
00:42:13.928 --> 00:42:17.098
Living long
Enough to trade it for a child

520
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.641
Is it worth it?

521
00:42:20.851 --> 00:42:21.852
Take it away

522
00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:24.563
That's it

523
00:42:25.273 --> 00:42:26.649
It's your choice.

524
00:43:07.606 --> 00:43:08.607
thank you

525
00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:10.735
thank you

526
00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:14.864
Father, father!

527
00:43:15.197 --> 00:43:16.365
father

528
00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:18.117
father

529
00:43:18.868 --> 00:43:21.662
father

530
00:43:26.334 --> 00:43:27.335
don't cry

531
00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:29.503
The worldly connection has just been broken

532
00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:32.673
Now never again

533
00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:34.967
There won't be any tears

534
00:43:47.229 --> 00:43:48.230
Who are you?

535
00:43:57.907 --> 00:43:59.450
People call me this

536
00:44:03.871 --> 00:44:06.874
It's called Samcheongap Automatic Bangsak.

537
00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.293
Dongbangsak

538
00:44:10.211 --> 00:44:12.380
The one with the longest lifespan in oriental folklore?

539
00:44:14.173 --> 00:44:16.050
Ai, so Rangi...

540
00:44:17.426 --> 00:44:20.096
Hey, that's a good thing, let's borrow some life.

541
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:21.305
non-human

542
00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:23.974
How can you covet longevity?

543
00:44:24.058 --> 00:44:26.894
- My brother is dying.
- Don't you know?

544
00:44:26.977 --> 00:44:28.771
Dealing with monsters requires a price.

545
00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:31.399
So you made this rule?

546
00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:33.401
It means not to covet life easily.

547
00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:37.113
In general, the rules are
Because I tend to make it

548
00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:41.492
save my brother

549
00:44:42.159 --> 00:44:43.661
- Right now
- cut

550
00:44:44.453 --> 00:44:45.538
If you cut me

551
00:44:46.622 --> 00:44:47.706
I can have a lifespan

552
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.341
What is this?

553
00:44:57.425 --> 00:44:59.260
This is a body that cannot die at will.

554
00:45:15.693 --> 00:45:17.528
Who are you? Where is Lee Yeon going?

555
00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:20.906
Can't you hear me?

556
00:45:29.457 --> 00:45:30.583
what?

557
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:32.460
Am I dead?

558
00:45:35.296 --> 00:45:36.589
Hey, hey!

559
00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:38.090
hey!

560
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:54.732
What is this...

561
00:45:55.232 --> 00:45:56.525
I need to find Lee Yeon

562
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.381
Leeyeon

563
00:46:20.508 --> 00:46:21.509
Yiyeon!

564
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:23.969
hey!

565
00:46:30.434 --> 00:46:31.435
So

566
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.562
Are you going to draw a lottery for me now?

567
00:46:33.938 --> 00:46:37.066
If you bring what you picked,
I'm trading it for my life.

568
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.361
What did you hear here?

569
00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:42.696
To some people, they are as valuable as life.

570
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.491
Money, fame, family, luck

571
00:46:45.574 --> 00:46:46.700
and

572
00:46:47.076 --> 00:46:48.244
Uturi's Sword

573
00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:50.162
Uturi?

574
00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:52.998
Why the baby general’s knife?

575
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.251
the only one

576
00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.169
Because it's something that can cut me down

577
00:47:00.047 --> 00:47:01.048
Have you ever

578
00:47:02.383 --> 00:47:03.509
Are you going to die?

579
00:47:03.592 --> 00:47:05.219
All I have left is loneliness

580
00:47:06.554 --> 00:47:08.097
living for thousands of years

581
00:47:09.098 --> 00:47:10.140
cherish me

582
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:12.309
Everything I cared about

583
00:47:13.644 --> 00:47:15.104
disappear like dust

584
00:47:20.442 --> 00:47:21.443
yes

585
00:47:22.903 --> 00:47:23.904
Let's do it

586
00:47:23.988 --> 00:47:26.323
What should I pick?

587
00:47:28.742 --> 00:47:30.244
How long are you going to do this?

588
00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:33.831
Now

589
00:47:39.086 --> 00:47:40.087
Uturi's Sword

590
00:47:43.424 --> 00:47:45.718
Hey, nothing else really works, huh?

591
00:47:45.801 --> 00:47:47.261
I know very well

592
00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:49.096
That's in this era
Are you in the worst place?

593
00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:51.932
If you don't want to, you can give up.

594
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:53.392
Okay

595
00:47:54.685 --> 00:47:55.894
Just bring a sword

596
00:47:56.562 --> 00:47:58.105
Are you sure you're saving my little brother?

597
00:47:58.439 --> 00:47:59.440
Of course

598
00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:01.900
I'll bring it

599
00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:05.279
But you

600
00:48:06.447 --> 00:48:08.157
If my brother dies before then

601
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.451
cut it up

602
00:48:26.467 --> 00:48:28.135
Hey, can't you hear me?

603
00:48:28.552 --> 00:48:30.387
I'm here, right before your eyes!

604
00:48:36.435 --> 00:48:37.436
Ah

605
00:48:42.232 --> 00:48:43.233
IC

606
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.861
Ah, Mr.

607
00:48:48.322 --> 00:48:49.323
Wait a minute

608
00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:50.407
yes

609
00:48:50.824 --> 00:48:52.326
Do I have rhinitis?

610
00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:54.078
Oh, you idiot.

611
00:48:55.037 --> 00:48:56.038
Wow

612
00:49:00.584 --> 00:49:02.586
Even when I was young, I often fell ill.

613
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.464
Boy, were you born to harass me?

614
00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:07.633
bastard

615
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.719
What you say to your dying brother

616
00:49:11.553 --> 00:49:13.972
Just hold on until I come back.

617
00:49:16.725 --> 00:49:17.726
My brother

618
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.937
you never give up

619
00:49:45.212 --> 00:49:46.630
Ah!

620
00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:50.050
what?

621
00:50:17.578 --> 00:50:19.621
within time
Can Rangi be saved?

622
00:50:25.878 --> 00:50:26.879
The problem is

623
00:50:27.463 --> 00:50:29.590
In this era, the guy with the sword of Uturi

624
00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.468
After all, it’s me.

625
00:50:35.179 --> 00:50:36.180
Ah um ah

626
00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:39.391
Where the hell are you?

627
00:50:40.893 --> 00:50:43.562
Why can't I be reincarnated?

628
00:50:49.902 --> 00:50:51.779
Why are you acting like that? Really

629
00:50:53.071 --> 00:50:54.072
I'm embarrassed

630
00:50:55.324 --> 00:50:57.284
Lee Yeon, Lee Yeon!

631
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.787
uh? Lee Yeon

632
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.871
Kneel down

633
00:51:00.954 --> 00:51:02.790
- Wow, IC.
- Got it.

634
00:51:03.874 --> 00:51:05.918
These disguised raccoons

635
00:51:09.797 --> 00:51:10.964
I know your sins

636
00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:12.299
A sin?

637
00:51:12.382 --> 00:51:13.383
your wife's name

638
00:51:14.343 --> 00:51:16.011
- What?
- It's an embryonic sound.

639
00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:17.846
Ah, ah!

640
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.640
-Who said that name?
- Uh, wait, wait, wait.

641
00:51:19.723 --> 00:51:21.016
Say that name, Mr.

642
00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:22.851
He went away screaming

643
00:51:22.935 --> 00:51:24.269
Lee Yeon’s first love is Jonham.

644
00:51:24.353 --> 00:51:27.189
Ah, we
How do you know that?

645
00:51:27.272 --> 00:51:28.273
I'll change my name, I'll change my name

646
00:51:29.608 --> 00:51:31.902
Ah, right here with Lee Yeon.
What is there to fret about?

647
00:51:32.528 --> 00:51:33.529
What, man?

648
00:51:33.821 --> 00:51:35.614
What did you say just now? Ah um next?

649
00:51:36.573 --> 00:51:37.574
Ah um next?

650
00:51:37.658 --> 00:51:38.826
Aung Daung, Aung Daung

651
00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:41.286
Come here, come here

652
00:51:43.413 --> 00:51:44.706
Hey, hey!

653
00:51:44.998 --> 00:51:47.334
hey! what? Ah um next?

654
00:51:48.669 --> 00:51:50.462
Wow, Lee Yeon.
Stop it, please

655
00:51:50.546 --> 00:51:51.713
- Stop it, stop it.
- Ah um next?

656
00:51:51.797 --> 00:51:53.966
- Go, go, go, go
- Seobang

657
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:55.050
Go quickly

658
00:51:55.133 --> 00:51:56.134
Ah um next?

659
00:51:56.969 --> 00:51:57.970
I can't do it

660
00:51:58.053 --> 00:51:59.847
Everyone has times of wandering.

661
00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:04.184
My black moment was exactly at this time.

662
00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:08.480
Oh, what?

663
00:52:08.772 --> 00:52:10.732
It's all gone

664
00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:14.194
Lee Yeon, please quit opium.
This is an addiction

665
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.821
Hey

666
00:52:17.364 --> 00:52:18.657
If you don't do this at least

667
00:52:19.408 --> 00:52:21.451
I keep crying, what should I do? Mr.

668
00:52:21.785 --> 00:52:23.370
IC

669
00:52:25.497 --> 00:52:27.165
Okay, okay, get some sleep.

670
00:52:27.416 --> 00:52:28.584
I'll quickly go and get it.

671
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.101
What is it?

672
00:53:29.144 --> 00:53:30.437
Was there a mirror in this place?

673
00:53:35.943 --> 00:53:37.069
um

674
00:53:39.404 --> 00:53:40.405
um

675
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:52.250
Ah, Shinju’s child
What, did you put a mirror in a place like this?

676
00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:04.596
Mr.

677
00:54:05.389 --> 00:54:06.723
Die, you opium addict, nine-tailed fox.

678
00:54:07.015 --> 00:54:08.809
- I've come to take revenge, dear.
- IC

679
00:54:09.977 --> 00:54:10.978
What are you guys? Mr.

680
00:54:11.061 --> 00:54:12.354
You're the one who got struck by lightning!

681
00:54:12.437 --> 00:54:15.482
I don't like how it looks
Should I break my leg?

682
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:17.109
I, I am truly sorry.

683
00:54:17.192 --> 00:54:19.611
Huh? Okay? I'm going because I'm busy, okay?

684
00:54:19.695 --> 00:54:21.363
-Where are you going? Mr.
- Hey, Mr. Lee.

685
00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:24.700
IC

686
00:54:24.783 --> 00:54:27.536
Let's go, hey, go, go, go, go

687
00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:28.870
Do you want to get hit again? uh?

688
00:54:28.954 --> 00:54:30.747
Just wait and see, nine-tailed fox, you, Mr.

689
00:54:30.831 --> 00:54:33.166
Oh, I'm tired, Mr., I should have been a little nicer, really.

690
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.918
Huh? Lee Yeon?

691
00:54:35.002 --> 00:54:36.837
Shinjuya

692
00:54:48.432 --> 00:54:50.392
Why are you doing this?

693
00:54:51.518 --> 00:54:52.769
What's wrong?

694
00:54:59.234 --> 00:55:01.028
What are you doing now?

695
00:55:10.704 --> 00:55:11.705
Look

696
00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:13.415
If you suffocate like this,

697
00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:16.001
my precious food

698
00:55:16.877 --> 00:55:18.128
It flies away

699
00:55:18.587 --> 00:55:20.172
What?

700
00:55:48.116 --> 00:55:50.077
It's not about giving away life.

701
00:55:51.244 --> 00:55:52.662
He was a sucker.

702
00:55:53.997 --> 00:55:54.998
I need to tell Lee Yeon quickly.

703
00:55:58.668 --> 00:55:59.669
No way

704
00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:02.172
Can you see me?

705
00:56:02.255 --> 00:56:03.256
There you are

706
00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.561
It's not what you see

707
00:56:17.062 --> 00:56:18.605
He is the one who hears sounds.

708
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.531
Oh, I missed it.

709
00:56:28.323 --> 00:56:30.784
Bring me his body, bring me his body

710
00:56:30.867 --> 00:56:31.868
yes

711
00:56:43.713 --> 00:56:44.881
Where are you going?

712
00:56:45.257 --> 00:56:47.801
Uh, well, go for a walk, go for a drink.

713
00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:49.386
I'll take you there

714
00:56:49.469 --> 00:56:51.304
No, uh, he, alone, alone

715
00:56:51.721 --> 00:56:54.057
How can you go alone?

716
00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:55.475
Develop independence

717
00:56:55.559 --> 00:56:57.227
You're in, you're in
Go in, go in

718
00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.395
No...

719
00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:10.699
Lee Yeon!

720
00:57:10.782 --> 00:57:12.492
Wake up, Lee Yeon!

721
00:57:41.104 --> 00:57:42.105
that

722
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:45.150
Isn't the thunder in the tail a bit overkill? uh?

723
00:57:45.233 --> 00:57:48.195
How dare you disguise yourself in this body?

724
00:57:48.486 --> 00:57:49.487
Besides

725
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:51.239
That's mine

726
00:57:51.656 --> 00:57:53.783
Uh, well, right

727
00:57:54.201 --> 00:57:56.912
Ah, this is strictly speaking
Well, your stuff is mine

728
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:58.079
- Well, that's it.
- Shut up

729
00:57:58.163 --> 00:58:00.832
Until now, you have touched my things
The one who survived

730
00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:02.500
There wasn't a single one

731
00:58:02.584 --> 00:58:04.044
You know, yeah

732
00:58:04.127 --> 00:58:05.295
I know better than anyone else

733
00:58:05.962 --> 00:58:09.090
But I'm a bit busy right now, right?

734
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:42.499
Ah, Mr.

735
00:58:42.749 --> 00:58:44.125
- Wow, stone head.
- Stone head

736
00:58:56.096 --> 00:58:57.722
What is it? Mr. Lee

737
00:59:10.652 --> 00:59:11.987
Hey, Mr.

738
00:59:16.324 --> 00:59:17.409
AC

739
00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:23.498
Hey!

740
00:59:27.961 --> 00:59:28.962
Hey, you bastard

741
00:59:29.045 --> 00:59:31.298
This is Ambada, huh? how is it?

742
00:59:31.548 --> 00:59:32.882
You didn't know, right?

743
00:59:38.763 --> 00:59:40.098
Hey, Mr. Lee

744
00:59:40.181 --> 00:59:41.182
you

745
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.648
Let go

746
00:59:49.983 --> 00:59:51.026
Let go, you bastard.

747
00:59:53.653 --> 00:59:55.363
Hey

748
01:00:00.452 --> 01:00:01.453
Ah um

749
01:00:04.956 --> 01:00:05.957
Ah-eum

750
01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:07.459
I was born again

751
01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:12.255
Where?

752
01:00:12.756 --> 01:00:13.757
where are you?

753
01:00:16.009 --> 01:00:17.010
That, over there

754
01:00:17.969 --> 01:00:18.970
Ten thousand, ten thousand?

755
01:00:19.888 --> 01:00:21.264
I

756
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.059
I'll go, ah

757
01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:29.606
Ah, ah!

758
01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:34.527
Wow, it's really gross.

759
01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:39.074
Will Rangi be safe?

760
01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:41.159
please

761
01:01:00.929 --> 01:01:02.597
What is it? Where did your body go?

762
01:01:16.778 --> 01:01:17.779
Find it

763
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:19.531
surely

764
01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:32.836
Are you there?

765
01:01:42.178 --> 01:01:43.513
What's going on?

766
01:01:43.596 --> 01:01:44.889
I'm looking for someone

767
01:01:45.473 --> 01:01:46.599
There's only one room left

768
01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:49.477
This is the gisaeng’s quarters, please go back.

769
01:01:55.442 --> 01:01:56.443
What should I do?

770
01:01:57.277 --> 01:01:58.278
I have to search

771
01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:03.491
Would you mind?

772
01:02:04.075 --> 01:02:05.076
our boss

773
01:02:05.702 --> 01:02:06.703
Even if I call you?

774
01:02:13.126 --> 01:02:14.544
rummage through

775
01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:16.171
He must be

776
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:18.840
It's inside Myoyeonggak.

777
01:02:39.068 --> 01:02:41.321
Why is my body here...

778
01:02:43.615 --> 01:02:44.616
sister

779
01:02:44.991 --> 01:02:46.201
Can I do this?

780
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:48.995
This is what the customer asked for.

781
01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:51.080
The boss gave permission

782
01:02:51.164 --> 01:02:53.541
If I don't come back by midnight

783
01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.668
Could you please move my sister's room?

784
01:02:56.544 --> 01:02:58.004
How can you say that...

785
01:02:59.172 --> 01:03:01.174
I'm not the type of person to trust others.

786
01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:08.097
A toxic guy

787
01:03:12.894 --> 01:03:14.187
I knew it would be like this

788
01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:35.708
Nothing bad happened, right?

789
01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:37.418
- There was.
- nothing happened

790
01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:40.088
There wasn't

791
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:41.422
tell the truth

792
01:03:41.506 --> 01:03:42.507
thank you

793
01:03:54.018 --> 01:03:55.436
No, you can't be fooled!

794
01:03:58.982 --> 01:04:00.608
Oh no, no

795
01:04:00.942 --> 01:04:03.319
No way

796
01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:05.238
AC

797
01:04:24.966 --> 01:04:26.759
Can you see me?

798
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.390
really? Can you see me?

799
01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:34.183
Are you a ghost?

800
01:04:35.768 --> 01:04:36.769
Why is it only visible to you?

801
01:04:37.312 --> 01:04:38.980
My grandmother is a shaman.

802
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.321
Yeon!

803
01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:47.405
Not yet

804
01:04:48.448 --> 01:04:49.782
Time is running out

805
01:04:50.617 --> 01:04:52.827
Ah, this damn child
Where are you doing?

806
01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:56.080
Hurry up

807
01:04:56.748 --> 01:04:58.082
You have to hurry, Yuna.

808
01:05:03.046 --> 01:05:04.047
Open the door!

809
01:05:06.966 --> 01:05:08.843
C, a, really

810
01:05:14.015 --> 01:05:15.099
black?

811
01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:16.726
here

812
01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:17.935
The contract has been concluded

813
01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:19.437
Wait a minute

814
01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:21.481
Did you take off the hem?

815
01:05:21.689 --> 01:05:22.690
What do you mean hem?

816
01:05:22.774 --> 01:05:25.443
My lottery ticket

817
01:05:25.526 --> 01:05:26.736
You played with your hands

818
01:05:26.819 --> 01:05:27.904
Is that possible?

819
01:05:29.781 --> 01:05:31.783
There are a total of 44 marbles in the bucket.

820
01:05:32.992 --> 01:05:35.370
But I didn’t take anything away from mine.

821
01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.622
They all have Uturi’s sword written on them?

822
01:05:39.165 --> 01:05:40.249
Do I look like I'm wearing hot pants?

823
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:41.459
knowingly

824
01:05:42.543 --> 01:05:43.544
Why did you get the sword?

825
01:05:43.628 --> 01:05:45.129
- Same reason as you.
- Ah

826
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.423
can cut me

827
01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:48.800
Because it's the only thing?

828
01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:50.593
Is it a lie to say you want to die?

829
01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.096
You wanted to get rid of this sword

830
01:05:53.179 --> 01:05:55.515
Stealing people's lives
'Cause I've been living forever

831
01:05:56.808 --> 01:05:58.184
What are the younger humans?

832
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:00.603
It's a simple trick

833
01:06:00.687 --> 01:06:01.854
사흘이면 원래대로 늙어

834
01:06:02.313 --> 01:06:03.314
When that time comes

835
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.149
I'm not here

836
01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:07.026
Ah, this kid

837
01:06:07.985 --> 01:06:08.986
Still

838
01:06:09.862 --> 01:06:10.863
you can't cut me

839
01:06:10.947 --> 01:06:13.866
Why?

840
01:06:14.992 --> 01:06:16.411
your younger brother

841
01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:18.329
I'm being held hostage

842
01:06:24.377 --> 01:06:25.378
What should I do?

843
01:06:26.587 --> 01:06:27.630
I don't have time

844
01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:31.509
Cut this guy down now
If you don't jump into a cabinet of this era...

845
01:06:32.385 --> 01:06:33.386
where

846
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.221
Let's see who dies first?

847
01:06:49.569 --> 01:06:50.570
Ah, Mr.

848
01:06:53.614 --> 01:06:54.699
What's wrong?

849
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.996
I didn't live longer than you for nothing

850
01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:26.230
It's one of the ten longevity

851
01:07:26.606 --> 01:07:27.607
leatherback turtle

852
01:07:28.816 --> 01:07:29.859
You're laughing

853
01:07:30.067 --> 01:07:32.945
Those guys are in the same gang as that guy.
Do you think I don’t know?

854
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:34.363
I'm with you

855
01:07:34.655 --> 01:07:36.157
I borrowed this guy’s body.

856
01:07:37.325 --> 01:07:38.701
You're talking nonsense, Mr.

857
01:07:42.121 --> 01:07:44.290
my soul
I borrowed this little body

858
01:07:44.373 --> 01:07:45.374
How do I let you know?

859
01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:53.216
Ah, Mr.

860
01:07:54.759 --> 01:07:56.385
yourself
To someone who doesn't try to save me

861
01:07:56.469 --> 01:07:57.845
There is no such thing as salvation!

862
01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:01.015
Whether you live as a human or a fox
It's your heart

863
01:08:01.516 --> 01:08:03.476
Remember this one thing, kid.

864
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:07.188
To the guy who doesn't save himself
There is no such thing as salvation

865
01:08:11.567 --> 01:08:12.652
Turtle, turtle

866
01:08:13.444 --> 01:08:15.112
take out your head

867
01:08:15.446 --> 01:08:16.489
If you don't give it away

868
01:08:16.572 --> 01:08:17.949
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

869
01:08:19.408 --> 01:08:20.576
Turtle, turtle

870
01:08:21.369 --> 01:08:22.370
take out your head

871
01:08:22.954 --> 01:08:24.121
If you don't give it away

872
01:08:24.205 --> 01:08:25.206
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

873
01:08:25.289 --> 01:08:26.749
Turtle, turtle

874
01:08:26.833 --> 01:08:28.334
take out your head

875
01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:30.169
If you don't give it away

876
01:08:30.253 --> 01:08:32.255
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

877
01:08:32.338 --> 01:08:34.966
Turtle, turtle, put out your head.

878
01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:36.551
If you don't give it away

879
01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.511
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

880
01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:41.848
Turtle, turtle, put out your head.

881
01:08:42.139 --> 01:08:43.391
If you don't give it away

882
01:08:43.933 --> 01:08:45.226
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

883
01:08:45.893 --> 01:08:47.103
Turtle, turtle

884
01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.313
take out your head

885
01:08:49.772 --> 01:08:50.815
If you don't give it away

886
01:08:51.315 --> 01:08:52.942
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

887
01:08:53.025 --> 01:08:54.318
Turtle, turtle

888
01:08:54.402 --> 01:08:56.112
take out your head

889
01:08:56.195 --> 01:08:57.697
If you don't give it away

890
01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.781
I will catch it and roast it and eat it.

891
01:08:59.073 --> 01:09:00.241
Turtle, turtle

892
01:09:00.324 --> 01:09:01.826
take out your head

893
01:09:02.535 --> 01:09:03.619
If you don't give it away

894
01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:05.872
Let's catch it, roast it and eat it!

895
01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:53.169
Kill it!

896
01:10:19.487 --> 01:10:21.238
oh my

897
01:10:51.268 --> 01:10:53.437
It's exactly up to the hour.

898
01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:55.898
If you don't come back in time, the door will be closed.

899
01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:15.334
Jia will be waiting

900
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:53.831
Dongbangsak is dead, right?

901
01:11:58.169 --> 01:12:00.838
It's a waste, it was a pretty good amount of money to make.

902
01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:03.382
Let's do it later

903
01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:04.467
yes

904
01:12:08.763 --> 01:12:11.849
By the way, is Lee Yeon still handsome?

905
01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:17.521
I'm going to try it with him
It's been hundreds of years of training and training.

906
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:20.941
Do you know what I mean?

907
01:12:22.026 --> 01:12:23.027
I understand

908
01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:25.821
Then

909
01:12:27.531 --> 01:12:29.784
Would you please give me the biggest and prettiest one?

910
01:12:33.162 --> 01:12:34.997
It's been a long time since we met

911
01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.231
someone

912
01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:44.108
Trapped me in the past

913
01:13:45.985 --> 01:13:47.361
But he doesn't know

914
01:13:48.821 --> 01:13:50.656
In an era where there is no woman to protect

915
01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:54.451
Gumiho is more than they know
That it's merciless

916
01:14:00.499 --> 01:14:01.625
It's hunting time

917
01:14:35.826 --> 01:14:37.453
Long time no see, fox

918
01:14:39.663 --> 01:14:40.748
you with that crazy girl

919
01:14:40.956 --> 01:14:42.333
- Hey
- What exactly is it?

920
01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:43.417
you

921
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.585
do mine

922
01:14:45.044 --> 01:14:46.212
I will have it

923
01:14:46.295 --> 01:14:48.505
By killing
Even if it means turning it into a stuffed animal.

924
01:14:50.049 --> 01:14:51.675
Only targeting beautiful women?

925
01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:54.386
If we solve this case
You can catch the guy who stabbed you.

926
01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:55.721
Are you going to take revenge?

927
01:14:56.305 --> 01:14:59.099
Well, maybe I'll help Lee Yeon.
Should I help him?

928
01:14:59.475 --> 01:15:01.143
Who are we?

929
01:15:01.227 --> 01:15:03.812
Foxes pay their debts properly
