﻿1
00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:55.345
That child
Would you like to stay overnight?

2
00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:59.224
you are the boss

3
00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:02.894
I can't talk to this bitch.

4
00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:05.564
You are fluent in Korean.

5
00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:08.567
Joseon
With girls

6
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.485
I've been in a lot of relationships

7
00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.864
I'm going to do this today

8
00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:16.032
I am not a prostitute who sells my body.

9
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.742
They are entertainers.

10
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.120
If I say I live

11
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.622
You guys sell art too

12
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:24.624
Selling your body too

13
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.167
What if you don’t want to sell it?

14
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.337
There's going to be a hole in this bitch's head.

15
00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.318
How about me?

16
00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:53.695
The reason you embrace me instead of that child is

17
00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:55.739
Oh, great.

18
00:02:56.823 --> 00:02:58.325
How much are you worth?

19
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:01.494
It's even free

20
00:03:05.248 --> 00:03:06.499
You're an easy girl.

21
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.546
Take it off too

22
00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.096
There is one condition

23
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.222
Conditions?

24
00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:25.644
If you compete for alcohol with me and win,

25
00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.646
Do what you want with this bitch.

26
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.981
What a fun bitch.

27
00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:32.108
If I win, I'll have you

28
00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:36.154
I will have this wrist too

29
00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:44.162
- That's what you do.
- instead

30
00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:46.748
I will make the rules

31
00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:54.297
Hey, eat it slowly

32
00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:57.384
um

33
00:03:57.801 --> 00:03:59.678
You too have a lot of events, huh?

34
00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:04.391
How long has it been since I came here?
Conscription, employment, and even robbery?

35
00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.018
Please buy me just one gun

36
00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:10.563
What's going on? If it's a gun, the kid will tremble

37
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.441
I will fight for independence

38
00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:16.653
we are

39
00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.656
The times we live in
On a mission to protect

40
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.740
You came here

41
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.704
Grab the red and white mask and find the guardian stone.
return safely

42
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.080
that's our mission

43
00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:29.249
- Still...
- If you want to join the independence movement

44
00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.751
thinking of going back home
don't do it

45
00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:33.670
Stay here until the end and take responsibility

46
00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:37.298
humans of this era
It's something you risk your life for.

47
00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:41.594
Can we really go back?

48
00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:43.513
I have to go

49
00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:45.306
There's no wifi here

50
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.225
No mint chocolate

51
00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:50.895
We don't even have Jia.

52
00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:52.897
Instead, there is Lee Rang.

53
00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:57.235
Hey, as soon as I got here
I saw the kid dying

54
00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:58.737
I thought my heart was going to explode?

55
00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.447
You saved me

56
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.700
I hope you can get along better without me

57
00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:06.619
Like the leader of that bandit group.
and sat down

58
00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:09.748
Hey, I'm walking a long way
I don't know if I'm going to fall

59
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.624
When are you going to speak?

60
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.001
what?

61
00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:16.504
Well, in a month
Suddenly disappear?

62
00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:17.589
Oh, you too

63
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.758
I need to give myself time to accept the breakup.

64
00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.515
Oh, what's going on?

65
00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:30.268
Eat, eat, eat, uh

66
00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:32.062
What should I do?

67
00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:33.772
- Ugh, what is it?
- Ranga

68
00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:36.941
Langa

69
00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.422
Get started!

70
00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:46.219
Oh, what should I do?

71
00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:48.680
Oh, I'm going to die like that.

72
00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:50.682
Oh, what should I do?

73
00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:46.362
Pathetic guy

74
00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:03.838
It's okay, it's okay

75
00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:15.934
Bring a jar

76
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:19.437
Hey, get the jar.

77
00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:52.011
Yes, that’s Ryu Hong-ju.

78
00:08:54.097 --> 00:08:55.848
But where did this guy go? Langa

79
00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:57.225
Langa

80
00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:02.063
It's because these people are so dishonest

81
00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:04.482
How can you properly function as an in-house employee?

82
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:07.485
How dare lowly gisaeng bitches...

83
00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:24.669
It's broken

84
00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:27.380
Can you give me that?

85
00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:49.027
Who are you?

86
00:09:56.284 --> 00:09:57.410
You like gayageum, right?

87
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.891
You're alive.

88
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.684
You in this era

89
00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:23.102
I'm alive like this

90
00:10:23.644 --> 00:10:25.730
Brother, you never give up

91
00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:28.358

The answer is also contained here

92
00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:30.151
Lee Yeon-i

93
00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:32.278
It's not a coincidence

94
00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:36.324
So what is it?

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:52.465

96
00:10:52.548 --> 00:10:57.220

♪ Become a star

I'll have to touch it to see if it's real or not.

107
00:11:50.815 --> 00:11:52.066
be quiet

108
00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:19.385
Are you really a mermaid? you

109
00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:20.470
I'm mixed race

110
00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:21.846
father is a human fisherman

111
00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.264
What are you doing in the human world?

112
00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:24.474
To become a singer

113
00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:25.725
Become a singer

114
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.393
Whether it's a spectacle or not

115
00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:29.687
Do one of the two

116
00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:42.492
glutinous rice cake

117
00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:45.870
Wait a minute

118
00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:52.251
These are my scales

119
00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:53.586
If you ever need me...

120
00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:54.670
no need

121
00:12:58.466 --> 00:12:59.634
take it

122
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.511
I don't need it

123
00:13:06.307 --> 00:13:07.308
hello

124
00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:14.482
The tie looks good on you

125
00:13:26.244 --> 00:13:27.662
Why did you do that?

126
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:29.664
Because of things like me

127
00:13:32.124 --> 00:13:34.919
I originally wanted the world
There are only two distinctions

128
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.880
Are you on my side or not?

129
00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:41.175
Either risk your life to protect it or

130
00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:43.010
Risk your life and throw it away

131
00:13:43.928 --> 00:13:45.638
This is my first time as a boss.

132
00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:48.391
The person who treated the gisaeng like people

133
00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.560
Did you cry earlier?

134
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:53.396
I didn't cry until the end

135
00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:56.148
Because the boss taught me that.

136
00:13:58.276 --> 00:13:59.277
Well done

137
00:14:01.404 --> 00:14:02.405
Are you full?

138
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.031
I'm full

139
00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:07.285
I just drank alcohol without any snacks.
I feel empty, man.

140
00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:09.620
Would you like to bake some?

141
00:14:09.704 --> 00:14:12.331
What time is it and I still haven’t come in?
Really, shit

142
00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:15.293
Oh, this bastard, really.

143
00:14:39.609 --> 00:14:40.610
Aren’t you sleeping?

144
00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:43.237
Where have you been and what have you been doing?

145
00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:44.447
I drank alcohol, why?

146
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.241
You have a 10 o’clock curfew from now on.

147
00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:48.743
crazy guy

148
00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:50.578
i don't trust you

149
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.851
Who are you?

150
00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:04.360
You are the gatekeeper of this place.

151
00:16:07.113 --> 00:16:09.865
You smell bloody.

152
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:12.576
Descendants of Baekdu Mountain tigers

153
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.663
How can you covet a wrong place?

154
00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:18.040
It is said that this body is corrupted.

155
00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:19.417
go back

156
00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:22.586
What's in that back case

157
00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:26.340
There is only one and only one

158
00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:27.717
What's inside me

159
00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:29.885
It's like

160
00:16:29.969 --> 00:16:33.556
It is a seal that cannot be broken for 500 years.

161
00:16:33.931 --> 00:16:34.932
today

162
00:16:37.268 --> 00:16:38.269
It will be solved

163
00:17:57.431 --> 00:17:58.432
Let's do this.

164
00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:01.060
I left the scorched rice at home without it.
I have to go quickly.

165
00:18:01.602 --> 00:18:02.728
Hit it!

166
00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:08.025
It's fire

167
00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:14.198
Poor thing

168
00:18:57.408 --> 00:18:58.409
Now

169
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.245
Go show Lee Yeon your pretty eyes

170
00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:10.129
What do you want?

171
00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:13.716
this?

172
00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:17.011
It seems like a valuable item.

173
00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:51.629
Where are you?

174
00:19:52.379 --> 00:19:53.464
Where are you?

175
00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.149
I found it

176
00:20:23.077 --> 00:20:24.954
look at me

177
00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:29.458
look at me

178
00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:34.129
Why did you do that? Why did you break your promise? why!

179
00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:39.176
What's going on?

180
00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:40.594
There's someone in the room

181
00:20:47.977 --> 00:20:50.104
Huh? There's nothing?

182
00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:51.313
You weren't dreaming?

183
00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:52.898
There was definitely someone there!

184
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:55.192
What is it? who?

185
00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:57.444
I don't know

186
00:20:58.112 --> 00:20:59.405
I don't know what it is

187
00:21:00.406 --> 00:21:02.241
I feel like I've seen something I shouldn't have seen

188
00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:21.552
Who is this?

189
00:21:24.847 --> 00:21:27.099
Ah, master, why are you here?

190
00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:29.852
'Cause I'm the boss here

191
00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:32.938
Uh, somehow, uh, for now

192
00:21:33.522 --> 00:21:35.065
My dreams were a bit disturbing last night.

193
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:38.986
How dare you run away from me
Are you crawling under Lee Yeon?

194
00:21:39.486 --> 00:21:40.904
You tried to kill me

195
00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:42.489
What happens if I catch my eye?

196
00:21:42.573 --> 00:21:44.074
Come here, Gusinju!

197
00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:45.200
I hate it

198
00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:46.952
Is everything that comes into my forest mine?

199
00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:50.372
Gusinju

200
00:21:51.331 --> 00:21:52.624
remember clearly

201
00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:54.418
Next time you see me

202
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.504
At least you won't be able to use your limbs.

203
00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:00.132
Please save me

204
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:02.843
Let's get hit first

205
00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:06.847
No! no!

206
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.182
Shinjuya

207
00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:10.434
Lee Yeon...

208
00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:14.605
- Hey, I...
- Nice to meet you, Shinju.

209
00:22:16.106 --> 00:22:17.107
Has it become cuter?

210
00:22:18.192 --> 00:22:19.318
Do you two know each other?

211
00:22:23.072 --> 00:22:24.531
That's right

212
00:22:31.246 --> 00:22:32.247
eat more

213
00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:34.416
I don't like it, I'm full

214
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.127
Ah, this guy, this
Just by looking at it, you can see that it is corrupt and corrupt.

215
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:38.545
Eat more, you need to gain weight

216
00:22:38.629 --> 00:22:40.297
Who are you to say this or that?

217
00:22:41.548 --> 00:22:42.883
If you keep not listening to me like this

218
00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:45.469
What? What are you going to do?

219
00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:52.935
boom, airplane

220
00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:55.187
kid, crazy

221
00:22:55.854 --> 00:22:57.189
So hurry up and eat

222
00:22:57.397 --> 00:22:58.398
Baby

223
00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:00.025
I'll go out and come back

224
00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:01.568
Oh, that's a disease too

225
00:23:01.652 --> 00:23:02.820
Hey, aren’t you looking for a red and white mask?

226
00:23:07.116 --> 00:23:08.117
fool

227
00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:09.368
Did you find him?

228
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.661
well

229
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.455
I can watch you do it and teach you.

230
00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:14.665
Boy, really, hey

231
00:23:14.748 --> 00:23:16.291
I'm a bit busy right now

232
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.797
What do you mean you found it?

233
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.507
Who knows? Inside there

234
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.175
I was curious about this before

235
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:27.761
you with that crazy girl
What exactly is it between you?

236
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.312
let's swear

237
00:23:37.604 --> 00:23:40.399
no matter what happens to us
Let's protect each other

238
00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:43.360
Are you sure we will become mountain gods and meet again?

239
00:23:44.903 --> 00:23:46.071
Hey, Cheon Muyoung!

240
00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:53.328
promise

241
00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:54.955
promise

242
00:24:08.135 --> 00:24:09.511
Oh, what?

243
00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:11.972
Just like a broken oath

244
00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:14.433
Eat, eat

245
00:24:17.603 --> 00:24:19.229
Someone wants to meet me urgently?

246
00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:20.606
who?

247
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:36.663
Ta-da

248
00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:39.208
What kind of flower is this?

249
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:43.337
um

250
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:46.006
Is it your favorite flower?

251
00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:47.674
I remember that too

252
00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:50.052
That's the Chun Mooyoung I knew.

253
00:24:52.721 --> 00:24:53.972
I have a bundle of questions

254
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.935
You, the grandmother of the undressing group,
He died at the seat of the mountain god of the north.

255
00:24:58.018 --> 00:25:00.187
I heard a rumor that it was made of stone

256
00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:04.066
It's true

257
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:05.901
Grandma is among us
I thought you were the prettiest

258
00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:07.945
Why?

259
00:25:08.487 --> 00:25:09.655
For doing something worth it

260
00:25:09.738 --> 00:25:11.031
So until now

261
00:25:11.698 --> 00:25:12.699
For hundreds of years?

262
00:25:12.783 --> 00:25:15.202
I was trapped like a stone

263
00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:19.915
I endured it while thinking of you?

264
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:22.167
Our beautiful Hongju

265
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.628
Just as I hoped

266
00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:28.882
With my seven younger brother owls,
Oh, I hope you'll be living well

267
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:31.802
you don't know

268
00:25:37.057 --> 00:25:38.433
my parents and my younger siblings

269
00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:40.686
We all starved to death.

270
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:44.439
I went home and found the body.

271
00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:47.985
Become a mountain god to me
They made such a fuss about me telling me to raise the family.

272
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.072
When incompetent and weak parents are even good,

273
00:25:53.782 --> 00:25:55.200
I can't even protect my babies.

274
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.245
sorry

275
00:25:59.913 --> 00:26:01.873
I couldn't be your friend and stay by your side.

276
00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:03.292
There's nothing to be sorry about

277
00:26:04.876 --> 00:26:05.961
Let me ask you just one question

278
00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:07.379
Lee Yeon and you

279
00:26:08.046 --> 00:26:09.256
What happened?

280
00:26:10.007 --> 00:26:12.467
What happened?
You couldn't even kill a single ant baby

281
00:26:13.343 --> 00:26:14.636
Cut open his brother's stomach?

282
00:26:17.556 --> 00:26:18.890
the pain I felt

283
00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.184
I hope Yeon feels the same way

284
00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:24.396
Like I lost my only brother

285
00:26:26.148 --> 00:26:27.149
What are you talking about?

286
00:26:29.026 --> 00:26:30.027
Yeon is coming

287
00:26:34.823 --> 00:26:36.241
They say your identity is a secret

288
00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:39.661
There's something I want to check

289
00:26:47.878 --> 00:26:49.504
Someone looked at me in a hurry and said it was you?

290
00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:52.632
Well, just like that before, he left.

291
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.427
What's with the flowers that don't look good, huh?

292
00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:17.824
what?

293
00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:20.619
It suddenly got dark

294
00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:23.830
What are you doing now?

295
00:27:37.552 --> 00:27:38.553
Hongjoo

296
00:27:39.513 --> 00:27:40.514
Hongju, where are you?

297
00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:42.265
Why is it like that?

298
00:27:44.768 --> 00:27:45.769
Yuna

299
00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:48.438
Yuna, why are you doing this? are you okay?

300
00:27:48.522 --> 00:27:49.523
Hongjoo

301
00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:52.150
Why am I like this, why am I like this?

302
00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:03.328
what's the matter?

303
00:28:03.412 --> 00:28:04.579
What's going on?

304
00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.207
who is there

305
00:28:07.499 --> 00:28:08.500
Who?

306
00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:14.423
flower seller

307
00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:18.468
Hongjoo

308
00:28:19.094 --> 00:28:20.762
Why am I doing this, huh?

309
00:28:23.849 --> 00:28:26.226
Let's go, I'll take you home

310
00:28:39.865 --> 00:28:40.866
still you

311
00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:43.452
You have Lee Yeon in your heart.

312
00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:45.412
Even then

313
00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:47.038
Even now

314
00:28:47.998 --> 00:28:49.082
Did you check it for no reason?

315
00:29:01.386 --> 00:29:02.387
my eyes

316
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:04.264
-What's wrong with my eyes?
- Lee Yeon

317
00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:06.183
Take a deep breath

318
00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:10.937
Open your eyes

319
00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:16.026
What do you see?

320
00:29:17.736 --> 00:29:18.737
no

321
00:29:19.404 --> 00:29:20.405
I can't see it

322
00:29:21.406 --> 00:29:22.657
Please give me some light

323
00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:27.037
I'll check the pupil reaction.

324
00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:36.004
yes

325
00:29:37.464 --> 00:29:38.465
There's no response

326
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.010
What are you talking about?

327
00:29:44.012 --> 00:29:45.180
say!

328
00:29:46.264 --> 00:29:47.807
I think you've lost your eyesight

329
00:29:51.645 --> 00:29:52.646
look at me

330
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.272
look at me

331
00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:55.357
That girl last night

332
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.109
Yes?

333
00:29:58.777 --> 00:29:59.778
It's him

334
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.863
It started when I made eye contact with him.

335
00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:13.667
What are those drops?

336
00:30:14.251 --> 00:30:15.252
I gave it to you

337
00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:16.628
I did a good thing

338
00:30:17.128 --> 00:30:18.380
Were you originally human?

339
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.052
My name, find my name

340
00:30:25.136 --> 00:30:26.137
Name?

341
00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:29.474
What does that matter?

342
00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:31.434
You are so special right now

343
00:30:31.518 --> 00:30:33.728
No! The nine-tailed fox knows

344
00:30:34.354 --> 00:30:36.231
- What?
- What are you doing?

345
00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:37.649
Don't look!

346
00:30:37.732 --> 00:30:39.276
You can't make eye contact

347
00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:43.446
What is that kid?

348
00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:45.740
I'm Saetani

349
00:30:47.867 --> 00:30:48.868
Saetani?

350
00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:51.496
A monster created by evil consciousness

351
00:30:52.163 --> 00:30:53.164
It's in

352
00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:02.173
Are you crazy?

353
00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:05.594
That cursed monster
I released it to the world

354
00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:06.678
What about Yeon?

355
00:31:07.137 --> 00:31:08.138
Are you suffering?

356
00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:10.307
Are you struggling in the dark?

357
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.767
Is this what you want?

358
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:14.978
It was Lee Yeon who broke her oath.
I need to be punished

359
00:31:15.353 --> 00:31:17.188
Oath?

360
00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:22.193
Let's protect each other even if we die
The three of us swore

361
00:31:22.277 --> 00:31:25.030
One guy fell in love with a human woman.
Throw away your place as a mountain god

362
00:31:25.113 --> 00:31:26.281
The other guy

363
00:31:27.324 --> 00:31:30.619
What did you do to raise me like a parent?
They say it turned into stone in the hands of the undressing group.

364
00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:35.332
There was no one next to me

365
00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:37.792
I needed you guys

366
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.170
-Hong Joo-ya
- Just now

367
00:31:41.338 --> 00:31:43.006
The three of us finally got together again

368
00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:47.010
Why are you like this?

369
00:31:48.928 --> 00:31:49.929
come to me

370
00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:52.265
whatever you want

371
00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:55.185
I'll give it to you

372
00:32:01.232 --> 00:32:02.692
Because you never know

373
00:32:02.776 --> 00:32:04.444
Please minimize eye irritation

374
00:32:05.028 --> 00:32:07.113
What is that girl?

375
00:32:07.197 --> 00:32:08.865
I don’t know who it is, but

376
00:32:09.407 --> 00:32:11.034
It's a type of curse that's quite powerful.

377
00:32:11.117 --> 00:32:13.328
Just looking at it puts a curse on you?

378
00:32:13.953 --> 00:32:15.455
I've never heard of such a monster.

379
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:16.873
That's not the problem

380
00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:18.792
in 1938

381
00:32:19.167 --> 00:32:20.794
To the exact address of Myoyeonggak

382
00:32:21.044 --> 00:32:23.463
The one who will deliver the curse to me
How many?

383
00:32:24.297 --> 00:32:25.340
red and white mask

384
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:27.592
Shinjuya

385
00:32:27.884 --> 00:32:28.885
fix it

386
00:32:29.344 --> 00:32:30.387
I don't have time to be like this

387
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.264
I'll find a way

388
00:32:33.598 --> 00:32:35.308
Please feed me the porridge first, I need to cheer up.

389
00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:52.409
You still hate me, right?

390
00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:57.330
Because of my greed
I held it next to me

391
00:32:57.622 --> 00:33:00.917
Why am I doing this to you?
I'm confused about whether I can trust it or not

392
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:04.754
I've been by your side these past few days
Are my watching eyes just an ornament?

393
00:33:04.838 --> 00:33:06.673
You are not the Lee Yeon I know

394
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.843
That's the only reason I kept you alive

395
00:33:10.135 --> 00:33:11.136
no

396
00:33:11.219 --> 00:33:13.346
you needed a family

397
00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:16.224
Whether I'm real or fake

398
00:33:17.267 --> 00:33:18.268
Shut up

399
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:20.729
I can kill you if I want to
right here and now

400
00:33:20.812 --> 00:33:21.813
While living

401
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.566
These guys are real monsters
Have you met a lot?

402
00:33:25.358 --> 00:33:27.110
I almost died several times

403
00:33:27.193 --> 00:33:29.112
I've never been scared

404
00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:32.240
It's a little scary now

405
00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:37.120
Scary?

406
00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:39.247
No one can protect you like this.

407
00:33:40.623 --> 00:33:41.875
No matter what happens to you

408
00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:43.543
Now don't pretend to be my older brother.

409
00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.628
No matter what anyone says, I'm your older brother

410
00:33:45.712 --> 00:33:48.047
I fed you, clothed you, raised you.

411
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:49.132
so what

412
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.633
Are you asking me to return the favor?

413
00:33:50.967 --> 00:33:52.469
Give it to me, I'll eat it.

414
00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:53.678
Hey, here

415
00:34:15.825 --> 00:34:17.577
Wow, it’s so ugly I can’t see it.

416
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.120
Ugh, hey, give it to me

417
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.581
- Ah
- Ah

418
00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.000
Ugh

419
00:34:24.793 --> 00:34:26.085
- Ah
- Again

420
00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:31.841
Baby, feed me kindly, I'm a patient.

421
00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:33.343
Ah

422
00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.680
Are you done?

423
00:34:39.098 --> 00:34:40.517
Hey, hey, it tastes bad.

424
00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:42.227
Next time, bring mung bean porridge.

425
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.229
Oh, what, are there all these guys?

426
00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:52.237
Where are you going with that body?

427
00:34:55.532 --> 00:34:56.991
The guy in the red and white mask will come

428
00:34:57.575 --> 00:34:58.576
What are you doing?

429
00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.828
think about it

430
00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:01.287
I can't see

431
00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:03.206
Would you miss this opportunity?

432
00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:05.208
I can't see it, so what can I do?

433
00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:08.586
I should try something

434
00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:10.588
Even if you walk by yourself

435
00:35:11.464 --> 00:35:12.465
IC

436
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:14.592
Wait a minute

437
00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:16.219
stand there

438
00:35:16.302 --> 00:35:17.345
five steps to the left

439
00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:21.307
one, two

440
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.436
- three, four, five
- there

441
00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:26.980
right there

442
00:35:28.898 --> 00:35:30.900
- IC
- Oh, that's a flower bed, you idiot.

443
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:32.485
uh

444
00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:33.820
flower bed

445
00:35:43.246 --> 00:35:44.247
nine

446
00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:46.124
heat

447
00:35:48.042 --> 00:35:49.043
seventeen

448
00:35:53.298 --> 00:35:54.924
17 steps from the flower bed

449
00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:02.724
What is this?

450
00:36:02.932 --> 00:36:03.933
It’s Gangjeong, eat it.

451
00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:05.018
Gangjeong?

452
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.395
Hey, what is it? Why does it smell like this?

453
00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:08.479
dog poop

454
00:36:08.563 --> 00:36:10.064
Hey, you crazy guy, really.

455
00:36:10.148 --> 00:36:11.149
Sure, Mr.

456
00:36:12.275 --> 00:36:13.276
Where are you?

457
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:15.028
You get caught, you just get caught

458
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.779
Huh?

459
00:36:16.863 --> 00:36:17.947
- hey
- IC

460
00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:19.032
You, Mr. Lee

461
00:36:21.034 --> 00:36:22.410
I never thought you would be so excited

462
00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:25.204
- One more time? Now, here, here
- Where are you?

463
00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:29.626
That Tawara show

464
00:36:30.043 --> 00:36:34.881
And my wife, Seiko, a native noblewoman.

465
00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:37.884
Today my wife and I

466
00:36:37.967 --> 00:36:41.804
Dedicating two airplanes to the Emperor

467
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.891
My heart becomes bigger

468
00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:48.811
Peace for 24 million subjects

469
00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:52.398
Only with the brave emperor

470
00:36:52.482 --> 00:36:54.943
It is thanks to His Majesty the Emperor!

471
00:36:58.363 --> 00:36:59.364
how is it?

472
00:36:59.656 --> 00:37:01.991
I'm going to give a speech later when I receive the medal.

473
00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:03.076
Sounds good?

474
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.661
at the end

475
00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.789
Long live His Majesty the Emperor

476
00:37:08.247 --> 00:37:09.999
Long live the Empire of Japan!

477
00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.543
What if you put ?

478
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:19.759
yes
People who listen are patriotic

479
00:37:19.842 --> 00:37:22.720
So that it just springs up on its own, right?

480
00:37:23.763 --> 00:37:24.764
Sore

481
00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:27.016
How much does it cost for two patriotic flags?

482
00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:28.518
100,000 won

483
00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:35.650
His Excellency the Governor is calling

484
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:46.494
Can you straighten your face?

485
00:37:46.828 --> 00:37:47.829
Such a glorious day

486
00:37:49.747 --> 00:37:50.748
If anyone sees

487
00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:53.376
I thought it was an independence movement or something.

488
00:37:57.171 --> 00:38:00.550
Receiving a medal from the Emperor of Japan
I am Tawara Sho's only daughter.

489
00:38:01.259 --> 00:38:02.427
If anyone hears it

490
00:38:02.677 --> 00:38:04.012
You think your brother-in-law is crazy, right?

491
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.724
There are times when my sister-in-law is this sharp.

492
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:09.642
It was really attractive

493
00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:22.780
Look into it often

494
00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:25.450
With that smooth face

495
00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:26.993
What are you doing?

496
00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:29.495
You have guessed it, right?

497
00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:32.707
pretending to be human
To swallow up this Joseon

498
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.043
i need this family

499
00:38:36.294 --> 00:38:38.129
my cute new bride

500
00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:40.798
I hope there isn't a speck of dust

501
00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:49.849
- Open your arms.
- child

502
00:38:50.308 --> 00:38:51.309
Now

503
00:38:51.684 --> 00:38:52.685
What is it?

504
00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:53.770
IC

505
00:38:54.062 --> 00:38:55.897
Hey, you crazy idiot, do you really want to die?

506
00:38:57.231 --> 00:38:59.025
Let’s ward off evil.

507
00:38:59.108 --> 00:39:00.276
Huh?

508
00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:02.653
Exorcism? Is that okay?

509
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.324
Well, it's a traditional method, but it's acceptable.
All curses can be removed

510
00:39:06.824 --> 00:39:08.951
Please take off the blindfold.
I need something from my body

511
00:39:09.035 --> 00:39:10.161
uh

512
00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:17.376
I'll be back soon

513
00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:19.921
Be careful

514
00:39:25.218 --> 00:39:26.219
Ah, Mr.

515
00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:53.371
Oh, grapes?

516
00:39:54.705 --> 00:39:57.458
When I think about my childhood
I still smell grapes

517
00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.335
Wow, that damn bow

518
00:39:59.877 --> 00:40:02.255
The grapes are ripening so hard
He was a winemaker

519
00:40:02.797 --> 00:40:04.382
It's our hometown

520
00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:06.300
It was an orphanage

521
00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:09.178
What is that mountain god?

522
00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:12.140
Did the lions roll over when the kids died like that?

523
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:17.019
Sometimes I want to turn back time

524
00:40:17.728 --> 00:40:18.855
To you

525
00:40:19.856 --> 00:40:22.150
There is no human woman I can never forget.

526
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:24.193
There are no libations

527
00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:25.945
To the time when I didn't even have a younger brother.

528
00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:29.407
There's nothing to rely on

529
00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:33.661
We were everything to each other

530
00:40:35.204 --> 00:40:38.124
We are now
Because they weren't those kids back then.

531
00:40:42.044 --> 00:40:43.796
you forever
I wish I couldn't open my eyes

532
00:40:44.714 --> 00:40:45.923
Why are you suddenly speaking evil?

533
00:40:46.007 --> 00:40:48.301
I'm the only one still living those days
I'm pissed

534
00:40:48.718 --> 00:40:51.721
you are helpless to me
I'm going crazy because I want to see people living in anticipation.

535
00:40:52.346 --> 00:40:54.557
You know that's not my style

536
00:40:58.227 --> 00:40:59.228
Yuna

537
00:41:01.063 --> 00:41:03.274
I'm giving you a chance now

538
00:41:05.151 --> 00:41:06.152
Opportunity?

539
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:09.864
When I close my eyes
They say they see more than they think

540
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.992
You have to realize it yourself

541
00:41:13.868 --> 00:41:15.077
What should I see?

542
00:41:16.162 --> 00:41:17.830
What did you miss when you opened your eyes?

543
00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:22.460
you saw it

544
00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:24.587
red and white mask

545
00:41:25.004 --> 00:41:27.131
You saw what was beyond that mask

546
00:41:27.757 --> 00:41:28.841
you saw it too

547
00:41:29.175 --> 00:41:30.176
What?

548
00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:32.970
Just one word

549
00:41:34.764 --> 00:41:36.349
I can be on your side

550
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.517
Or

551
00:41:39.477 --> 00:41:41.395
I could be a worse enemy than him.

552
00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:43.356
Kid, let go of this.

553
00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:45.107
answer me

554
00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:47.109
- You are mine.
- What's wrong with you?

555
00:41:47.401 --> 00:41:48.402
I’m like this because I like you

556
00:41:56.452 --> 00:41:57.620
Wrong

557
00:41:57.954 --> 00:41:58.955
you always

558
00:41:59.163 --> 00:42:01.707
what you want
Isn’t it only when you get your hands on it that your passion will go away?

559
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:03.876
You just can't stand it, you

560
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:06.212
So

561
00:42:06.837 --> 00:42:07.964
What is the answer?

562
00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:09.215
The fox

563
00:42:09.298 --> 00:42:11.092
I never abandon a partner once I make one.

564
00:42:12.218 --> 00:42:13.219
that's my answer

565
00:42:23.688 --> 00:42:24.689
Jaeyuya

566
00:42:26.732 --> 00:42:29.485
Go and meet the monsters on the floor of Gyeongseong.
Come and spread the word.

567
00:42:30.236 --> 00:42:31.237
What do you mean?

568
00:42:33.698 --> 00:42:35.199
Lee Yeon said she was blind.

569
00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:45.459
Wow, how long has it been since this business was shut down?

570
00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:47.295
go to the bathroom
I need to push as hard as I can.

571
00:42:47.378 --> 00:42:48.379
Is that so?

572
00:42:49.005 --> 00:42:51.257
But is this okay?

573
00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:53.634
leave the guest alone

574
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.761
It's the boss's order.

575
00:42:56.012 --> 00:42:58.347
For us it's the law

576
00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:27.835
Ah, Mr.

577
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.341
That

578
00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:34.842
Is there anyone outside?

579
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.178
Can you give me some water?

580
00:43:39.013 --> 00:43:40.514
Yes, did you call me?

581
00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:43.100
Who are you? It's my first time hearing this voice.

582
00:43:43.184 --> 00:43:45.353
It is called a stone that carries and chops firewood.

583
00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:48.189
Well, all the gisaengs went to the bathhouse.

584
00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:49.607
Ah

585
00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:51.859
Are you alone?

586
00:43:52.318 --> 00:43:53.319
yes

587
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.490
give me your hand

588
00:43:58.157 --> 00:43:59.158
yes

589
00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:03.746
Where are you going?

590
00:44:12.797 --> 00:44:13.923
Did you say Sudol?

591
00:44:15.049 --> 00:44:16.342
What are you doing here?

592
00:44:17.301 --> 00:44:19.136
He's a guy carrying firewood.

593
00:44:20.054 --> 00:44:21.055
Yeah?

594
00:44:22.014 --> 00:44:23.015
strange

595
00:44:23.974 --> 00:44:26.060
What do you mean?

596
00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:36.612
Your hands are clearly those of a knife holder.

597
00:44:59.552 --> 00:45:01.554
Just guess
I think there are about 15 of them.

598
00:45:02.179 --> 00:45:03.431
What are you guys doing?

599
00:45:03.514 --> 00:45:05.558
As you go under the undressing group

600
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:07.601
The monster that was caught and killed
Do you know how many there are?

601
00:45:08.769 --> 00:45:10.479
I'm like that
Do you look like someone who writes a diary?

602
00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:13.107
A guy who can't even use his eyes has time to spare

603
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.822
Did you know that foxes only hunt with their eyes?

604
00:46:17.755 --> 00:46:20.049
Oh, is it an amulet or something?
Does it really have to be done in a place like this?

605
00:46:21.217 --> 00:46:23.135
A lot of people step on it
It has to be a road

606
00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:24.386
Ah, why red beans?

607
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.804
To chase away evil spirits

608
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.723
If you look at those rice cakes, you will be amazed.

609
00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:34.563
What time is it?

610
00:46:37.107 --> 00:46:38.400
5 minutes before 12

611
00:46:38.484 --> 00:46:39.485
It's almost on time

612
00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:40.569
Please come in

613
00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:47.660
Lee Yeon's hair

614
00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:50.246
here

615
00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:52.957
Burn it at midnight

616
00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:55.042
And without exception, north, south, east and west
Sprinkle some alcohol...

617
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:57.419
Baby, okay, tell me how many times

618
00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:01.632
From now on, you and I will be alone.

619
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.676
Please leave as soon as you finish.

620
00:47:04.593 --> 00:47:06.887
never until you arrive
You cannot look back or speak.

621
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:13.310
- You must never look at it.
- Go

622
00:48:22.796 --> 00:48:23.797
Jaeyuya

623
00:48:24.632 --> 00:48:27.259
Our kite can't even use his ears
I need to make it for you

624
00:48:27.343 --> 00:48:28.344
yes

625
00:48:57.706 --> 00:48:58.707
Ah, Mr.

626
00:49:25.693 --> 00:49:27.319
Are you running away in a bad way?

627
00:49:49.383 --> 00:49:51.301
Wait, five steps to the left.

628
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:57.891
One, two, three, four

629
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:00.102
five

630
00:50:03.814 --> 00:50:04.815
here

631
00:50:24.877 --> 00:50:25.878
Now

632
00:50:26.712 --> 00:50:28.172
Now it's fair darkness

633
00:50:34.428 --> 00:50:35.929
Oh no, it's not fun

634
00:50:52.154 --> 00:50:53.238
Are you going out?

635
00:50:55.032 --> 00:50:56.408
It's a call from the grandmother of the undressing group.

636
00:50:56.825 --> 00:50:58.202
I killed a person yesterday

637
00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:02.039
Leave Yeon alone

638
00:51:02.915 --> 00:51:03.916
Are you okay?

639
00:51:05.459 --> 00:51:06.752
Cook whatever you want

640
00:51:09.254 --> 00:51:10.631
Let me see your skills.

641
00:51:39.785 --> 00:51:42.913
Something on the way back
If you feel like you're being chased, that's it.

642
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.832
never look back

643
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.291
never

644
00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:49.628
He's a lot more dangerous than I thought.

645
00:51:51.421 --> 00:51:53.340
I have a bad feeling

646
00:51:55.801 --> 00:51:57.010
I'm going to catch up at this rate

647
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:04.518
Hey, where are you going, boss?

648
00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:06.812
yes? Let's go together

649
00:52:07.312 --> 00:52:08.313
Yes?

650
00:52:08.397 --> 00:52:10.440
what? Oh, why are you pretending not to know?

651
00:52:10.691 --> 00:52:11.692
yes?

652
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:13.110
yes?

653
00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.361
specifications

654
00:52:14.862 --> 00:52:17.239
Now I'm pulling a rickshaw
Are you doing this because you’re embarrassed, right now?

655
00:52:19.908 --> 00:52:22.119
What, why aren't you talking?

656
00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:24.496
yes?

657
00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:28.250
I have to go, uh

658
00:52:29.626 --> 00:52:30.627
Get in, then

659
00:53:02.075 --> 00:53:03.243
Taran

660
00:53:10.167 --> 00:53:11.752
What did you buy so much?

661
00:53:11.835 --> 00:53:15.088
It’s been a while since you smelled the sea, right?
try one

662
00:53:23.847 --> 00:53:24.932
Does it taste good?

663
00:53:25.015 --> 00:53:26.642
It tastes much better than crucian carp.

664
00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:30.187
Ah, but you

665
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.480
What is this all about?

666
00:53:32.564 --> 00:53:35.651
I want to give it as a gift
There is a brother who came with me a few days ago.

667
00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:37.819
Oh, you mean bro? Lee Yeon

668
00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:39.196
No, my brother.

669
00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:41.657
With this?

670
00:53:41.907 --> 00:53:43.075
His name is Rang.

671
00:53:43.158 --> 00:53:44.368
Oh my goodness, Yeohee.

672
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.036
don't go near

673
00:53:46.119 --> 00:53:47.245
Are you a bad guy?

674
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:48.622
very

675
00:53:50.165 --> 00:53:51.875
This kid has a lot of scars

676
00:53:52.668 --> 00:53:55.212
Like you, one of your parents is human.

677
00:53:56.463 --> 00:53:57.631
You know that too, right?

678
00:53:57.714 --> 00:53:59.716
Those who are neither humans nor monsters

679
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.344
Which path do you end up taking?

680
00:54:06.431 --> 00:54:08.350
But I fell in love with it at first sight.

681
00:54:08.433 --> 00:54:09.685
me

682
00:54:12.062 --> 00:54:14.022
I'm going to fall in love with that guy

683
00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:20.779
boss

684
00:54:27.577 --> 00:54:28.912
Soon in Shanghai

685
00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:30.205
There's going to be a bomb

686
00:54:32.582 --> 00:54:34.042
I'll leave the back door open

687
00:54:34.835 --> 00:54:36.044
Oh, what's the password?

688
00:54:41.049 --> 00:54:42.676
♪ Do-re-mi-re-do ♪

689
00:54:46.638 --> 00:54:47.639
Take care of yourself

690
00:54:47.723 --> 00:54:48.807
The boss too.

691
00:54:57.482 --> 00:54:58.859
"Obok Goods Store"

692
00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:18.754
Was the exorcism successful?

693
00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:34.144
Now finally

694
00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.564
Our kite is alone

695
00:55:50.077 --> 00:55:52.412
Hey, what is this?

696
00:55:52.746 --> 00:55:53.830
Hey!

697
00:55:54.247 --> 00:55:57.125
This is Jingogae, that
It's selling like hot cakes

698
00:55:57.209 --> 00:55:58.668
It's that castella.

699
00:56:04.049 --> 00:56:07.594
The bread is fluffy like cloud cookies, huh?

700
00:56:13.892 --> 00:56:16.645
Hey Hongju!
Why do you keep killing people?

701
00:56:17.395 --> 00:56:18.605
Why can't I just kill him?

702
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.065
They all die anyway

703
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:23.568
How can this guy who was once a mountain god!

704
00:56:23.652 --> 00:56:26.780
Why are you the only one with me?
Yeon also killed many soldiers.

705
00:56:26.863 --> 00:56:27.906
Why are you looking at him?

706
00:56:27.989 --> 00:56:30.283
Ah, that's Yeon in Myoyeonggak...

707
00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:31.660
Hey!

708
00:56:34.955 --> 00:56:36.123
What is Yeoni?

709
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.085
what?

710
00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:42.420
Why don't you stop talking?

711
00:56:42.504 --> 00:56:44.923
The guy who killed people and came to get punishment talks a lot.

712
00:56:45.006 --> 00:56:46.091
Send it to cold ice hell

713
00:56:46.925 --> 00:56:49.970
Oh, Hong Joo is also older.
Let’s send it somewhere warmer.

714
00:56:53.974 --> 00:56:54.975
Let's go

715
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:56.601
Hey, this

716
00:56:57.185 --> 00:56:58.186
Oh, that's right

717
00:56:59.271 --> 00:57:00.438
You know Muyoung is here, right?

718
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:02.190
uh?

719
00:57:02.482 --> 00:57:04.192
What do you mean?
Is Muyoung alive?

720
00:57:06.403 --> 00:57:07.404
Didn’t your grandmother save your life?

721
00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:09.072
Hongjoo

722
00:57:09.823 --> 00:57:13.910
Why did I raise Muyoung like my own child?
Do you think it's made of stone?

723
00:57:15.245 --> 00:57:16.246
with my own hands

724
00:57:16.746 --> 00:57:20.542
The mountain I ruled
The thing that annihilated everything

725
00:57:21.084 --> 00:57:22.335
It's him

726
00:57:23.795 --> 00:57:24.796
It can't be

727
00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:28.550
There’s no way Muyoung would do something like that.

728
00:57:30.552 --> 00:57:31.553
I am like that

729
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.055
Would you have forgiven Muyoung?

730
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.601
no

731
00:57:38.518 --> 00:57:39.519
Grandma would never...

732
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:41.354
Take it away

733
00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:55.660
alternative

734
00:57:55.994 --> 00:57:58.496
Who saved Muyoung?

735
00:58:00.248 --> 00:58:01.583
For what?

736
00:58:08.256 --> 00:58:09.507
Langa

737
00:58:10.342 --> 00:58:11.343
Shinju!

738
00:58:11.927 --> 00:58:13.011
Is there anyone?

739
00:58:24.606 --> 00:58:25.607
uh?

740
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:26.775
Rangi watch

741
00:58:29.861 --> 00:58:30.987
libation handkerchief

742
00:58:34.574 --> 00:58:36.910
Ah, Mr.

743
00:58:45.961 --> 00:58:47.545
Oh, kinda!

744
00:58:51.883 --> 00:58:52.884
There's no one there!

745
00:58:54.177 --> 00:58:55.637
Well, anyone is fine

746
00:58:56.221 --> 00:58:57.347
please help me

747
00:58:57.639 --> 00:58:58.640
Huh?

748
00:58:59.307 --> 00:59:00.767
Please, please!

749
00:59:03.186 --> 00:59:04.187
please

750
00:59:05.021 --> 00:59:07.232
Who is it?

751
00:59:11.736 --> 00:59:12.737
runt?

752
00:59:14.239 --> 00:59:15.365
Could you please read this letter?

753
00:59:18.159 --> 00:59:20.453
‘My younger brother and Shinju are dying’

754
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:22.455
‘If you want to save the two of them’

755
00:59:22.872 --> 00:59:25.458
'At the eastern foot of Bukhansan Mountain
'Come to the hermitage'

756
00:59:25.834 --> 00:59:27.544
‘I’ll give you just one hour’

757
00:59:28.378 --> 00:59:30.130
'You know who I am, right?'

758
00:59:32.507 --> 00:59:33.925
Red and white mask, this bastard

759
00:59:37.178 --> 00:59:38.179
Hey, kid

760
00:59:38.805 --> 00:59:39.806
help me

761
00:59:39.889 --> 00:59:40.890
Give me a piggyback ride

762
00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:42.225
uh

763
00:59:47.314 --> 00:59:48.815
- This way
- This way?

764
00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.280
Please save me!

765
00:59:55.864 --> 00:59:57.615
Please save me! yes!

766
00:59:57.949 --> 00:59:59.534
Is there anyone? uh!

767
01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:01.536
Please save me!

768
01:00:03.204 --> 01:00:05.999
If you want to save me
Would you have put it in something like this?

769
01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.084
Hey, then what?
They all look dead

770
01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:09.294
I have to try something

771
01:00:09.836 --> 01:00:11.171
Untie the line first

772
01:00:19.429 --> 01:00:20.680
It can't be done by force, it can't be done.

773
01:00:27.228 --> 01:00:28.646
Lee Yeon will come to the rescue.

774
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.607
A guy who can't even see will come back easily.

775
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.817
not the eyes
Even if all my hands and feet are gone

776
01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:34.861
Lee Yeon will come to rescue Lee Rang.

777
01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:36.613
I think you will too.

778
01:00:36.988 --> 01:00:38.239
How do you know that?

779
01:00:39.407 --> 01:00:41.576
you guys talk about me
You can say whatever you know.

780
01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:43.078
I know even though I can’t explain it.

781
01:00:43.286 --> 01:00:45.705
What a warm person you are.

782
01:00:46.081 --> 01:00:47.665
I also bought a kimchi refrigerator.

783
01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.293
What on earth are you guys?

784
01:00:51.086 --> 01:00:52.087
Is that a secret too?

785
01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:54.672
After living like everyone else for hundreds of years, suddenly

786
01:00:55.924 --> 01:00:57.717
Come into my life and pretend to be nice

787
01:00:58.218 --> 01:01:00.220
Just pretend to be friendly, because it's disgusting.

788
01:01:02.847 --> 01:01:04.724
It seems like the water level is higher than before

789
01:01:06.935 --> 01:01:08.353
Lee Yeon!

790
01:01:09.312 --> 01:01:11.272
Lee Yeon!

791
01:01:12.982 --> 01:01:13.983
Thank you, kid.

792
01:01:18.113 --> 01:01:19.114
Ah, the sound of the moktak

793
01:01:21.783 --> 01:01:22.784
This way?

794
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.427
This is the stride length of an adult man.

795
01:02:03.032 --> 01:02:04.993
It's not a person, it's him.

796
01:02:37.817 --> 01:02:39.235
I'm deliberately shooting from a distance

797
01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:41.571
You're playing with me

798
01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:42.989
As if chasing rabbits

799
01:02:58.505 --> 01:03:01.841
Damn it

800
01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.761
Well, if it's not just the eyes

801
01:03:05.094 --> 01:03:06.971
If it weren't for the eyes...

802
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.901
you

803
01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.111
You know me, right?

804
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:24.113
What are we doing?

805
01:03:24.364 --> 01:03:26.574
What on earth are you doing?
Are you doing this to me?

806
01:03:26.658 --> 01:03:28.785
받아

807
01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:37.043
뭔지 모르겠는데

808
01:03:37.627 --> 01:03:38.753
내가 다 잘못했다

809
01:03:39.212 --> 01:03:41.631
나 너랑 싸울 생각 전혀 없어

810
01:03:42.173 --> 01:03:43.174
그러니까

811
01:03:43.716 --> 01:03:45.385
랑이랑 신주만이라도

812
01:03:45.635 --> 01:03:46.636
제발

813
01:03:54.018 --> 01:03:56.312
피뢰침이다, 이 새끼야

814
01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:01.317
아이씨, 어유, 씨

815
01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:06.072
좀만 더

816
01:04:13.788 --> 01:04:14.998
- 뭐야?
- That's enough, that's enough.

817
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.541
That's enough

818
01:04:20.712 --> 01:04:22.046
What is that line, huh?

819
01:04:33.099 --> 01:04:34.601
IC

820
01:04:35.226 --> 01:04:36.853
No, no, no.

821
01:04:36.936 --> 01:04:38.605
In this way, we both die

822
01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:41.065
What should I do?

823
01:04:42.025 --> 01:04:43.067
Lee Rang!

824
01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:52.327
Lee Rang

825
01:05:09.302 --> 01:05:10.303
Langa

826
01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:12.472
Shinju!

827
01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:23.566
Give me back my eyes, okay?

828
01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:26.194
Give me back my eyes, please!

829
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:33.451
Find me

830
01:05:33.826 --> 01:05:34.827
my name

831
01:05:38.623 --> 01:05:40.625
Is this voice, that kid from earlier?

832
01:05:42.168 --> 01:05:43.169
Could it be that you...

833
01:05:43.628 --> 01:05:44.629
Saetani

834
01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:45.713
It's you, right?

835
01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:47.131
What took my eyes

836
01:05:47.632 --> 01:05:48.633
Give it to me

837
01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:50.051
You're the one who broke your promise!

838
01:05:54.222 --> 01:05:55.807
Find me

839
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.141
my name

840
01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:58.226
Name?

841
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:00.186
How do I know that? Mr.

842
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:01.270
Die!

843
01:06:01.354 --> 01:06:03.815
Where are you?

844
01:06:03.898 --> 01:06:05.400
Got it

845
01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:11.406
sound of bells

846
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:14.992
This sound, someday...

847
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:23.251
here

848
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.961
the forest I ruled

849
01:06:32.552 --> 01:06:34.011
The carp you just saved is

850
01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:35.972
They are descendants of the owner of this pond.

851
01:06:37.348 --> 01:06:39.183
I'll give you this as a reward

852
01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:50.319
What is this?

853
01:06:50.695 --> 01:06:52.363
I'll grant you just one wish

854
01:06:55.867 --> 01:06:57.118
What's your name?

855
01:06:57.618 --> 01:06:58.745
my name is

856
01:07:01.247 --> 01:07:02.248
I...

857
01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:11.299
tell me

858
01:07:12.759 --> 01:07:14.427
Tell me, what is your name?

859
01:07:15.094 --> 01:07:16.179
tell me

860
01:07:16.429 --> 01:07:17.597
Speak quickly!

861
01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:19.682
tell me

862
01:07:38.659 --> 01:07:39.744
Sister, I'm hungry

863
01:07:40.077 --> 01:07:41.829
We're almost home, just hang in there

864
01:07:41.913 --> 01:07:42.914
Yeah

865
01:08:05.436 --> 01:08:06.479
I'll take this kid

866
01:08:11.567 --> 01:08:15.446
Sister, I don’t want to go.

867
01:08:15.905 --> 01:08:17.740
I'm scared

868
01:08:23.079 --> 01:08:24.622
our clothes

869
01:08:25.081 --> 01:08:26.374
let's change it

870
01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:38.302
don't go

871
01:08:44.433 --> 01:08:45.434
sister

872
01:08:56.362 --> 01:08:57.864
I want to go home

873
01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:01.033
I'm thirsty

874
01:09:03.369 --> 01:09:04.954
I don't want to die

875
01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:07.331
Mountain spirit

876
01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:08.791
Please save me

877
01:09:10.793 --> 01:09:12.962
I shouldn't have switched clothes with my brother.

878
01:09:14.797 --> 01:09:15.798
I hate you

879
01:09:17.216 --> 01:09:18.217
My father too

880
01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:20.094
My younger brother too

881
01:09:20.469 --> 01:09:21.470
Even the spirits

882
01:09:22.722 --> 01:09:24.599
I want to go home

883
01:09:25.808 --> 01:09:26.809
I'm thirsty

884
01:09:27.727 --> 01:09:28.811
I don't want to die

885
01:09:30.271 --> 01:09:31.272
Mountain spirit

886
01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.607
Please save me

887
01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.025
Please save me

888
01:09:34.442 --> 01:09:35.860
please save me

889
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:37.528
Please save me

890
01:09:37.612 --> 01:09:40.615
Please, mountain spirit, spirit, please

891
01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:43.284
Please save me, please

892
01:09:43.576 --> 01:09:45.119
please help me

893
01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:47.872
Please help me, please help me

894
01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:52.960
Why didn't you come?

895
01:09:53.502 --> 01:09:54.629
At that time I already

896
01:09:56.213 --> 01:09:57.632
It wasn't a mountain god

897
01:10:01.052 --> 01:10:02.678
He abandoned his position as a mountain god.

898
01:10:02.929 --> 01:10:04.513
to save a woman

899
01:10:04.597 --> 01:10:06.474
Now you can't save anyone

900
01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:15.107
I'm sorry

901
01:10:16.484 --> 01:10:17.485
It's too late

902
01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:19.946
I'm sorry

903
01:10:23.074 --> 01:10:24.241
my name is

904
01:10:31.832 --> 01:10:33.668
I remembered your name

905
01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:35.711
my name?

906
01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:37.380
your name is

907
01:10:39.215 --> 01:10:40.800
It's the soothing of azalea.

908
01:10:43.886 --> 01:10:44.887
Soothe it

909
01:10:46.472 --> 01:10:47.473
Azalea

910
01:10:48.391 --> 01:10:49.392
Soothe

911
01:10:50.309 --> 01:10:51.477
Azalea

912
01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:30.558
There's nothing holding you back now

913
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.602
You don't have to live as Saetani anymore

914
01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:35.438
It's not Saetani

915
01:11:37.356 --> 01:11:38.357
I

916
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.151
Soothe

917
01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:41.235
yes

918
01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:42.737
Soothe

919
01:11:45.656 --> 01:11:47.908
You were scared, right?

920
01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.578
Dying alone there

921
01:11:57.334 --> 01:11:58.711
In the next life

922
01:11:59.712 --> 01:12:01.172
Born as an ordinary child

923
01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:03.716
Shaman or Saetani

924
01:12:04.383 --> 01:12:06.385
Let's not live as anyone else's tool

925
01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.098
I had a hard time

926
01:12:12.641 --> 01:12:14.101
Living in this small body

927
01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:19.065
wish

928
01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:21.650
Thanks for listening

929
01:12:23.694 --> 01:12:25.029
My younger brother

930
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.782
It's at the western well.

931
01:13:04.026 --> 01:13:05.027
Shinjuya

932
01:13:05.111 --> 01:13:06.112
yes

933
01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:07.321
- We're all here, we're all here
- Lee Yeon

934
01:13:09.406 --> 01:13:11.534
Shinju!

935
01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:14.703
are you okay?

936
01:13:14.787 --> 01:13:15.788
What about Rangi?

937
01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:17.248
It hasn't come out yet

938
01:14:49.381 --> 01:14:52.051
The grandmother saved Muyoung’s life
You mean no?

939
01:14:53.844 --> 01:14:55.387
But Muyoung and Yeoni

940
01:14:56.347 --> 01:14:58.641
He appeared in Gyeongseong on the same day.

941
01:15:02.978 --> 01:15:03.979
you guys

942
01:15:05.814 --> 01:15:06.899
What is it?

943
01:15:17.618 --> 01:15:19.495
Lang, can you recognize me?

944
01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:21.747
Ah, thank goodness

945
01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.557
Playing with Yeon
It's still fun

946
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:45.771
Yuna

947
01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:50.109
You're forever stuck in the past

948
01:15:53.195 --> 01:15:55.906
everything you care about
You'll see me dying

949
01:15:57.992 --> 01:15:58.993
that day

950
01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:01.870
It's a first for me too
There is a thing called a bucket list.

951
01:16:02.579 --> 01:16:03.956
Can you move your legs?

952
01:16:04.039 --> 01:16:05.165
Even if I leave

953
01:16:05.582 --> 01:16:08.127
I wish there was someone next to Rang.

954
01:16:10.713 --> 01:16:11.714
at least

955
01:16:12.631 --> 01:16:15.009
In the era in which they live, things like red and white masks

956
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.886
I will never leave you alive

957
01:16:57.009 --> 01:16:58.010
red and white mask

958
01:16:58.344 --> 01:16:59.511
Who are you?

959
01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:02.264
He knows me, right?

960
01:17:02.348 --> 01:17:03.766
- Shhh
- You guys already

961
01:17:03.849 --> 01:17:05.559
You guys are in a dog fight
pulled me in

962
01:17:05.642 --> 01:17:07.019
If you measure the length and width of a corpse,

963
01:17:07.102 --> 01:17:08.937
It is the treasure that even the dead come back to life.

964
01:17:09.313 --> 01:17:10.647
Baby

965
01:17:10.731 --> 01:17:12.316
- Let’s hit him and knock him out.
- Hey, hey, hey, it's wet.

966
01:17:12.399 --> 01:17:13.400
Is this person?

967
01:17:14.568 --> 01:17:15.819
Isn’t this a disguised monster?

968
01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:17.696
What is your ideal type?

969
01:17:17.988 --> 01:17:19.239
A guy stronger than me

970
01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:21.658
Why did you come to this era?

971
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:24.119
I'm fake?

972
01:17:24.203 --> 01:17:26.413
One of the two with my own hands
I might have to kill him.

973
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:27.956
don't go, please
