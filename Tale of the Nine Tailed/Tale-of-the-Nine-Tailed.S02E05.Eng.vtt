﻿1
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.167
Shall I step on it?

2
00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.170
Let's step on it

3
00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.222
Sigh

4
00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:34.032
You, you, you, this

5
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.451
Take it easy and don’t even wash your hands.
It happened and it happened

6
00:01:36.535 --> 00:01:38.620
Germs on our hands
Do you know how many? uh?

7
00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:40.372
E. coli, norovirus

8
00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:41.748
And so on

9
00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:51.091
No strollers

10
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.969
- Don't kill me.
- Oh, why?

11
00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:56.972
Green Mother's Association
You have to set an example for your child.

12
00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:58.849
Ah, I heard you're raising a child too much.

13
00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:02.727
Now, everyone pay attention

14
00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:07.357
I will take care of your trauma today
I'll get rid of it completely

15
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.401
Oh my

16
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.866
you guys today

17
00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.034
It's not like they hit us.

18
00:02:18.577 --> 00:02:21.246
You've never been to Myoyeonggak, huh?

19
00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:45.896
Look at this

20
00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:48.732
Do we have another Yeon?

21
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:54.529
Ah um

22
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.202
you said she died
I'm living in those times

23
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.290
I'm looking at you like this

24
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.501
die

25
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:10.962
wait

26
00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:22.641
don't go, please

27
00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:28.188
I missed you

28
00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:33.109
I missed you so much I thought I was going crazy

29
00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:42.619
Now don't ever leave me again

30
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:46.790
Ah um

31
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.046
Damn it

32
00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:55.840
What did you expect, me?

33
00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:06.643
Muyoung is back

34
00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:10.105
Do you remember?

35
00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:14.693
Long ago, when the three of us ran
You were always first

36
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.154
I always ran after you

37
00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:20.699
I ran just looking at you

38
00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:24.244
Just like back then

39
00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:34.963
I'm only looking at your back

40
00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:40.385
Hongju?

41
00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.358
sleep well

42
00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:57.402
Yuna in 1938

43
00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.201
Are you that guy?

44
00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:09.956
That guy?

45
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.917
You can't fool my eyes
You took away all the belongings from our house.

46
00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.671
Do you have any proof?
Oh, well, there's no CCTV, whatever.

47
00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:18.381
CC? Ah

48
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.676
It will come out that way.

49
00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:26.014
It'll be on the front page of the newspaper tomorrow morning

50
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.725
A robber who attacked seven wealthy gold miners

51
00:05:28.808 --> 00:05:30.101
No, the other house is not mine.

52
00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.978
- You just confessed?
- AC

53
00:05:33.188 --> 00:05:35.440
Give me a picture
Me, I own the image rights.

54
00:05:36.024 --> 00:05:38.443
-Give me these clothes.
- Hey, give me the camera.

55
00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.819
Give it to me, ah!

56
00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:41.237
- Boy, real hair.
- Give it to me.

57
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.405
- What are you doing?
- Give it to me.

58
00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.365
IC

59
00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:51.039
What is it?

60
00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:53.917
Why are you still so fine after being shot?

61
00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.212
So, a little bit.

62
00:05:58.671 --> 00:05:59.756
Uh, special constitution?

63
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.467
Why didn't I die even when I got shot?

64
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.053
Um, uh, a gun like this...

65
00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:08.139
I don't believe it, but if that's true

66
00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:12.310
about Japanese imperialism
What do you think?

67
00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.396
yes?

68
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.815
Write, but

69
00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:18.525
Why is the Government General looking for Miho?

70
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.611
If the bounty is the price of a house
I'm saying it's not normal.

71
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.072
Shall I show you something fun?

72
00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:27.742
Well, guess what?

73
00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:34.999
What is it?

74
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.376
uh?

75
00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:37.460
Now, one more time

76
00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:43.466
Huh?

77
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:49.472
what?

78
00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:51.307
Isn’t it Baekbal Baekjung?

79
00:06:51.391 --> 00:06:53.726
They say that being a businessman brings good luck.

80
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.270
He was a born gambler.

81
00:06:56.312 --> 00:06:59.023
I'll bring you a mountain of wealth
Right?

82
00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.193
Wait a minute

83
00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:04.154
Wealth and fortune?

84
00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:06.781
Isn’t this a person of contempt?

85
00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.827
The god of evil is his own place
They say you decide for yourself.

86
00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:13.204
From the beginning we did that
Even if I take it to another house

87
00:07:13.288 --> 00:07:14.289
It's the same thing that keeps coming back

88
00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:18.251
Don’t gods usually live under the floor?

89
00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:21.796
no eyes, nose, mouth
In the form of a serpent or toad

90
00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:24.841
Who are you? uh?

91
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.092
Talk to me

92
00:07:32.223 --> 00:07:34.559
The Governor-General found us
It's a matter of time

93
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.270
The red and white mask is also targeting me.

94
00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:41.232
Is it best for this child to be here?

95
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.527
Jongro Police Station Jeong Dae-seung?

96
00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.739
That snake-like guy
Are you saying they were trying to use us as cannon fodder?

97
00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:49.365
The boss isn't there either.

98
00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.201
In this mess
Where has your sister gone?

99
00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:54.829
what?

100
00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.581
Didn’t Plum Sister report it?

101
00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:58.208
no

102
00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:00.418
I didn't tell anyone about the baby.

103
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.046
Crazy bitch, you wouldn't know

104
00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.590
Mr. Lee, don’t curse at me.
This girl

105
00:08:05.673 --> 00:08:06.966
- Did you pinch it?
- stop!

106
00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:09.886
Why are they like this?

107
00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:12.305
We go looking for the child

108
00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:13.556
I met a tiger the size of a house.

109
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.267
The tiger said, ‘If I give you one piece of rice cake,
He said, ‘I won’t eat you,’ so I quickly

110
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:17.560
I handed him some rice cake and he said he didn’t like it.

111
00:08:17.977 --> 00:08:18.978
I like honey rice cake

112
00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:23.399
Are you sane?

113
00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:24.484
It's real

114
00:08:24.817 --> 00:08:25.818
Right?

115
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.737
- Yes, that's right!
- That's right, it's a tiger.

116
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.239
- It's definitely a tiger.
- That's right, I'm sure.

117
00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:30.323
It was a tiger

118
00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:35.203
I'm possessed by something

119
00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:38.248
The other person is not human

120
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.253
Who are you?

121
00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:50.760
I found the location

122
00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.553
It's Myoyeonggak.

123
00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:54.097
I'll bring you right away

124
00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:55.515
It's not in your power

125
00:08:56.516 --> 00:08:59.352
There's a pretty strong Joseon monster there.

126
00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:01.145
I go myself.

127
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.023
It's a gisaeng's house
There are many eyes to see

128
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.733
Your identity may be exposed...

129
00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.610
Myoyeonggak President

130
00:09:08.444 --> 00:09:10.530
Is this the girl you met on the train?

131
00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:12.907
- Yes
- Use that bitch.

132
00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.037
I know her weakness

133
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.665
My sister is a gisaeng at Myoyeonggak.

134
00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:22.125
Check if the information is useful

135
00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:24.419
Ah

136
00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:26.504
And who lives in the poor people's village?

137
00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:28.548
I sprinkled a mountain of gold jewelry.

138
00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:32.427
Where are you?

139
00:09:34.053 --> 00:09:35.388
Where are you going?

140
00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:37.557
Lee Yeon? Or is it Muyoung?

141
00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.017
Well, okay

142
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:44.022
My lifelong friend
It was just Yeon and Muyoung.

143
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.984
My precious friends
The war is about to start

144
00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:49.193
don't interrupt

145
00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.070
On either side

146
00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:52.780
The boss will get hurt.

147
00:09:53.197 --> 00:09:55.199
no, i have to do it

148
00:09:55.575 --> 00:09:56.576
I maybe

149
00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:01.622
One of the two with my own hands
I might have to kill him.

150
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.421
drink

151
00:10:16.512 --> 00:10:17.847
Isn’t it hard?

152
00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:19.390
Working for me?

153
00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:21.267
It's already been 17 years ago

154
00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:22.643
Meeting the boss

155
00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:28.358
It wasn't the boss

156
00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:31.611
Japanese police officers with clubs
I would have died if I got hit.

157
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.740
Due to the order to destroy wild dogs, many people are still
Native dogs are dying out

158
00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:38.868
um

159
00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:41.746
When I was a mountain god

160
00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:46.167
Humans came with offerings
I used to make a wish on a fake day

161
00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:48.461
To look cool at first
Did you listen to everything?

162
00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:51.255
But the experience I had that day was

163
00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:54.467
It makes humans weak and evil.

164
00:10:56.052 --> 00:10:57.053
You always did that.

165
00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:00.431
In the human world
we are not the main characters

166
00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:03.893
Everyone has their own fight

167
00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:06.145
Humans too

168
00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:08.648
We too

169
00:11:09.524 --> 00:11:10.942
This is my battlefield

170
00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:13.986
Until I die
I will serve only one master

171
00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:33.256
'Hi'

172
00:11:49.272 --> 00:11:50.356
Please save me

173
00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:13.129
This fragrant smell of blood

174
00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:20.470
Lee Yeon

175
00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:27.310
Why are you walking around topless?
Huh? Grossly...

176
00:12:27.768 --> 00:12:29.061
Look who I brought

177
00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:30.897
Were the two of you a gang?

178
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.231
- Hey, Mr. Lee.
- Ah

179
00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:34.066
You are the victim of theft
What if I bring it with me?

180
00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:36.777
We got caught, but we made up

181
00:12:39.864 --> 00:12:40.907
You said you were a detective?

182
00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:42.867
Do detectives steal?

183
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.911
Ah, well, it was inevitable.

184
00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:46.454
you understand

185
00:12:48.122 --> 00:12:49.373
What is it? What is this confidence?

186
00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:50.583
Uh huh!

187
00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:51.667
To the lifesaver

188
00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:53.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

189
00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:55.922
Give me the stolen jewels

190
00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.465
Oh, wait a minute.

191
00:12:58.508 --> 00:13:00.092
Hey, don't pretend

192
00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:01.385
- Yes, yes
- And now

193
00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:03.387
To find Miho
The police's eyes are on

194
00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:05.097
Eunho is okay
I guess it’s an independence movement.

195
00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:11.729
Thieves are raising children

196
00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.439
Where did you steal this too?

197
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.320
Are you a Murim expert?

198
00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:22.365
- What are you talking about?
- Or don't show up in front of me.

199
00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:23.824
I can't even find a bone.

200
00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.034
What, man?

201
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.578
uh

202
00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:32.458
Here, one ruler made of gold is missing.
Write, where did you go?

203
00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:34.460
I'll do my best for that

204
00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:48.057
Ah, I like Gyeongseong too

205
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.815
Look at each catch.

206
00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.400
It's an institution

207
00:13:58.401 --> 00:13:59.819
You are the president of Myoyeonggak, right?

208
00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:01.821
This is a message from the Governor-General to bring me back.

209
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:03.990
I'll be back

210
00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:26.554
What is my suggestion?

211
00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:27.805
Have you thought about it?

212
00:14:27.888 --> 00:14:28.973
I just ask one thing

213
00:14:29.682 --> 00:14:31.058
Why the independence movement?

214
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.770
If you have this kind of wealth
With Hwashin Department Store for the rest of my life

215
00:14:34.854 --> 00:14:36.397
Going back and forth to Gunjari Golf Course
You can live

216
00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:41.235
At first, my sister's death
I started to dig into it.

217
00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:43.654
Next is my patriotism.

218
00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:46.240
A little bit of my father’s treason
I wanted to pay it back

219
00:14:46.699 --> 00:14:48.284
As a result, I made comrades.

220
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:50.995
Every day goes by
I heard about the death of my comrades

221
00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:55.416
Even with this much money

222
00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.709
I'm in debt

223
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:58.586
I survived

224
00:15:00.254 --> 00:15:01.255
Why?

225
00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:03.007
Is it me?

226
00:15:04.967 --> 00:15:07.261
I'm in the spotlight because of my family situation

227
00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:09.055
You...

228
00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:14.769
There's a secret to keep

229
00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.106
Do you want to do it or not?

230
00:15:22.193 --> 00:15:23.903
In this era when Joseon is crunching

231
00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:26.947
I'm taking care of someone who's addicted to opium
Because I couldn’t do anything?

232
00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:29.033
That always bothered me

233
00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.243
Of course, in 1938

234
00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:33.996
After all, we look exactly like ourselves
I met an independence activist.

235
00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:36.957
like fate

236
00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:43.339
Gyeongseong Station tonight

237
00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:46.592
A man holding a white chrysanthemum will come

238
00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:49.470
It was stolen anyway

239
00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:51.305
Let's use it for military funds.

240
00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:11.992
What should I do?

241
00:16:12.743 --> 00:16:14.203
I think I'm going to get neurotic

242
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:36.559
Did you learn to play the piano?

243
00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:41.355
Not yet

244
00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:44.525
I can only play ‘Do-re-mi-re-do’

245
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.406
Handle with care, comrade.

246
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:57.830
comrades?

247
00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:04.962
comrade

248
00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:21.145
Nice to meet you

249
00:17:21.228 --> 00:17:23.230
Police Affairs Director Ryuhio Kato

250
00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:30.946
The reason I brought you here...

251
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.072
I heard it on the way

252
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:34.116
Is it because of the wanted baby?

253
00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:36.035
That is, at Myoyeonggak.

254
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.330
I guess we can communicate well.

255
00:17:40.831 --> 00:17:43.083
A pretty annoying guy
Looks like he's taking it with him

256
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.127
Could President Ryu hand it over to you?

257
00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:47.004
How much do you know about me?

258
00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:53.761
'All of Gyeongseong's money and information
'Woman holding'

259
00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.429
'Strangely'

260
00:17:57.139 --> 00:17:59.058
'I don't age'

261
00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:01.101
is the protagonist of the rumor

262
00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:02.895
I need some

263
00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:05.356
Because I tend to manage it closely.

264
00:18:05.898 --> 00:18:07.733
That friend's story was a bit different.

265
00:18:17.117 --> 00:18:19.036
We met on the train, right?

266
00:18:19.787 --> 00:18:20.788
Damn it

267
00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.251
What are we going to do?

268
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.754
As you can see, it's a monster.

269
00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:31.090
I already guessed your identity.

270
00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:32.299
If it's false

271
00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:37.012
You can't scare me with something like this
You probably know

272
00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.430
So

273
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.642
I prepared a small gift

274
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.441
You like gayageum, right?

275
00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:53.654
It’s a welcome face, isn’t it?

276
00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:57.032
This wound on the neck is believed to be a musical instrument string.

277
00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:58.993
For example, gayageum?

278
00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:03.414
That day, I played the gayageum
They said they were parasitic and had a fight.

279
00:19:04.331 --> 00:19:05.499
The name is

280
00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:07.751
orchid

281
00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.920
- or something like that
- Before pulling out your fingernails

282
00:19:10.004 --> 00:19:11.005
I confessed

283
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.423
He said he killed it

284
00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:14.049
What?

285
00:19:18.637 --> 00:19:20.723
I killed a soldier
I will kill you by firing squad.

286
00:19:21.015 --> 00:19:22.391
Myoyeonggak is closed.

287
00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:27.813
Where is the orchid?

288
00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:36.614
bring a child
Open your mouth

289
00:19:36.906 --> 00:19:39.241
If the gold mine map isn't released by noon tomorrow,

290
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.619
That bitch dies.

291
00:20:41.553 --> 00:20:42.554
Let's go

292
00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:44.223
Is this the only way?

293
00:20:44.682 --> 00:20:46.475
What I have accumulated in the human world

294
00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:47.559
everything is here

295
00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:49.603
Save the orchid

296
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:52.064
I will also protect Myoyeonggak.

297
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:05.035
I got the kid

298
00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.874
Go to Myoyeonggak and see their reaction.

299
00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:15.546
Would you mind thinking about something else when you have a hostage?

300
00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.260
never

301
00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.637
I'm not a skinny bitch

302
00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:31.770
Miho

303
00:21:33.397 --> 00:21:34.398
Miho

304
00:21:34.732 --> 00:21:37.359
No, where has our Miho gone?

305
00:21:37.443 --> 00:21:39.361
Didn’t Lee Rang take you out?

306
00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:41.655
No, I'm looking for a kid.
I went to collect my men.

307
00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:44.158
I can't even see the orchid

308
00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:45.617
What?

309
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:47.703
He said he was going to take a bath and left.
I didn't come back

310
00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:51.540
What is this...

311
00:22:02.593 --> 00:22:03.844
say it again

312
00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:05.471
When you find the kidnapped orchid

313
00:22:05.804 --> 00:22:07.598
where the baby is
I said I would let you know

314
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:09.058
Where is Hongju now?

315
00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.434
say!

316
00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:11.602
please find the orchid

317
00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:13.729
That's all I have to say

318
00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:16.356
Lee Yeon

319
00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:21.320
Get out of the way

320
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.363
This guy opens his mouth today, huh?

321
00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:29.578
Move a parasitic orchid

322
00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:31.955
If there is no news by noon...

323
00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:33.165
yes

324
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.958
Are you saying shoot me?

325
00:22:45.552 --> 00:22:46.553
gold mine location

326
00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:50.099
It's bitter

327
00:22:50.265 --> 00:22:51.308
uh

328
00:22:56.688 --> 00:22:58.190
I'll count to three exactly.

329
00:22:59.024 --> 00:23:00.317
Photograph the location of the gold mine

330
00:23:00.984 --> 00:23:01.985
one

331
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:03.862
two

332
00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:09.284
- three
- Get out of the way

333
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:26.009
I don't know how I lost it, but

334
00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.388
The child was loved

335
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.224
at my house
Three men eating and sleeping

336
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.434
Although I'm clumsy

337
00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:36.812
I took care of it with all my might.

338
00:23:46.697 --> 00:23:48.031
In that touch

339
00:23:49.283 --> 00:23:50.534
People’s lives depend on it.

340
00:24:01.753 --> 00:24:02.754
help me

341
00:24:18.103 --> 00:24:19.104
Thank you

342
00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:25.736
It's not a mine, is it?

343
00:24:27.446 --> 00:24:29.406
There are veins of gold in the river too.

344
00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:31.325
Check if it's real

345
00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:32.409
yes

346
00:24:34.036 --> 00:24:35.245
Let's go together

347
00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:38.457
- Why am I going?
- Humans or monsters

348
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:41.043
You have to be able to trust the Joseon bastards.

349
00:24:49.051 --> 00:24:50.302
Where is the orchid now?

350
00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:51.470
You man, huh?

351
00:24:51.553 --> 00:24:53.263
Do you want to see my brother take off his clothes?

352
00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:54.932
Who am I living like this for now?

353
00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:57.476
- Oh, you killed him?
- That's because I said it wasn't, really.

354
00:24:57.684 --> 00:24:59.853
Oh my

355
00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:05.234
Yes, I killed my only brother.
live well

356
00:25:05.317 --> 00:25:06.526
Why don’t you pay it like this?

357
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.070
Where is the orchid?

358
00:25:08.654 --> 00:25:10.280
Oh my, really, really

359
00:25:10.364 --> 00:25:12.616
After all, it's Jongno Police Station.

360
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.660
What should I do, just push it in?

361
00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:17.287
Hey, inside the police station
Well, roughly how many people are there?

362
00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:19.122
I don't know, maybe 250 people?

363
00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:20.207
250 people?

364
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:23.627
There are 45 minutes left until noon.

365
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:25.295
I don't have time to deal with it all, huh?

366
00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:27.756
- What about Lee Rang?
- Oh, I decided to stick with Hongju.

367
00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:29.675
So what should I do?

368
00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:31.468
How about this?

369
00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:35.722
Ah, I don't like it, even if there's a knife to my throat
I can't do that

370
00:25:35.806 --> 00:25:37.057
Then I'll do it, okay?

371
00:25:37.266 --> 00:25:39.434
Me, a former mountain god?
My son, he has honor.

372
00:25:39.518 --> 00:25:41.436
If you're at a disadvantage, they always say you're a former mountain god, Mr.

373
00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:55.534
- Let's go with confidence.
- Yeah.

374
00:25:55.617 --> 00:25:57.411
Jongno Police Station, we take over.

375
00:26:05.168 --> 00:26:06.962
Hey, do you know how to stand up?

376
00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:08.588
Uh, Jongno Language School
I went there for 6 months

377
00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:09.756
This

378
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.091
Can I exchange or refund?

379
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.343
- what do you mean?
- Can I exchange or get a refund?

380
00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:15.304
- IC
- Baby, don’t be scared.

381
00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:16.471
Half of them are Korean

382
00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:31.445
Is it a face I haven’t seen before?

383
00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:33.363
Oh my god, I’m new.

384
00:26:34.698 --> 00:26:35.907
Are you Korean?

385
00:26:36.283 --> 00:26:37.284
yes

386
00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:38.452
I am also Korean

387
00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.536
Ah, yes

388
00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:42.039
But

389
00:26:43.248 --> 00:26:44.875
Where have we met before?

390
00:26:46.335 --> 00:26:47.878
Oh, well, I

391
00:26:48.962 --> 00:26:51.965
Yeah, I'm talking about a common face
Yes, I hear it often.

392
00:26:53.508 --> 00:26:54.509
This face?

393
00:26:58.305 --> 00:26:59.473
Anyway, whatever

394
00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:01.058
Work hard

395
00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:02.476
yes

396
00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:03.685
Wait a minute

397
00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:11.401
Since you're new, you probably don't know much yet.

398
00:27:19.326 --> 00:27:20.660
You want me to shave my head?

399
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.579
Why? Men have hair

400
00:27:22.662 --> 00:27:24.039
The war is prolonging

401
00:27:25.207 --> 00:27:27.376
We dedicate ourselves to our country even from the rear.

402
00:27:28.543 --> 00:27:30.504
It means make up your mind

403
00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:32.047
Ah

404
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:33.882
Be prepared...

405
00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:38.261
Oh, I'll do it for you.

406
00:27:39.054 --> 00:27:41.181
I am a former intern at Seungja Choi’s hair salon.

407
00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:43.767
Just this time, just this time, I...

408
00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:47.521
sit this way

409
00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:09.835
Wow
I cut it all, I cut it all

410
00:28:09.918 --> 00:28:10.919
uh

411
00:28:14.548 --> 00:28:15.549
Let's go, let's go

412
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.471
You have to look closely

413
00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:24.015
- Huh?
- Yes

414
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:25.934
Well, it's shiny.

415
00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:29.479
If you have anything like that, tell me

416
00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:33.233
- None? what?
- None.

417
00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:35.861
Ha, indeed, Mr.

418
00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:38.738
This Jeong Dae-seung

419
00:28:39.197 --> 00:28:41.908
In a place like this
You're just watching a baby, right?

420
00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:44.411
Are you brothers from the same litter as Maehwa?

421
00:28:45.078 --> 00:28:47.831
why?
Well, my brother makes a living by selling his country.

422
00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:49.458
Well, what, did you say you were embarrassed?

423
00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:51.668
How much is a police officer's salary?

424
00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:54.129
They say they even send money to Maehwa every month?

425
00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:56.631
It's so sad that I can't bear to see you.

426
00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:58.633
Well, be a little more picky, tsk.

427
00:28:58.717 --> 00:29:01.178
If it wasn't for the plum blossoms, it would be that damn gisaeng's house
I robbed you a dozen more times, Mr.

428
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:04.055
If it weren't for Maehwa's brother
This was your place

429
00:29:08.143 --> 00:29:10.312
You don't know anything about this, huh?

430
00:29:10.395 --> 00:29:13.565
Smile brightly, ayu

431
00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:17.611
Don't laugh, man, eh?

432
00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:21.615
If you don't come out today, you and your father will
Dead life, man.

433
00:29:22.032 --> 00:29:23.241
Aig

434
00:29:27.329 --> 00:29:29.122
Ah, you little bastard.

435
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.041
This, this, that

436
00:29:31.416 --> 00:29:33.001
You just cursed at me with your finger, right?

437
00:29:33.293 --> 00:29:34.878
There’s nothing you can’t say to a child.

438
00:29:39.007 --> 00:29:40.133
None

439
00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:52.229
wake up

440
00:29:54.189 --> 00:29:55.440
How dare you fool me?

441
00:31:05.552 --> 00:31:06.553
No...

442
00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:23.278
Hey, what are you doing? Come on in.

443
00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:26.156
No, whatever you do, hurry up...

444
00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:33.496
Come here

445
00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:35.206
Give it, give it

446
00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:41.755
It's placer gold

447
00:31:43.089 --> 00:31:45.550
It's gold dust!

448
00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.428
Ah, carrots!

449
00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:51.389
Is it really gold dust?

450
00:32:09.908 --> 00:32:11.368
Hey, wake up

451
00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:14.037
Wake up! wake up

452
00:32:16.623 --> 00:32:17.916
The Governor-General proposed a deal.

453
00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:20.627
If you don't take the baby

454
00:32:21.127 --> 00:32:22.295
orchid dies

455
00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:26.883
What are your choices?

456
00:32:28.677 --> 00:32:29.969
I already made my choice?

457
00:32:33.598 --> 00:32:34.599
sleep quickly, sleep

458
00:32:37.394 --> 00:32:39.062
Then let's do it like this

459
00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:44.234
Ah, you do the transformation.

460
00:32:44.943 --> 00:32:46.277
Just until I get the orchid

461
00:32:46.653 --> 00:32:47.779
Just hold on until then

462
00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:49.698
Just keep doing what you're doing

463
00:32:50.699 --> 00:32:53.326
Now, this operation is only known to the three of us?
uh?

464
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:01.876
It's okay, this is enough

465
00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:04.045
Where on earth are you? Mr. Lee

466
00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:06.423
Hey, we're police now.
You ask confidently

467
00:33:06.923 --> 00:33:07.924
Uh, here it comes.

468
00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:09.926
I don't know, now, hey

469
00:33:12.095 --> 00:33:13.847
Gisaeng captured from Myoyeonggak
Where is it?

470
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:15.724
It's a transfer order.

471
00:33:15.807 --> 00:33:17.642
- Where?
- Government-General

472
00:33:17.726 --> 00:33:19.978
Oh, go to the interrogation room.

473
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.358
- Inside, inside? Go down?
- Yes

474
00:33:25.442 --> 00:33:27.277
Hey, less than 10 minutes left, Mr.

475
00:33:32.157 --> 00:33:33.158
Lee Yeon?

476
00:33:33.783 --> 00:33:35.368
You are Lee Yeon, right?

477
00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:37.912
-Who was it?
- A couple of disguised raccoons

478
00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:40.623
why are you here
Are you imitating a police officer?

479
00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:42.375
- Uh huh
- Because of you, my honey.

480
00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:44.461
I sprayed this
You weren't caught here.

481
00:33:44.544 --> 00:33:45.545
- These guys, really.
- You, Mr.

482
00:33:45.628 --> 00:33:46.796
- Do you know them?
- Yes, that

483
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.466
These are the ones I missed when I tried to catch them.
It seems like he has a very grudge against me.

484
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:50.842
- This nine-tailed fox, this is another lie...
- Uh huh

485
00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:53.386
A nine-tailed fox?

486
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.930
Yeah, it's opiate addiction
I'm hallucinating, look at these eyes, these eyes

487
00:33:56.014 --> 00:33:57.599
very just

488
00:33:57.682 --> 00:33:58.850
- That's you!
- quickly, quickly

489
00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:00.518
Uh, quickly, quickly.

490
00:34:03.188 --> 00:34:06.399
The newbies these days
You are full of spirit.

491
00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:21.915
Orchid, are you okay?

492
00:34:22.207 --> 00:34:23.416
Come to your senses

493
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.918
These bad guys, really, Mr.

494
00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:26.628
Why did you put your child in this situation?

495
00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:28.922
Lee Yeon?

496
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:31.257
- Are you Shinju’s brother?
- uh

497
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.051
Can you get up?

498
00:34:33.384 --> 00:34:34.385
Let's go out

499
00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.472
No way
If I run away, my boss is in danger.

500
00:34:38.473 --> 00:34:40.558
Hong Joo is trying to save you.
Do you know what you did?

501
00:34:42.393 --> 00:34:44.354
Wake up, let's go, there's no time

502
00:34:51.444 --> 00:34:52.445
This way

503
00:34:52.946 --> 00:34:54.656
walk straight

504
00:34:57.867 --> 00:34:59.619
called orchid
Looking for a gisaeng

505
00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:01.412
It's an order to transfer to the Governor-General.

506
00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:04.666
Uh, I heard earlier that other kids were taking it?

507
00:35:08.378 --> 00:35:10.213
hey!

508
00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:12.966
hey!

509
00:35:25.478 --> 00:35:27.897
That shiny thing
If you have anything, you have to tell me!

510
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:30.066
Spread that out quickly!

511
00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:33.111
Hey, I think we need more people.

512
00:35:33.194 --> 00:35:34.237
Well, then...

513
00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:36.447
Definitely finish it today

514
00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:37.907
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes!

515
00:35:38.575 --> 00:35:39.701
Do it quickly!

516
00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:41.661
Hey, where did he go?

517
00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:43.496
I don't even see my children, tsk

518
00:35:45.915 --> 00:35:47.375
Where are you running, huh?

519
00:35:49.252 --> 00:35:50.587
huh? Where are you running away?

520
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.797
Put it down, you bastard.

521
00:35:54.799 --> 00:35:55.925
you

522
00:35:56.342 --> 00:35:57.844
Do you speak well?

523
00:35:57.927 --> 00:35:59.888
It's a secret, come here

524
00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:04.726
They're criticizing me

525
00:36:08.146 --> 00:36:10.231
Ah, oh my

526
00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:14.152
Oh my, oh my, oh my

527
00:36:16.946 --> 00:36:19.532
Hey, lose your temper a bit.

528
00:36:19.616 --> 00:36:20.700
It's because of you

529
00:36:20.783 --> 00:36:21.910
Is it coming out?

530
00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:24.621
Baby, baby bites people

531
00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:25.955
Yeah, that's what kids do that time of year.

532
00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.916
That's not it, you call me a salty guy, Mr.

533
00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:29.125
Sounds that don't even sound like words

534
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:30.752
He speaks so well, this

535
00:36:30.835 --> 00:36:31.836
Hey

536
00:36:33.588 --> 00:36:35.465
Gold mines are all gold mines.

537
00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:59.530
Oh, oh, slowly, slowly

538
00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:01.324
Mr. Lee

539
00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:06.454
Are you sure?

540
00:37:06.663 --> 00:37:07.664
yes

541
00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:11.376
Currently under development in secret
It even includes gold mines.

542
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:13.044
That guy is real

543
00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:15.588
Yeah?

544
00:37:34.524 --> 00:37:36.442
No, not yet.

545
00:37:36.818 --> 00:37:38.152
Save the orchid first

546
00:37:42.907 --> 00:37:43.908
Yuna

547
00:37:44.283 --> 00:37:45.284
Hurry up

548
00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:54.168
- Hey, get it!
- Stand there!

549
00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:01.342
Stop!

550
00:38:01.676 --> 00:38:04.012
- Hey, get it!
- Stand there!

551
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.311
야, 먼저 가
내가 유인할게

552
00:38:16.149 --> 00:38:17.316
어이, 잡아가쇼

553
00:38:59.734 --> 00:39:02.195
어딜 만져, 이 개새끼야!

554
00:39:03.362 --> 00:39:04.363
What are you again? Mr.

555
00:39:04.447 --> 00:39:05.448
Wow

556
00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:06.908
Mr. Lee, die!

557
00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:09.660
Die, die!

558
00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:11.579
Wow, Mr.

559
00:39:11.662 --> 00:39:14.040
Die, die, die

560
00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:15.458
Oh, I'm pissed, really, Mr.

561
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.251
Wow, Mr.

562
00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:20.046
Ugh, really, Mr. Lee.

563
00:39:21.172 --> 00:39:23.549
Ah, this is why I hate disguises

564
00:39:26.803 --> 00:39:28.179
- Lee Yeon
- Hey, those bastards

565
00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:29.639
Thighs only, ah, that's it, that's it

566
00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.100
No, but
How do you know the orchid is safe?

567
00:39:32.517 --> 00:39:33.643
I don't have a cell phone

568
00:39:37.146 --> 00:39:38.147
Uh, wait a minute

569
00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:56.916
Ah, this, this
The weather is like this, why is it like this?

570
00:39:56.999 --> 00:39:58.251
uh?

571
00:39:58.584 --> 00:39:59.585
It's Yeon's signal.

572
00:40:00.169 --> 00:40:01.254
The orchid is safe

573
00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:04.257
Tell it to the police chief right away.

574
00:40:04.882 --> 00:40:07.802
Yes, this much gold
Would a hundred years war be easy?

575
00:40:13.933 --> 00:40:15.726
If you've seen everything you need to see, I'm done too.

576
00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.270
What about the kid? Not interested?

577
00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:20.106
I'm not particularly a humanist

578
00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:25.153
Is that, Mr., hitting you in the back?

579
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.071
I'm sorry but

580
00:40:27.572 --> 00:40:29.699
gold mine map
Why can't it fall into their hands?

581
00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:36.831
your father is dead

582
00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:38.875
You're a monster too, so you probably hold a grudge.

583
00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:48.467
Oh, I thought I was dying from a moth sting.

584
00:40:48.718 --> 00:40:49.719
Who are you?

585
00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:51.012
me?

586
00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:53.014
Joseon's nine-tailed fox

587
00:41:06.736 --> 00:41:08.321
Mr.

588
00:41:25.213 --> 00:41:26.380
Everyone stop moving

589
00:41:28.424 --> 00:41:30.301
If you take just one step from now

590
00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:32.929
This is your cemetery today.

591
00:41:34.263 --> 00:41:35.556
Hey, brother-in-law Gumiho

592
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.226
I'll look after you, feel free to stick around.

593
00:41:46.692 --> 00:41:47.902
Are you going to be okay?

594
00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:49.612
You know Hongju, Rang is behind you.

595
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.157
I took the orchid
I'll go to Myoyeonggak.

596
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.742
- Uh
-What about our Miho?

597
00:41:54.825 --> 00:41:57.245
Ah, I left it to Ureong Gaksi.
I'll come find you

598
00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:13.970
What is it?

599
00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:16.305
This bloody bloody thing

600
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.603
In Joseon
Has there ever been a monster with this much power?

601
00:42:33.322 --> 00:42:34.323
What are you looking at?

602
00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:37.827
What is your name?

603
00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:39.370
Leeyeon

604
00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:43.165
My name is Ryuhei Kato

605
00:42:43.499 --> 00:42:44.500
Remember that

606
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:46.168
Because we will see each other again

607
00:42:51.632 --> 00:42:53.426
Eat up people

608
00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:56.595
Then everything flies away.

609
00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:05.313
- Lee Yeon
- Don't come!

610
00:43:56.781 --> 00:43:57.948
Leeyeon

611
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.891
I had a hard time

612
00:44:24.392 --> 00:44:25.393
boss

613
00:44:26.352 --> 00:44:28.145
I won't forget this grace

614
00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:32.108
What is grace

615
00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:34.902
So much because of me
You almost lost it

616
00:44:36.487 --> 00:44:37.488
fool

617
00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:39.615
Why did you say you killed him?

618
00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:41.117
Blow it up because it's me

619
00:44:42.243 --> 00:44:44.286
I also wanted to protect my boss.

620
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:47.081
Because you always protected us

621
00:45:16.819 --> 00:45:17.820
Are you back?

622
00:45:20.322 --> 00:45:21.323
Could it be that our Miho...

623
00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:23.742
This person is a mocker

624
00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:26.537
Isn't it your daughter?

625
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.955
It's just me doing some tricks.

626
00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:30.040
It's my job to protect this person.

627
00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:32.960
Why does it look like a baby?

628
00:45:33.043 --> 00:45:34.712
Because he is the god who rules over desire

629
00:45:34.962 --> 00:45:36.839
purest
Born as a child

630
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:39.049
It never grows.

631
00:45:39.133 --> 00:45:41.051
Oh, that's too much for a kid.

632
00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:43.137
Born as a native god
This child is destined

633
00:45:44.096 --> 00:45:45.097
Where are you going now?

634
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:46.474
i don't know

635
00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:47.725
where to stay

636
00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:50.978
Who will you bless?
Because you decide for yourself.

637
00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:53.731
I put baby supplies in my bag.

638
00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.065
Thank you

639
00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.153
go

640
00:45:59.236 --> 00:46:00.446
Well, just once

641
00:46:01.572 --> 00:46:02.573
Can I just look at it once?

642
00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:07.536
Miho

643
00:46:08.454 --> 00:46:10.039
I said I was going to wash your diaper, that

644
00:46:10.331 --> 00:46:12.374
I thought my back was cracked

645
00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:13.667
It's already goodbye

646
00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:15.252
wherever you go

647
00:46:15.878 --> 00:46:17.379
No matter what name you live by

648
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.634
Please remember us
I don't think he remembers

649
00:46:22.384 --> 00:46:24.303
Hey, don't be shy, tsk

650
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.888
Bye, okay?

651
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:27.264
To people

652
00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:28.599
It's good to share good fortune

653
00:46:28.682 --> 00:46:30.100
You too are blessed

654
00:46:30.684 --> 00:46:32.311
Say hello to Lee Rang too

655
00:46:34.188 --> 00:46:35.189
I

656
00:46:35.773 --> 00:46:36.774
That's enough

657
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.946
Oh my, fish oil

658
00:46:44.907 --> 00:46:47.284
Huh?

659
00:46:50.663 --> 00:46:51.664
What are you saying?

660
00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:54.250
Rather than a doctor

661
00:46:54.917 --> 00:46:56.835
I like the magic band.

662
00:46:57.836 --> 00:46:59.838
Boy, I knew that

663
00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:03.217
Well, I like you too

664
00:47:06.178 --> 00:47:07.388
Huh?

665
00:47:08.597 --> 00:47:11.559
And you meet the person you miss again

666
00:47:13.269 --> 00:47:15.688
And you have a pure nature

667
00:47:16.105 --> 00:47:17.231
You'll get lost.

668
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.111
What are you talking about?

669
00:47:31.996 --> 00:47:33.789
arm once
Could you please pick it up?

670
00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:48.012
It's finding its way
Hope this helps

671
00:47:58.731 --> 00:47:59.732
Then I'll leave

672
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.415
goodbye

673
00:48:17.249 --> 00:48:18.876
A time when everyone was poor

674
00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:22.713
Koreans treat abandoned babies
It's called eopdung

675
00:48:22.796 --> 00:48:24.131
I used to harvest and grow

676
00:48:24.965 --> 00:48:25.966
a lucky child

677
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.593
stop crying

678
00:48:27.676 --> 00:48:31.513
That name almost starved to death
Saved the lives of countless babies

679
00:48:32.848 --> 00:48:33.849
we are

680
00:48:35.059 --> 00:48:36.894
met the real thing

681
00:48:48.072 --> 00:48:49.073
I...

682
00:48:51.075 --> 00:48:53.035
- Wow, really.
- There

683
00:48:53.118 --> 00:48:54.119
Let me ask you something.

684
00:48:55.037 --> 00:48:57.956
Somewhere in this alley, there is a pawn shop for monsters.
They say there is, but do you know?

685
00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.042
pawnshop? I know it all

686
00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:03.253
I bought this there too

687
00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:05.214
A fan that makes your nose longer

688
00:49:05.297 --> 00:49:08.467
Oh my, this guy
Do you think you know who I am and talk about it?

689
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.719
- In this harsh world
- No, I...

690
00:49:11.303 --> 00:49:12.471
Do you know Lee Yeon?

691
00:49:13.097 --> 00:49:14.098
I came to catch that guy too.

692
00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:15.557
Oh my

693
00:49:15.974 --> 00:49:17.935
On our side!

694
00:49:18.018 --> 00:49:19.812
Hey, are you good at fighting?

695
00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:22.189
- yes?
- Hey, what are you doing?

696
00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:23.357
Oh, tell me anything

697
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.441
uh

698
00:49:25.484 --> 00:49:26.985
Is there any location...

699
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:28.487
The pawn shop of monsters

700
00:49:29.822 --> 00:49:31.073
It's only open on New Year's Eve

701
00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:32.157
Last year?

702
00:49:33.117 --> 00:49:34.451
Oh, I don't have time

703
00:49:34.535 --> 00:49:36.036
Do you know who the boss is there?

704
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:39.623
Write, well, that, so much
There is a rumor that he is a big man.

705
00:49:39.707 --> 00:49:41.375
- That's fine with us too...
- Would you like me to find out?

706
00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:44.253
to our meeting
I have a yard foot.

707
00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:46.588
Please
I have enough examples...

708
00:49:46.672 --> 00:49:48.132
That's it!

709
00:49:48.215 --> 00:49:49.341
I...

710
00:50:25.753 --> 00:50:26.754
Not yet

711
00:50:27.504 --> 00:50:28.505
I still

712
00:50:30.382 --> 00:50:31.508
There's still work to do

713
00:50:50.152 --> 00:50:51.320
“Oriental Theater”

714
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:09.254
Are you the Great King of Wudo?

715
00:51:14.343 --> 00:51:16.220
Someone talks to me while I'm watching a movie

716
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.013
I hate it the most

717
00:51:18.639 --> 00:51:20.474
I have something important to say to you.

718
00:51:21.225 --> 00:51:22.810
Say those words after the movie is over.

719
00:51:24.186 --> 00:51:25.270
It's urgent.

720
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:28.982
I'm not in a hurry

721
00:51:33.237 --> 00:51:35.113
I saw this movie

722
00:51:35.197 --> 00:51:36.573
They all die in the end

723
00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:40.953
No, this is crazy!

724
00:51:41.036 --> 00:51:44.122
Oh, let's be quiet, okay?

725
00:51:45.958 --> 00:51:46.959
sorry

726
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.796
sorry

727
00:51:52.464 --> 00:51:54.341
Have you seen such a vicious person?

728
00:51:55.133 --> 00:51:56.134
how

729
00:51:56.426 --> 00:51:58.178
Would you like to roll in the dark hell?

730
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:59.596
What is the crime?

731
00:52:01.598 --> 00:52:02.599
movie ending

732
00:52:04.184 --> 00:52:05.561
crime of leakage

733
00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:08.897
You can't be prosecuted for that.

734
00:52:10.732 --> 00:52:13.944
A child who should not survive
I came back alive

735
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.029
That too in the future

736
00:52:17.447 --> 00:52:18.657
Who did it?

737
00:52:20.409 --> 00:52:21.451
No way

738
00:52:23.078 --> 00:52:25.038
Are you suspicious of the kings of hell?

739
00:52:27.624 --> 00:52:28.625
Exactly

740
00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:31.253
You are doubting the King.

741
00:52:32.546 --> 00:52:34.214
Always tinkering

742
00:52:34.298 --> 00:52:36.633
He goes in and out of this world,

743
00:52:36.717 --> 00:52:38.719
Tinkle? Ding ding...

744
00:52:46.977 --> 00:52:47.978
I'm not

745
00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:50.272
I need to watch a movie too

746
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.357
I have to run a business and am very busy.

747
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.903
Who else but the kings?

748
00:52:56.653 --> 00:52:58.614
The only thing that has that much power in this world is

749
00:52:58.947 --> 00:53:00.073
You

750
00:53:02.159 --> 00:53:03.160
and

751
00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:05.829
There was one more guy, wasn't there?

752
00:53:12.461 --> 00:53:13.462
He is

753
00:53:15.756 --> 00:53:17.049
That can't be possible

754
00:53:24.014 --> 00:53:25.015
Who are you?

755
00:53:27.893 --> 00:53:29.895
The pawn shop of monsters
Are you looking for it?

756
00:53:33.357 --> 00:53:34.441
This body is

757
00:53:36.234 --> 00:53:37.778
He is the owner of a pawn shop.

758
00:53:39.488 --> 00:53:40.989
You are the exiled northern mountain god

759
00:53:41.323 --> 00:53:42.324
Right?

760
00:53:43.367 --> 00:53:44.660
Just looked at it

761
00:53:45.285 --> 00:53:46.870
I'm not from this era

762
00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:49.289
You are not a regular businessman.

763
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.250
I want to know your respect

764
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:54.252
I'm oh

765
00:53:54.962 --> 00:53:57.255
Baby, with my mouth
Should we talk about this?

766
00:53:59.383 --> 00:54:00.384
uh

767
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.761
5

768
00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:04.137
What is 5?

769
00:54:05.764 --> 00:54:07.683
Oh my, this is frustrating, tsk

770
00:54:08.308 --> 00:54:09.935
Odo front wheel

771
00:54:10.686 --> 00:54:11.687
king

772
00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.981
The king who rules hell
How could a place like this...

773
00:54:15.148 --> 00:54:16.316
Forgive me, I don't know.

774
00:54:21.405 --> 00:54:25.701
This guy is so upright
How can you go around being betrayed by a group of people who take off their clothes?

775
00:54:25.993 --> 00:54:28.245
I didn't want to be your king's guest.

776
00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:29.705
Because you came here knowing everything

777
00:54:30.497 --> 00:54:31.498
Isn't it?

778
00:54:32.666 --> 00:54:33.667
yes?

779
00:54:36.044 --> 00:54:39.339
This is my wholesome hobby
Let's leave politics out of it.

780
00:54:39.423 --> 00:54:40.549
Those words...

781
00:54:40.924 --> 00:54:43.510
I'm saying I like you quite a bit.

782
00:54:44.177 --> 00:54:45.178
yes

783
00:54:45.721 --> 00:54:46.722
What do you want?

784
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:51.018
I want my body back

785
00:54:54.354 --> 00:54:55.355
close

786
00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:05.282
The skill of the undressing group

787
00:55:08.118 --> 00:55:09.661
The requirements might be a bit difficult, right?

788
00:55:09.995 --> 00:55:11.788
I'll do anything to fix it.

789
00:55:11.872 --> 00:55:13.290
If so

790
00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:15.000
Let's see

791
00:55:16.209 --> 00:55:17.919
Where was this?

792
00:55:18.628 --> 00:55:19.629
Oh, I'm here.

793
00:55:19.963 --> 00:55:22.591
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Jag, jag, jag, jag, jag.

794
00:55:24.259 --> 00:55:26.094
He's a guy with no smile at all.

795
00:55:26.386 --> 00:55:28.263
Hey, tight guy.

796
00:55:33.977 --> 00:55:35.103
Now

797
00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:40.484
What are you giving me?

798
00:55:44.154 --> 00:55:45.363
I'll give you anything

799
00:55:46.907 --> 00:55:47.908
Even my soul

800
00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.835
Do you really not know? Who is the red and white mask?

801
00:56:00.045 --> 00:56:02.714
Oh, how many times?
Because I can't even see it

802
00:56:03.006 --> 00:56:04.966
Oh, the old lady's clairvoyance is, well, a decoration?

803
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.927
Wow, blood pressure, really.

804
00:56:09.304 --> 00:56:10.305
Hey

805
00:56:10.764 --> 00:56:14.059
Even in the future
Working with you like this?

806
00:56:15.018 --> 00:56:16.686
When you get home, give me my deepest condolences.

807
00:56:17.145 --> 00:56:18.188
To my future self

808
00:56:18.647 --> 00:56:21.483
So
They say I might not be able to go home

809
00:56:21.775 --> 00:56:23.568
It's a deal to lose your way, you look down on me

810
00:56:24.194 --> 00:56:26.029
What could be the reason? Red and white mask!

811
00:56:26.113 --> 00:56:29.908
The road is made by the guardian stone you have
The door opens when the time comes! Tsk

812
00:56:29.991 --> 00:56:31.076
Take care of the guardian stone, you bastard.

813
00:56:31.409 --> 00:56:32.410
Eh?

814
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:34.996
Why are you so indifferent to me?

815
00:56:36.206 --> 00:56:37.833
The 38 year old lady is, what, a cyborg?

816
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:40.627
Su, sa, what?

817
00:56:41.628 --> 00:56:44.256
Oh, that's it.
Anyway, just try not to go home.

818
00:56:44.339 --> 00:56:46.424
This world, the next world, just
It's all a mess, just

819
00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:48.051
Wow, really

820
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.387
Oh my
How did I end up here?

821
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.308
Why are you lying to Yeon?

822
00:56:57.978 --> 00:57:00.188
Because it’s Cheon Muyoung

823
00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:01.898
That damn red and white mask

824
00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:08.196
A child born with a dual destiny

825
00:57:11.408 --> 00:57:14.202
It could be a blessing to the world
I said I might get angry, but

826
00:57:15.328 --> 00:57:16.663
I was confident

827
00:57:18.248 --> 00:57:19.624
This guy is definitely

828
00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:21.751
I will become a noble mountain god.

829
00:57:24.004 --> 00:57:25.839
Turn Muyoung into stone

830
00:57:27.674 --> 00:57:28.675
you

831
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.928
I've been squeezing my heart out for a long time

832
00:57:32.554 --> 00:57:33.763
I shed tears of blood

833
00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:35.140
I know that

834
00:57:36.975 --> 00:57:39.394
I tried not to give too much affection, but...

835
00:57:41.813 --> 00:57:43.231
You want to save Muyoung, right?

836
00:57:44.649 --> 00:57:45.650
well

837
00:57:47.235 --> 00:57:49.946
I'm just having small expectations.

838
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:52.949
me in the future

839
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.246
To catch Muyoung
Why did I send Yeon-i?

840
00:58:02.709 --> 00:58:04.920
'Isn't there a reason?' And

841
00:58:13.595 --> 00:58:15.096
“Cheon Ho-young”

842
00:58:16.556 --> 00:58:17.641
I'll be back, bro.

843
00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:38.036
Are you going on a date today too?

844
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:41.248
They say they’ll come to the club later at night.

845
00:58:42.415 --> 00:58:45.252
Today I will definitely
You'll capture his heart

846
00:58:45.585 --> 00:58:47.254
Oh, by what means?

847
00:58:49.798 --> 00:58:50.799
“Three thousand miles”

848
00:58:50.882 --> 00:58:53.551
Looking at the magazine, the man said what he said
They say they like women who listen to them.

849
00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:55.553
What was Gya fussing about?

850
00:58:57.472 --> 00:59:00.308
If you want to sing
Stand properly on both legs

851
00:59:02.894 --> 00:59:04.437
Don't be a spectacle

852
00:59:06.189 --> 00:59:07.274
It's a big deal

853
00:59:08.775 --> 00:59:10.110
This guy and that guy...

854
00:59:13.905 --> 00:59:14.906
Oh, it's uncomfortable

855
00:59:15.865 --> 00:59:17.117
Oh, it's so uncomfortable

856
00:59:17.784 --> 00:59:19.369
- Oh, my neck hurts so much.
- I'm leaving.

857
00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:21.663
Where are you going?

858
00:59:23.498 --> 00:59:24.958
Where are you going at this hour?

859
00:59:25.417 --> 00:59:27.127
I know where you and I are going.

860
00:59:28.253 --> 00:59:30.088
date

861
00:59:30.463 --> 00:59:32.048
date?

862
00:59:33.383 --> 00:59:34.384
I want to go too

863
00:59:38.138 --> 00:59:39.723
Oh my

864
00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:41.308
What kind of bouquet is this?

865
00:59:43.018 --> 00:59:44.019
You ordered it

866
00:59:44.311 --> 00:59:45.854
Come to the club with a bouquet of flowers

867
00:59:45.937 --> 00:59:46.938
second wish

868
00:59:47.647 --> 00:59:48.648
It was like that

869
00:59:49.024 --> 00:59:50.025
Anyway, thank you

870
00:59:50.859 --> 00:59:52.193
Yes, I'm going

871
00:59:52.569 --> 00:59:53.570
Wait a minute

872
00:59:53.987 --> 00:59:55.405
You should go see my performance

873
00:59:55.488 --> 00:59:57.282
Even that is a set of wishes.

874
00:59:57.657 --> 00:59:59.909
Yeah? Sure, whatever

875
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.800
Oh, a bouquet

876
01:00:16.051 --> 01:00:17.635
I have feelings for you too.

877
01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:19.220
Hey, doesn’t that girl look really nice?

878
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.431
My dream is to be a singer

879
01:00:21.514 --> 01:00:23.683
There's nothing that hasn't been done in the human world.
They say he’s the king of part-time jobs

880
01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:26.227
That's great, then you get married.
Aren’t you going to work together?

881
01:00:27.395 --> 01:00:28.521
- How old are you?
- Than Lee Rang.

882
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.065
Are you 40 years older?

883
01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:32.484
Oh my, among the monsters
I'm not even 40 years old

884
01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:33.943
Well, I don't even see compatibility.

885
01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:41.618
Are you confident that you can leave this behind?

886
01:00:45.663 --> 01:00:47.123
Honestly I'm not confident

887
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.544
With that personality
He probably thinks I abandoned him again.

888
01:00:53.088 --> 01:00:55.799

01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:35.208
Today will be the last day, right? us

917
01:03:37.418 --> 01:03:38.795
Why did you lie?

918
01:03:39.504 --> 01:03:41.548
I'm sorry, you're disappointed in me, right?

919
01:03:42.465 --> 01:03:44.050
I did that without even knowing

920
01:03:44.384 --> 01:03:45.385
I like it

921
01:03:46.678 --> 01:03:48.763
You're a lot stronger than you thought, right?
yes fighting power

922
01:03:48.846 --> 01:03:49.931
Combat power?

923
01:03:50.557 --> 01:03:51.599
It's cool

924
01:03:51.683 --> 01:03:52.684
Really?

925
01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:55.103
You're the first person to say that

926
01:04:01.484 --> 01:04:02.569
I couldn't hear you
I couldn't hear you

927
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:06.698
- Can you run?
- huh?

928
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.950
Annoying guys caught up with me

929
01:04:10.535 --> 01:04:11.536
I can run

930
01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:17.333
Lee Rang
Irang, over there

931
01:04:18.293 --> 01:04:19.294
There, there

932
01:05:22.315 --> 01:05:25.693
Boy, where are these guys hiding?
uh?

933
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:28.154
I hid so well, I hid so well

934
01:05:28.613 --> 01:05:30.657
I can't find it at all

935
01:05:34.118 --> 01:05:35.119
Aren't you my brother?

936
01:05:49.425 --> 01:05:50.426
Ah

937
01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:53.596
uh

938
01:05:55.431 --> 01:05:56.432
went

939
01:06:07.402 --> 01:06:08.820
Do you want to eat together?

940
01:06:10.988 --> 01:06:11.989
well

941
01:06:13.199 --> 01:06:14.200
What

942
01:06:14.534 --> 01:06:15.535
If it's cold noodles

943
01:06:18.454 --> 01:06:19.789
I got caught because of you

944
01:06:19.872 --> 01:06:21.791
Hey, are you sneezing there?

945
01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:22.875
Ah

946
01:06:22.959 --> 01:06:24.752
Hey, this is still enough
I guess the boards are laid out well?

947
01:06:24.836 --> 01:06:26.254
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

948
01:06:28.548 --> 01:06:29.966
I'm going to meet someone for a moment.

949
01:06:30.842 --> 01:06:33.302
- Who?
- I also have a private life.

950
01:06:33.553 --> 01:06:34.846
- Sleep first, okay?
- uh?

951
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:36.139
Hey, where are you going?

952
01:06:37.306 --> 01:06:39.517
Ah, these are all...

953
01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:45.648
I want to see Jia too

954
01:07:07.628 --> 01:07:09.297
He will definitely come

955
01:07:10.173 --> 01:07:11.632
Aiming for this treasure

956
01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:14.594
Yuna

957
01:07:14.927 --> 01:07:15.928
Leeyeon

958
01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:17.555
let's play with me

959
01:07:27.982 --> 01:07:28.983
What is it?

960
01:07:47.502 --> 01:07:48.503
Cheon Muyoung?

961
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:50.671
Muyoung?

962
01:07:51.088 --> 01:07:52.089
yes

963
01:07:53.049 --> 01:07:54.050
It's me

964
01:07:56.219 --> 01:07:57.261
How did you get here...

965
01:07:57.345 --> 01:07:58.513
Did you come back alive?

966
01:08:04.018 --> 01:08:05.019
Ah

967
01:08:19.242 --> 01:08:20.451
Are you wearing a red and white mask?

968
01:08:51.732 --> 01:08:53.901
It's not just a ghost

969
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.071
I will protect it

970
01:08:57.363 --> 01:08:59.365
Our relationship is becoming tattered
Even if I have resentment

971
01:08:59.448 --> 01:09:01.450
Let's play, without thinking like in the old days

972
01:09:02.743 --> 01:09:04.537
in this room right now
There's someone else!

973
01:09:05.496 --> 01:09:07.957
- Where did boss Hongju go?
- I have to find Hongju.

974
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:09.876
Oh, what if this is a trap?

975
01:09:09.959 --> 01:09:12.461
At least I don’t know why Muyoung came to see me.

976
01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:13.671
You'll find out

977
01:09:13.754 --> 01:09:14.881
The path of the wicked

978
01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:18.050
Even the world’s undressing faction
It's a place you can't pry into

979
01:09:18.342 --> 01:09:20.052
Yuna, please be my Janggi player.

980
01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:22.680
here
You can't die
