﻿1
00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:07.255
Emergency, emergency, emergency, wake up!

2
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:08.381
Emergency! Wake up, wake up!

3
00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:09.674
ax!

4
00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.263
- Is this a surprise attack?
- Call President Hongju

5
00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:17.474
I don't know what it is
They say there’s chaos now.

6
00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:23.063
What is it? why?

7
00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:30.695
Cabbage grown in the sea breeze
My stomach is full.

8
00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.781
Are the shrimp cooked well?

9
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.699
It’s refreshing without any fishy smell.

10
00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:36.701
Please save me, boss.

11
00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:37.911
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.288
Oh, what? What, it's an emergency?

13
00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.457
The largest in Myoyeonggak
It's one of our monthly events.

14
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.667
Of course it's an emergency

15
00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.252
Sit down, all three of you.

16
00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:46.962
Kimchi?

17
00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:48.255
I am a former mountain god

18
00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:49.840
I am the leader of a bandit gang.

19
00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:50.924
I am

20
00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.342
I am a victim of a bandit gang.

21
00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.511
Sanshin doesn’t make kimchi or anything like that.

22
00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:56.096
- A
- Wait a minute.

23
00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.015
In the meantime, you guys
The cost of eating without knowing anything

24
00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.725
I calculated it

25
00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:02.853
Even if I can’t do it

26
00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:04.563
The price of a house comes up?

27
00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:06.690
No, why so much...

28
00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.192
No, why do you keep
Order a full course Korean meal...

29
00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:10.610
You ate it all, Mr. Lee.

30
00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:13.071
Oh, well, what

31
00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.448
DC, isn’t there something like that?

32
00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:16.867
He's your friend and a former mountain god?

33
00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:19.286
No meme, man.

34
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.788
Oh, really
You should have tried this before, really.

35
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:23.707
Wow, really

36
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.710
Ah, my waist.

37
00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.339
No, what kind of kimchi?
Are you going to soak 500 heads and eat them? really

38
00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:33.174
Ha, the name is Magic Bandit.

39
00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.510
Instead of blood, I got red pepper on my hands.

40
00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:37.262
- I, I
-Kimchi is homemade.

41
00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:38.847
Fill it thoroughly

42
00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.141
- Hey, but this
- Huh?

43
00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:42.475
Isn't the liver a bit too strong?

44
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:43.560
okay? Give it to me

45
00:02:48.607 --> 00:02:50.650
Just right

46
00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.569
If you want it to ferment in a crock pot, you need to season it a bit.

47
00:02:52.652 --> 00:02:53.945
Carefully

48
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:55.739
- They say you have to do it occasionally.
- Mmm, it's delicious.

49
00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:26.061
What?

50
00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:28.104
Wow, really

51
00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:32.025
Lee Yeon, I can’t be roommates with you.

52
00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:33.193
It really doesn't suit me

53
00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:34.486
Kwak, Mr., are you Ilumbo?

54
00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.905
So you
Why did you rob him?

55
00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:38.365
How strong is this guy?

56
00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:40.283
What did he know?

57
00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.243
Just whatever, work ethic.
All you need to do is check whether you are thorough or not.

58
00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:43.411
Ah, of course

59
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.163
I just thought there was something in the alcohol

60
00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.082
A guy who throws things away when he says something is good
Aren't you stupid?

61
00:03:47.457 --> 00:03:48.959
This thief's son

62
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.421
Hey

63
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.924
You are still the victim
It's not about covering up the sin.

64
00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:57.384
Don't yell at my men!

65
00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:58.677
I'm not criticizing you.

66
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.845
To our boss
Don't say this or that

67
00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:02.514
- Shut up and make kimchi!
- Boy, aren't you letting go of that?

68
00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:20.281
Gyeongseong has also changed a lot.

69
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.450
It has to be in Korean.
This chicken head

70
00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:25.286
Cho, Korean language

71
00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:27.080
Ugh, it's difficult.

72
00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:29.374
Have you learned Korean?
It's already been 20 years

73
00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:34.671
Is it a shinigami mercenary group or something?
It's you guys, right?

74
00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.048
I came to pick you up by order of the director.

75
00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:39.759
Working under Kato
Don't you know us?

76
00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:41.469
This is Gyeongseong

77
00:04:41.553 --> 00:04:43.096
country bumpkins
Something like a name

78
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.723
It's none of my business

79
00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.976
Shall I tell you? who we are

80
00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.274
There are many eyes to see

81
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.011
Are you waiting with me?

82
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:25.597
- No.
- Or?

83
00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:27.640
What is all this?

84
00:05:29.267 --> 00:05:33.438
I saw in a magazine that if you fold a paper crane,
They say love will come true

85
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.731
What are you doing?

86
00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:36.149
Is it that good?

87
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:40.487
Then go out and meet him.

88
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.322
Is that okay?

89
00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:44.657
Then I'll leave for an hour and come back.

90
00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:48.661
Ah, indeed

91
00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:53.708
There was caramel on my clothes!

92
00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:55.877
Newdo, right?

93
00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:57.921
It's noisy

94
00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:00.006
dirty, my clothes

95
00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.060
What are you looking at?

96
00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:13.228
I didn't see it

97
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.271
You saw it, just now

98
00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:32.997
Ah
It's finally gotten a little wider

99
00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.628
It's a monster, there's a monster

100
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:40.046
what
Youkai?

101
00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:43.633
mermaid

102
00:06:44.008 --> 00:06:45.009
Mermaid?

103
00:06:45.093 --> 00:06:48.763
mermaid meat
They say it’s the elixir of immortality.

104
00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:50.306
I want to eat

105
00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:53.101
Yuki
I'll catch you

106
00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:54.602
Do it in moderation

107
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.771
Now the mission comes first

108
00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:14.706
Delicious, delicious

109
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.249
Looks leisurely?

110
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.792
Aren’t you going to catch the red and white mask?

111
00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:20.128
I've already been there, it's gone

112
00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:21.713
Shall we ask our kids to find it?

113
00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:24.340
No, it will come on its own

114
00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:28.970
You are

115
00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:31.014
Dying before living for less than 100 years

116
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.766
2020

117
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.186
Becoming a sacrifice to replace your brother

118
00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:39.063
Oh, how are you with that mermaid girl?

119
00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:40.982
How is it going? You say you see them all the time these days?

120
00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:42.108
Isn't it always?

121
00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:43.526
Let's set a date, meet up

122
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.361
Write, ah, where is the best place?

123
00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:46.738
Hanjeongsik? Light Western food?

124
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:47.989
Should I leave out the seafood?

125
00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:49.532
Also, the bride seems to be from that branch.

126
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.076
Aren't you crazy? What is a meeting ceremony?

127
00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:55.413
My wish is for you to get married, huh?

128
00:07:55.496 --> 00:07:56.956
Don't worry about me

129
00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.377
Ah, why like this
Only drink makgeolli, on an empty stomach

130
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.338
Huh? Come on, eat some boiled pork.

131
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:04.923
Ah, why are you like this? really

132
00:08:06.716 --> 00:08:08.218
Is this something to be so upset about? uh?

133
00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:10.136
Don't act friendly, I feel bad

134
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.640
Why again?

135
00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:16.184
What's the problem, huh? Why is it crooked?

136
00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:20.188
Hey

137
00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:23.441
Mr. Really

138
00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.361
Oh, that bastard, that

139
00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:29.155
There's not much left until we're together, tsk

140
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.001
Brother

141
00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:10.131
Did you miss Yuki?

142
00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:12.550
Well, okay

143
00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:15.219
Yuki
I missed you so much, brother.

144
00:10:15.303 --> 00:10:17.013
They say it was applied by Joseon monsters?

145
00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:19.682
don't laugh

146
00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:23.436
I will take revenge

147
00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:26.356
Just do what you're told

148
00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:27.690
To Yuki

149
00:10:27.774 --> 00:10:30.068
Don't give orders!

150
00:10:30.318 --> 00:10:31.402
Akira

151
00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:35.698
They beat up our mercenary group.
Has your spirit become clearer? huh?

152
00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.118
Is it because I have an office job?

153
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:40.620
Put it away

154
00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.248
Are you here?

155
00:10:50.588 --> 00:10:51.923
Shinigami mercenary group

156
00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:54.258
I just returned from Manchuria.

157
00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:57.011
You worked hard on the front lines of the war.

158
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.473
Who is your leader?

159
00:11:01.057 --> 00:11:02.100
Didn't you see it?

160
00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:04.185
I entered Gyeongseong first.

161
00:11:04.477 --> 00:11:06.687
The captain was originally
You show up when you want to show up.

162
00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:09.065
Tell me your mission quickly.

163
00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.234
My body itches, I feel like I'm going crazy

164
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.528
conducting an experiment

165
00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:15.029
Experiment?

166
00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:18.741
Joseon's monsters of our empire
Converting it into a weapon of war

167
00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:20.952
Oh my, this sounds so fun.

168
00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:22.453
Your mission is

169
00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:24.288
Capturing Joseon Yokai alive.

170
00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:25.581
kill

171
00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:28.876
Can I bring just a body part?

172
00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:31.254
capture

173
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.215
Bring me alive

174
00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:36.008
The calculation is

175
00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.760
How?

176
00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:40.680
I'll do it according to the number of people

177
00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:43.224
'Hi'

178
00:11:51.732 --> 00:11:53.401
Was it a good thing I called them?

179
00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:54.652
So selfish

180
00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:56.028
Experiments are not everything

181
00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:00.074
The seeds must be dried.

182
00:12:01.117 --> 00:12:03.161
Root out the Joseon monsters

183
00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:05.538
The folk beliefs of this land

184
00:12:07.206 --> 00:12:09.834
The spirit of Joseon must be uprooted.

185
00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:14.380
I found out about this person named Lee Yeon.

186
00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:15.840
Yeah?

187
00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:17.008
It's at Myoyeonggak.

188
00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:19.343
Just like the president of Myoyeonggak

189
00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:20.803
It is the mountain god of Joseon.

190
00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:26.017
The mountain god of Joseon...

191
00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:41.365
You waited a long time, right?

192
00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:21.572
grandfather

193
00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:23.741
Are you coming?

194
00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:30.581
How did you find me?

195
00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:32.250
I went home and it wasn't there

196
00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:36.462
Your brother Hoyoung

197
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:38.214
It's buried here, right?

198
00:13:38.297 --> 00:13:39.423
Yes, I did.

199
00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:42.927
I'm here now, my brother.

200
00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:48.558
Muyoungah

201
00:13:49.517 --> 00:13:51.227
What on earth are you trying to do?

202
00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:54.981
I'm boiling my brother's bones and dirt.

203
00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:57.066
Catch weasels, snakes, and spiders

204
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.693
You can't believe it

205
00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:00.570
Half-marriage drinking...

206
00:14:00.653 --> 00:14:01.946
No way

207
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.740
the realm of life and death
You must not break it down carelessly.

208
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.284
I know

209
00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:09.036
I will never be forgiven

210
00:14:10.162 --> 00:14:11.163
Still, I have to do it.

211
00:14:11.247 --> 00:14:13.291
Don't turn grandma into an enemy.

212
00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:15.251
Grandma and I

213
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.003
you didn't give up

214
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:20.590
This is why I didn't want to meet you

215
00:14:23.134 --> 00:14:25.052
Even after I turn into a stone, I come to you
You talked to me

216
00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:27.555
Why is it snowing?

217
00:14:27.638 --> 00:14:30.308
can't even move
He gave me clothes and gave me clothes.

218
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:37.773
you from long ago

219
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.775
You've been very cold, right?

220
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.070
I no longer know what my grandfather knew
It's not Chun Moo-young, no.

221
00:14:44.363 --> 00:14:45.531
It shouldn't be

222
00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:51.162
Muyoung, don’t I know you?

223
00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:55.166
I just want to keep playing the villain.

224
00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:58.753
Don't come to me again

225
00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:07.178
This

226
00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:08.971
I bought it for you

227
00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:15.269
Don't be hungry

228
00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:53.224
When are you going?

229
00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:55.184
There's less than a week left

230
00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.563
Do you have to go?

231
00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:01.357
I have to go

232
00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:03.317
There's someone waiting

233
00:16:03.984 --> 00:16:05.736
Chi, you bastard.

234
00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:08.906
You said you were born again? that human woman

235
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:11.492
You heard it from Muyoung?

236
00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:16.330
Why didn't you tell me?

237
00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:17.832
Muyoung’s identity

238
00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:19.583
Did you know?

239
00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:23.629
I guess I wanted to dream

240
00:16:25.548 --> 00:16:26.674
'Maybe we'

241
00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:29.009
'Wouldn't it be possible to go back to that time?'

242
00:16:31.846 --> 00:16:33.848
Such a foolish dream that only I dream

243
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.433
I don't know if you believe it or not

244
00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:38.644
I'm with you Muyoung
I've never thrown it away

245
00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:42.732
That's why I can't forgive you any more, Cheon Moo-young

246
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.943
I'll see the end with my own hands

247
00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:49.447
Same as Muyoung

248
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.907
You risk your lives to save me

249
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:55.244
They're taking you away from me again.

250
00:16:55.327 --> 00:16:56.704
I'm sorry, Hongjoo.

251
00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.498
Never once did you get the answer you wanted
Because I can’t do it

252
00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:01.667
But

253
00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.252
I have something to protect

254
00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:05.963
Here too

255
00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:07.465
Even in the future I came from

256
00:17:08.883 --> 00:17:09.884
ok

257
00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:12.845
If you guys come out like that

258
00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:18.392
This is the end of the tragic heroine

259
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.645
I don't care about any means or methods.

260
00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:23.856
I will protect Myoyeonggak with my babies.

261
00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:27.485
one is missing

262
00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:29.779
you

263
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:32.448
Be sure to protect Ryu Hong-joo too.

264
00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:35.993
I want to hug you

265
00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:42.208
There is no fair play anymore

266
00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:03.145
No, now, wait a minute.

267
00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:04.355
Wait a minute

268
00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:07.274
No, this isn't some kind of barbershop.

269
00:18:07.358 --> 00:18:09.276
What do we do if we mow by ourselves?

270
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.861
The group that needs to take off their clothes must come out, take off their clothes...

271
00:18:10.945 --> 00:18:12.363
Hey, hey, hey!

272
00:18:12.822 --> 00:18:14.865
you are fasting now

273
00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:16.325
- This is the problem...
- Hey!

274
00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:19.578
Ha, oh my

275
00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:22.206
Now you can finally see me

276
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.752
Did you come and watch Daejung Teoju shave his head?

277
00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:31.215
well

278
00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:33.384
If I break up with my hair

279
00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:35.928
That's a bit
I think it's going to be difficult

280
00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:37.346
Cut it out

281
00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:39.265
Nice head

282
00:18:39.515 --> 00:18:41.684
- Should I shave it?
- Oh my, wait a minute.

283
00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:45.354
This is really
I can't say it in words

284
00:18:45.437 --> 00:18:46.689
Wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait

285
00:18:46.772 --> 00:18:48.566
for a moment! Let's say it in words, in words

286
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:50.150
in words

287
00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:51.777
You'll die like this

288
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:53.362
Ouch!

289
00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:56.115
Whose side are you on?

290
00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.536
The indigenous gods do not know anything
It's disappearing.

291
00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:03.581
Just us right now
There is no place to live

292
00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:04.707
So?

293
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.833
what?

294
00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:07.209
You want to buy me a house?

295
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:10.170
honey

296
00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:12.339
It's a matter of survival.

297
00:19:12.423 --> 00:19:14.592
What governs human life and death
it's our job

298
00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:15.801
These are not something to be left behind!

299
00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:17.845
Hey

300
00:19:18.053 --> 00:19:19.513
I knew it would be like this!

301
00:19:19.597 --> 00:19:21.932
If this problem is not solved

302
00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:24.560
All the bad guys in the local area

303
00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:26.228
I decided to fight for Seoul

304
00:19:26.312 --> 00:19:28.022
We have reached an agreement!

305
00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:29.398
Destroy him first!

306
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:31.400
- That's not it again, really.
- Oh my, what should I do?

307
00:19:31.483 --> 00:19:32.776
Ah, honey

308
00:19:33.193 --> 00:19:35.738
Instead of that, let’s do something, okay?

309
00:19:38.073 --> 00:19:39.283
huh?

310
00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:42.578
you

311
00:19:43.037 --> 00:19:45.039
Take them all away

312
00:19:47.124 --> 00:19:48.584
Do whatever I tell you.

313
00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:53.213
It's a monster

314
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.758
There is a disguised monster

315
00:19:57.468 --> 00:19:58.469
What about the body?

316
00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:00.262
One is an eagle owl

317
00:20:01.138 --> 00:20:02.222
One is a nine-tailed fox

318
00:20:02.306 --> 00:20:03.599
What should I do, what should I do

319
00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:05.643
so cute

320
00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:07.269
that man

321
00:20:07.353 --> 00:20:09.897
Is there such a handsome monster in Joseon?

322
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.274
Don't touch him, I'll take care of him.

323
00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:13.567
Yuki

324
00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.694
Ah, what!

325
00:20:15.986 --> 00:20:17.237
you can't

326
00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:22.034
Now

327
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.455
Wow

328
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:29.124
I wonder if someone is like this

329
00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:30.834
Oh, I'm not a girl

330
00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:33.212
What are you putting on your face like that, Mr. Lee?

331
00:20:33.754 --> 00:20:35.297
The guy who puts oil on the blanket

332
00:20:35.381 --> 00:20:37.216
- Do you want to play another round later?
- Mr. Lee

333
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:38.717
two minutes

334
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:40.386
Let's talk for a moment

335
00:20:42.054 --> 00:20:44.348
Although we merged due to unavoidable circumstances,

336
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:46.475
Co-living comes with responsibilities

337
00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.186
Because I heard two people fighting
I can't sleep

338
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.521
Just last night...

339
00:20:50.604 --> 00:20:53.482
No, the thief's wolf cub
I messed with my syllabus.

340
00:20:53.565 --> 00:20:56.652
It would be better to share the outline
Why are you talking so big?

341
00:20:57.277 --> 00:20:59.029
No, at least not in someone else's outline.

342
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.906
You shouldn't poop

343
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.408
It could be rice!

344
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:04.201
Let me tell you the rules of this room.

345
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.411
first

346
00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:06.870
Don't fight after 9pm

347
00:21:06.954 --> 00:21:08.038
second

348
00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:09.498
Live a regular life

349
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:11.375
Wake up time is 6 am

350
00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:12.501
What, military?

351
00:21:12.584 --> 00:21:13.669
third

352
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:16.005
Cleaning takes place once a day in shifts.

353
00:21:16.088 --> 00:21:17.423
Be sure to dry the blanket in the sun.

354
00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:21.010
Ah, that nagging
There are quite a lot of them.

355
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.720
Write, maybe, that

356
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.431
What about the main body before it was transformed?

357
00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:26.974
This is a Jindo dog.

358
00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:30.310
Natural Monument No. 53

359
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.025
hand

360
00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:41.739
don't do it

361
00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:45.159
Well, we too
It's an endangered species.

362
00:21:45.617 --> 00:21:46.827
bread

363
00:21:48.287 --> 00:21:49.997
Usually dogs get over this, right?

364
00:21:51.165 --> 00:21:52.249
bread!

365
00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:54.877
two minutes

366
00:21:55.753 --> 00:21:56.920
Do you want to become extinct?

367
00:21:57.504 --> 00:21:58.672
Water, huh?

368
00:21:58.756 --> 00:21:59.757
water!

369
00:22:01.258 --> 00:22:02.259
eat a lot, eat a lot

370
00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:06.430
Wow, really, Mr.

371
00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:08.057
Oh my

372
00:22:08.348 --> 00:22:11.268
No, let us hear that complaint.
You want me to solve everything? Why?

373
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:13.520
What should I do?
If you don't like it, you can't go home

374
00:22:13.604 --> 00:22:14.688
They say you are hell

375
00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:16.148
Ah, this old lady is real!

376
00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:17.983
That's okay for him, but why for me?

377
00:22:18.067 --> 00:22:19.943
You killed a salt seller last time.
They commuted your sentence

378
00:22:20.027 --> 00:22:22.071
- They put me in prison for that.
- I thought so.

379
00:22:22.154 --> 00:22:23.864
At that time, I took a bribe and gave it to him, a cow.

380
00:22:23.947 --> 00:22:25.199
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

381
00:22:25.449 --> 00:22:27.493
Anyway, blame me, I'm going, uh.

382
00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:28.577
Ah, old man

383
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.079
- What if I just go like this, really?
-Grandfather

384
00:22:30.162 --> 00:22:31.663
Ugh, tsk.

385
00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:33.415
Hey, I don't know, you solve it all.
It's your house

386
00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:35.417
Let's do it together

387
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:37.294
IC

388
00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:39.379
Just eat it! really

389
00:22:54.812 --> 00:22:56.230
hey!

390
00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:00.526
Everyone pay attention

391
00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:03.570
We made kimchi today
Are you mentally and physically strained?

392
00:23:03.654 --> 00:23:06.698
Because I want to avoid violence whenever possible.
let's go in an orderly manner

393
00:23:06.782 --> 00:23:07.991
They come in one by one

394
00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:11.120
The story should be short and bold, less than 20 characters.

395
00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:12.621
Who lives where?

396
00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:14.331
I am the owner of the well at the intersection.

397
00:23:14.706 --> 00:23:16.667
Well God, what are you doing here?

398
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.461
Originally my well
They say it's a strong medicinal water.

399
00:23:19.753 --> 00:23:21.964
They came from Incheon to fetch water, too.

400
00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:23.632
The taste of water has changed.

401
00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:26.260
Are we the water purifier lady? uh?
Can you change the filter?

402
00:23:26.718 --> 00:23:27.719
What is a water purifier?

403
00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.139
What you want
Cleaning the well, Isaiah?

404
00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:31.932
Alas, I can no longer use that well.

405
00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:33.725
Some guy took some medicine

406
00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.394
Well, I need to find a new home

407
00:23:36.687 --> 00:23:38.939
Give me an ownerless mineral spring.
Sit down

408
00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:40.440
next

409
00:23:40.983 --> 00:23:42.151
I'm Cheol-yung.

410
00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:43.777
The crock pot was stolen.

411
00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:45.529
I don't know who the culprit is

412
00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:47.531
I heard you dressed up like a Japanese soldier?

413
00:23:48.073 --> 00:23:50.701
Because Cheolyungsin empties the crock pot.
It's not being stolen.

414
00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:52.119
That's right

415
00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:54.163
Why are you running around like that, huh?

416
00:23:54.246 --> 00:23:55.247
Because I gained weight

417
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.082
The crock pot was too tight.

418
00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:58.709
- Buy me one.
- Yes!

419
00:23:59.042 --> 00:24:00.544
Hey, if possible

420
00:24:00.627 --> 00:24:02.921
It's a luxury pottery made in Yeoju...

421
00:24:03.005 --> 00:24:04.798
It's a thorn

422
00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:07.134
Who are you?

423
00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:11.722
Ah

424
00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:13.140
Oh no

425
00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:15.559
- Yes?
- why? What is it?

426
00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:16.935
He is the god of sacrifice.

427
00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:19.479
Because the owner of the house did not hold a ancestral rite
They say you were starving.

428
00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:22.566
That's like that
Is this something you want to talk about quietly?

429
00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:24.818
They say you’re a bit shy to begin with.

430
00:24:24.902 --> 00:24:26.403
So what do you want?

431
00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:28.322
You want to destroy the house.

432
00:24:28.405 --> 00:24:30.449
This is the problem with these guardian gods

433
00:24:30.782 --> 00:24:33.285
You guys aren't the landlord, huh?

434
00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:36.079
We share our lives with our descendants.
‘Share House’

435
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:39.333
I send it off after feeding it as a ceremonial meal.

436
00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:40.792
next

437
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:42.920
You are the great general of the world.

438
00:24:43.003 --> 00:24:45.756
Originally, it was under Bukhansan Mountain.
They are a Jangseung couple.

439
00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:47.674
My wife, General Ji Ha, has gone missing.

440
00:24:47.758 --> 00:24:49.509
- Oh my.
- Isn’t it boredom?

441
00:24:49.593 --> 00:24:50.594
next

442
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.890
I went there

443
00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:56.475
fortress
Where are you going out like that?

444
00:24:57.935 --> 00:25:00.270
I guess you forgot about my dad, but I'm a reporter.

445
00:25:01.688 --> 00:25:03.232
a reporter for my newspaper

446
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:06.109
the boss says

447
00:25:06.652 --> 00:25:07.653
sit

448
00:25:14.618 --> 00:25:15.619
I don't want to eat anything

449
00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.789
You lost weight
I'm so worried about your dad.

450
00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:20.916
Daughter of the richest family in Gyeongseong

451
00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:22.501
If you face each other like a barley hill

452
00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:25.003
people me
How much will you laugh at me?

453
00:25:25.963 --> 00:25:27.047
That's because I'm busy, Ginko.

454
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.174
Brother-in-law
What do you know about me?

455
00:25:29.258 --> 00:25:31.593
Damn, you son of a bitch
Don't be rude

456
00:25:32.135 --> 00:25:34.429
My son-in-law brought a gift for you.

457
00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:36.473
What gift?

458
00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:44.606
I have to watch it alone

459
00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:55.867
It was stolen anyway

460
00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:57.536
Let's use it for military funds.

461
00:25:58.245 --> 00:25:59.955
Why is this in the hands of the police chief?

462
00:26:01.123 --> 00:26:03.125
I definitely passed it on to our organization members.

463
00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:05.794
What do you think? Do you like it?

464
00:26:07.462 --> 00:26:08.755
What kind of gift is this?

465
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:13.927
Why are you giving this to me?

466
00:26:14.803 --> 00:26:15.804
We're family, we

467
00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:17.389
I

468
00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:20.434
I'm always watching Ginko

469
00:26:23.812 --> 00:26:25.272
What can you do with something like this?

470
00:26:26.189 --> 00:26:28.608
My brother-in-law
You need my family background.

471
00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:31.194

Others may not know, but you can’t do this.

490
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:49.106
How can I let you go with that limb?

491
00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:51.691
I had a vague guess

492

Are you in a bad mood?

Please don't follow me.

517
00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:13.250

00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:24.261
Are you mad at me?

522
00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:27.597
Or have somewhere to vent your anger
Do you need it?

523
00:30:28.098 --> 00:30:29.641
It's because of you, I'm mad

524
00:30:30.642 --> 00:30:32.269
What did I do wrong?

525
00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:36.273
Abandoned by parents

526
00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:40.068
Abandoned by my brother
I wandered alone for hundreds of years

527
00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:43.738
I

528
00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:48.326
I thought they were just stains

529
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.745
Did you just kill someone out of frustration?

530
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:53.373
They become bandits and loot and set fire.

531
00:30:54.124 --> 00:30:55.542
That was everyday life

532
00:30:58.461 --> 00:30:59.546
But

533
00:31:00.547 --> 00:31:02.132
But, what?

534
00:31:03.925 --> 00:31:05.260
you

535
00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:07.345
You guys

536
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:11.099
You keep making me weak, I feel bad

537
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.773
This place keeps tickling

538
00:31:22.652 --> 00:31:24.779
The world is worth living in the way it is.

539
00:31:27.324 --> 00:31:28.783
Even for a guy like me

540
00:31:29.743 --> 00:31:31.036
It was warm

541
00:31:34.539 --> 00:31:36.791
I don't want to feel like shit like that

542
00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:40.420
So

543
00:31:42.172 --> 00:31:43.298
What is the conclusion?

544
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:45.050
I

545
00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:48.094
I don't need anyone anymore

546
00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:51.514
You too

547
00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:54.017
Lee Yeon-yeon

548
00:31:55.393 --> 00:31:56.895
All the magic bandits

549
00:32:01.816 --> 00:32:02.859
coward

550
00:32:10.784 --> 00:32:11.785
What?

551
00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:13.578
Basically, it's easiest to just say something

552
00:32:14.245 --> 00:32:16.289
I broke up alone and deleted it alone.

553
00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:18.667
in the world
Don’t use the most comfortable shield.

554
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.919
It's better to fight back
Like the leader of a bandit group

555
00:32:22.212 --> 00:32:24.214
What do you think you know?
What did you say!

556
00:32:24.297 --> 00:32:25.507
Not like me

557
00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:27.133
Don't do it carelessly

558
00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:31.054
We kissed

559
00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:37.394
Because I'm going to marry you

560
00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:46.986
So

561
00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:49.698
I can't go anywhere anymore

562
00:33:09.426 --> 00:33:11.511
Everyone, today’s complaint is
I'll take it here

563
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.138
Those who couldn't make it today, please come tomorrow.

564
00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:16.933
But isn’t it a bit strange?

565
00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:18.768
what?

566
00:33:18.852 --> 00:33:21.688
Who decided
It seems like they're targeting the guardian gods.

567
00:33:22.439 --> 00:33:24.649
There are many gods who suddenly disappeared

568
00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:30.321
I ordered re-yu
I was looking into something

569
00:33:32.323 --> 00:33:33.533
You know that raccoon couple?

570
00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:35.118
AC, I know.

571
00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:37.537
I was kidnapped in a back alley in Gyeongseong not long ago.

572
00:33:40.248 --> 00:33:42.542
Kidnapping? To whom?

573
00:33:43.793 --> 00:33:44.878
It's the Government General's doing.

574
00:33:45.628 --> 00:33:47.380
Police Affairs Director Ryuhei Kato

575
00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:49.924
What kind of experiment is he doing?

576
00:33:51.384 --> 00:33:53.428
Gato...

577
00:33:53.928 --> 00:33:56.014
Wow, where did I hear that before?

578
00:33:57.932 --> 00:33:59.392
My name is Ryuhei Kato

579
00:33:59.726 --> 00:34:00.727
Remember that

580
00:34:01.227 --> 00:34:02.353
Because we will see each other again

581
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:04.564
Ah!

582
00:34:05.231 --> 00:34:06.232
It's him.

583
00:34:09.444 --> 00:34:11.529
Should I just throw it over? Japanese Government-General of Korea

584
00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:13.865
What if I kill them?

585
00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:15.283
What next?

586
00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:17.535
new governor

587
00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:19.496
A new police chief will come.

588
00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.247
What if we fight again?

589
00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:25.543
who?

590
00:34:26.002 --> 00:34:27.420
You have less than a week left to go?

591
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.089
don't forget

592
00:34:30.882 --> 00:34:32.884
you are not invited to this era
I'm just a guest

593
00:34:42.936 --> 00:34:44.229
Can I just pick this up and wear it?

594
00:34:45.063 --> 00:34:46.564
From my salary, whatever.

595
00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:49.234
But

596
00:34:49.943 --> 00:34:51.361
Was your tone always this harsh?

597
00:34:52.946 --> 00:34:53.947
Don't stop me

598
00:34:54.197 --> 00:34:56.282
I'm soon Mrs. Magic Bandit

599
00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:02.914
don't marry me

600
00:35:04.749 --> 00:35:05.875
Why?

601
00:35:06.459 --> 00:35:07.627
When I die, I'll be alone

602
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.087
you won't die

603
00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:11.005
I'm going to fight the grim reaper

604
00:35:11.798 --> 00:35:13.424
It's reassuring.

605
00:35:18.054 --> 00:35:19.472
"Obok Goods Store"

606
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:24.435
When we get married
Honeymoon: mountains and sea

607
00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:25.770
Which do you like?

608
00:35:26.563 --> 00:35:27.564
Do you both just want to go?

609
00:35:31.818 --> 00:35:32.819
Then

610
00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:34.028
Let’s go to Geumgangsan Mountain first.

611
00:35:34.863 --> 00:35:36.865
Without seeing Mt. Geumgang

612
00:35:36.948 --> 00:35:38.783
They told me not to discuss the scenery.

613
00:35:40.076 --> 00:35:41.578
Then let's go to the East Sea

614
00:35:42.453 --> 00:35:43.496
You are

615
00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:46.332
Dying before living for less than 100 years

616
00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:48.376
2020

617
00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:50.920
Becoming a sacrifice to replace your brother

618
00:36:47.268 --> 00:36:48.770
You smelled blood.

619
00:36:50.021 --> 00:36:51.064
Don't fuss

620
00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:52.482
If I just finish this

621
00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:55.485
I'll get you some food

622
00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:28.810
Hey!

623
00:37:28.893 --> 00:37:30.186
I, I, I

624
00:37:32.105 --> 00:37:33.106
Ah
Wait, wait, wait, come out

625
00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:34.273
Me na na na na

626
00:37:34.357 --> 00:37:35.358
Come out!

627
00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:36.693
Come out, Lee!

628
00:37:50.873 --> 00:37:52.041
what?

629
00:37:52.417 --> 00:37:53.584
IC

630
00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:56.713
Ah, okay

631
00:38:02.719 --> 00:38:03.845
Hey

632
00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:06.556
Hey!

633
00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:11.477
Come out, come out, come out

634
00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:12.729
Come out, come out, come out, come out

635
00:38:12.812 --> 00:38:14.313
Damn, you bastard

636
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:16.482
Oh no

637
00:38:16.983 --> 00:38:17.984
Ah, okay

638
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.031
Ah

639
00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:42.008
Oh my shoulder

640
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.138
Is it because of kimchi?

641
00:38:56.314 --> 00:38:57.440
Jae-yu too?

642
00:38:57.523 --> 00:38:59.609
I guess I ate it for dinner
I think the clams were spoiled.

643
00:39:21.089 --> 00:39:23.132
Oh, will this make the bad smell go away?

644
00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:26.928
Ouch, ooh, ooh!

645
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.763
Ouch! Ouch!

646
00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:31.599
- Okay, this one shot is all.
- Let's see.

647
00:39:31.682 --> 00:39:33.142
Let's go

648
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:35.061
- If I do well this time,
- Uh

649
00:39:35.144 --> 00:39:36.187
That's right

650
00:39:40.108 --> 00:39:41.734
- Come in, come in
- Oh my.

651
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.656
sweep

652
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:52.078
It's here!

653
00:39:56.582 --> 00:39:57.583
Want to give it a try?

654
00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.836
I'm done

655
00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:04.799
How much is the stake?

656
00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:07.051
It's not money

657
00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:10.721
Kim Seo-bang, the single-horned devil, is engaged in
It's a gambling table.

658
00:40:12.181 --> 00:40:13.307
the author

659
00:40:14.058 --> 00:40:15.476
A solitary horned ear?

660
00:40:16.435 --> 00:40:17.436
If not money, what is it?

661
00:40:20.064 --> 00:40:21.107
lifespan

662
00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:30.366
- It's here!
- wow!

663
00:40:33.661 --> 00:40:37.456
Single-horned ear, single-horned ear, single-horned ear!

664
00:40:40.543 --> 00:40:43.171
Brother Jaeyu
I heard you fell into a relationship?

665
00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:48.092
You were always so tidy.

666
00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:49.719
You sit down and make some shit rice cake

667
00:40:52.847 --> 00:40:54.515
But what is ttongtteok?

668
00:40:55.433 --> 00:40:56.642
It's a kind of amulet rice cake.

669
00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:59.270
If you fall into a relationship and start to suffer,

670
00:40:59.353 --> 00:41:01.230
They say even a shaman’s exorcism won’t cure you.

671
00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:04.025
This, this
Try this, try this

672
00:41:04.108 --> 00:41:05.735
I want to eat as much as my age

673
00:41:05.818 --> 00:41:07.945
Ah, ah, ah

674
00:41:08.279 --> 00:41:09.822
child, smell

675
00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:12.491
Instead of being a Jindo dog, it has become a mutt dog.

676
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.625
To the boss

677
00:41:21.626 --> 00:41:23.169
Please don't ever tell me

678
00:41:23.753 --> 00:41:24.754
please

679
00:41:27.924 --> 00:41:29.342
Hold on to your worries

680
00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:31.260
Even though I’m like this

681
00:41:31.344 --> 00:41:33.804
He's famous for being loud-mouthed, huh?

682
00:41:35.014 --> 00:41:36.182
You fell into a conflict?

683
00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:37.475
How?

684
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.604
Well, what I mean is, who is below?
They said my foot was pulled hard.

685
00:41:41.896 --> 00:41:43.272
I'm saying this because I'm embarrassed.

686
00:41:43.356 --> 00:41:47.568
The point is, it smells so bad.
Please give me a new room, yes

687
00:41:47.652 --> 00:41:48.694
you

688
00:41:49.737 --> 00:41:50.738
Shut up and take the lead

689
00:42:01.874 --> 00:42:03.000
Close it

690
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:04.377
Close everything, everything.

691
00:42:13.803 --> 00:42:15.263
- Oh, what a surprise, Mr.
-Open

692
00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:16.430
Yes?

693
00:42:16.514 --> 00:42:18.057
Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared, open it

694
00:42:18.391 --> 00:42:19.642
open

695
00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:24.355
Don't come in!

696
00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:25.773
Come in? I'm not going in, Mr. Lee.

697
00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:29.568
Oh, really

698
00:42:29.902 --> 00:42:31.028
What is it?

699
00:42:34.824 --> 00:42:36.409
what's this?

700
00:42:36.659 --> 00:42:38.119
Hmm, ugh!

701
00:42:38.202 --> 00:42:40.162
What is it? It's filth between sides.

702
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.791
If that's true, I deny it.

703
00:42:52.466 --> 00:42:54.051
With this temperament

704
00:42:55.803 --> 00:42:57.013
Oh my, oh my!

705
00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:58.514
you

706
00:42:58.848 --> 00:43:00.016
Are you a side person?

707
00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.559
A side messenger?

708
00:43:01.767 --> 00:43:03.769
In that past life
By acting viciously

709
00:43:03.853 --> 00:43:05.271
They say a dead concubine becomes a confidant.

710
00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:06.605
Indeed

711
00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:10.276
No, what are you doing?

712
00:43:10.359 --> 00:43:11.444
Leave it alone

713
00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:14.572
If you look at the hair, you have to count it all the way through.
The thing that makes you lose your senses is your side.

714
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.324
IC

715
00:43:16.615 --> 00:43:18.909
I forgot because of you, girl.
Really, Mr.

716
00:43:20.202 --> 00:43:21.871
Girl?

717
00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:25.207
- Let's go
- I'm going

718
00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:27.918
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see

719
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:37.011
Hey, I can't see you.
Wow, I really

720
00:43:44.852 --> 00:43:46.771
- Hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here
- came

721
00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:48.314
What should I do?

722
00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:49.482
Now

723
00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:51.525
50 years

724
00:43:54.987 --> 00:43:55.988
take it

725
00:43:56.072 --> 00:43:58.074
- I'm afraid
- Let’s eat first.

726
00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:02.203
3 dings

727
00:44:03.954 --> 00:44:05.331
5 dings, 5 dings!

728
00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:06.665
won

729
00:44:06.749 --> 00:44:08.209
The one-horned devil won!

730
00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:10.628
As expected, you are a single horned demon.

731
00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:12.713
Give me 50 years!

732
00:44:23.015 --> 00:44:24.600
- Play one more round.
- Wait.

733
00:44:25.893 --> 00:44:27.478
Baby, it's heavy, let's sleep

734
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:29.146
Hey, eat some

735
00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:33.484
Buckwheat jelly, my love buckwheat jelly

736
00:44:37.363 --> 00:44:38.781
Wow

737
00:44:38.864 --> 00:44:40.658
Just one bite too, ah

738
00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:42.993
Leave it alone

739
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:46.789
- It's a lump, it's a lump
- It’s a lump.

740
00:44:47.081 --> 00:44:48.416
I got a lump

741
00:44:54.755 --> 00:44:55.965
- There is a lump
- Do the next game

742
00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:58.634
yes, good

743
00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:05.558
Going

744
00:45:19.905 --> 00:45:21.240
What are you doing in my house?

745
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:22.616
When I came and saw it

746
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.743
Since there was no housewife at the moment,

747
00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:27.246
between us
Were you planning on sticking around?

748
00:45:28.372 --> 00:45:29.498
Why did you throw Jae-yu away?

749
00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:33.669
Last night he
Why don't you bring me flowers?

750
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:36.755
It's been so long
I received flowers from the man.

751
00:45:37.214 --> 00:45:39.467
Because I always want to be together forever

752
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.344
I support this love

753
00:45:42.428 --> 00:45:43.846
Wow, that's really useless.

754
00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:45.097
- Go quickly!
- Yes

755
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:49.310
You go too!

756
00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:50.519
Uh, uh...

757
00:45:50.978 --> 00:45:52.730
here
Can’t you please let me dwell there?

758
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:54.982
Don't sell drugs

759
00:45:55.316 --> 00:45:56.442
I don't raise a guardian spirit

760
00:45:56.525 --> 00:45:58.152
blessed, angry

761
00:45:58.402 --> 00:45:59.737
Don't I know your quirks?

762
00:45:59.945 --> 00:46:00.946
Go quickly

763
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.448
Oh, wait a minute.

764
00:46:03.657 --> 00:46:04.742
If you take it away

765
00:46:05.117 --> 00:46:06.911
Let me tell you about the treasure.

766
00:46:09.413 --> 00:46:10.414
Treasure?

767
00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:14.627
Living in a rich gold mining house
I heard it from the house gods.

768
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.754
Baekdudaegan Mountain God

769
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.840
He has a guardian stone and a golden chuck.

770
00:46:25.095 --> 00:46:26.222
What?

771
00:46:27.723 --> 00:46:29.016
Boss brother

772
00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:30.601
I'm in big trouble, I'm in big trouble, yeah?

773
00:46:30.684 --> 00:46:31.894
Oh, why, what is it again?

774
00:46:31.977 --> 00:46:34.021
The boss took a gamble.

775
00:46:34.104 --> 00:46:36.440
Mr. Lee, really, he said it was a disease, tsk.

776
00:46:36.524 --> 00:46:38.400
- How much did you lose?
- It's not money, it's not money.

777
00:46:38.484 --> 00:46:39.485
- Huh?
- It's not money.

778
00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:41.111
here, here, here, here

779
00:46:44.031 --> 00:46:45.074
Hey

780
00:46:46.408 --> 00:46:47.409
Why are you like this?

781
00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:50.788
They say it's the rest of my life

782
00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:53.207
There's less than a day left

783
00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:02.258
Who did it?

784
00:47:02.591 --> 00:47:04.260
- It's Jangttaeng.
- Right.

785
00:47:06.804 --> 00:47:08.681
Hey, you stupid bastard!

786
00:47:08.764 --> 00:47:09.890
Shut up

787
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:11.350
give me back my brother

788
00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:12.768
Little brother?

789
00:47:13.644 --> 00:47:15.145
That nine-tailed fox from earlier?

790
00:47:16.438 --> 00:47:19.108
Ah

791
00:47:19.692 --> 00:47:21.235
A single horned ear picked it up

792
00:47:22.778 --> 00:47:23.904
Give it to me

793
00:47:25.197 --> 00:47:26.699
Not much life left

794
00:47:27.283 --> 00:47:28.325
What are you taking?

795
00:47:28.993 --> 00:47:31.036
a bet is a bet

796
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.454
kill it

797
00:47:32.871 --> 00:47:34.039
Then kill me somewhere

798
00:47:34.415 --> 00:47:36.542
Does that mean your younger brother Myeongjul will come back?

799
00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:39.545
Oh, as expected, majestic

800
00:47:39.628 --> 00:47:41.755
Solitary Horned Ghost is not afraid

801
00:47:43.757 --> 00:47:45.134
Now

802
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:47.428
Try it, where

803
00:47:47.511 --> 00:47:49.972
- Poke me.
- Poke it.

804
00:47:53.601 --> 00:47:54.602
What do you want?

805
00:47:55.019 --> 00:47:56.228
I'll give you everything

806
00:47:56.312 --> 00:47:58.063
Give him his life back

807
00:47:58.147 --> 00:47:59.481
Yeah?

808
00:48:00.232 --> 00:48:02.943
Then go gamble with the poisonous horned devil.

809
00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:05.195
Because you won
Just go with it, okay?

810
00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:10.034
I

811
00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:13.162
- I don't gamble.
- Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

812
00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:15.748
Now, let's lay the board again.

813
00:48:15.831 --> 00:48:18.334
- Okay.
- Lay the board, lay the board

814
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.297
Now, quickly, quickly, quickly, yes

815
00:48:25.758 --> 00:48:27.259
What should I do, yeah?

816
00:48:27.468 --> 00:48:29.803
- Oh, what should we do, Mr.
- It's noisy.

817
00:48:31.055 --> 00:48:32.097
Without me

818
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:34.141
You lead the magic bandits.

819
00:48:35.434 --> 00:48:37.561
Boss, don't die.

820
00:48:38.103 --> 00:48:40.397
We decided to conquer the land of Gyeongseong together.

821
00:48:40.731 --> 00:48:42.316
Don't whine

822
00:48:43.484 --> 00:48:44.652
Just run one errand

823
00:49:06.924 --> 00:49:08.634
Why did you do that? uh?

824
00:49:09.343 --> 00:49:11.470
Why make a bet like that?
Risk your life carelessly!

825
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.640
It's my life

826
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.309
I said I would do whatever I wanted, but what?

827
00:49:19.144 --> 00:49:20.562
You foolish bastard

828
00:49:21.313 --> 00:49:23.607
You are responsible for what you did

829
00:49:25.693 --> 00:49:27.319
Now it's finally showing its true colors

830
00:49:29.405 --> 00:49:30.406
yes

831
00:49:31.073 --> 00:49:32.116
This was you

832
00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:34.284
On a fake day, I get sick and hurt

833
00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:37.287
I can't do it anymore
Are you even cutting off my lifeline?

834
00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:39.873
What on earth should I do after you?
How much more do I have to do?

835
00:49:39.957 --> 00:49:41.959
It's because of you

836
00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:43.293
What made me like this

837
00:49:44.461 --> 00:49:46.630
- It's you.
- Why on earth are you doing this?

838
00:49:47.005 --> 00:49:48.048
uh?

839
00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:49.633
please

840
00:49:50.259 --> 00:49:51.885
Can't you please live a proper life?

841
00:49:54.722 --> 00:49:56.181
How should I go, Mr.

842
00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:58.142
Oh, shit

843
00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:05.899
- Hey
- Ah, Mr.

844
00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:10.279
Are you crying? Are you because of me?

845
00:50:11.113 --> 00:50:12.197
I didn't cry!

846
00:50:12.656 --> 00:50:14.074
I did it because I didn't want to die.

847
00:50:15.492 --> 00:50:16.577
me too

848
00:50:17.786 --> 00:50:18.787
Because I want to live

849
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.003
you

850
00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:29.339
What do you mean?

851
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:31.759
What do you mean?

852
00:50:33.093 --> 00:50:34.386
Don’t you know better?

853
00:50:41.602 --> 00:50:44.646
Lee Yeon
They say they gamble with their lives

854
00:50:59.077 --> 00:51:00.954
- Let's get started
- before that

855
00:51:01.663 --> 00:51:03.332
You have to check what you have first.

856
00:51:07.628 --> 00:51:09.087
52 years?

857
00:51:09.338 --> 00:51:10.380
Egye

858
00:51:10.714 --> 00:51:12.966
What kind of lifespan is this?

859
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.010
I have so many

860
00:51:15.385 --> 00:51:17.471
I decided to die on the same day as the human woman.

861
00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:20.307
- Pathetic guy.
- Okay

862
00:51:20.724 --> 00:51:22.226
Give me fifty-two

863
00:51:24.269 --> 00:51:26.063
Hey, I’m embarrassed to even give this away.

864
00:51:26.146 --> 00:51:28.148
Wow, really, oops

865
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.619
Now, 10 years

866
00:51:42.204 --> 00:51:43.288
I don't get it

867
00:51:46.083 --> 00:51:47.376
I'm afraid

868
00:51:49.002 --> 00:51:50.254
Seven steps, seven steps

869
00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:53.674
- Gabo
- That's right.

870
00:51:53.757 --> 00:51:55.217
That's right

871
00:51:57.177 --> 00:52:00.514
Single-horned ear, single-horned ear, single-horned ear!

872
00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:01.765
just now

873
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:03.183
10 years flew by

874
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:22.911
Write, now

875
00:52:22.995 --> 00:52:25.330
12 years

876
00:52:31.545 --> 00:52:32.671
spread

877
00:52:34.673 --> 00:52:36.341
1 ding

878
00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:38.719
- 2 dings
- That's right.

879
00:52:38.802 --> 00:52:40.596
That's right

880
00:52:41.555 --> 00:52:44.808
Return home alone
Better at gambling than Sanshin

881
00:52:45.183 --> 00:52:47.644
how is it? Is your poop burning?

882
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:53.358
What are you laughing at?

883
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:56.194
Okay then

884
00:52:57.029 --> 00:52:58.238
Would you like to try mixing it up?

885
00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:08.999
Oh my

886
00:53:09.082 --> 00:53:11.793
This guy gambles
I guess you haven't tried it, huh?

887
00:53:11.877 --> 00:53:15.088
With that kind of skill
Have you jumped into a gambling game that risks your life?

888
00:53:15.172 --> 00:53:18.550
- That's right, this.
- I'll pay the invoice today, ayu.

889
00:53:18.634 --> 00:53:21.261
- Oh my, that's right.
- I’m so bad at it, oops.

890
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:23.513
this time

891
00:53:24.389 --> 00:53:27.684
It's been 20 years, what do you think?

892
00:53:27.768 --> 00:53:29.770
Were you scared?

893
00:53:30.187 --> 00:53:31.855
I don't get it

894
00:53:31.939 --> 00:53:33.190
If I lose this time too

895
00:53:33.982 --> 00:53:35.192
10 years left

896
00:53:36.443 --> 00:53:37.444
How

897
00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:44.159
Ouch, my hand, ooh, my hand!

898
00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:45.452
my hand

899
00:53:48.664 --> 00:53:50.749
my hand, my hand, my hand

900
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:52.793
3 lights?

901
00:53:53.752 --> 00:53:55.128
Wow, really

902
00:53:55.212 --> 00:53:56.213
He looks like he's going to die

903
00:53:56.296 --> 00:53:57.464
Give me back my hand!

904
00:53:57.798 --> 00:53:59.967
I cheated, that bastard

905
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.343
This was my first time

906
00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:03.220
Trust me, it's real

907
00:54:03.303 --> 00:54:04.680
Don't be funny

908
00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:06.807
Why, just take a look, okay?

909
00:54:07.307 --> 00:54:08.725
No, unless you have one hand.

910
00:54:08.934 --> 00:54:10.477
I can't gamble with a single horn.

911
00:54:13.188 --> 00:54:14.815
ok

912
00:54:15.732 --> 00:54:17.693
So the game so far is
Everything is invalid

913
00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:19.236
Yes, then, then, then

914
00:54:19.653 --> 00:54:21.405
From now on, you will officially compete with me.

915
00:54:21.822 --> 00:54:22.864
if i win

916
00:54:23.782 --> 00:54:24.908
As well as my younger brother

917
00:54:25.534 --> 00:54:28.245
It was stolen by the bastards here.
Give me my whole life back

918
00:54:29.037 --> 00:54:30.497
Then

919
00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.832
Well, that's it.

920
00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:36.503
Even though they are poor and powerless gods

921
00:54:36.712 --> 00:54:37.754
Definitely a guardian deity

922
00:54:38.463 --> 00:54:40.382
It's not a life that should be controlled by someone like you.

923
00:54:41.842 --> 00:54:42.926
Answer me!

924
00:54:48.015 --> 00:54:49.266
Err, I don’t know.

925
00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:50.976
Okay, come on!

926
00:54:56.064 --> 00:54:57.607
That's enough, that's enough now

927
00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:10.162
What is Yeon doing?

928
00:55:10.245 --> 00:55:11.997
You're gambling with a single horned devil.

929
00:55:14.416 --> 00:55:15.667
Are you crazy or what?

930
00:55:16.043 --> 00:55:18.754
Gambling with a single horned devil
I've never seen anyone win

931
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:24.009
I searched thoroughly, but
The guardian stone and gold chuck are not visible.

932
00:55:24.676 --> 00:55:26.386
Are you saying he's more cautious than he looks?

933
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:29.181
Shall we find more?

934
00:55:29.765 --> 00:55:30.766
no

935
00:55:32.142 --> 00:55:34.895
All you have to do is make Yeon give it himself.

936
00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:51.495
Now, I have this

937
00:55:51.578 --> 00:55:53.330
everything

938
00:55:53.705 --> 00:55:54.706
Are you crazy?

939
00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.500
It comes out strong from the start, right?

940
00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.168
Now it's all or nothing

941
00:55:58.502 --> 00:56:00.837
I'm scared when I'm angry

942
00:56:00.921 --> 00:56:03.006
- It's scary.
- Scary, scary, scary

943
00:56:05.342 --> 00:56:07.177
If you get this

944
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.262
Because I have so much more

945
00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.972
I'll pay you the same price

946
00:56:12.224 --> 00:56:14.643
One of the two will die here

947
00:56:16.019 --> 00:56:17.646
I can't see you because I'm running late

948
00:56:25.904 --> 00:56:27.197
i die

949
00:56:29.533 --> 00:56:30.784
Huh? Menton?

950
00:56:30.867 --> 00:56:32.160
Mangtong?

951
00:56:32.661 --> 00:56:34.204
Are you betting everything on a card like this?

952
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:35.872
I shouldn't have accepted it that way

953
00:56:35.956 --> 00:56:37.082
You won the game

954
00:56:40.794 --> 00:56:42.254
everything

955
00:56:42.629 --> 00:56:43.880
die

956
00:56:43.964 --> 00:56:45.757
- everything
- die

957
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.095
- everything
- die

958
00:56:50.178 --> 00:56:51.263
everything

959
00:56:55.392 --> 00:56:56.601
die

960
00:56:56.685 --> 00:56:58.186
Sanshin is timid

961
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:59.938
The mountain god was scared.

962
00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:14.035
It's worth a try this time

963
00:57:15.704 --> 00:57:17.122
Should I hang it up?

964
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.083
everything

965
00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:23.503
Are you going to take it or not?

966
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.714
The problem is

967
00:57:25.797 --> 00:57:28.091
Is that a fake or not?

968
00:57:28.592 --> 00:57:29.593
no

969
00:57:30.177 --> 00:57:31.344
let's die this time

970
00:57:31.761 --> 00:57:33.221
Just die one more time...

971
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.893
- What is this?
- Isn't he dead?

972
00:57:38.185 --> 00:57:39.477
I'm warning you

973
00:57:39.561 --> 00:57:41.771
The moment I leave, it’s patuya

974
00:57:42.439 --> 00:57:44.024
Don't give me a second chance

975
00:57:49.529 --> 00:57:50.614
Langa

976
00:57:50.697 --> 00:57:52.616
Just hold on a little longer, just a little longer

977
00:57:53.116 --> 00:57:54.159
I will definitely save you

978
00:57:54.242 --> 00:57:55.702
idiot

979
00:57:56.453 --> 00:57:57.913
Can't win even one game

980
00:57:58.496 --> 00:57:59.956
Shouting loudly

981
00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:11.760
The game is a one-shot match.

982
00:58:12.135 --> 00:58:13.261
If I lose

983
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:14.512
me too

984
00:58:14.888 --> 00:58:16.973
Rang dies here too.

985
00:58:17.057 --> 00:58:18.391
Are you going to take it or not?

986
00:58:21.353 --> 00:58:23.021
walk, walk

987
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.981
- Walk.
- You'll be okay, right?

988
00:58:25.065 --> 00:58:28.026
The name is Sanshin, but there is distribution.

989
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:29.527
Let's cheer together

990
00:58:30.111 --> 00:58:31.112
walk

991
00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:32.614
walk, walk

992
00:58:32.697 --> 00:58:34.616
- No, no.
- Walk, walk.

993
00:58:34.699 --> 00:58:36.409
- Walk, walk, walk
- Don't bet.

994
00:58:36.493 --> 00:58:38.536
- Walk, walk, walk
- A monster of that weight class

995
00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:41.122
It's not a bad idea to remove it in advance.

996
00:58:41.206 --> 00:58:46.336
walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk

997
00:58:46.419 --> 00:58:48.505
walk, walk

998
00:58:49.089 --> 00:58:50.090
yes

999
00:58:52.342 --> 00:58:53.843
Let's give it a try

1000
00:58:57.138 --> 00:58:58.265
ok

1001
00:58:58.848 --> 00:58:59.849
Then put it on

1002
00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:02.602
Are you confident you won’t regret it?

1003
00:59:03.561 --> 00:59:05.230
I don't usually regret things like that.

1004
00:59:05.855 --> 00:59:07.816
one, two

1005
00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:08.900
Three!

1006
00:59:16.574 --> 00:59:17.659
what's this?

1007
00:59:24.457 --> 00:59:25.750
Did you lose?

1008
00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:34.926
my name

1009
00:59:47.022 --> 00:59:48.773
thank you for saving me

1010
00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:50.775
Hey!

1011
00:59:50.984 --> 00:59:53.069
Thank you, thank you

1012
00:59:53.153 --> 00:59:54.154
Thank you, thank you

1013
00:59:54.237 --> 00:59:56.281
Now I'll live a good life

1014
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.158
No gambling

1015
00:59:58.241 --> 00:59:59.659
Don't grab anyone and don't wrestle with them.

1016
00:59:59.743 --> 01:00:00.869
Yes!

1017
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:03.163
- Let's go
- Yes

1018
01:00:03.246 --> 01:00:04.748
thank you

1019
01:00:09.085 --> 01:00:10.086
thank you

1020
01:00:12.297 --> 01:00:13.590
It's done

1021
01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:15.175
Stop harassing the old woman who is wearing clothes

1022
01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:16.259
Sore

1023
01:00:16.343 --> 01:00:19.012
How did you restore our lifespan?

1024
01:00:20.638 --> 01:00:22.307
These are dizzying times for indigenous gods.

1025
01:00:22.807 --> 01:00:23.892
It will continue to be like that in the future.

1026
01:00:23.975 --> 01:00:26.644
If you want to survive, make a place for yourself

1027
01:00:27.937 --> 01:00:28.938
In a changed world

1028
01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:30.357
live with humans

1029
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.900
yes

1030
01:00:37.822 --> 01:00:39.407
If this was in the Governor General

1031
01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:41.743
To the organization member I met
What happened?

1032
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.163
Couldn't contact you?

1033
01:00:45.246 --> 01:00:46.873
Not only that friend

1034
01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:51.419
Contacts in Gyeongseong
They all hid underground.

1035
01:00:51.503 --> 01:00:53.713
To what extent was it exposed?

1036
01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:55.256
I don't have time

1037
01:00:56.841 --> 01:00:58.802
The movements of the Governor-General are also unusual.

1038
01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:00.720
No way

1039
01:01:01.012 --> 01:01:03.139
Are you going to proceed with the big deal? With this number of people?

1040
01:01:03.348 --> 01:01:06.184
Moving with a minimum number of people
It might get better

1041
01:01:07.602 --> 01:01:08.603
For now

1042
01:01:09.145 --> 01:01:10.647
I'll find out the time and place.

1043
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:12.899
Everyone, please come in.

1044
01:01:17.654 --> 01:01:18.947
You have to take care of yourself

1045
01:01:19.656 --> 01:01:20.740
Shinjuya

1046
01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:22.492
Please protect Eunho.

1047
01:01:23.118 --> 01:01:24.452
yes

1048
01:01:28.915 --> 01:01:30.291
Definitely today

1049
01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.668
I need to hear the answer

1050
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.211
Gusinju

1051
01:01:33.586 --> 01:01:35.255
What are you?

1052
01:01:36.089 --> 01:01:37.382
What do you mean by that?

1053
01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:39.259
I was caught by Jang Sanbeom.

1054
01:01:39.342 --> 01:01:41.094
I also met a self-proclaimed mountain god

1055
01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:43.847
About my comrade who didn't die even after being shot

1056
01:01:45.098 --> 01:01:46.391
Shouldn’t we know by now?

1057
01:01:49.436 --> 01:01:50.603
what?

1058
01:01:51.604 --> 01:01:53.773
Who are you going to remarry?

1059
01:01:54.774 --> 01:01:55.859
Tawara Ginko

1060
01:01:56.317 --> 01:01:57.569
My sister-in-law.

1061
01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:59.320
Are you out of your mind?

1062
01:01:59.904 --> 01:02:02.365
Remarriage or third marriage
Do whatever you want

1063
01:02:02.449 --> 01:02:04.617
But it's a job for our Ginko.

1064
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:06.619
How did I raise him!

1065
01:02:06.703 --> 01:02:08.997
If you see this, you'll change your mind.

1066
01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:11.332
Come in

1067
01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:20.592
Armed group based in Manchuria

1068
01:02:20.884 --> 01:02:22.177
I am a member of the Liberation Volunteer Corps.

1069
01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:25.805
Not long ago, the Gyeongseong Station bomb incident
These guys did it.

1070
01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:27.682
They robbed my house

1071
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.351
Does that mean he is that guy?

1072
01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:32.812
We thought so too at first.

1073
01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:37.859
There's something strange about this

1074
01:02:47.243 --> 01:02:48.703
Did you write it on a typewriter?

1075
01:02:48.786 --> 01:02:49.829
Gyeongseong

1076
01:02:49.913 --> 01:02:53.374
This precious typewriter
How many people can write it?

1077
01:03:00.256 --> 01:03:02.175
Just something like this

1078
01:03:02.425 --> 01:03:04.761
Shall we try weaving long noses?

1079
01:03:07.514 --> 01:03:08.515
Try it

1080
01:03:08.598 --> 01:03:09.974
Please sit down.

1081
01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:13.895
father-in-law

1082
01:03:15.522 --> 01:03:16.981
It's just the beginning

1083
01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:25.323
There are witnesses

1084
01:03:27.534 --> 01:03:29.786
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

1085
01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:31.329
During the Gyeongseong Station bomb incident

1086
01:03:31.913 --> 01:03:33.915
Come to us, Lady Ginko.

1087
01:03:35.124 --> 01:03:36.125
Fox?

1088
01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:38.545
A fox?

1089
01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:39.671
Shhh

1090
01:03:40.505 --> 01:03:42.715
That's top secret on our part.

1091
01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:45.718
Ah, so
Is that what you said?

1092
01:03:45.802 --> 01:03:48.346
The world I know
It might not be everything

1093
01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:49.556
Do you believe me?

1094
01:03:50.348 --> 01:03:52.767
Ah, usually humans
Even if I see it in person, I never believe it.

1095
01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.018
i want to believe

1096
01:03:54.727 --> 01:03:56.396
Are there any ghosts?

1097
01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:58.648
Why ghosts?

1098
01:04:08.157 --> 01:04:09.909
This is my sister

1099
01:04:12.203 --> 01:04:13.746
It's the anniversary soon.

1100
01:04:14.497 --> 01:04:16.040
I was thinking of coming to eat the ancestral rites.

1101
01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:19.085
How did you die?

1102
01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:21.004
The police chief said it was suicide.

1103
01:04:21.504 --> 01:04:23.047
But I don’t believe that bastard.

1104
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.674
The day my sister died

1105
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:28.303
Together to Changgyeongwon
I promised to go see the azalea flowers.

1106
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:32.682
No way

1107
01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:34.392
Eunho, then...

1108
01:04:34.684 --> 01:04:35.977
I told my brother-in-law

1109
01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:37.770
murder

1110
01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:39.814
I think I got hit

1111
01:04:41.107 --> 01:04:43.735
Ah, cool

1112
01:04:44.235 --> 01:04:45.278
How did you win?

1113
01:04:49.949 --> 01:04:51.034
Like this

1114
01:04:51.492 --> 01:04:52.577
3 light?

1115
01:04:53.244 --> 01:04:54.871
You can't believe it

1116
01:04:56.247 --> 01:04:57.248
Ouch!

1117
01:04:57.332 --> 01:05:00.376
Oh, oh my hand, oh my hand!

1118
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.669
Ah, my hand

1119
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.842
Even if you're not good at gambling, you learn quickly.

1120
01:05:07.925 --> 01:05:10.345
Wow, cut off that guy’s wrists for cheating.

1121
01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:12.972
Basically, everything I do is romance.

1122
01:05:13.389 --> 01:05:14.891
Chi

1123
01:05:17.352 --> 01:05:18.394
tell me

1124
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.271
in the future you came from

1125
01:05:20.897 --> 01:05:22.649
what happened to us

1126
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:29.155
Do you want to see it for yourself?

1127
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:38.414
Now look at this

1128
01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.584
It's me

1129
01:05:43.127 --> 01:05:44.295
i will die soon

1130
01:05:44.754 --> 01:05:47.799
If you are in times like this
He would come running to save me right away.

1131
01:05:48.383 --> 01:05:50.468
where
There's nowhere to rub and I'm ruined

1132
01:05:51.135 --> 01:05:52.887
I will be reborn as a Dokdo shrimp

1133
01:05:53.721 --> 01:05:55.431
Just in case, don't eat shrimp.

1134
01:05:56.849 --> 01:05:57.975
You too

1135
01:05:58.559 --> 01:05:59.977
Be sure to be born again

1136
01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:02.313
Still

1137
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:05.191
if you can

1138
01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:09.362
Let's meet again

1139
01:06:13.157 --> 01:06:14.325
brother

1140
01:06:21.833 --> 01:06:22.834
Will you forgive me?

1141
01:06:24.085 --> 01:06:25.586
you protected me

1142
01:06:26.254 --> 01:06:27.338
I couldn't protect you

1143
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:32.969
Even though I am like that

1144
01:06:33.845 --> 01:06:35.471
Why can't you just buy this?

1145
01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.640
Oh, that human woman died together?

1146
01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:41.352
I chose it

1147
01:06:42.729 --> 01:06:45.857
Without growing old for infinite years
You lived without dying

1148
01:06:46.733 --> 01:06:47.734
This isn't bad either

1149
01:06:48.776 --> 01:06:49.944
Oh, what else would be good?

1150
01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:53.614
like normal people
Do you feel like cherishing every minute and every second?

1151
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.283
I lived like this

1152
01:06:55.366 --> 01:06:58.202
With how bright the world is
I knew it was full

1153
01:07:02.957 --> 01:07:04.083
But

1154
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:08.296
Did you cry?

1155
01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:10.798
huh?

1156
01:07:11.924 --> 01:07:13.593
No, did you cry and cry when I died?

1157
01:07:21.017 --> 01:07:22.226
uh

1158
01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:24.145
No?

1159
01:07:24.228 --> 01:07:25.688
I have no tears at all, you idiot?

1160
01:07:27.982 --> 01:07:29.567
- hey!
- Lang!

1161
01:07:33.196 --> 01:07:35.072
You thought you were going to die

1162
01:07:38.785 --> 01:07:39.786
I'm not dead

1163
01:07:39.869 --> 01:07:41.412
Look!
I knew that, really

1164
01:07:41.496 --> 01:07:43.289
It was mean, really.

1165
01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:44.791
sorry

1166
01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:46.876
Still, the last thing I want to see is

1167
01:07:47.376 --> 01:07:48.586
Was it my face?

1168
01:07:52.548 --> 01:07:55.468
No, our boss.
He's such a lover, really

1169
01:08:03.559 --> 01:08:04.811
if you can

1170
01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:06.813
Fold it neatly into your travel bag.

1171
01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:09.273
I wanted to take you back to the times I live in.

1172
01:08:10.149 --> 01:08:11.234
Sore

1173
01:08:11.651 --> 01:08:12.944
my little brother

1174
01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:16.155
By that time, I had become an adult and created my own place.

1175
01:08:16.989 --> 01:08:18.991
I'm living my own world again

1176
01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:25.706
Could you imagine?

1177
01:08:25.915 --> 01:08:28.167
Why are they taking over Joseon now?
Did you swallow it?

1178
01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:29.794
You know what’s even more absurd?

1179
01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:32.296
In the future, Joseon will be divided into North and South.

1180
01:08:32.588 --> 01:08:35.258
Our hometown Baekdu Mountain
I can't go as I want

1181
01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:41.138
With my brother

1182
01:08:42.473 --> 01:08:43.724
I want to go home

1183
01:08:46.561 --> 01:08:49.063
We planted together
I wonder if the persimmon tree is doing well too.

1184
01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:53.109
So bro

1185
01:08:54.235 --> 01:08:55.486
wake up quickly

1186
01:08:56.946 --> 01:08:58.030
infant

1187
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.075
If I want to be fully resurrected

1188
01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:03.661
I need a guardian stone and a gold chuck.

1189
01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:05.121
Okay, bro.

1190
01:09:07.123 --> 01:09:08.207
I'll bring it

1191
01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.390
Who are you?

1192
01:09:24.724 --> 01:09:27.602
who
You poisoned my well

1193
01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:32.064
It's me

1194
01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.070
Please save me!

1195
01:09:40.197 --> 01:09:41.741
Please save me!

1196
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.637
Joseon Yokai

1197
01:10:03.512 --> 01:10:05.973
It's all plain water?

1198
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.157
- You said to capture him alive, right?
- Chi

1199
01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:25.743
What should I do if I can’t control my strength?

1200
01:10:26.285 --> 01:10:28.329
I'm hungry

1201
01:10:29.664 --> 01:10:30.873
Buy me food, brother.

1202
01:10:31.415 --> 01:10:32.458
I'm busy

1203
01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:36.128
Interesting rumor
I heard one

1204
01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.674
Should I tell you or not?

1205
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.553
At Myoyeonggak

1206
01:10:45.304 --> 01:10:47.348
They say there is treasure

1207
01:10:52.269 --> 01:10:53.521
It's a treasure...

1208
01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:15.418
-He's dead.
- Lee Yeon

1209
01:11:18.129 --> 01:11:21.090
From Well God, Cheol Yong God, and Jangseung Grandfather
It's all gone

1210
01:11:21.173 --> 01:11:22.925
Gyeongseong floor searched as if to grab it

1211
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:25.136
Find out what kind of guy he is doing

1212
01:11:25.469 --> 01:11:27.221
yes

1213
01:11:27.847 --> 01:11:28.931
Langa

1214
01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.936
Release all our children

1215
01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:35.479
Yes!

1216
01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.619
I tried to go as soon as possible.

1217
01:11:51.412 --> 01:11:52.621
I just can't do it.

1218
01:12:26.614 --> 01:12:27.948
Japanese monsters

1219
01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:29.992
I'll sweep it all up before I get home

1220
01:12:30.076 --> 01:12:32.870
Four Japanese monsters and two mountain gods
It's a 6 to 1 fight

1221
01:12:32.953 --> 01:12:34.872
I'll be the bait

1222
01:12:35.706 --> 01:12:36.874
It's over now

1223
01:12:36.957 --> 01:12:38.459
go out your brother

1224
01:12:38.542 --> 01:12:39.794
If you want to save it, hand over the treasure

1225
01:12:40.336 --> 01:12:42.755
Our Yeon and Muyoung
Put up a fight

1226
01:12:42.838 --> 01:12:44.048
I have to run away with the treasure.

1227
01:12:44.298 --> 01:12:45.966
I don't fight losing battles

1228
01:12:46.258 --> 01:12:48.052
Hongju and Muyoung

1229
01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:49.678
What if you're on our side?

1230
01:12:49.762 --> 01:12:52.223
Let's catch them together with me.

1231
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.558
As the last mountain god of Joseon
