00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:54,219
THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

2
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:11,611
<i>Somewhere in the desert of my heart</i>

3
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:17,117
<i>No one's here but only you and I</i>

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,622
<i>Even if I stay inside a storm</i>

5
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:28,712
<i>I'll be standing till the morning comes</i>

6
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:02,746
<i>I'll pray for you</i>

7
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:12,756
<i>Nightmares, stop signs, obey</i>

8
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:18,261
<i>I'm waiting for you</i>

9
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:02,389
Hey.

10
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,057
Hey!

11
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:08,186
Who is this?

12
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,105
Up. Up.

13
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:11,356
Get up.

14
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:13,233
Who are you?

15
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,277
You've got some guts.

16
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,279
Let me ask you something.

17
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,825
Name, Im Pilseung.

18
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,912
Age, 42.

19
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,082
Forty-seven
Russian weapon trafficking cases.

20
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,586
Thirty-five drug trafficking.

21
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,213
Twelve murders.

22
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,382
An Interpol Red Notice.

23
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,593
Right?

24
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,345
The country wants you in.

25
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,431
Come with me.

26
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:45,765
Who is this punk?

27
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,516
We've had enough, let's go.

28
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,642
What?

29
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,200
Dohoon.

30
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,202
You dead or alive?

31
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:48,828
What took you so long?

32
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,455
I thought I was dead.

33
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,375
Take them.

34
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,044
Hey. Take him.

35
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:57,504
Give me water.

36
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,632
What are you doing? Take them.

37
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,635
Why does Chief Oh
suddenly want him alive?

38
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:05,887
Live a straight life, you punk. Be good.

39
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,014
How dare you sell drugs.

40
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,141
- Punk.
- You okay?

41
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,774
Jaeyeol.

42
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,109
Yeah.

43
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:20,360
What's the date today?

44
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,279
- Sixth.
- Sixth?

45
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:23,863
What time is it?

46
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,200
It's 10:26 p.m.

47
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,286
It's 10:26 p.m. on the 6th?

48
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,370
Yes.

49
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,123
- Give me your phone.
- What?

50
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,916
Give me your darn phone, now!

51
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,213
- This is bad.
- What's wrong?

52
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:43,091
Unlock it. Hurry up!

53
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,218
- Done?
- Yes.

54
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,971
This is crazy.

55
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,894
- Minseo. Where are you?
<i>- I'm home. You, Dad?</i>

56
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:58,356
Me? Where's Mom?

57
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,442
<i>Mom? How about you, Dad?</i>

58
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,860
<i>Aren't you with her?</i>

59
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:04,404
Is she there? Did she leave?

60
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:06,990
<i>She left.</i>

61
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:08,575
She left?

62
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:11,161
<i>She went to Thailand with you
for the 10th anniversary.</i>

63
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,038
<i>You didn't go with her?</i>

64
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:15,123
<i>- Dad. Dad.</i>
- So she left.

65
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,334
Was it today?

66
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,461
Am I trembling?

67
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:21,379
It's cold.

68
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:24,174
It's really cold.

69
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,301
What do I do?

70
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,094
It's okay.

71
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,807
Yura left.

72
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,268
What do I do now?

73
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,318
THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

74
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,862
{\an8}Episode 1

75
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,479
{\an8}How's the job going?

76
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,023
{\an8}Any issues?

77
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,486
{\an8}You're still not there yet?

78
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,114
{\an8}Dad. What were you doing?

79
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:30,990
I said I'm here.

80
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,575
I just arrived.

81
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,121
Slowly, Mirim.

82
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,247
Walk slowly.

83
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,332
Mirim's there too?

84
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,334
I told you to go alone!

85
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,253
<i>Dad. Wait for me.</i>

86
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,296
Even Jihoon's there.

87
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,298
Dad. He shouldn't do anything.

88
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,883
You have to do it yourself.

89
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,051
You know what I mean?

90
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,011
Dad. Dad? Answer me!

91
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,930
<i>- Dad.</i>
- That punk.

92
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,266
Such a pain in the neck.

93
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,687
Wait. Excuse me.

94
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,946
OVER LOAD

95
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,372
Why would you kick out what I loaded?

96
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,083
I can't tell my grandchild to get off.

97
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,294
Of course, Grandpa.

98
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,547
Seriously.

99
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,300
House prices will go down
if you behave like that.

100
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,385
They will just plummet.

101
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,970
Why would they plummet?

102
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,388
Don't be ridiculous.

103
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,474
How brazen.

104
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,896
Father, is this really necessary?

105
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,732
Do we need the whole family to come?

106
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,067
See it for yourself, and you'll get it.

107
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,282
My goodness.

108
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,206
I knew it.

109
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,750
My brother is always beyond imagination.

110
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,760
My goodness.

111
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,970
You punk.

112
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,723
You call this dump a house?

113
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,351
Hey.

114
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,435
What the...

115
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,772
He only calls when he needs me.

116
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,232
Goodness...

117
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,900
Dad, you do the dishes.

118
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,735
You can sit and fold clothes.

119
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,404
Make sure it's spotless

120
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:34,531
like how Yura does.

121
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:36,699
That'll only make things worse.

122
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:39,494
- Huh?
- Think about it.

123
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,412
She returns home after running away,

124
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:42,997
and finds her house spotless.

125
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:46,376
"Oh, they're fine without me."

126
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,669
She'll be disappointed.

127
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,338
It's more like an outing,

128
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,423
she was out for just four days.

129
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,217
That's not true, Father.

130
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,761
If she left home
with a grudge in her heart,

131
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,097
you can't consider that an outing.

132
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,849
She ran away.

133
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,853
I can't disappoint Yura.

134
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,522
Should we make a bigger mess?

135
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,274
No, no.

136
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:12,944
Hmm... It should show Dohoon's effort,

137
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,738
yet, make her feel

138
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:18,074
she's needed.

139
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,868
That's right.

140
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,371
You're smart.

141
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:27,750
Then shall we get down to it?

142
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,544
She wants a lick and a promise.

143
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,212
Don't get carried away.

144
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,673
By the way,

145
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,675
never heard of a wife
that fled to Thailand

146
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,427
just because she got sulky.

147
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,305
How can she go alone
on their 10th anniversary trip?

148
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:42,932
Honestly, she's got more issues
than Dohoon.

149
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,394
You say that because you have no idea.

150
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,146
My brother has a history.

151
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:02,619
8 YEARS AGO

152
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,621
I'm sorry,
it was your birthday yesterday.

153
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,331
I'm really sorry.

154
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,374
Why did Chief Oh send me on a biz trip?

155
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,542
{\an8}Such a nutjob.

156
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,752
{\an8}CHIEF OH

157
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,588
You said Chief's giving you a hard time.

158
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,340
I shouldn't have let you down.

159
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:18,009
I'll make it up to you next time.

160
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,345
If it happens again, as a punishment...

161
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,305
Oh, we have to change the position.

162
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,015
This is complex.

163
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:25,892
Do we hold hands?

164
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:29,979
I'll shave both my eyebrows.

165
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,319
It's okay.

166
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:37,737
I understand.

167
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,739
Thank you. Thank you so much.

168
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,123
{\an8}6 YEARS AGO, 2 DAYS
AFTER MINSEO'S FIRST B-DAY

169
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,506
I'm a dad?

170
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,675
I don't deserve to be a dad.

171
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:03,429
What kind of dad misses his
only daughter's first birthday party?

172
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:04,889
Chief Oh.

173
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,933
Chief Oh.

174
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,476
Chief Oh. Chief Oh!

175
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,019
{\an8}CHIEF OH

176
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,105
I'm quitting this darn job.

177
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,941
I lost my right to be a dad.

178
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:18,361
No, I lost my right to be a human!

179
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:20,947
It's okay.

180
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:22,699
I understand.

181
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,701
Minseo.

182
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:27,954
Oh, Minseo.

183
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,415
Oh, you're scared.

184
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,875
You're scaring her.

185
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,128
Okay.

186
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:38,464
Don't be sad. Who did that to you?

187
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,307
A YEAR AGO, THREE DAYS
AFTER MINSEO'S B-DAY

188
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,564
Where does he live?

189
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,607
- He's so hot.
- Look at his abs.

190
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:57,859
They're perfect.

191
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,072
He's so fit.

192
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,165
Is there a fight? Let me see.

193
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:14,125
What's that nutjob doing naked?

194
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,587
Such a ridiculous guy.

195
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,593
Wait, that's...

196
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,513
- Minseo!
- It's Dad!

197
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,390
Minseo!

198
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,768
- It's my dad.
- Are they your friends?

199
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,145
Come. Let's run.

200
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,397
He's been working out?

201
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,068
What the heck is he doing?

202
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,197
Dad. Let's run together.

203
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,491
Dad. Come here.

204
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,825
No, no.

205
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,077
Where are you going?

206
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,370
Jihoon. Come here.

207
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:52,538
You punk.

208
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,917
Honey!

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,710
I love you, Kang Yura.

210
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:02,090
Kang Yura the fair lady.

211
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,383
I worked out so much today.

212
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,843
Look forward to it!

213
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:10,932
It's okay. I understand.

214
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,318
He's been doing that
for ten years.

215
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:23,736
But it's a bit strange.

216
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,364
She's usually cool about it.

217
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,366
He's the one who always makes a fuss.

218
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,868
What's gotten into her this time?

219
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:32,787
I think I get it.

220
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:37,041
Yura is sly.

221
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,668
Maybe she endured it for ten years

222
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,419
to blow it all up at once.

223
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,047
Come on. She wouldn't do that.

224
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,841
Jihoon is right.

225
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:46,008
She's not sly at all.

226
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,552
She's very thoughtful.

227
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,803
Of course.

228
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,012
No, Father.

229
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,181
I know people like her very well...

230
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:57,436
There is a ground in this family
you must never mess with.

231
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,646
That is

232
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,773
Yura.

233
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,278
You'll eventually realize
what she's like.

234
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,904
You should learn from her.

235
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,949
Let's start moving.

236
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,368
Let's move.

237
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,080
Are they all hypnotized or what?

238
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:19,292
Damn it!

239
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,509
This goes in the recycling bin.

240
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,012
Oh.

241
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:34,390
Don't tell anyone Mommy's
good at cursing. Sorry.

242
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,185
I'll do it.

243
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:39,520
This is darn...

244
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,147
- Mirim.
- Yes.

245
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,232
I'm coming.

246
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:56,037
- Why is it shaking so much?
- What's going on?

247
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,580
Please fasten your seatbelts.

248
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,958
Please fasten your seatbelts.

249
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,794
We're experiencing turbulence.

250
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:06,005
Please fasten your seatbelts.

251
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,299
Fasten your seatbelts please.

252
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:11,385
Fasten your...

253
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,348
Be careful. You might get hurt.

254
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:16,432
Thank you.

255
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,476
Aren't you scared?

256
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,269
How can you be so calm?

257
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,902
{\an8}BORN IN 1986, THE BEST DAY IN LIFE

258
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,612
IT'LL BE A DAY FULL OF LAUGHTER

259
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:38,287
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain Lee Myungjin.</i>

260
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:40,665
<i>We are experiencing some turbulence.</i>

261
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,292
<i>Please remain seated
and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

262
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:46,379
<i>And follow the guidance
of the flight attendants.</i>

263
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:49,090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
This is Captain speaking.</i>

264
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,100
BANGKOK-SUVARNABHUMI

265
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:07,358
I was so busy that my wife ended up

266
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:10,319
going on our tenth anniversary trip

267
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:12,947
all by herself.

268
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,949
She's returning today.

269
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:19,996
What do I do to make it up to her?

270
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,628
Oh.

271
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,171
{\an8}<i> Be hot.</i>

272
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,256
{\an8}<i>That always works.</i>

273
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,590
{\an8}Oh, geez.

274
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,929
{\an8}How hot?

275
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,351
Honey. I'm really sorry.

276
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,312
Will you forgive me just this once?

277
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,231
I'm so hot.

278
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:48,482
She'll forgive me for sure.

279
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,568
I'm hot from any...

280
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:01,454
You're back.

281
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:06,584
You arrived early.

282
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,793
Thanks to the turbulence.

283
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,339
Oh, wait.

284
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,716
Welcome to Korea.

285
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,558
Is she angry or not?

286
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:36,572
Honey.

287
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,033
You weren't lonely on this trip,
were you?

288
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,702
When you were traveling,

289
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,372
I was also traveling with you virtually
on YouTube.

290
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,708
I managed to squeeze into
your busy schedule. Lucky me.

291
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,503
We may have been physically apart,

292
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:51,629
but doesn't matter,

293
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,631
as long as we were together mentally.

294
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:54,882
Am I right?

295
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:58,010
Yesterday was bill payment date.

296
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,095
Did you check?

297
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,099
Of course.

298
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:05,059
How many times did you have delivery?

299
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:08,521
The fridge was full of food and soup

300
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,147
you made with love.

301
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,816
Why would I get delivery?

302
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,067
I shouldn't.

303
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,151
Good job.

304
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:18,823
I bet I can braid Minseo's hair better
than you.

305
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,075
I also cleaned the house spotless.

306
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:22,952
You'll be surprised when you get home.

307
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:24,745
You'll pass out. You'll be knocked down.

308
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:27,665
What about Chief Oh?

309
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,796
Chief Oh? Chief Oh...

310
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:38,467
Oh, I tried to straighten that out too.

311
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,803
But the schedule was so hectic.

312
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,471
That's the thing about trade.

313
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,683
Chief must be on a trip to like,
Saudi Arabia?

314
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,351
{\an8}Or was it Madagascar?

315
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,103
{\an8}Kyrgyzstan! It was Kyrgyzstan.

316
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,521
{\an8}Anyways, not in Korea.

317
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:53,107
{\an8}I'll make sure you two meet
when Chief returns.

318
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,191
{\an8}Don't worry.

319
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:00,906
Can you pull over there?

320
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,991
Why?

321
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,659
- Pull over now.
- Why?

322
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,163
Okay.

323
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,426
I'll go alone from here.

324
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,345
I was going to set the date,

325
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,514
but I can't just do that by myself.

326
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,308
I get it. Move.

327
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,018
If you go alone,

328
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,186
do I just walk home?

329
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,479
Or hitchhike?

330
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:32,897
In this heartless world?

331
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:35,149
This is wrong.

332
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,484
Yura, you know this is wrong.

333
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,651
You know that too, right?

334
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,987
I said I need to see Chief Oh

335
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,281
who interrupts our family matter
every time.

336
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:44,366
Set the date or I'm not letting this go.

337
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,743
- Get out of my way.
- Wait.

338
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:51,207
Yura. Look at that calm blue sea.

339
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:54,585
Take a deep breath out.

340
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:55,753
And breathe in.

341
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:57,046
Breathe out.

342
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,547
Breathe in again.

343
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,508
Relax and calm down.

344
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,385
One more time. Breathe out.

345
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,346
And? Do you feel better now?

346
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,514
Do you feel calm now?

347
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:07,890
Set the date with Chief Oh.

348
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:09,767
Hey.

349
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,562
- You can't just leave.
- Move!

350
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,482
Hey.

351
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,275
Open the door.

352
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:21,862
Hey.

353
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:33,832
Wait for me.

354
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,959
Take me with you.

355
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,294
Gosh, that...

356
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,633
- Geez.
- Take me!

357
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:48,556
Minseo. Mommy's back.

358
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,477
Mom. I'm busy. I'm in class.

359
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:58,816
Okay. See you later. Love you.

360
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,442
Kwon Minseo.

361
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:04,989
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:06,865
Sorry, guys.

363
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:09,660
{\an8}-It's okay.
- It's okay.

364
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:12,204
Minseo. You shouldn't be
answering your phone during class.

365
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,998
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,875
I guess my mom was confused
after the flight.

367
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,420
She usually never calls
when I'm in class.

368
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:22,172
You need to turn off
your phone in class.

369
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:25,134
- I turned off my phone.
- I turned off my phone.

370
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:28,095
Quiet.

371
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:30,180
Sorry.

372
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,349
But my dad said

373
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:36,228
if I ever get in trouble,
you won't be the one saving me,

374
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:37,479
but my dad will be.

375
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:40,065
So he told me to keep my phone on
at all times.

376
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,775
{\an8}I want to turn my phone on.

377
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,110
{\an8}I want to call my friend.

378
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,654
{\an8}Everyone, quiet!

379
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:49,325
I guess your father
watches movies a lot.

380
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,327
He doesn't like movies.

381
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:55,414
You have a way with words, Minseo.

382
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:58,584
{\an8}Me too!

383
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,713
Be quiet!

384
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,968
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:10,346
But my grandfather said,

386
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,389
"You can only live 100 years.

387
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:15,225
"If you can't say all you want,
you might as well die."

388
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,604
Forget it. Where were we?

389
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,691
Boseok and I were practicing a duel.

390
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:24,985
In a duel,

391
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:27,363
you must never yield.

392
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:28,989
That means,

393
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:30,908
I'll die if I don't kill the opponent.

394
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,228
Yura.

395
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:00,521
<i>Where's Dohoon?</i>

396
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,564
<i>Did he beg you for your forgiveness?</i>

397
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:05,359
<i>You shouldn't forgive him
so easily this time.</i>

398
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,486
So I left him in the middle of the road.

399
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:08,654
<i>You're so nice.</i>

400
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:10,572
<i>I would've thrown him into the sea.</i>

401
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:12,157
I caused you a hassle.

402
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:15,744
<i>Don't say that. I pushed you to leave.</i>

403
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:18,038
<i>That punk needs to learn his lesson.</i>

404
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:20,416
<i>At least he felt guilty.</i>

405
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:22,710
<i>He refused to eat for a whole day
on the day you left.</i>

406
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:24,878
No wonder he looked haggard.

407
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:28,132
<i>You shouldn't fall for that.</i>

408
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:30,759
<i>He really knows how to put on a show.</i>

409
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:35,472
<i>This is a garbage dump.</i>

410
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:48,360
Kwon Minseo is so strong.

411
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:50,654
Boseok.

412
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,408
Kim Boseok.

413
00:24:58,287 --> 00:24:59,288
Hey.

414
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,165
Yes?

415
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,583
Did you think about it?

416
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,628
- What?
- I asked you out yesterday.

417
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,131
You said you'll think about it.

418
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,215
So did you?

419
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:14,178
Not yet. I'll need more time.

420
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,391
How much more? When are you
going to give me your answer?

421
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,310
Tomorrow? The day after?

422
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,147
- Sorry.
- Boseok. Boseok!

423
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,734
Did you just get dumped?

424
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:30,569
Too bad.

425
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,029
That's not true.

426
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:34,072
You don't know what he wants.

427
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,162
<i>He woke me up
when I was about to sleep.</i>

428
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,331
<i>How do you manage to live with him?</i>

429
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:44,875
<i>I really respect you, Yura.</i>

430
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,668
It's all thanks to you.

431
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,047
You're the best of all he has.

432
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,009
<i>It's always fun to gossip about him.</i>

433
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:55,093
Mom.

434
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,678
Minseo.

435
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,222
Minseo is here!

436
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:03,852
What has he done to her?
Seriously, Kwon Dohoon.

437
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,103
Minseo's here.

438
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:08,315
<i>Okay. Let's talk more in person.</i>

439
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:09,942
<i>- </i><i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

440
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:11,985
Bye, Minseo.

441
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,862
Mom.

442
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,868
Did you miss Mommy or not?

443
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,079
Of course I did.

444
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:26,124
How come you didn't respond to my texts?

445
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,752
I got sick of it
after texting you all day.

446
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:30,379
You got sick of it?

447
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:34,299
You got sick? You little brat.

448
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,970
I was dying to see you.

449
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:44,142
Mom. How come men think too much?

450
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:48,814
Mom. Do I have to move to another school
if I get dumped?

451
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:51,275
Mom. Can I ask him out again
after I get dumped?

452
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,652
One question at a time.

453
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:57,197
Hmm... How many times
did Dad dump you?

454
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,282
What?

455
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,284
That's what Dad said.

456
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,370
He married you
because you kept chasing him.

457
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:07,082
Dad made up a lot of stories
while I was gone, didn't he?

458
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,793
Daddy's calling!

459
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,297
DECLINE

460
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:15,674
Do you want to get a dessert?

461
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,552
No, let's get a meal instead.

462
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,556
We can get our love story straight

463
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,640
and talk about Boseok.

464
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:26,310
How did you know it was about Boseok?

465
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,353
It's obvious.

466
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:35,485
- <i>The number you have reached...</i>
- She's not picking up.

467
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,491
Latte is sold out?

468
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:43,785
Latte is the best in the afternoon.

469
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,537
Fine. Americano it is.

470
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,290
PAY

471
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:56,965
EARN POINTS

472
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,277
404 JOB LIST

473
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,605
- Hey.
- You're late.

474
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,482
- Off on a biz trip?
- Pohang for 2 days.

475
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,236
Stay safe.

476
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,570
Stay safe.

477
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,781
- Thank you.
- Hey.

478
00:29:11,623 --> 00:29:15,127
GARDEN TRADING

479
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,524
Hey. Hey.

480
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,193
Oh, hello.

481
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,611
I checked everything.

482
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:42,946
The offer sheet looks good,

483
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,406
but the delivery date is a shame.

484
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,283
Check out the sample draft I sent.

485
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:47,409
Yes, sir.

486
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,163
The unit looks right.
Can you check the amount?

487
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:53,373
Are they
on a business trip again?

488
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,208
I don't know.

489
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,877
Team Two always gets to go.

490
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,337
When will our team get to go?

491
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,797
Gosh, I hate this.

492
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,383
Anyway, I'll handle it as usual.

493
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,968
Just get the papers done.

494
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:06,053
Okay.

495
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:07,846
- What about Chief Oh?
- Out on business.

496
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:10,307
Always. Always out.

497
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:14,978
I have something to say. This is tiring.

498
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,649
By the way,
what are you having for lunch?

499
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:20,776
I'm not eating.

500
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,902
Black bean noodles again.

501
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:23,236
Always them noodles.

502
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,321
That attitude.

503
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,906
Don't change later.

504
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:31,411
I'm ordering just mine.

505
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,253
Shanghai restaurant?

506
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,839
This is Garden Trading.
Black bean noodles...

507
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,591
<i>The number</i>...

508
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:47,135
I have 20 coupons.
Can I get free sweet and sour pork<i>?</i>

509
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:49,221
<i>Minseo. Did you meet Mom?</i>

510
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,807
<i>Are you with Mom? Where are you?</i>

511
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,850
<i>Let me know when you get home.</i>

512
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,703
Ah... It's about time.

513
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:15,163
Geez.

514
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,666
Oh.

515
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,920
Minseo!

516
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,672
Dad.

517
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:24,798
Honey.

518
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,966
- Minseo.
- Dad.

519
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,218
Minseo. Minseo.

520
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,012
Minseo! Honey!

521
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:35,559
- Dad!
- Minseo!

522
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,067
So playful.

523
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:45,402
She loves pranks.

524
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:46,862
Geez.

525
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,613
Why didn't you stop for him?

526
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:50,365
Aren't you going to forgive him?

527
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,952
Mommy's ready to forgive him.

528
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:57,289
As long as he finishes
the homework I gave him.

529
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,419
Minseo. How's Mom?

530
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:05,005
I'll be home soon

531
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:06,506
with Mom's favorite cake.

532
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,133
So keep an eye on her,

533
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,217
okay?

534
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:16,057
Mr. Cha. How many times
do I need to tell you that I'm busy?

535
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:17,601
You working on some art piece?

536
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:18,894
Hurry up already.

537
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:21,438
Be good to your family.

538
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:22,606
Don't be like that.

539
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,191
Be like what?

540
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,401
There's no one family-oriented
as much as me.

541
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:28,403
This isn't the first time.

542
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:31,239
You're always home late.
You never look after your family.

543
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,617
You were not there
for Minseo's first birthday party.

544
00:32:34,784 --> 00:32:37,996
Mr. Cha. You may not know
because you have your own business.

545
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,497
You know about office workers?

546
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:40,749
It wasn't my choice!

547
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:42,584
Who's not busy in life?

548
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,211
Everyone's busy. It's not just you.

549
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:47,297
And by the way,
people in this neighborhood

550
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,757
think she has no husband.

551
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,176
What kind of nonsense is that!

552
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:52,594
Don't spread any fake news.

553
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:55,013
Or I'm going to send you to prison
for false allegation.

554
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,182
So be nice to Yura.

555
00:32:57,265 --> 00:32:59,184
And just to add,

556
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,644
she's nice to her father-in-law,

557
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:03,480
visited her mother-in-law
every weekend when she was alive,

558
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:05,398
takes good care of your brother,

559
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:06,900
does a great job raising Minseo.

560
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,318
Fine, fine.

561
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,862
You're so full of yourself.
Give me the cake already.

562
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,948
Pull yourself together
and carry it carefully.

563
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:15,325
You think I'm going to drop it?

564
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,661
- Be careful.
- I'm not going to drop it.

565
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:18,745
Watch out.

566
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:23,416
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,588
That was the last cake of the day.

568
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:31,466
You know we only make cakes
ordered in advance.

569
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,971
Mr. Cha.

570
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,431
Mr. Cha.

571
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,422
Chief Oh! Seriously.

572
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:14,384
<i>Dad. Did you buy it?</i>

573
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:17,137
<i>Dad. How did it go? Dad?</i>

574
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,014
<i>I failed...</i>

575
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:20,932
<i>Then get something else.</i>

576
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:32,736
Seriously.

577
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:36,156
Should I go home or not?

578
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,658
This is driving me nuts.

579
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,125
FRIED CHICKEN WILL SET YOU IN PEACE

580
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,085
{\an8}PEACE CHICKEN

581
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:55,717
<i>That's it, Dad!</i>

582
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,684
<i>Daddy!</i>

583
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:25,413
Minseo, it's time
for some fried chicken!

584
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:33,380
Where can Mommy be?

585
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:48,937
- Want some fried chicken?
- I brushed my teeth.

586
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:53,358
So she's brushed her teeth already.

587
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,693
Do you want fried chicken?

588
00:35:58,029 --> 00:35:59,739
Let's have fried chicken.

589
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:06,329
This is different from those
instant chickens.

590
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,582
It's cooked homemade style.
It's amazing.

591
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,879
Drumstick.

592
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,464
Here.

593
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:18,633
- You're unbelievable, Dad.
- What?

594
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:21,428
Fried chicken is your favorite.

595
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,179
You should've got Mom's favorite.

596
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:25,849
What are you saying?
Mom likes fried chicken too.

597
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:41,489
Why are you peeling it?

598
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:45,076
Mom doesn't like it fried.

599
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,828
Take this and go in.

600
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,080
Hurry up.

601
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:52,041
Really? Mom doesn't like it fried?

602
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,961
Okay. I'll be right back.

603
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:56,296
Enjoy.

604
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:25,241
It smells so good.

605
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:27,160
It's chicken. Try it.

606
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:28,870
It's so heavy. My arm's falling.

607
00:37:28,953 --> 00:37:29,954
Oh, it fell.

608
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:31,539
It's back up.

609
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:33,500
Did you set the date with Chief Oh?

610
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:38,588
Let's watch <i>The Legend of Zorro</i>
with Minseo outside

611
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:39,672
and have fried chicken.

612
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,633
Weekdays or weekend,
anything is fine with me.

613
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:47,222
What are you going to say to the Chief
when you meet?

614
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,974
I'll see for myself

615
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:52,227
if your Chief is really a wicked boss

616
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,771
or you have been making it all up.

617
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,814
You...

618
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:59,442
How can you say I'm...

619
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,908
You still haven't changed it yet?

620
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:09,160
- I was...
- I'm sure you were going to.

621
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,621
You changed it more
than a hundred times in your heart.

622
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:13,998
It's off.

623
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,214
Where is it? I can't see anything.

624
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:22,423
It's too dark.

625
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:23,800
The lamp.

626
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,760
{\an8}-Turn it on.
- You turn it on.

627
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,845
{\an8}Don't be so cheap.
I can't see anything.

628
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:31,015
{\an8}Ouch.

629
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,768
{\an8}Did you just hit me?

630
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:35,895
{\an8}It was the drumstick.

631
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,897
{\an8}Did you just hit me
with the drumstick?

632
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:39,899
It slipped
because of the grease.

633
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,569
So why did you get chicken fried in oil?

634
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,988
For you for goodness' sake.

635
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,490
- What's your deal?
- I only eat grilled chicken.

636
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,993
Chicken's all about the fat,

637
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:51,369
didn't you know that?

638
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:54,330
It must be so nice to be smart.

639
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:56,958
It's too bad you don't know
what you should know.

640
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,210
Get out unless you have the dates
for Chief Oh.

641
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:01,421
Go eat your greasy fried chicken.

642
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:06,009
I bought it to share it with you.
With you!

643
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,355
Should have taken it with him.

644
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:29,282
Gosh, I'm tired.

645
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,461
- Dad.
- Yes?

646
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,087
Oh.

647
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,882
Thank you.

648
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,346
Give me some more.

649
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:52,972
That's good. Thank you.

650
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,057
Give me a kiss.

651
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,602
Nice.

652
00:39:58,478 --> 00:39:59,479
Ah.

653
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:03,775
Hmm?

654
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:14,369
Huh.

655
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,007
<i>Shall we dance?</i>

656
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:31,928
<i>And shall we love?
I know you hate me</i>

657
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:38,643
<i>Though I don't have anything</i>

658
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:43,231
<i>But our love is true, yeah</i>

659
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:47,652
<i>All my love is yours</i>

660
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:50,822
<i>Until the sun goes down</i>

661
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:56,619
<i>So, let's drink strawberry wine</i>

662
00:40:56,703 --> 00:41:00,123
<i>On this sparkling night...</i>

663
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:06,671
- Dad. Breakfast.
- Hmm?

664
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:08,756
Breakfast?

665
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,882
I should.

666
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,101
Don't show we had a fight
in front of Minseo.

667
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,310
Watch it yourself.

668
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:23,563
I'm completely poker-faced.

669
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:25,148
You have eye booger.

670
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:26,858
Gosh, the soup is salty.

671
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:27,984
Be quiet and eat.

672
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:29,068
What?

673
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,904
Don't you dare just leave,
do the dishes before you go.

674
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:34,323
You're washing the dishes this month.

675
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:35,867
It was your call.

676
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,326
Just set the date with Chief Oh!

677
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,413
Everyone is available
except for Chief Oh.

678
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,338
I'm off to school. Fight all you want.

679
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:55,928
I told you to hide it.

680
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,889
You were more obvious.

681
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:00,475
- Minseo...
- Have...

682
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:12,987
<i>It's your ovulatory phase.</i>

683
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,156
<i>Have a good and fruitful day.</i>

684
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:22,622
<i>I'll wake you just in time</i>

685
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:27,126
<i>To go missing a hundred miles</i>

686
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:32,340
<i>Till we run out of time</i>

687
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:37,595
<i>It's time</i>

688
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:01,452
<i>It's wine day today.</i>

689
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:02,954
<i>Let's keep that promise.</i>

690
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,389
Hold on.

691
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:25,101
I got you this.

692
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,145
Cheers.

693
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,569
We do it during the ovulatory phase.

694
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:35,862
No exceptions.

695
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:37,154
That works for me.

696
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:39,240
But what if we had a fight?

697
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:41,868
It'll probably be your fault.

698
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,370
You can make it up to me and do it.

699
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:46,914
But what if you're still angry?

700
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,416
You can beg until I forgive you.

701
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:50,418
What if your ovulatory phase ends
before then?

702
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:53,504
What could you possibly do wrong
to take that long?

703
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,506
Do it first.

704
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,925
And make it up to me later.

705
00:43:58,009 --> 00:43:59,135
Really?

706
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:03,306
You become really generous with alcohol.

707
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,474
You're so great.

708
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:06,809
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

709
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:12,982
Honey.

710
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:16,903
Get over here.

711
00:44:19,113 --> 00:44:20,197
Let's go.

712
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:39,759
Ah...

713
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,224
White wine? Red wine?

714
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:49,226
Or sparkling wine like Champagne?

715
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,646
- Hello.
- Hello.

716
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:53,439
I got you a souvenir.

717
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:54,857
Share it with your girlfriend.

718
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:55,942
Thank you.

719
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:57,652
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

720
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:00,488
- Hello.
- Hello.

721
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,115
You know what? Tonight's going to be

722
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,117
a very long and rough night.

723
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,911
Are you ready for it?

724
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:09,956
How about eel or parboiled octopus
for pairing?

725
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,374
{\an8}No, that's not necessary.

726
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:13,793
{\an8}We won't need that.
Let's just keep it natural,

727
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,252
{\an8}passionate, and rough!

728
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:16,462
Oh, hello.

729
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,673
How have you been?

730
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,257
Oh, hello.

731
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,593
- How was your trip?
- It was great.

732
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:24,303
I got you a special gift

733
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:27,640
- with a bottle opener.
- It's nice.

734
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:28,766
Thank you.

735
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:30,851
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

736
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:34,438
{\an8}Respond.

737
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:36,524
Father.

738
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,067
Father.

739
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,154
You're back
from the photo studio already?

740
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:45,241
I went there as soon as I got up.

741
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:48,494
It's my wife's memorial today.

742
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:51,747
Hold on.

743
00:45:59,171 --> 00:46:02,842
How about this one for this year?

744
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:07,013
Shinae was prettier
before her eye surgery.

745
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:09,932
Wait.

746
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:11,976
These earrings.

747
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:15,229
You mean these? That nutjob.

748
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:17,815
He didn't even know
if she had ears pierced or not.

749
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:19,942
Yet she got her ears pierced in her 50s

750
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:21,652
just because he got them for her.

751
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:23,487
See those red earlobes?

752
00:46:25,656 --> 00:46:26,949
Let's go with this.

753
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,576
Fifty five-year-old Kim Shinae.

754
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:29,702
Sounds good to me.

755
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:34,331
Are you leaving already?

756
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:36,500
Yes. I don't have much time

757
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:38,044
to get her favorite things.

758
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:39,962
I'll be home early.

759
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:41,464
Let's do the preparation together.

760
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:42,548
Don't do it alone.

761
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:46,052
All right. See you later.

762
00:46:56,604 --> 00:46:57,605
Oh.

763
00:46:58,272 --> 00:47:01,192
I was just thinking about you, Ms. Park.

764
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:03,027
Right on time.

765
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:09,867
Where are you, by the way?

766
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:12,745
Oh!

767
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:16,040
Really?

768
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:18,918
Who's so cute?

769
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:34,642
TODAY'S MENU

770
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,911
Will you cut Dohoon some slack?

771
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:57,081
If you don't, who will?

772
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:04,088
Yura. We're soulmates.

773
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:07,341
I like you more than Dohoon.

774
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:15,891
{\an8}<i>Respond please!</i>

775
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:18,352
<i>Answer me!</i>

776
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,250
- Hello?
- You have a minute.

777
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,376
Make me feel better.

778
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:45,379
<i>It was 2006 World Cup Germany.</i>

779
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:47,173
<i>It was the World Cup period.</i>

780
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,716
<i>You know Drogba? Right?</i>

781
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:50,217
<i>Don't you know him?</i>

782
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:52,219
<i>The Black Jesus Didier Drogba.</i>

783
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:53,554
I'm not a soccer fan.

784
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:54,763
<i>Anyway, Drogba...</i>

785
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,599
<i>made it to the World Cup.</i>

786
00:48:56,682 --> 00:48:57,725
<i>Then he fell to his knees</i>

787
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:59,602
<i>because his country was in civil war.</i>

788
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:01,187
<i>He looked at the sky and said,</i>

789
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,646
<i>"Dear Nation.</i>

790
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,023
<i>"At least for a week,</i>

791
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:06,317
<i>"let's put down the guns</i>

792
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,985
<i>"and stop fighting."</i>

793
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:09,653
<i>And guess what happened?</i>

794
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:10,738
What?

795
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:13,199
This is crazy.
You don't even know who Drogba is.

796
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:15,743
If you're a true soccer fan,

797
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:17,828
this is a super touching true story.

798
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:20,289
The moment you bring up Drogba,
it's over.

799
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:21,999
The game's over.

800
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,002
So what you want to say is,

801
00:49:25,085 --> 00:49:27,338
just like how Christians and Muslims
stopped war

802
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:28,422
as Drogba had wished,

803
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:30,424
you want us to call a truce.
Isn't that it?

804
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:32,801
You're really amazing.

805
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:34,678
Yura. You're so amazing.

806
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:38,849
How come you know nothing about soccer

807
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:41,185
but know things like
Israel and Christianity?

808
00:49:41,602 --> 00:49:42,686
Get to the point.

809
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,188
<i>The point is,</i>

810
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:46,440
you know Minseo,

811
00:49:46,523 --> 00:49:49,235
she wants a sibling so badly.

812
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:52,404
We should stop this war too, honey.

813
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:55,449
Drogba, did he fall to his knees?

814
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:56,784
I'm on my knees.

815
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,619
I'm already on my knees.

816
00:49:58,702 --> 00:50:00,746
I've been on my knees the whole time.

817
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:04,375
Let's call a truce for our child,
will you?

818
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,085
Let's call a truce, honey.

819
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:08,587
- Fine, let's call it a truce.
- Really?

820
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:13,050
But war is back on
after the ovulatory phase.

821
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:14,969
Of course. Don't worry.

822
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:16,971
Don't be late
for your mom's memorial tonight.

823
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:18,055
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

824
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:20,307
After it's over, let's send Dad...

825
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:23,394
I mean, send Minseo to Dad's.

826
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:24,603
Just don't be late.

827
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:26,563
<i>Tonight, I'm Drogba.</i>

828
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:28,190
Soccer goes on for 80...

829
00:50:28,274 --> 00:50:29,817
No, for 90 minutes, you know?

830
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,236
Including overtime, it's 120 minutes.

831
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,071
Are you trying to kill yourself?

832
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:36,448
I'll die if I have to.
I'll make it worth my death.

833
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,284
<i>"The Night of Burning Flesh and Bones".</i>

834
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:41,161
<i>"Capriccio: Love and Passion".</i>

835
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:44,957
I'm hanging up.

836
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,502
What's he saying?

837
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:36,050
One please.

838
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,017
Here, take this.

839
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:53,859
- Hey.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

840
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,152
Checking the target.

841
00:51:58,072 --> 00:51:59,073
What's up?

842
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:01,742
<i>Chief Oh is looking for you like crazy.</i>

843
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:05,329
Chief only wants me when I'm busy.

844
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:06,705
By the way, Ma.

845
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,708
I didn't get the last stamp
on the coupon. Need confirmation.

846
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:12,127
<i>Enough of that coffee coupon, please.</i>

847
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:13,962
Without the stamps,

848
00:52:14,046 --> 00:52:15,255
I can't start my work.

849
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:17,091
I need a clear reference point.

850
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:20,511
<i>She's the Chief recruiter
of the international fraud gang.</i>

851
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:22,554
<i>There are hundreds of victims.</i>

852
00:52:22,638 --> 00:52:24,515
<i>She's flying out tomorrow.</i>

853
00:52:24,598 --> 00:52:25,808
<i>It's urgent.</i>

854
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:31,688
She has a family.

855
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:35,359
<i>- What?</i>
- Nothing.

856
00:52:35,442 --> 00:52:37,820
I need to talk to Chief Oh.

857
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:40,155
You know the Japanese restaurant
we went before?

858
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,199
Tell her to meet me there. Bye.

859
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,879
She has a family.

860
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:22,614
Yura. Watch your hand.

861
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,168
There's no <i>jeon.</i>

862
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:36,253
Is it really okay like this?

863
00:53:36,336 --> 00:53:38,088
This is our style.

864
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,590
You should keep in mind.

865
00:53:40,632 --> 00:53:44,178
So, this is how you held the memorial
until now?

866
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:46,180
Get macarons from a dessert place,

867
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:48,182
and pork from Chinese restaurant?

868
00:53:48,265 --> 00:53:51,977
You must have been freeloading, I guess?

869
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,188
You can freeload along with me
from now on.

870
00:53:55,522 --> 00:53:56,648
Ah...

871
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,901
I was expecting some pollack <i>jeon.</i>

872
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:02,404
I'll make it for you this weekend.

873
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:06,200
What else does Bboongbboong want?

874
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:09,286
Bboongbboong wants
pork hocks and...

875
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:11,038
Pork hocks and...

876
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:13,207
Oh, I want pork hocks.

877
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,791
Here. Pork hocks.

878
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:18,086
That's not a pork hock.

879
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:24,801
Have some apples.

880
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:31,517
Thanks.

881
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:40,234
Grandpa.

882
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:41,902
Do you miss Grandma?

883
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:43,237
Yes.

884
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:47,074
Too bad. You can't go see her.

885
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:48,534
It's okay.

886
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,869
I'll go meet her soon.

887
00:54:50,953 --> 00:54:52,287
We'll meet soon.

888
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:54,540
When? Today? Tomorrow?

889
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:55,624
When?

890
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,417
Oh.

891
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:00,379
It reminds me of the time
I first met your grandma.

892
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:02,422
We called her Daebang-dong Madonna.

893
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:05,133
Men even got into fights over her.

894
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,970
I defeated them all.

895
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:09,596
Really?

896
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,641
That's amazing, Grandpa.

897
00:55:13,475 --> 00:55:15,352
Did you call Dohoon?

898
00:55:16,144 --> 00:55:18,063
Yes. Don't worry, Father.

899
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:19,731
He won't be late today.

900
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,872
Call Dohoon and check
when he'll be home.

901
00:55:35,956 --> 00:55:37,082
One second.

902
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,967
Is he driving?

903
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,803
He's never early.

904
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:52,180
It's probably Chief Oh again.

905
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:54,516
If he's late again,

906
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,476
that Chief Oh is going to pay for it.

907
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:58,729
We still have time.

908
00:55:58,812 --> 00:56:00,814
Don't worry, Father.

909
00:56:00,897 --> 00:56:01,982
Father.

910
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:03,900
Mother looks tired.

911
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:05,527
Shall we turn her off for now?

912
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:07,487
Yes, let's do that.

913
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:08,905
I bet he's going to be late.

914
00:56:10,073 --> 00:56:12,576
He's late for sure.
Dad, you should rest.

915
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:14,703
I'll turn her back on later.

916
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:05,420
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

917
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:07,923
<i>Are you seriously going to do this?</i>

918
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:09,633
<i>Is it Chief Oh again?</i>

919
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:38,328
I'm sorry I'm late.

920
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,831
There was so much traffic
even at this hour.

921
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,875
I made it.

922
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:49,131
It doesn't even make sense.

923
00:57:49,214 --> 00:57:50,215
This can't be happening.

924
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:51,425
Chief Oh called today,

925
00:57:51,508 --> 00:57:52,718
said something went wrong,

926
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,302
it's just ridiculous.

927
00:57:54,386 --> 00:57:56,221
I want to tell you all about it,

928
00:57:56,304 --> 00:57:58,724
but if we do,
we won't get to hold the ritual.

929
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:01,810
- What's taking you so long?
- I'm coming. I'll be right there.

930
00:58:01,893 --> 00:58:03,103
Honey. I'm really sorry.

931
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:06,231
I'll tell you all about it later.

932
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:08,024
I'm sorry again. I have to go.

933
00:58:18,118 --> 00:58:21,663
CHIEF OH

934
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:45,228
<i>Chief Oh.
You need to come to my house now.</i>

935
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:47,939
Mom.

936
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:51,943
- Mom.
- Whom to blame?

937
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:53,403
He's your own son.

938
00:58:54,237 --> 00:58:56,406
Chief Oh is always the problem.

939
00:58:56,823 --> 00:58:57,824
That darn guy

940
00:58:57,908 --> 00:59:00,160
always ruins everything.

941
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,162
Goodness...

942
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:08,335
Oh, Mom.

943
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,962
Drink it up.

944
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:12,964
Here.

945
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:17,552
Give your mom a macaron.

946
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:19,971
Give her the macaron. Mom.

947
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:23,350
You used to say

948
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:25,143
only if you knew about macarons earlier,

949
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,020
you would've had more before you died.

950
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,647
You were sad.

951
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,982
This is from your favorite store.

952
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,944
She had Italian.

953
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:37,614
This time, Chinese.

954
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:39,157
Sweet and sour pork.

955
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:40,283
Enjoy.

956
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:42,953
Your favorite Chinese restaurant
closed down.

957
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:45,121
The owner got into a car accident.

958
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:47,666
He had no kids to take over,
so it's closed.

959
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:49,000
Have you met him yet?

960
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,796
If it's not good enough,
ask him to make one for you.

961
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,007
Oh, we have a new member in the family.

962
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:57,092
Mirim. Come here.

963
01:00:02,138 --> 01:00:03,598
She's Jihoon's wife.

964
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:05,684
She's very shrewd.

965
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:06,977
Mirim. Say hello.

966
01:00:08,436 --> 01:00:09,688
Do I look here?

967
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:10,772
- Yes.
- Yes.

968
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:12,274
Oh.

969
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:19,322
Hello, Mother.

970
01:00:27,038 --> 01:00:28,123
Is that it?

971
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:30,333
Ah...

972
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:35,422
I'm Lee Mirim.

973
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:37,674
Nice to meet you.

974
01:00:38,216 --> 01:00:40,427
We're expecting
a grandchild soon.

975
01:00:41,303 --> 01:00:43,013
A shotgun wedding.

976
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:46,099
Jihoon's always been hasty.

977
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:48,184
Remember you had a hard time

978
01:00:48,268 --> 01:00:50,770
because he came out
faster than expected?

979
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:06,786
Oh, honey.

980
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,249
I miss you, Shinae.

981
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,293
Oh, honey.

982
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:16,922
Grandpa.

983
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:25,096
Mom.

984
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,391
Why did you have to die?

985
01:01:28,975 --> 01:01:31,561
What's wrong with them all of a sudden?

986
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:33,271
Now, Jihoon is

987
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,691
your responsibility.

988
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:39,694
Mom.

989
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:45,575
Why did you leave me?

990
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:47,786
Jihoon.

991
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:53,416
Dohoon. I'm so sad.

992
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,753
Mom. Why did you have to leave me?

993
01:01:56,836 --> 01:01:59,965
Bring Mom back.

994
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,636
Mom.

995
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:07,847
I miss Mom.

996
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:12,477
Dohoon. Bring Mom back.

997
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,562
Mom.

998
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:23,071
So this whole thing...

999
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,699
How long does this go on?

1000
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,251
It's over now.

1001
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:44,551
Give me Mom.

1002
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,639
I miss Mom.

1003
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,393
Pork hock's here.

1004
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:55,562
You said you wanted it.

1005
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:59,274
But I'll get fat if I eat at night.

1006
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,151
Pork hock's here.

1007
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:05,196
Did you order it from Jangheung <i>Jokbal</i>?

1008
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,656
Your favorite forefoot.

1009
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:08,533
Pork hocks.

1010
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:20,128
Who are you?

1011
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:21,337
Who are you?

1012
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:23,631
Sorry to visit you at this hour.

1013
01:03:23,715 --> 01:03:25,216
I'm Kwon Dohoon's boss,

1014
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,968
Chief Oh Chunryun.

1015
01:03:27,802 --> 01:03:29,262
Chief Oh Chunryun?

1016
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:31,181
Oh!

1017
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:32,307
Chief Oh?

1018
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:36,102
What? Chief Oh is here?

1019
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:39,022
Dohoon's boss Chief Oh?

1020
01:03:39,105 --> 01:03:41,858
He came on his own?

1021
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:44,360
Let me see.

1022
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,571
Chief Oh?

1023
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:03,463
<i>It was a she, not a he.</i>

1024
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:04,589
<i>Things are gonna get hot.</i>

1025
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:06,925
<i>Very hot.</i>

1026
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,427
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1027
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:11,387
<i>But she's pretty.</i>

1028
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:13,640
<i>If his boss is that pretty, did he...</i>

1029
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:17,519
<i>It's not a guy.</i>

1030
01:04:17,602 --> 01:04:19,229
<i>Why did she come at this hour?</i>

1031
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:23,108
<i>She's pretty.</i>

1032
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:36,621
Chief Oh.

1033
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:38,540
What brings you here?

1034
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:41,167
You told me to come.

1035
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:05,316
Delivery.

1036
01:05:07,277 --> 01:05:08,319
Hey.

1037
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:09,988
Wait.

1038
01:05:19,497 --> 01:05:20,874
Chief Oh was a woman?

1039
01:05:20,957 --> 01:05:22,876
- Was it just me?
- I thought he was a man too.

1040
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,752
I didn't know she was a woman.

1041
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:26,504
Hey. What's going on?

1042
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:28,298
She's such a pretty boss.

1043
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:29,674
Yura doesn't know, right?

1044
01:05:29,757 --> 01:05:31,009
You're hiding something.

1045
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:33,386
- Oh, my goodness
- What's going on?

1046
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:35,096
Anything going on? Are you...

1047
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:41,519
I called Chief Oh.

1048
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,443
Chief Oh...

1049
01:05:50,361 --> 01:05:52,947
Why did you call her?

1050
01:05:53,364 --> 01:05:54,824
I told you.

1051
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,951
I wanted to talk to her.

1052
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:01,915
Bring her in.

1053
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:16,846
THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

1054
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:39,911
{\an8}<i>Why is Chief Oh</i>

1055
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:42,497
{\an8}so nice to our family?

1056
01:06:43,122 --> 01:06:44,624
{\an8}<i>You think money is everything?</i>

1057
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:45,708
{\an8}Whoa.

1058
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:47,460
{\an8}<i> I know we called a truce</i>

1059
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:48,670
{\an8}<i>and we made a promise,</i>

1060
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:50,004
{\an8}but we're not animals.

1061
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,050
{\an8}Dad!

1062
01:06:54,384 --> 01:06:55,927
{\an8}<i> I'm booking a hotel room.</i>

1063
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,637
{\an8}<i>I can't draw back anymore.</i>

1064
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:01,557
{\an8}<i>If it was this dangerous,</i>

1065
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:03,434
{\an8}<i>you should've given me</i>
<i>proper information.</i>

1066
01:07:03,977 --> 01:07:07,563
<i>Do you have to work
at such a company?</i>
