﻿1
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:16.742
Chief Oh.

2
00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.661
What brings you here?

3
00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:21.288
You told me to come.

4
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.020
Delivery.

5
00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:52.820
Hey.

6
00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:54.488
Wait.

7
00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:33.861
Who are you?

8
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.119
A claim occurred.
The location is Byeonju-ro 17.

9
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.747
Seo Apartment 704.

10
00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.082
Situation handled.

11
00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.375
Requesting cleaning team.

12
00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:32.354
By looking at his knife skills,
he's from Vladivostok.

13
00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.398
You haven't had any problem
with them lately.

14
00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:37.484
I used to dig into them.

15
00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.736
They were quiet for a while.
They put a tail on me.

16
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.406
So why did you bring that tail here?

17
00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:45.033
The cleaning team is taking care of it.

18
00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:47.077
It's not a big deal. Don't nag at me.

19
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:50.914
What are they talking about?

20
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.459
Yura's life is now changed

21
00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:56.462
before and after meeting Chief Oh.

22
00:04:56.545 --> 00:04:57.546
She's right.

23
00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.548
When she sees him
going to work tomorrow,

24
00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.383
all kinds of thought will occur to her.

25
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.469
"Why is he wearing a blue shirt?

26
00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:05.137
"Because Chief Oh likes that color?"

27
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.597
"He took a shower last night.

28
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.098
"Why is he taking it again?"

29
00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.641
"Why is he polishing his shoes?"

30
00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:12.060
"He likes boxers.
Why is he wearing a brief?"

31
00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.645
Everything he does

32
00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.772
will lead to sexy Chief Oh.

33
00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:17.441
She won't stand it.

34
00:05:17.524 --> 00:05:18.775
I wouldn't.

35
00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:20.194
Who? Yura?

36
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:21.862
Let me see.

37
00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:24.656
Even if it was Jun Jihyun,

38
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.867
she wouldn't even flinch.

39
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.745
Dad. Life is all the same.

40
00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.414
If you lack here,

41
00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.833
you become timid.

42
00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.001
You feel pathetic.

43
00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:37.252
Obsession...

44
00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:43.175
Yura.

45
00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:46.386
The Chief must be pretty.

46
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.765
What are you still doing down there?

47
00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:51.183
Dad.

48
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.441
What is this?

49
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.318
Get home!

50
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.321
Hurry up, you punk.

51
00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:07.032
What's taking you so long?

52
00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:08.575
Your family's waiting. Let's go.

53
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.536
Go where? You messed it all up.

54
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.496
Get in the car. Leave.

55
00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:15.582
Why? I can't wait to see your wife
who orders her husband's boss

56
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.125
to come in the middle of the night.

57
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.752
Don't you dare mess with Yura.

58
00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:20.796
She's fragile.
If she talks to someone like you,

59
00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.673
she'll get hurt.

60
00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:27.135
If there's a misunderstanding,
I'll resolve it.

61
00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.137
If she's disappointed, I'll comfort her.

62
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:30.514
I'll solve it all.

63
00:06:30.597 --> 00:06:32.975
What can you solve?
Your existence itself is a problem.

64
00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:34.059
So, get going.

65
00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:38.897
What is this?

66
00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:46.196
THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

67
00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:48.407
Episode 2

68
00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:54.538
Hello. I'm Oh Chunryun.

69
00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:56.790
Oh, my. Mr. Kwon.

70
00:06:57.457 --> 00:07:00.294
You look so young in person.

71
00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:02.879
I'd believe it if you said
you were Dohoon's brother.

72
00:07:02.963 --> 00:07:04.756
Oh, no.

73
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.925
Were you disappointed
when I missed your wedding?

74
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.513
So I sent a lot of money.

75
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:14.558
Nice to meet you, Mirim.

76
00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:16.727
You must be Minseo.

77
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.188
Look at your cute round cheeks.

78
00:07:21.148 --> 00:07:22.357
Nice to meet you.

79
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.442
I'm Oh Chunryun.

80
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.570
Oh...

81
00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:29.156
We finally met.

82
00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:31.825
Everyone. Let's sit down.

83
00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:33.952
Mr. Kwon. Have a seat.

84
00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.245
All right.

85
00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.559
You're probably curious
what these are all about.

86
00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.853
These are the gifts I prepared

87
00:07:59.936 --> 00:08:02.731
for Dohoon to take home
every time something came up.

88
00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:05.692
I urged him to take them,

89
00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.361
but he always refused.

90
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.738
They're my heartfelt gifts

91
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:11.365
I couldn't deliver.

92
00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:13.367
Dear family.

93
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.534
Please begin.

94
00:08:15.243 --> 00:08:19.039
This is really expensive.

95
00:08:19.122 --> 00:08:21.166
Thank you so much.

96
00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:23.377
I've always wanted to play this.

97
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.463
Aren't these a limited edition?

98
00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:34.012
Why is it so dusty?

99
00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:42.396
Chief Oh.

100
00:08:43.063 --> 00:08:46.149
- Hmm?
- You prepared so much even at this hour.

101
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:47.734
Oh, it's nothing.

102
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.112
When one's giving a gift,

103
00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:52.572
there must be a reason.

104
00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:56.451
Is this a charity for my family?

105
00:09:00.163 --> 00:09:03.583
A charity? No way.

106
00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:06.586
I'm trying to win your favor.
It's more like a bribe.

107
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.756
To let go of everything that happened,

108
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.051
this is never enough.

109
00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.220
Of course.

110
00:09:15.303 --> 00:09:17.097
This is only the beginning.

111
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.307
From now on,

112
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:20.642
I'm going to...

113
00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:21.727
Chief Oh?

114
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:26.022
When my father-in-law was
hanging between life and death

115
00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:28.442
on a cold operating table,

116
00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:30.610
this bad son never paid him a visit.

117
00:09:30.694 --> 00:09:32.320
How much would that be worth?

118
00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:41.329
Honey. I was on a business trip.

119
00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:44.499
You know I was busy.

120
00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.126
That is your problem.

121
00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:53.508
You're always on a business trip
when something happens with the family.

122
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.679
To be honest,

123
00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:03.268
it was just a knee surgery.
It wasn't life-and-death.

124
00:10:03.351 --> 00:10:04.811
Hey.

125
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:06.563
You think general anesthesia is a joke?

126
00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:08.857
Oh, Dad, please.

127
00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:10.233
And

128
00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:13.069
when Jihoon was in the army,

129
00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:14.613
you never visited him.

130
00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:16.656
That's right.

131
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.701
You said you were always busy
because of Chief Oh.

132
00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.497
The disappointment I felt at the time,
how much is that worth?

133
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.915
It's probably worth a house.

134
00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:26.833
No way.

135
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.002
Were you disappointed?

136
00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:30.504
Don't get me started.

137
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.257
This is crazy.

138
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:35.425
Hey.

139
00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:37.427
My goodness.

140
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:41.139
Why would I visit a social service agent
who commuted from home every day?

141
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.642
How can I visit you?

142
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:45.018
You find it funny too right?

143
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:46.102
How?

144
00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.313
Complete nonsense.

145
00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:50.524
Your misunderstanding is more serious

146
00:10:50.607 --> 00:10:52.567
than I thought.

147
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:55.529
Besides, things keep coming up

148
00:10:55.612 --> 00:10:56.905
day and night.

149
00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:58.865
Day and night!

150
00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:01.451
She can't control them. Huh?

151
00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:04.579
It's work. Do you get it?

152
00:11:05.372 --> 00:11:06.414
My point is,

153
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.294
do you have to work

154
00:11:11.378 --> 00:11:12.754
at such a company?

155
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.299
Right, Chief Oh?

156
00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:20.345
Chief?

157
00:11:40.323 --> 00:11:41.575
It's all my fault.

158
00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:44.911
This all happened

159
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:47.956
because of my incompetence.

160
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:53.086
I'm an incompetent boss.

161
00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:56.006
I'm a terrible boss.

162
00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:57.799
I have no excuse.

163
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.552
I'm ashamed.

164
00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:03.930
That's work.

165
00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:07.350
Being a boss is the hardest, Chief Oh.

166
00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:10.604
Yes. That's why I'm not getting a job.

167
00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:12.188
Yes.

168
00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:14.733
A thoughtful boss
who cares about her juniors.

169
00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:15.901
She's pretty.

170
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.155
Because of all that workplace hierarchy

171
00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:21.948
Dohoon

172
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.783
never said no.

173
00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.620
He took it on the chin
and got jobs done.

174
00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:28.955
Without Dohoon,

175
00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.874
- this company will go under.
- Ah!

176
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.168
This company and I

177
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.547
owe you and Dohoon so much.

178
00:12:39.007 --> 00:12:40.008
I'm ashamed.

179
00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:43.845
No, don't say that.

180
00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.597
He's not working for free.

181
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.891
He's getting paid to do that.
He should do it.

182
00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:49.643
Hey.

183
00:12:50.852 --> 00:12:52.020
Work harder.

184
00:12:52.103 --> 00:12:53.688
Okay. I will.

185
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.148
It's okay. Don't cry.

186
00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:57.525
I feel like crying too.

187
00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:00.403
I didn't know about that.

188
00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:01.947
Mom. Are you crying?

189
00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:08.912
Honey.

190
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.590
It's all my fault.

191
00:13:23.218 --> 00:13:25.387
Honey, it must be so hard
to make ends meet.

192
00:13:27.305 --> 00:13:29.099
The café isn't going well.

193
00:13:29.182 --> 00:13:31.851
I spent so much money on the renovation.

194
00:13:32.936 --> 00:13:36.648
I'm sorry, I couldn't be of any help.

195
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.237
Father.

196
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.239
Only if

197
00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:47.742
I'd bought you a pair
of limited-edition hiking shoes,

198
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:50.578
you wouldn't have
tripped in the mountain.

199
00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:51.913
I'm so sorry.

200
00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:55.125
No, don't say that, Yura.

201
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:58.503
I don't need them.

202
00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.422
An old man should stay in his room.

203
00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:02.590
Why did I go hiking?

204
00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:04.592
It's my fault.

205
00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:06.428
I shouldn't have acted up.

206
00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:09.764
Jihoon.

207
00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:15.937
You want to play games that badly?

208
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:19.649
I should've known better

209
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:22.402
as your sister-in-law.

210
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:25.071
No, Yura. Please don't cry.

211
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.656
I shouldn't be playing games.

212
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.783
No. I will never play games.

213
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:36.291
I'm sorry, everyone.

214
00:14:39.252 --> 00:14:40.754
This is funny.

215
00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:42.714
Who would've seen this coming

216
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:46.051
after the memorial?

217
00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:51.056
- Mom.
- Minseo. It's okay.

218
00:14:52.015 --> 00:14:53.933
Gosh, we better grab a drink.

219
00:14:54.017 --> 00:14:56.436
We can't miss alcohol
in times like this.

220
00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.771
Jihoon. Get ready.

221
00:14:57.854 --> 00:14:58.855
Okay, Dad.

222
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:00.899
Get what ready?

223
00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:02.358
You know.

224
00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.953
<i>Let me get some sleep!</i>

225
00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.205
This is bad.

226
00:15:57.288 --> 00:15:58.748
Get in the car.

227
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.209
Start the engine.

228
00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:03.002
- Honey.
- Did you have a good time?

229
00:16:03.753 --> 00:16:04.879
Chunryun is my sister now.

230
00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:06.464
I know that.

231
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:07.966
Dohoon.

232
00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:09.551
Look at my sis, isn't she pretty?

233
00:16:09.634 --> 00:16:11.052
Of course.

234
00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:14.180
- We're married.
- You should sleep over.

235
00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.933
Where are you taking her?
She needs to go home.

236
00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:18.476
No.

237
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.936
She needs to go home.

238
00:16:20.019 --> 00:16:22.897
Let's go, Chief Oh.

239
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.900
You should come too.

240
00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.819
- Let's go.
- Bye.

241
00:16:27.902 --> 00:16:29.404
- Let's all go together.
- Where?

242
00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:30.947
Minseo's going to school tomorrow.

243
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.907
Come with me.

244
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:34.200
No, no.

245
00:16:35.326 --> 00:16:37.620
Just go already.
Don't you see this mess?

246
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.749
Bye.

247
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.251
Bye bye.

248
00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:47.964
- Bye.
- Bye.

249
00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:51.593
Goodbye.

250
00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:53.178
You two look good together.

251
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:56.681
Bye. Get home safe.

252
00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:01.728
Bye.

253
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.938
She's finally gone.

254
00:17:06.357 --> 00:17:07.400
How old is she?

255
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:08.735
Hmm?

256
00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:11.905
Can't you tell?

257
00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:14.908
She looks at least ten years older
than you.

258
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.202
Why didn't you tell me she was a woman?

259
00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:21.706
I did.

260
00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:25.460
Didn't I?

261
00:17:25.543 --> 00:17:27.212
Honey, that doesn't matter.

262
00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:28.379
Why does that matter?

263
00:17:28.463 --> 00:17:29.672
CHIEF OH

264
00:17:29.756 --> 00:17:30.757
That doesn't matter.

265
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.467
If I can't reach you,

266
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.260
I'm going to call your boss now.

267
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.720
Honey.

268
00:17:36.763 --> 00:17:37.764
Honey.

269
00:17:40.016 --> 00:17:42.977
Honey.

270
00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:51.861
Take Dongbu Expressway.

271
00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:06.459
Who are you?

272
00:18:16.135 --> 00:18:17.428
Yes, we've checked.

273
00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:20.390
They're on the move.

274
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.600
I'll report it to you when I arrive.

275
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.616
KWON MINSEO

276
00:18:41.953 --> 00:18:42.954
Hello?

277
00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.748
Is it yes or no?

278
00:18:46.249 --> 00:18:47.500
What?

279
00:18:47.583 --> 00:18:48.793
Hmm...

280
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.629
I'm not sure yet.

281
00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:54.632
I didn't ask you
a hard question.

282
00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.301
I said I like you.

283
00:18:58.678 --> 00:19:00.221
Hello?

284
00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:02.223
Hello?

285
00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.308
By the way,

286
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:05.768
I'm so tired, I'm getting dizzy.

287
00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:08.021
Are you okay?

288
00:19:08.104 --> 00:19:10.690
Don't worry about me.
Just give me your answer.

289
00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:13.192
If you don't, I'm not hanging up.

290
00:19:13.276 --> 00:19:16.821
I thought about it.

291
00:19:16.904 --> 00:19:18.865
I don't think I like you.

292
00:19:19.824 --> 00:19:22.035
What? How can you do this to me?

293
00:19:22.118 --> 00:19:24.495
I've been so nice to you all this time!

294
00:19:24.954 --> 00:19:27.623
Why did you eat the corn dog
I bought you?

295
00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:29.292
You don't even like me.

296
00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:31.669
I'll buy you a corn dog. Will that do?

297
00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:34.339
Kim Boseok.

298
00:19:34.422 --> 00:19:36.090
Sorry I don't like you.

299
00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:37.675
Bye.

300
00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.594
Hello? Kim Boseok?

301
00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:40.762
Kim Boseok!

302
00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:16.714
My dearest wife.

303
00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.008
The sexiest in the universe.

304
00:20:19.092 --> 00:20:20.259
It's time.

305
00:20:22.762 --> 00:20:23.888
Aren't you tired?

306
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:25.390
No. I'm not tired.

307
00:20:25.473 --> 00:20:26.516
I'm not tired at all.

308
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:29.394
The memorial is over.
You finally met Chief Oh,

309
00:20:29.477 --> 00:20:31.187
in fact, you totally outdrank her.

310
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.688
You knocked her out.

311
00:20:33.648 --> 00:20:35.566
Honey. We should do it.

312
00:20:36.943 --> 00:20:37.944
Let's do it.

313
00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:40.405
We've got to do it. Huh?

314
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:43.699
I'm not doing this for myself.

315
00:20:43.783 --> 00:20:45.451
This is for Minseo.

316
00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:47.912
You promised Minseo

317
00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:49.664
you'll make her a sibling.

318
00:20:49.747 --> 00:20:50.748
Have you forgotten?

319
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.875
You said we can do it and we should try.

320
00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:55.086
You said it wasn't late,
we had a high five

321
00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.671
and got all excited.

322
00:20:56.754 --> 00:20:58.589
We even pinky swore.

323
00:20:58.673 --> 00:21:00.299
You're a mother.

324
00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:02.760
Are you going to ignore your daughter

325
00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:05.430
who's waiting for a sibling?

326
00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:06.889
Huh? Is that it?

327
00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:11.227
It's for Minseo.

328
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.395
Of course.

329
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.189
- Stay still.
- It's not easy to untie it.

330
00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:16.399
There's a way.

331
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.068
Mom.

332
00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:21.571
Boseok dumped me.

333
00:21:24.949 --> 00:21:26.951
I'm not going to play
with Boseok anymore.

334
00:21:27.034 --> 00:21:28.828
I'm not going to buy him corn dogs.

335
00:21:28.911 --> 00:21:32.081
I'm never going to tell him
even if he has something in his teeth.

336
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.125
Boseok's going to regret it so much.

337
00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:36.085
Yes. He's definitely going to regret it.

338
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:39.505
I'm going to stab him so much
in the play practice.

339
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.800
I'm going to avenge. He's so dead.

340
00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.802
Minseo.

341
00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:47.847
To take revenge,
you must stay in good condition.

342
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:48.931
You must go to sleep.

343
00:21:49.015 --> 00:21:50.433
Let's sleep just for an hour.

344
00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:52.685
Let's go, Minseo.

345
00:21:52.768 --> 00:21:55.021
No. I'm sleeping here.

346
00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:05.364
I like it here.

347
00:22:07.825 --> 00:22:09.994
Then should Mom and Dad
sleep in your room?

348
00:22:13.956 --> 00:22:15.291
Give me a hug.

349
00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:26.177
Boseok is an idiot.

350
00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:31.307
- Boseok is a real idiot.
- He's an idiot.

351
00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:48.950
Hello.

352
00:23:13.724 --> 00:23:14.725
Minseo.

353
00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:25.152
Minseo.

354
00:23:25.236 --> 00:23:26.862
Make sure to stick to the script

355
00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:28.864
when you practice the play.

356
00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:30.408
It's okay to make ad-lib.

357
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:32.577
Hitting Boseok isn't ad-lib.

358
00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:35.121
Minseo.

359
00:23:35.204 --> 00:23:37.623
A true actor never takes

360
00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:39.625
the stage personally.

361
00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:40.710
Understood?

362
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.754
Have a good day.

363
00:23:43.838 --> 00:23:45.172
Minseo. Say bye before you go.

364
00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:46.924
Bye.

365
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.305
Honey.

366
00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:54.682
- What?
- Let's send her to Dad's tonight.

367
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:57.977
- Why?
- We couldn't do it last night.

368
00:23:58.853 --> 00:24:01.981
We must prevent all interruptions
in advance.

369
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.650
I haven't decided it yet.

370
00:24:05.484 --> 00:24:09.363
I know we called a truce
and made a promise,

371
00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:11.282
I don't want to do it like homework.

372
00:24:11.782 --> 00:24:12.992
We're not animals.

373
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:18.497
Do it.

374
00:24:18.581 --> 00:24:20.124
We must do it!

375
00:24:20.207 --> 00:24:21.417
Let's do it. We're doing it!

376
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.627
What are you saying?

377
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.920
What am I saying?

378
00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:26.714
Let's do it!

379
00:24:26.797 --> 00:24:28.341
Are you crazy?

380
00:24:30.092 --> 00:24:31.093
Yes, I'm crazy.

381
00:24:31.177 --> 00:24:34.096
So what? I'm an animal.

382
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.222
First it's Chief Oh,

383
00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:36.390
then it's my daughter,

384
00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:38.351
there's something every day!

385
00:24:38.434 --> 00:24:40.770
Then when do I get to do it?

386
00:24:40.853 --> 00:24:43.356
What's the problem?
Am I not strong enough? Too weak?

387
00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:44.440
Watch.

388
00:24:49.987 --> 00:24:51.656
I can even clap twice.

389
00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:53.532
I can do it.

390
00:24:53.616 --> 00:24:54.992
I'm full of energy.

391
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:56.369
I'm all set.

392
00:24:56.869 --> 00:24:58.537
Do you have any plans?

393
00:24:58.621 --> 00:25:00.081
I have to go to the café.

394
00:25:00.164 --> 00:25:01.582
Right? I have to go to work too.

395
00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:04.210
In fact, I'm late.
Then tonight is the only option.

396
00:25:04.835 --> 00:25:06.545
Get home early, got it?

397
00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.047
Answer me!

398
00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:10.299
- Okay.
- Good.

399
00:25:11.217 --> 00:25:12.343
You can go now.

400
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.391
Oh!

401
00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:21.519
Get home early.

402
00:25:29.402 --> 00:25:30.611
Whoa.

403
00:25:33.906 --> 00:25:34.907
Phew.

404
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:38.035
When Minseo's off school today,
pick her up

405
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.870
and make her sleep at Dad's house.

406
00:25:39.954 --> 00:25:41.747
Watch Minseo tonight.

407
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.541
Understood?

408
00:25:44.208 --> 00:25:46.919
It's 300 dollars for food and bed.

409
00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:48.838
Happy?

410
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:50.214
I'm hanging up.

411
00:25:53.217 --> 00:25:54.635
Wow.

412
00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.346
Bossing around with some money.

413
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.806
Darn you, Kwon Dohoon.

414
00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:02.143
The postnatal center Yura booked
for me is nice,

415
00:26:02.226 --> 00:26:05.020
but the one you mentioned

416
00:26:05.104 --> 00:26:06.397
was my dream.

417
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.691
Thank you so much, Chief Oh.

418
00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:14.530
Bye, Chief.

419
00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:15.990
Thank you.

420
00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:28.544
What's wrong with you?

421
00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:31.005
Remember the postnatal center
I wanted to go to?

422
00:26:31.088 --> 00:26:32.840
- That's as good as a hotel?
- Yes.

423
00:26:32.923 --> 00:26:35.968
Chief Oh's friend is running it.

424
00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:38.846
I'm going there.

425
00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:39.930
Really?

426
00:26:41.056 --> 00:26:42.099
That place is expensive.

427
00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:44.059
You know what's more amazing?

428
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.150
You're getting a job.

429
00:26:51.233 --> 00:26:53.569
She said she'll set up an interview

430
00:26:53.652 --> 00:26:55.196
at her friend's company.

431
00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.864
Isn't that great?

432
00:26:58.073 --> 00:26:59.283
What is it?

433
00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:00.367
What's that face?

434
00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:04.622
I mean, you're going to enjoy
your time in a hotel,

435
00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:06.665
but I have to work my butt off.

436
00:27:06.749 --> 00:27:08.000
Am I going there for fun?

437
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:12.213
I'm going there to take care
of my body after giving birth.

438
00:27:12.296 --> 00:27:14.924
Besides, you always said
you wanted a job.

439
00:27:15.007 --> 00:27:18.219
What I meant was I didn't want
to get treated as some bum,

440
00:27:18.302 --> 00:27:20.721
I didn't mean I wanted to work, Mirim.

441
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.306
Don't ruin this for me.

442
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:23.766
By the way,

443
00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:25.351
if you change the postnatal center,

444
00:27:25.434 --> 00:27:27.394
Yura will be disappointed.

445
00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:29.855
The place she booked is
the fanciest in town.

446
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:31.899
She made a hard decision.

447
00:27:31.982 --> 00:27:34.527
She'll be happy to save money.

448
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.571
Gosh, you're so naive.

449
00:27:38.572 --> 00:27:39.573
You think so?

450
00:27:41.617 --> 00:27:44.203
No, Yura will be very disappointed.

451
00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:46.872
I'm going to post so many photos.

452
00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:50.543
Jihoon. You know Heeju, right?

453
00:27:50.626 --> 00:27:52.503
- I don't care.
- She always looked down on me

454
00:27:52.586 --> 00:27:54.421
because her husband's family is rich.

455
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:57.675
When she finds out I'm going to
a better postnatal center than her...

456
00:27:57.758 --> 00:27:59.802
Gosh, it's awesome!

457
00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:03.055
Are you happy too, Bboongbboong?

458
00:28:03.138 --> 00:28:04.139
Yes?

459
00:28:05.182 --> 00:28:08.477
Is there really nothing
between Dohoon and Chief Oh?

460
00:28:08.561 --> 00:28:10.396
Stop. Yura is here.

461
00:28:10.479 --> 00:28:12.898
I mean, why would she
care about us?

462
00:28:13.816 --> 00:28:16.110
Is Dohoon having an affair with...

463
00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:18.112
Hi, Yura.

464
00:28:19.488 --> 00:28:21.115
You were talking about Chief?

465
00:28:21.782 --> 00:28:23.033
Oh, yes.

466
00:28:23.117 --> 00:28:25.703
That we should sell everything
she gave us yesterday.

467
00:28:25.786 --> 00:28:26.787
Oh.

468
00:28:32.668 --> 00:28:33.919
Watch your mouth.

469
00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:35.921
You should've told me faster.

470
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.931
Bang! Bang!

471
00:29:27.014 --> 00:29:29.183
Teach me. Is it here?

472
00:29:33.562 --> 00:29:34.897
Another one.

473
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.816
I'll make fried eggs
for Dohoon and Minseo.

474
00:29:38.984 --> 00:29:39.985
Okay.

475
00:29:45.449 --> 00:29:49.244
Dohoon doesn't eat <i>ramyeon</i>
without a fried egg.

476
00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:52.623
He just needs one.

477
00:29:52.706 --> 00:29:54.458
One for myself too.

478
00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:56.502
It was pretty good when I tried it.

479
00:30:01.507 --> 00:30:03.425
It breaks easily.

480
00:30:25.364 --> 00:30:26.365
CAFFÈ LATTE

481
00:30:27.783 --> 00:30:28.784
PAY

482
00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:48.220
BAE YOUNGDAE

483
00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:57.479
BAE YOUNGDAE

484
00:31:28.927 --> 00:31:30.679
Singapore? Says who?

485
00:31:33.098 --> 00:31:34.308
You've lost it.

486
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:36.894
Switzerland is still the best.

487
00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:38.062
Singapore is troublesome.

488
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.607
Don't worry.

489
00:31:42.107 --> 00:31:43.484
Just follow my order.

490
00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:46.028
<i>Prepare half in US dollars.</i>

491
00:31:46.111 --> 00:31:47.780
<i>You know the private banking account?</i>

492
00:31:47.863 --> 00:31:49.198
<i>Take good care of it.</i>

493
00:31:49.615 --> 00:31:52.117
<i>It must be completed this week.</i>

494
00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:55.746
Die.

495
00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:57.581
Die.

496
00:31:57.664 --> 00:31:59.458
Wait.

497
00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:02.336
Stop. Stop it.

498
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.130
Is it because I said no?

499
00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:06.924
No. Not at all.

500
00:32:07.007 --> 00:32:10.094
Then how come you never lose
when you're a villain?

501
00:32:10.177 --> 00:32:11.845
Villains can win too.

502
00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.639
You have to beat me.

503
00:32:13.722 --> 00:32:15.099
I can't throw a game.

504
00:32:15.182 --> 00:32:16.517
You must die,

505
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.228
so we can say justice is alive.

506
00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:21.730
I'm going to kill you and become good.

507
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:24.983
Then we can say the villain's reformed.

508
00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:26.443
Whatever.

509
00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:28.278
Anyway, you have to die.

510
00:32:28.737 --> 00:32:31.740
If you don't follow the script,
I'm telling the teacher.

511
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:33.784
A tattletale hero?

512
00:32:34.993 --> 00:32:37.579
You really have to die.

513
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:43.877
Minseo.

514
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:52.469
Minseo.

515
00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:54.012
Minseo.

516
00:32:54.763 --> 00:32:56.181
Minseo. Are you okay?

517
00:32:56.932 --> 00:32:58.809
I'll save you, Minseo.

518
00:33:15.492 --> 00:33:16.493
Minseo.

519
00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:23.000
Kwon Minseo.

520
00:33:26.461 --> 00:33:29.131
You shouldn't have practiced without me.

521
00:33:29.214 --> 00:33:30.549
You told me to practice

522
00:33:30.632 --> 00:33:33.135
even in my dreams to immerse in my role.

523
00:33:33.677 --> 00:33:35.095
In school,

524
00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.598
you should only practice
when I'm in sight, okay?

525
00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:39.975
Then can I practice in math class?

526
00:33:40.392 --> 00:33:43.687
I can't stay focused in math.

527
00:33:44.897 --> 00:33:47.482
Stay after school.

528
00:33:47.566 --> 00:33:49.568
I'll give you a special lesson.

529
00:33:49.651 --> 00:33:52.196
I want to do that,

530
00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:54.656
but a villain shouldn't listen
to her teacher.

531
00:33:55.365 --> 00:33:57.784
You never stop talking back.

532
00:33:57.868 --> 00:33:58.952
You seem fine.

533
00:34:02.956 --> 00:34:04.917
Let me check your stomach.
You said it hurt.

534
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.043
No.

535
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.961
Why not?

536
00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.046
Show her.

537
00:34:09.421 --> 00:34:12.716
No. It's embarrassing.

538
00:34:13.884 --> 00:34:15.886
I'm your teacher. Don't be shy.

539
00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:24.061
You have to leave.

540
00:34:24.144 --> 00:34:26.146
Why are you watching? It's embarrassing.

541
00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:40.327
Thank you.

542
00:34:40.994 --> 00:34:42.829
The troublemakers all look the same.

543
00:34:42.913 --> 00:34:44.373
They look just like Minseo.

544
00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:47.251
Minseo isn't like that.

545
00:34:48.835 --> 00:34:50.587
She's very cheerful,

546
00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:51.964
assertive,

547
00:34:52.047 --> 00:34:54.049
innocent and good.

548
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:57.219
Other teachers tell me

549
00:34:57.302 --> 00:34:59.513
awards work the best for troublemakers.

550
00:34:59.596 --> 00:35:01.807
When they receive an award, they change

551
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:02.975
and become obedient.

552
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:08.647
An award is the cure?

553
00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:13.819
How can I award her?

554
00:35:14.903 --> 00:35:15.904
Oh.

555
00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:23.412
Hurry up.

556
00:35:23.495 --> 00:35:24.746
You're doing great.

557
00:35:26.164 --> 00:35:27.165
Keep kicking.

558
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:32.129
I'm right here.

559
00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:42.139
Minseo.

560
00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:44.933
Do you like him?

561
00:35:45.684 --> 00:35:46.935
No, I don't.

562
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.186
Really?

563
00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:51.773
- Shoot.
- He scored.

564
00:35:57.112 --> 00:36:00.490
Then why are you standing here
for half an hour like you're glued?

565
00:36:00.574 --> 00:36:02.701
Spicy rice cake is waiting
for you at home.

566
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.412
I said no.

567
00:36:07.247 --> 00:36:09.291
Do you want me
to make him like you?

568
00:36:09.374 --> 00:36:11.043
How?

569
00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:12.169
Minseo.

570
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:15.339
I'm your uncle.

571
00:36:16.089 --> 00:36:17.090
I'm not like your dad.

572
00:36:17.716 --> 00:36:20.385
You finally need a lesson on love.

573
00:36:21.553 --> 00:36:22.846
Trust me.

574
00:36:22.929 --> 00:36:24.639
I'll help you.

575
00:36:33.857 --> 00:36:36.526
This is so nice.

576
00:36:39.905 --> 00:36:42.783
It's lovely.
We should've came here sooner.

577
00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:44.242
Let's take a photo.

578
00:36:44.951 --> 00:36:46.203
I'll hold it.

579
00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:51.958
Look at the camera.

580
00:36:58.924 --> 00:37:02.677
<i>Though I don't have anything</i>

581
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:06.765
<i>But our love is true</i>

582
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.772
<i>All my love is yours
until the sun goes down...</i>

583
00:37:13.855 --> 00:37:15.190
What's this?

584
00:37:15.273 --> 00:37:16.316
Open it.

585
00:37:17.984 --> 00:37:19.361
TICKETS TO QINGDAO AND HOTEL STAY

586
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:22.531
- What is...
- You wanted to go on a trip

587
00:37:22.614 --> 00:37:23.907
for your 80th birthday.

588
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.450
It's not even an European cruise.

589
00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:26.618
It's only Qingdao.

590
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:28.203
Have fun.

591
00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:30.664
This is too much.

592
00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:32.749
You should go.

593
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.461
Thank you.

594
00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:41.341
TICKETS TO QINGDAO AND HOTEL STAY

595
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.511
Ms. Park.

596
00:37:45.637 --> 00:37:47.973
Do you want to go to Qingdao
with me for beer?

597
00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:52.853
We can also take a look around
while we're there.

598
00:37:52.936 --> 00:37:54.396
If you're going,

599
00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:56.773
the flight and the hotel room's on me.

600
00:38:00.944 --> 00:38:03.155
For our first trip.

601
00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.283
Cheers.

602
00:38:18.837 --> 00:38:22.299
<i>Let's wear
matching clothes to Qingdao.</i>

603
00:38:24.134 --> 00:38:26.136
- I like the blue one.
- Huh?

604
00:38:27.804 --> 00:38:30.765
You should wear that
for the family trip.

605
00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:32.392
Huh?

606
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:35.353
A family trip for your 80th birthday.

607
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.689
A family trip?

608
00:38:38.607 --> 00:38:40.817
What about Gangneung?

609
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:45.113
A photo in the blue sea in blue clothes.

610
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.699
Isn't that exciting?

611
00:38:47.782 --> 00:38:50.535
It's too blue. It's not a good idea.

612
00:38:52.162 --> 00:38:53.747
Then what about Jeju Island?

613
00:38:54.247 --> 00:38:57.334
We had so much fun in Jeju Island
for your 70th birthday.

614
00:38:57.417 --> 00:38:59.961
It'll be more fun with Mirim.

615
00:39:00.754 --> 00:39:03.465
I'm afraid of going on a plane.

616
00:39:04.382 --> 00:39:06.801
A big chunk of iron flying.

617
00:39:06.885 --> 00:39:08.136
Isn't that weird?

618
00:39:08.428 --> 00:39:09.513
Oh...

619
00:39:10.847 --> 00:39:12.057
Okay, Father.

620
00:39:13.058 --> 00:39:14.893
I'll keep that in mind. Don't worry.

621
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:19.189
I'll make sure to find the place

622
00:39:19.272 --> 00:39:21.274
you like.

623
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:23.568
Speaking of which,

624
00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:25.946
it's not about where we go.

625
00:39:26.029 --> 00:39:28.782
We have more people,
and the economy's not so good.

626
00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:31.535
Why don't we just skip my 80th birthday?

627
00:39:31.618 --> 00:39:32.953
Here too.

628
00:39:33.036 --> 00:39:36.331
You barely sell 100,000 won a day.

629
00:39:37.332 --> 00:39:40.001
On a busy day,

630
00:39:40.085 --> 00:39:43.755
it's up to 300,000.

631
00:39:43.838 --> 00:39:46.299
You should save up, Yura.

632
00:39:47.092 --> 00:39:50.136
You might think you can make money
forever when you're young,

633
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.429
but that's never the case.

634
00:39:51.513 --> 00:39:52.597
You must save up.

635
00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.559
CHIEF OH

636
00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:58.937
No family trip

637
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.564
until you sell a million won a day.

638
00:40:00.647 --> 00:40:01.648
No trip.

639
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.068
What's Chief Oh's business?

640
00:40:05.151 --> 00:40:06.945
Why would she call Father?

641
00:40:10.782 --> 00:40:11.783
Hello?

642
00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:15.287
<i>Hello? Mr. Kwon? It's me.</i>

643
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.621
<i>It's Oh Chunryun.</i>

644
00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:19.291
What's wrong with this?

645
00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:21.418
Hello...

646
00:40:22.127 --> 00:40:23.211
Dang it.

647
00:40:28.842 --> 00:40:29.926
Father, can you hear me?

648
00:40:30.468 --> 00:40:31.469
Yes.

649
00:40:32.804 --> 00:40:35.890
I reserved the highest hotel in Qingdao.

650
00:40:35.974 --> 00:40:38.560
I was wondering
if you have a fear of heights.

651
00:40:38.643 --> 00:40:40.437
I was worried.

652
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.564
Of course.

653
00:40:42.647 --> 00:40:45.025
Yes.

654
00:40:50.655 --> 00:40:51.781
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

655
00:40:51.865 --> 00:40:53.241
Bye.

656
00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.212
It's my mother's birthday

657
00:41:06.296 --> 00:41:08.089
this month.

658
00:41:08.173 --> 00:41:10.008
She wants a designer-brand purse.

659
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.635
How old is she?

660
00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:13.762
Fifty...

661
00:41:14.512 --> 00:41:15.513
Fifty eight.

662
00:41:16.514 --> 00:41:18.099
Keep that in mind,

663
00:41:18.183 --> 00:41:21.603
and tell me again on her 80th birthday
22 years later.

664
00:41:21.686 --> 00:41:23.063
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

665
00:41:36.618 --> 00:41:37.619
Yes.

666
00:41:37.702 --> 00:41:40.914
<i>The disguised
delivery man, his name is Min Junki.</i>

667
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.794
IDENTIFICATION
MIN JUNKI

668
00:41:47.921 --> 00:41:50.006
- Okay.
<i>- Age 32.</i>

669
00:41:50.757 --> 00:41:52.550
<i>He used to run a casino in Russia.</i>

670
00:41:52.634 --> 00:41:54.719
<i>He closed it
and returned to Korea last year.</i>

671
00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:56.846
He probably didn't return alone.

672
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.933
Keep your eye on anyone related.

673
00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:01.017
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

674
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:19.619
He siphoned classified document...

675
00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.787
PROOF OF EMPLOYMENT

676
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.957
created an SPC with Ilsin Group

677
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.501
and got an illegal loan
of 4 trillion won.

678
00:42:26.584 --> 00:42:28.920
SUICIDE-ACCIDENT

679
00:42:29.003 --> 00:42:31.548
<i>Where are you?
I'll meet you there.</i>

680
00:42:48.273 --> 00:42:49.691
- Are you here for groceries?
- Yes.

681
00:42:49.774 --> 00:42:51.025
How's your father?

682
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:52.902
Hello.

683
00:42:52.986 --> 00:42:54.028
Oh, hello.

684
00:43:08.793 --> 00:43:09.794
TENNIS PRACTICE

685
00:43:55.715 --> 00:43:58.635
My café is this slow?

686
00:44:00.845 --> 00:44:03.097
I can't complete Father's mission
with this.

687
00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:05.350
How am I supposed to sell
a million won a day?

688
00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:06.434
A million?

689
00:44:08.102 --> 00:44:09.103
Ah...

690
00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:17.695
<i>I got off work.</i>

691
00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:19.197
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

692
00:44:25.995 --> 00:44:27.080
Hello.

693
00:44:27.163 --> 00:44:28.289
Excuse me.

694
00:44:29.749 --> 00:44:31.209
Restroom?

695
00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:34.337
I'd like to place an order

696
00:44:34.712 --> 00:44:36.506
for an event in two days.

697
00:44:37.173 --> 00:44:38.842
- For an event?
- Yes.

698
00:44:39.717 --> 00:44:40.718
Yes!

699
00:44:41.302 --> 00:44:42.554
Have a seat.

700
00:44:45.723 --> 00:44:47.767
I miss you too.

701
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:50.520
Daddy loves you so much.

702
00:44:52.146 --> 00:44:53.523
You want to come home?

703
00:44:53.606 --> 00:44:55.817
No, no, no.

704
00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.861
You can't do that.

705
00:44:57.944 --> 00:44:59.529
You must sleep at Grandpa's tonight.

706
00:44:59.612 --> 00:45:01.072
Or Grandpa will be very sad.

707
00:45:01.155 --> 00:45:04.200
You're his cutie.

708
00:45:04.284 --> 00:45:06.828
So you have to sleep
at Grandpa's tonight, okay?

709
00:45:06.911 --> 00:45:09.497
Pinky swear, promise,

710
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:10.874
one more time.

711
00:45:10.957 --> 00:45:13.835
Sweet dreams.

712
00:45:13.918 --> 00:45:15.044
I'll see you tomorrow.

713
00:45:15.128 --> 00:45:16.254
Bye.

714
00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:22.093
Minseo's done.

715
00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:24.345
Let me see.

716
00:45:26.973 --> 00:45:29.767
I look hotter than usual.

717
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.769
Good. Satisfied.

718
00:45:36.858 --> 00:45:38.693
Honey.

719
00:45:40.153 --> 00:45:42.071
What's going on?

720
00:45:42.947 --> 00:45:44.741
It's the support snack

721
00:45:44.824 --> 00:45:47.160
for handsome Cha Eunwoo.

722
00:45:47.243 --> 00:45:48.786
You know Cha Eunwoo the actor?

723
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:49.871
No.

724
00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:53.875
It's 20,000 won per person
for 80 people. It's 1.6 million.

725
00:45:53.958 --> 00:45:55.168
He paid up on the spot.

726
00:45:55.251 --> 00:45:57.337
It's the biggest sales
since I opened the café.

727
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.922
Try it when it's still hot.

728
00:46:01.799 --> 00:46:03.134
- How is it?
- Good.

729
00:46:03.217 --> 00:46:04.302
Let's go home.

730
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:06.930
- Is it really good?
- Yes, it is.

731
00:46:07.013 --> 00:46:09.223
It's darn good. It's freaking good.

732
00:46:09.307 --> 00:46:10.725
It's awesome.

733
00:46:10.808 --> 00:46:12.268
Why are you so upset?

734
00:46:12.352 --> 00:46:14.312
Do you really have to do this now?

735
00:46:14.395 --> 00:46:16.230
It's an important day today.

736
00:46:16.314 --> 00:46:19.359
Why did you get such a big order
in the first place? It's tiring.

737
00:46:20.443 --> 00:46:23.696
Father said he won't go on
a family trip because of money.

738
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.324
He was worried about money?

739
00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:27.659
I doubt it.

740
00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:29.744
Oh, right.

741
00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:36.376
Hi, I sent the money for the RV.

742
00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:37.752
I just wanted to check.

743
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.963
It's Kang Yura.

744
00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:41.714
For 3 days with 2 options.

745
00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.549
Yes. For 1.1 million.

746
00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:45.343
We can pick it up.

747
00:46:46.177 --> 00:46:47.178
Yes.

748
00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:52.308
If you make 1.6 million
and spend 1.1 million,

749
00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:54.185
what's left after paying
for this and that?

750
00:46:54.268 --> 00:46:56.688
- What do you get from it?
- Our family trip.

751
00:47:02.568 --> 00:47:05.029
Stay here, I'll clean it up. You rest.

752
00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:07.198
- Let's do it together.
- No.

753
00:47:07.281 --> 00:47:08.366
You'll get all tired

754
00:47:08.449 --> 00:47:10.284
and pass out at home. Just rest.

755
00:47:10.368 --> 00:47:11.619
Don't move. Stay still!

756
00:47:11.703 --> 00:47:14.831
Let's clean it up together,
so we can get home quick and do it.

757
00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:17.041
Get home quick and do it?

758
00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:19.961
Get home quick, and do it?

759
00:47:20.044 --> 00:47:22.046
Okay. Let's clean up fast. Be quick.

760
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.548
What do I put away? Everything?

761
00:47:23.631 --> 00:47:26.009
- Plates first.
- Why do I have only two hands?

762
00:47:26.092 --> 00:47:27.343
- Seriously.
- Okay.

763
00:47:30.138 --> 00:47:32.223
The door's open!

764
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.352
Hurry up.

765
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:39.522
Keep it down.

766
00:47:39.605 --> 00:47:42.150
It's open!

767
00:47:44.444 --> 00:47:46.529
It's my happy, loving,

768
00:47:46.612 --> 00:47:49.615
home sweet home!

769
00:47:49.699 --> 00:47:52.118
Oh, my.

770
00:47:56.956 --> 00:47:58.458
What are you doing here?

771
00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.294
Our whole neighborhood is

772
00:48:01.377 --> 00:48:02.920
out of water until tomorrow.

773
00:48:03.588 --> 00:48:04.797
My TV broke.

774
00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.842
Dohoon. You know the game
against Japan is on tonight?

775
00:48:07.925 --> 00:48:10.762
Go, Korea!

776
00:48:10.845 --> 00:48:12.889
Go, Korea!

777
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.476
Why, for goodness' sake!

778
00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:18.436
There's a sauna in front of Dad's house.

779
00:48:18.519 --> 00:48:19.937
You can shower there

780
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:24.400
and shout "Go, Korea"!

781
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.863
Dad. Mom.

782
00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:31.491
I'm getting an award.

783
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.951
Why? Oh, my. Why?

784
00:48:35.036 --> 00:48:36.329
Why?

785
00:48:36.412 --> 00:48:37.413
Why on earth?

786
00:48:37.497 --> 00:48:38.706
I don't know.

787
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.125
If you're curious,
come to the award presentation.

788
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:42.210
It's this Thursday.

789
00:48:42.293 --> 00:48:44.128
It must be true.

790
00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:48.800
Yay. We're all sleeping
together tonight, okay?

791
00:48:53.429 --> 00:48:54.555
Good girl.

792
00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:24.210
Dad.

793
00:49:45.356 --> 00:49:46.899
Yura. What are you eating alone?

794
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.362
You scared me.

795
00:49:51.445 --> 00:49:52.446
What's this?

796
00:49:54.323 --> 00:49:56.450
When Dohoon went on a business trip,

797
00:49:56.534 --> 00:49:57.785
he got me one for my skin.

798
00:49:58.286 --> 00:50:01.664
No wonder your skin was so firm.

799
00:50:01.747 --> 00:50:04.000
- Really?
- Dohoon is amazing.

800
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:06.127
Bringing gifts for his wife

801
00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.462
all the way from abroad.

802
00:50:09.755 --> 00:50:10.923
Huh? Well...

803
00:50:15.636 --> 00:50:16.637
I'll be generous.

804
00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:17.722
Take these.

805
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:19.807
It's an odd number.

806
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:21.350
- Make it even.
- But it's mine.

807
00:50:21.434 --> 00:50:22.560
Three more will do.

808
00:50:27.899 --> 00:50:31.277
So is Uncle Jihoon and Aunt Mirim
coming to the award presentation?

809
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.406
Yes. They can go
on behalf of your parents.

810
00:50:35.489 --> 00:50:36.490
Us?

811
00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:39.368
What else are you going to do at home?

812
00:50:39.452 --> 00:50:41.746
You might as well support your niece.

813
00:50:42.538 --> 00:50:43.956
Hmm.

814
00:50:45.249 --> 00:50:46.751
But I have a plan that day.

815
00:50:47.585 --> 00:50:49.754
- You have an interview.
- Yes.

816
00:50:50.838 --> 00:50:52.965
An interview? Oh.

817
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:55.593
You weren't so sure
but you passed the application?

818
00:50:55.676 --> 00:50:57.678
I didn't make it there as I expected.

819
00:50:57.762 --> 00:50:59.013
Someone set it up for me.

820
00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:00.348
Who?

821
00:51:02.433 --> 00:51:06.312
Someone I happen to know by chance.

822
00:51:10.775 --> 00:51:12.735
I reserved an RV.

823
00:51:12.818 --> 00:51:15.863
A family trip to celebrate
Father's 80th birthday.

824
00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:18.783
Everyone's coming
including Mirim and Bboongbboong.

825
00:51:18.866 --> 00:51:20.743
- What?
- I knew

826
00:51:20.826 --> 00:51:21.827
you were a big spender.

827
00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:24.580
Really? Did you really reserve it?

828
00:51:25.456 --> 00:51:28.417
You should've asked me
and the family first

829
00:51:28.501 --> 00:51:30.169
and had voting.

830
00:51:31.045 --> 00:51:32.505
This is crazy.

831
00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:36.133
Father, are you mad?

832
00:51:38.886 --> 00:51:40.513
Father...

833
00:51:53.484 --> 00:51:55.403
<i>Does it match well with Qingdao?</i>

834
00:51:55.486 --> 00:51:58.197
<i>I already packed all my stuff.</i>

835
00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.534
I'm very excited too.

836
00:52:04.453 --> 00:52:06.831
<i>Don't change
the postnatal center.</i>

837
00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:09.125
<i>If Yura gets upset, no one can stop her.</i>

838
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.919
<i>I decide
where Bboongbboong and I will go.</i>

839
00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:13.296
<i>Mind your own interview.</i>

840
00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:16.299
<i>Do you want to go instead?</i>

841
00:52:16.382 --> 00:52:17.508
<i>You'll do better than me.</i>

842
00:52:19.343 --> 00:52:21.429
<i>Talk about Chief Oh
during the interview,</i>

843
00:52:21.512 --> 00:52:23.264
<i>and show off your connection, okay?</i>

844
00:52:29.228 --> 00:52:31.939
<i>I'm booking
a hotel room on Thursday.</i>

845
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:36.027
<i>A hotel room?</i>

846
00:52:42.199 --> 00:52:43.868
<i>I can't draw back anymore.</i>

847
00:52:45.244 --> 00:52:46.495
<i>Okay.</i>

848
00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:47.580
Boseok!

849
00:52:48.998 --> 00:52:51.042
Boseok.

850
00:52:51.125 --> 00:52:53.961
Boseok.

851
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:04.138
<i>- Make sure you get the job.
- What should I wear that day?</i>

852
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:05.723
<i>Finally.</i>

853
00:53:05.806 --> 00:53:06.849
<i>Dream of me.</i>

854
00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:24.825
Hello?

855
00:53:24.909 --> 00:53:26.535
<i>Hello I'm calling from</i>

856
00:53:26.619 --> 00:53:28.579
<i>the postnatal center
regarding the refund,</i>

857
00:53:28.662 --> 00:53:31.248
<i>and to inform you
about the cancellation fees.</i>

858
00:53:31.332 --> 00:53:33.626
Cancel? I never canceled it.

859
00:53:34.752 --> 00:53:37.171
<i>Ms. Lee Mirim canceled it herself.</i>

860
00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:40.299
Yura.

861
00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:43.219
Why don't you add
more varieties of pastries?

862
00:53:43.302 --> 00:53:45.971
I'm starting to crave new flavors.

863
00:53:46.722 --> 00:53:49.183
Let me find out and call you back.

864
00:53:49.266 --> 00:53:50.267
Bye.

865
00:53:51.936 --> 00:53:53.437
- Mirim.
- Yes.

866
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:55.481
Did you cancel the postnatal center?

867
00:54:01.779 --> 00:54:03.656
I can explain.

868
00:54:03.739 --> 00:54:06.742
Chief Oh put me
in a real awkward position.

869
00:54:06.826 --> 00:54:08.202
It would look weird

870
00:54:08.285 --> 00:54:10.871
if we say yes to the job
but no to the postnatal care.

871
00:54:10.955 --> 00:54:14.166
You either take it or leave it.

872
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.294
But I have to get Jihoon a job.

873
00:54:17.378 --> 00:54:20.047
Right. I hope things work out for him.

874
00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:23.050
It's my first delivery.

875
00:54:23.134 --> 00:54:26.095
If I get to stay in the postnatal center
I've always wanted,

876
00:54:26.178 --> 00:54:29.140
both Bboongbboong and I will be happier.

877
00:54:29.223 --> 00:54:30.933
Would that be okay, Yura?

878
00:54:32.059 --> 00:54:35.771
If you think you'll be happier there,

879
00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:37.231
go ahead.

880
00:54:37.314 --> 00:54:39.400
I'll pay for the penalty.

881
00:54:39.483 --> 00:54:41.068
I'll pay for it.

882
00:54:41.152 --> 00:54:43.404
Treat yourself with that money.

883
00:54:47.575 --> 00:54:50.953
This is why Father and Jihoon
always praise you.

884
00:54:51.036 --> 00:54:52.997
Yura. Yura.

885
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:57.793
Can I try this?

886
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:03.007
You know, Chief Oh

887
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.675
didn't make a good first impression

888
00:55:04.758 --> 00:55:06.260
but she seems like a nice person.

889
00:55:06.969 --> 00:55:08.053
Oh, yes.

890
00:55:10.973 --> 00:55:12.933
By the way,

891
00:55:13.017 --> 00:55:14.894
why is she so nice to our family?

892
00:55:18.147 --> 00:55:19.982
- Yura. Let's get sweet potatoes.
- Okay.

893
00:55:20.065 --> 00:55:21.984
Sweet potatoes.

894
00:55:22.693 --> 00:55:25.446
This looks so delicious!

895
00:55:34.788 --> 00:55:37.249
<i>B104. Routine checked.</i>

896
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.918
<i>I attached the data.</i>

897
00:55:46.884 --> 00:55:48.344
STAR CHA
CHA EUNWOO

898
00:55:48.427 --> 00:55:52.139
MY FAVORITE IS CHA EUNWOO

899
00:56:06.487 --> 00:56:09.114
I was upset when you said
you'll give up on the trip

900
00:56:09.198 --> 00:56:10.491
because of money.

901
00:56:11.575 --> 00:56:13.994
I should've asked you first.

902
00:56:14.078 --> 00:56:15.412
I'm sorry, Father.

903
00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.582
Well, the truth is...

904
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:21.252
Yura...

905
00:56:22.628 --> 00:56:24.463
The truth is,

906
00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.382
- Chief Oh...
- What?

907
00:56:27.258 --> 00:56:30.511
She sent me tickets to Qingdao
without asking.

908
00:56:31.011 --> 00:56:33.013
I was going to return them back to her,

909
00:56:33.097 --> 00:56:36.058
but she was so firm about it.

910
00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.562
I see.

911
00:56:39.645 --> 00:56:42.648
I don't feel comfortable going anyway.

912
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:45.234
I won't go if you say no.

913
00:56:45.317 --> 00:56:48.988
I prefer traveling with my family.

914
00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:51.532
So, what do you say?

915
00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:57.246
I don't want to be petty.

916
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.834
You should go, Father.

917
00:57:05.087 --> 00:57:07.131
Shall we wrap it up?

918
00:57:30.863 --> 00:57:31.905
By the way,

919
00:57:31.989 --> 00:57:36.285
why is Chief Oh so nice to our family?

920
00:58:23.707 --> 00:58:27.086
It would've cost way more
in other places.

921
00:58:27.169 --> 00:58:28.295
Thank you.

922
00:58:28.379 --> 00:58:29.963
Next time you come again

923
00:58:30.047 --> 00:58:31.632
I'll make them even better.

924
00:58:32.841 --> 00:58:35.427
No wonder Oh Chunryun recommended you.

925
00:58:37.054 --> 00:58:38.263
Oh Chunryun?

926
00:58:38.347 --> 00:58:39.848
She said you're her close friend.

927
00:58:40.724 --> 00:58:42.142
Didn't you know?

928
00:58:42.226 --> 00:58:43.686
She told me about this place.

929
00:58:46.146 --> 00:58:48.565
Chief Oh. Right.

930
00:59:40.909 --> 00:59:41.994
Oh.

931
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.175
Congratulations, Minseo.

932
00:59:56.258 --> 00:59:58.802
Such a creative child.

933
00:59:58.886 --> 01:00:02.139
It's all thanks to you, Mom.

934
01:00:03.307 --> 01:00:05.434
I should have been there for you.

935
01:00:05.517 --> 01:00:09.021
Sorry. I had a group order.

936
01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:10.481
I had so much work today.

937
01:00:10.564 --> 01:00:12.024
It's okay.

938
01:00:12.107 --> 01:00:15.402
As long as you don't spend
that money on my private tuitions.

939
01:00:16.111 --> 01:00:17.613
Really?

940
01:00:17.696 --> 01:00:19.615
You said math was hard,

941
01:00:19.698 --> 01:00:21.492
so I was thinking of a math institute.

942
01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:23.035
I'll talk to you later.

943
01:00:23.118 --> 01:00:25.078
I have to tell Dad too.

944
01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:30.834
She's cute.

945
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.463
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

946
01:01:59.172 --> 01:02:00.799
<i>I'll be there early.</i>

947
01:02:27.075 --> 01:02:29.620
<i>Yura, did you see the photo?</i>

948
01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:32.789
<i>She looked really cute
when she received the award.</i>

949
01:02:32.873 --> 01:02:35.500
<i>She was sad
no one from her family was coming,</i>

950
01:02:35.584 --> 01:02:36.919
<i>so I went instead.</i>

951
01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:07.546
THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

952
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.319
Let me borrow him like now.

953
01:06:31.403 --> 01:06:33.321
But you can't take my family.

954
01:06:33.405 --> 01:06:35.240
<i>You can only take Dohoon.</i>

955
01:06:35.323 --> 01:06:37.075
<i>Minseo.
Do you like me or Boseok?</i>

956
01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.952
- Family, of course.
- That's my daughter!

957
01:06:39.035 --> 01:06:40.829
<i>Boseok is our family now.</i>

958
01:06:40.912 --> 01:06:42.455
Get him in the car. Now.

959
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.584
<i>Boseok's kissing another girl.</i>

960
01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:47.294
<i>I'm going home.</i>

961
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.005
You can't make it?

962
01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:52.007
<i>The suspect's been identified.</i>

963
01:06:52.382 --> 01:06:54.176
<i>Still no call from Dohoon yet?</i>

964
01:06:54.259 --> 01:06:56.219
<i>I'm always worried about you.</i>

965
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.722
<i>I missed it. I should handle it.</i>
