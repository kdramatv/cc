01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,820
All I want is my family.

916
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,824
Bring back my daughter and granddaughter
whom Chunryun took from me.

917
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,620

920
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,759
Hello?

921
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,565
Yes, I'll check when I get home.

922
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,323
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)

923
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,577

CHIEF OH: Who is it?

928
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:23,779
Have you seen the face?

929
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,573
What's up with you two today?

930
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,743
I was wondering why it's so icy in here.

931
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,829
Yura, what did he do wrong this time?

932

01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,541
TAEGU: You got to make it this time.

934
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,084
I can't reach Minseo.

935
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,919
TAEGU: If you want your daughter back,

936
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,797
come after you have finished the task.

937
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,425
Your smile hasn't change a bit,
then or now.

938
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,260
TAEGU: The target is Oh Chunryun.

939
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,305
The murderer who has
destroyed our lives.
