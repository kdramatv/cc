He's a university baseball coach.

He has no time to go home.

916
01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:32.243

He has training for two months

100th day photos,

948

he straightened up after 20 years.

Jihoon!

1092
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.003
Calm down. Let me handle it.

1093
01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:10.964
I'm telling you again...

1094
01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.050
Speak Korean, you punk.

1095
01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:15.552
Don't you know how to talk?
What's wrong with you?

1096
01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.598
FAMILY: THE UNBREAKABLE BOND

1097
01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:24.561
(SONG CONTINUES IN ENGLISH)
Take me out of misery

1098
01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:29.149
And I'll wake you just in time

1099
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:34.071
To go missing a hundred miles

1100
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:37.866
Till we run out of time

1101
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.577
Let's fade away

1102
01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.123
All right

1103
01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.043
Let's sit ourselves down together

1104
01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:49.753
Tell me

1105
01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:52.464
What have you been drinking
you such a hater

1106
01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.299
I don't know about you or

1107
01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.884
Whatever you're readin'

1108
01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.387
I've got a case to be closed

1109
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.306
'Cause it has taken a toll on me

1110
01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:09.856
Yeah

1111
01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:14.236
Sugar love, don't you turn on me, babe

1112
01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:17.739
I don't know why
'Cause I can't fight this
