-(IN KOREAN) What's that?

That tattoo on your friend.

303
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,158
It's some kind of tradition they have.

304
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,786
But the tattoos looked a bit different

305
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,330
on Carly Young and Wolfe.
Why is that?

306
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,043
Oh, MGD is actually
a secret organization formed in the '70s

307
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
and was named "Union" by the government.

308
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,465
The government formed
a secret organization?

309
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,717
A private one?

310
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,469
Interesting.

311
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,556
So what happened?

312
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,268
It gets a little expensive from here.

313
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,272
Hey. I paid you last time.

314
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,484
Fine. Put it on a tab.

315
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,069
So what happened?

316
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,154
What happened next?

317
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,326
At the time, there were a lot of spies
around the world.

318
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,912
Korea also formed a group of mercenaries
to settle the affairs,

319
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,831
but it was foundered in the late '90s.

320
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
That's when the tattoo shape changed.

321
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,543
That's the difference

322
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,962
between the Old Union and the New Union.

323
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,924
The Old Union is made up of old members
carrying out covert activities,

324
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,470
it's more like
a private group of killers.

325
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,097
New Union has a different intent.

326
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,600
They have been trafficking

327
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,643
weapons, drugs and humans.

328
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,230
Should I say,
they're more like a business group?

329
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,900
But it was Wolfe who killed Carly Young.

330
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:45,113
Does that have something to do
with the breakup of the organization?

331
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,116
It looks like it.

332
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,954
New Union is trying to get rid of
the remaining members of the Old,

333
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,706
that's why they sent your friend.

334
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,460
Then who's the sniper that killed Wolfe?

335
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,337
I'm not completely sure,

336
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,255
-but I think...
-Dad, Boseok is here.

337
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,465

365
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,494
