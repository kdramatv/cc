The decisive reason for being designated as a suspect is

321

I was so worried that I couldn't sleep a wink all night.

331
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.840
so

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.550
In the end, I'm going to say it again
He definitely wrote a letter like this

333

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.620
mom?

354
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.820
It's in, really?

355
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.690
You, who transferred to the school yesterday, are starting a trend at this school.
There's no way I knew in advance

356
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.730
Coffee shop matchbox in student bag
What is this?

357
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.200
(Heeseop) What is it?

358
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.170
[surprised] Ah! Oh, that's it!

359
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.570
Come to our castle on Sunday
I can taste the coffee.

360
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.510
I went to a coffee shop in town and took it.
I just built a tower with this and that’s it.

361
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.910
Wow, it was so fun

362
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.410
And then again...

363
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.320
You are still with your brother
That lock?

364
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.550
Oh well, of course

365
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:39.750
Now, lock?

366
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.760
(Haejun) The bag is
Why is it so light again?

367
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.560
Oh, then on a picnic.
What book are you bringing?

368
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.760
My little mother
Didn’t you pack me a lunch box?

369
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.400
Oh, not that person.

370
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.930
Well, you wrapped it for me
I just forgot and just...

371
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.700
Ask the kids to find my bag

372
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.240
Because I searched your bag too
You can search my bag too

373
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.610
Take your lunch box with you

374
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.980
(Haejun) The drinks are yours...

375
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.880
Here, I even buy things for the kids in the class next to me.

376
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.460
It's an errand

377
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320
(Heeseop) Yes

378
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.560
(Pure love) In the Rochester room
The fire just started

379
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.630
Jane put it out with a bucket of water.

380
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.800
Hold my hand like this
‘You saved my life’

381
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.900
How do you do it?
Don't you want to read the next one?

382
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.170
So in the end, I told my mom
I got hit with a flipper, whatever.

383
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.340
(Yoonyoung) But why are you reading a book?

384
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.310
(Soonae) I read books
Because you hate it

385
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.580
The girl got caught up in something useless

386
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.850
I don't do housework
You're just wasting time

387
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:47.850
ah

388
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:53.090
Read your favorite books to your heart's content
Listen to music to your heart’s content

389
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.860
Just sipping warm coffee
I wish I could live like that

390
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.770
(Yoonyoung) That kind of mother’s dream is

391
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.700
It finally happened

392
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.710
[Nostalgic music]

393
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.240
[Nostalgic music]

394
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.990
(Yoonyoung) Why?

395
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.190
I just like it
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) When you’ve finished drinking, give me a cup.

396
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.960
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) When you’ve finished drinking, give me a cup.

397
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.830
(Yoonyoung) It’s all over
I'll do it separately

398
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.030
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) Baby, give it to me
Mom does this

399
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.200
My daughter can read books to her heart’s content.

400
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.700
[Sound of flowing water]
[Middle-aged Soon-ae is humming]

401
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.630
(Yoonyoung) Why!

402
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.230
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) Ah...

403
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.660
Oh, just

404
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.900
I'm curious what you're hearing

405
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.640
Give me, I'll do it

406
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.970
Oh my, that's enough, that's enough

407
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.540
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) When I get married later,
Even if I don't want to do it, I'm bored.

408
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.210
I won't disturb you, listen, listen

409
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.850
(Yoonyoung) The sound of that damn poetry book, really.

410
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.850
Even if it doesn't go that way...

411
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.650
(Yoonyoung) Mom

412
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.490
The time my mother didn't have
It was made for me.

413
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.330
What are you doing?

414
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.000
(Yoonyoung) Now
I'll give it back to you, Mom.

415
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.070
Mom's lost time

416
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.270
And everything I gave up

417
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.610
I'll definitely get it all back

418
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.410
It's late, it's late, I have to run

419
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.780
But why go there?
Isn’t that over there at the school?

420
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.290
Didn't you hear it during the finale yesterday?

421
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.290
It's picnic day, today

422
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.860
(Yoonyoung) Ah...

423
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:07.830
[laughter]

424
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.430
[Laughing] Oh

425
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.230
Let's go together!

426

(Haejun) Oh, oh, really, really

434
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.620
(Teacher) Teacher Yoon
[Haejun sighs]

435
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.390
- Teacher Yoon?
- (Haejun) Oh, why?

436
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.030
(Teacher) Ah, but why?
Are you doing this here?

437
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.130
Don't you check the kids in your class?

438
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.960
Look at me, look at those bastards

439
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.400
[The male students are noisy]

440
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.240
It's just a waste of money
Last price, huh?

441
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.170
Kids who can't study
Don't worry, huh?

442
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.840
Don't be late
It was written clearly, really.

443
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.780
It makes people anxious, really, oops, tsk

444
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.780
(Teacher) Why are you going there again? also?

445
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.120
Hey, you guy!

446
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.830
Ah, why is the principal again?

447
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.230
Same as that class
Tie it up, really

448
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.100
Ouch!
[hem]

449
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.940
[Blubbering] Cotton candy
Aren't you guys going to fall?

450
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.540
These bastards are just

451

[Heeseop sighs]

454
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.530
No, it's paired with a lock.

455
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.240
Doesn't the second head look like a watch?

456
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.380
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

457
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.950

- Su, Sunae
- (Soonae) Huh?

460
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.520
That terminal then?

461
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.290
[Welcome sigh]

462
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.130
That’s why we met again
I guess we are destined...

463
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.700
(Yoonyoung) It sounds like fate!
[Music cuts out]

464

[Yoonyoung’s heavy breathing]

465
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.470
Listen carefully, Sunae.

466
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.970
Listen carefully, Sunae.

467
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.210
This is it

468
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.710
This is a real waste of time

469
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.780
Oh, what kind of dog noise are you talking about again?

470
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.780
in your future life

471
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.480
It's never going to help

472

[Yoonyoung’s heavy breathing]

473
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.690
(Heeseop) It looks like you’re having a hard time

474
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.520
Shall we go first?

475
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.830
Uh, still, but...

476
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:27.660
(Yoonyoung) Where are you going? To go

477
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.500
(Hee-seop) When times are hard,
It's up to me to take a break, huh

[Soon-ae’s embarrassed voice]

479
00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:33.700
Then take a break and come back.

Why are there so many?

When you play, you just play, huh?

496
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.200
come this far
I'm worried about the academic exam for no reason.

497

Don't do that

(Boys) You know!

506

(Entertainment Manager) That’s right.
I'm going to have a time bragging about my talent.

509

(Heeseop) Hey, at this critical moment
A precious thing called wotchi...

510

Ah, but is it possible?

A real guitar
I haven't touched it yet

514
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.850

Let’s practice first
Wouldn't it be nice?

in front of girls
I can be a mess

[sigh]

871
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.660
[Meaningful music]

872
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.100
Do you even know who that is?

873
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.540
[Sound of strength]

874
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.970
(Middle-aged immature) Just look at one place

875
01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.450
(Middle-aged immature) Just look at one place
When I rush in blindly

876
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.950
You can fall into many traps
