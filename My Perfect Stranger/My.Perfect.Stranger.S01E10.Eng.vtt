May 14, 1987, May 16

4
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.680
died one after another
Two female victims

5
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.550
And disappeared on the 20th
A woman who has never been found

6
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.720
Because I left a note
Although I was treated as a runaway

7
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.060
Actually he died

8
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.490
(Yoonyoung) As written here
I just talked

9
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.790
It's a novel, written by Go Mi-sook.

10
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.200
It was written like that.

11
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.760
three women died

12
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.170
The real culprit is
I was never caught.

13
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.000
Do you hope Go Mi-sook is the culprit?

14
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.370
(Middle-aged immature) In my novel
The murderers

15
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.140
Why were there only women?

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.710
What men in the world
Like committing a murder somewhere

17
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310
Some women
You end up committing a brutal murder.

18
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.120
Among them, I

19
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.820
Things I know better
I just choose and use it.

20
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.420
(Yoonyoung) The Go Mi-sook I know is
Because I'm a person who can do that.

I don't even know if it's possible

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.710
[sniffling]

25
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.220
Even if I go back a long, long time, I will definitely

26
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.990

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.020
(Yoonyoung) Can you walk?

29
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.060
Let's go, hospital

30
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.330
(Heeseop) I hate it

31
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.830
On the topic of getting out alone

32
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.470
How much more shameless will I become?
Get some treatment

33
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.400
Until I start crying

34
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.770
I can't go anywhere, I

35
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.050
You probably thought so

36
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.360
I guess they left it like that.

37
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.260
(Yoonyoung) When you were alone in this alley

38
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.270
But not now

39
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.940
don't leave it like that

(Haejun) Oh, wait a minute.

52
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.250
Actually, Baek Hee-seop was dragged in earlier.

53
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.350
I immediately called my seniors.

54
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.360
Because they said they would come in 50 minutes
It will arrive soon

98
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.870
There's no way this could actually be reported.

99
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.740
I came knowing that this would happen.

100
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.950
Also people I deserve
Do you know the direct number?

101
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.650

Did you bring me here, Baek Hee-seop?

151
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.810
why? Is that different from this?

152
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.440
ah! Actually

153
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.350
If you caught the murderer, it would be an achievement.

154

This kind of disgrace...
[Chief sighs]

168
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.520

On the subject of playing around with my daughter’s homeroom teacher

377

384
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.030
What about rice?

385
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.900
Also, is that kimchi soup not on the menu?

(Coast Guard) Huh?

390
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.810
Uh, okay, I'll do it tomorrow, Mom.

391

Just make seaweed soup

392
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.420
If you make kimchi soup again,
I'm not really coming home anymore

393
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.200
(Yoonyoung) No way, because of kimchi soup tomorrow
Are you running away from home?

394
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.130
That's it.

395
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.540
(Yoonyoung) So
Gimhae-kyung is seaweed soup.

The drill is kimchi soup.

397
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.480
Mom finally
I chose kimchi soup...

398
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.180
(Haejun) That’s right
It was a misunderstanding, Kim Hae-kyung

399
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.050
Actually for my daughter

400
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.390
Don't come to see me anymore
It was the last thing I boiled.

401

[sigh]

402
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.560
But what's important to us is
Wasn’t it after he ran away from home?

403
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.160
It's not a reason to run away from home

404
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.300
It would have been like that in the past.

405
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.040
Time and place to encounter the criminal

406
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.470
(Haejun) That’s important
Because I thought about it

407
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.370
But

408
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.240
Now there are no other possibilities
I don't want to leave it behind

But

412
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.290
This is how you can meet the culprit
It might be your last chance...

413
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.050
(Haejun) There must be another way.

414
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.830
before that

415
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.890

418

I'm thinking of running away from home
I guess you can fold it up right away?

Yes, today is a very good day.

Don't you?

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.380
As if I were a special person
I have no luck not being able to see it.

877
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.980
In the meantime, to me
The biggest question was

878
01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:05.180
(Haejun) It was this sentence

879
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:07.280
‘Women who read books are dangerous’

880
01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.520
I don't know if this is some kind of warning

881
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.290
(Pure love) Even in front of me
Don't lie shamelessly

882
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.290
I'll tell you everything

883
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.130
(Misuk) Why like this?
Are you being annoying, Sunae?

884
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.760
I was acting out for no reason
Don't be like your sister, Sunae.
