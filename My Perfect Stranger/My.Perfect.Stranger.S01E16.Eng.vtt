It's a new situation

Are we going to be trapped like this forever?

So far, well

There's no need to ask
Have you thought about it?

30
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.950
Well, it’s a time machine anyway.
Because existence itself makes no sense

(Yoonyoung) It should be okay

181
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.260
Insurance doesn't even work here.

182
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.230
(Haejun) This is the first thing I heard
I guess not?

183
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.500
(Yoonyoung) ‘It has to be okay’

184
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.240
'If I die here,
It's getting very ambiguous'

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.780
[Yoonyoung sighs]

187
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.380
It was really awkward back then.

188
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.080
Honestly, right now
It's not that daunting.

189
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.020
Because I’m with someone I want to be with.

190
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.730

very if

193
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.640
I can never find my way back

194
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.310
just here
Even if I'm locked up for the rest of my life

195
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.540
uh...

196
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.880
I think it'll be okay, I

197
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.450
If I'm with you

198
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.420
really?

199
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.990
What about that one?

200
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.030
(Haejun) Me?

201
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.530
Tell me what are you doing?

202
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.740
Of course I don't like it

203
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.620
[bird chirping]

204
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.460
[Interesting music]

205
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.920
(Haejun) What you said to me last night
It seems a little different, doesn't it?

206
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.990
What is it?

207
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.590
If you're with me

208
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.330
If you're with me
They say it’s okay to stay here forever

209
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.800
(Haejun) In the back of my head
I thought there was a hole

210
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.730
No, for hours
Are you watching?

211
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.270
No, is it going well?

212
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm just curious.
Well, I'm curious

213
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.470
A person who is just curious, yes

214
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.140
I nodded once
Every time I tilt like this

215
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.740
Do you sigh like that?

216
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.110
(Haejun) Was I the only one who was sincere? Just me, yeah

217
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.080
Boy, I'm so serious, me too

218
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.780
(Yoonyoung) But, that...

219
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.320
Preferably in 2021
Because it's nice to meet together

220
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.990
Enjoying the benefits of modern civilization

But just that door

224
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.970
But just that door
Can't you just leave it open a little bit?

225
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.780
all right

226
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.250
Okay, I'll go in.

(Yuri) That...

237
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.630
I read it

238
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.300
It was good

239
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.740
(Eunha) You write well, you

240
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.870
Later, just one signature on the cover here.

(Yuri) But

246
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.130
Even though you were discharged from the hospital
Why aren't you coming to school?

247
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.660
Maybe because of us?

248
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:49.900
No, nothing like that.

Without even saying hello
I thought you just went away

331
00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:07.241
in the blink of an eye
It can go well beyond 30 years.

But during those 30 years

333

I understand too.

339
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:49.381
Maybe this is an opportunity

340
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:54.051
I can't go back right now

341
00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:55.821
That much here
time to spend

00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:57.151

The time we haven't shared

How about taking it here?

A time we haven’t shared together?

531
00:36:58.311 --> 00:37:00.011
Are you sure you fixed everything?

532
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:02.581
maybe?

533
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:08.281
If I knew it would be like this
I won't say I'll see you again tomorrow

534
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:10.621
(Haejun) Um...

535
00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:13.351
It’s okay if it’s not right now

536
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.091
no

537
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:19.661
(Yoonyoung) Anyway
Because I'm a person who shouldn't exist

538
00:37:19.731 --> 00:37:21.561
It has to be erased somehow

539
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.701
I'll see you again soon when I get back.

540
00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:26.031
[Yoonyoung’s light smile]

541
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:29.441
How about you?

542
00:37:30.771 --> 00:37:32.241
really

543
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:34.841
Is it okay if I go back like this now?

544
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:21.861
(Cheongah) This road

545
00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:24.931
How did you find out?

546
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.891
Sorry for coming on suddenly.

547
00:38:28.961 --> 00:38:31.931
you are here
I won't tell anyone else.

548
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:34.901
I'll forget too
After today

549
00:38:39.741 --> 00:38:41.211
Can I sit down for a moment?

550
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:15.941
When you have a child
Are you really going to let me go?

551
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:18.011
uh

552
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:24.121
uh

553
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:26.391
I told you so.

554
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:30.961
Terrible and scary, that kid?

555
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:34.231
okay

556
00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:45.571
(Haejun) That’s right

557
00:39:46.611 --> 00:39:49.581
Then live well.

558
00:39:51.141 --> 00:39:53.411
Don't feel guilty for nothing

559
00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:56.221
Forget everything and live

560
00:39:57.551 --> 00:39:59.751
[Sad music]

561
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:03.561
I know your situation well, I

562
00:40:05.191 --> 00:40:07.861
It's terrible and scary
I think it can happen

563
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:13.701
If it's too hard
I think it's okay to live without seeing it.

564
00:40:15.871 --> 00:40:17.201
I understand, I

565
00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:23.841
Chairman Byeong-gu Yoon
He has a lot of money and is a good person.

566
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:25.581
It'll be good for your child too

567
00:40:26.611 --> 00:40:30.381
Nothing lacking in a good home

568
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:33.421
You can live like that

569
00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:36.591
Something like hate towards my mother

570
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:39.831
Without any resentment

571
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:43.361
You can live like that

572
00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:47.571
lie

573
00:40:49.041 --> 00:40:50.741
How do you not resent it?

574
00:40:51.741 --> 00:40:53.541
(Cheong-ah) How do you not hate me?

575
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:55.911
I gave up sleeping

576
00:40:57.341 --> 00:41:00.781
In the end, she is a mother who abandoned her child.

577
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:05.021
Take my word for it

578
00:41:05.821 --> 00:41:07.621
(Haejun) He said he has the same name as me

579
00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:12.891
It's probably similar to what I think.
That kid too

580
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.231
(Cheongah) Really

581
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:18.871
Is that so?

582
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:24.641
in this world
Just for giving me birth

583
00:41:26.941 --> 00:41:29.181
enough

584
00:41:29.241 --> 00:41:30.681
thank you

585
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:38.621
You would think so.

586
00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:52.001
[Seagull crying]

587
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.771
Are you relieved?

588
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.411
(Haejun) Yes

589
00:42:04.511 --> 00:42:07.881
The person who abandoned me
I sent you away

590
00:42:07.951 --> 00:42:09.981
Strangely, I feel at ease.

591
00:42:12.251 --> 00:42:14.651
Well now for real
We can go back, right?

592
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:16.891
(Haejun) Yes

593
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:23.901
(Yoonyoung) But this time
You really fixed it properly, right?

594
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:26.671
Also with the manager
Shouldn’t you say hello?

595
00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:28.001
Probably not?

596
00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:31.941
This time, the real person is the right person.
Because it appeared

597
00:42:32.011 --> 00:42:33.541
Who came?

598
00:42:33.611 --> 00:42:36.041
At that time, at the tunnel
who called me

599
00:42:37.881 --> 00:42:39.881
The person who built this time machine

600
00:42:41.051 --> 00:42:42.921
[Calm music]

601
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:45.151
(Haejun) At first, I too
It was hard to believe

602
00:42:45.221 --> 00:42:47.851
It's completely impossible
Because I thought about it

603
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:51.421
It doesn't make sense, how...

604
00:42:51.491 --> 00:42:53.891
(Man) How can my son
Could it be?

605
00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:56.531
To someone who is already dead in 2022?

606
00:42:58.031 --> 00:43:00.401
Because he actually didn't die.

607
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:03.501
Well, it was almost like that

608
00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:05.171
I survived in the end

609
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:08.781
(Man) There is something my father missed

610
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:12.811
(Man) There is something my father missed
There was a big hole

611
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:16.621
What emerged from that hidden future

612
00:43:18.551 --> 00:43:19.991
That's me

613
00:43:23.321 --> 00:43:25.891
One more time to my father
I wanted to give you a chance

614
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:29.031
the opportunity to make a second choice

615
00:43:30.001 --> 00:43:30.901
however

616
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:34.471
You did it in the end, Dad.

617
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:41.441
(Haejun) To me
There was a hidden future

618
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:44.411
Thanks to that future
This is how it all started

619
00:43:47.351 --> 00:43:49.221
(Yoonyoung) So who was it?

620
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:52.821
That's a secret

621
00:43:54.251 --> 00:43:55.791
Is it like this, really?

622
00:43:59.431 --> 00:44:00.431
Let's go

623
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:17.081
(Haejun) Now we’re there

624
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:19.381
(Yoonyoung) That’s right

625
00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:22.751
A person who doesn't even know who he is
Thanks to you, I'll be back

626
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.221
Still, there were a lot of good moments, right?

627
00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:32.731
There were many moments I was thankful for.

628
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:34.661
It's because of you too

629
00:44:35.331 --> 00:44:36.301
(Yoonyoung) But when I go back

630
00:44:38.301 --> 00:44:40.201
(Yoonyoung) But when I go back

631
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:43.001
Has everything really changed?

632
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.311
What if nothing has changed?

633
00:44:47.241 --> 00:44:49.141
Let's go and check it out quickly.

634
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:52.011

710
00:52:40.351 --> 00:52:42.881
(Hae-jun on TV) The key suspicion is
To steal money from the company...

711
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:44.321
(Yuseop) Heeseop

712
00:52:44.381 --> 00:52:45.791
(Hee-seop) Uh, last name

713
00:52:46.921 --> 00:52:48.151
Are you here?

714

[Yuseop’s laughter]

715
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:50.861
(Yuseop) Why are there no customers? uh?

716
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:54.031
(Heeseop) Oh, well
Has retro gone out of style now?

717
00:52:54.091 --> 00:52:55.261
(Yoonyoung) Dad!

718
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:02.171
(Haejun on TV) Details
Reporter Kim Woo-hyun reports.

719
00:53:18.581 --> 00:53:19.751
(Haejun) Let’s go

720
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:26.331
(Yoonyoung) Because I walk here like this
It feels very strange, doesn't it?

721
00:53:26.961 --> 00:53:28.591
(Haejun) It’s better

722
00:53:28.661 --> 00:53:31.101
Anywhere like this
You can go hand in hand

723
00:53:31.161 --> 00:53:33.071
(Yoonyoung) You can talk about anything

724
00:53:34.571 --> 00:53:36.401
(Haejun) Ah, but
My parents saw my face

725
00:53:36.471 --> 00:53:37.941
What are you not saying?

726
00:53:38.971 --> 00:53:40.711
(Yoonyoung) Why wouldn’t I do it?

727
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:42.381
Every time I see the news

728
00:53:42.441 --> 00:53:44.281
With a teacher from my old school

729
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:47.981
Even the face and voice are similar.
It's so amazing

730
00:53:48.051 --> 00:53:49.321
[Yoonyoung’s laughter]

731
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:51.721
(Haejun) I also have doubts about your daughter.
Is it worth it?

732
00:53:53.151 --> 00:53:54.451
(Yoonyoung) Of course

733
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:59.461
- (Hee-seop) Now
- (Soonae) Oh my

734
00:53:59.531 --> 00:54:01.331
The rice cake looks so delicious

735
00:54:01.891 --> 00:54:03.901
(Yoonyoung) Now, let’s eat.

736
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:06.401
- (Soonae) Oh my
- (Yoonyoung) Here, eat.

737
00:54:09.941 --> 00:54:11.671
[Soonae’s surprised voice]
(Heeseop) Huh?

738
00:54:11.741 --> 00:54:14.241
It's really the same as what I used to eat in the past.

739
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:17.281
(Soon-ae) Why, in our old days
With Yoonyoung

740
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.511
The day I went to the park and rode my bike
Even then...

741
00:54:19.581 --> 00:54:21.911
[Coughing]
[lively music]

742

[Soonae’s crying sound]

743
00:54:26.121 --> 00:54:28.091
Well, even after 30 years

744
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:31.921
(Soonae) So

745
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:35.291
(Soonae) So
You even had the same name

746
00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:38.501
[Soonae’s crying sound]

747
00:54:38.561 --> 00:54:41.101

749
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:45.001
(Soonae) Oh my

750
00:54:45.071 --> 00:54:48.441
But as I grow older
Even their faces look exactly alike

751
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:50.841
How can this happen?

752
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:53.381
Ah, when I had it

753
00:54:53.451 --> 00:54:55.081
thinking about that friend
I guess I did a lot

754
00:54:55.151 --> 00:54:56.581
Then you can

755
00:54:56.651 --> 00:54:58.451
Um, really?

756
00:54:58.521 --> 00:55:01.451
Is that so? Wow
[Heeseop’s laughter]

757
00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:03.561
(Haejun) You believe that?

758
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:05.961
(Yoonyoung) What if I don’t believe it?

759
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:10.531
The friend and teacher I met 34 years ago
They have the same face

760
00:55:10.601 --> 00:55:13.771
Write, even if it’s time travel
Do you understand what I did?

761
00:55:19.241 --> 00:55:20.341
(Yoonyoung) Ah

762
00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:22.611
Not long ago

763
00:55:23.411 --> 00:55:26.281
That person
We also ran into each other by chance.

764
00:55:31.381 --> 00:55:32.921
[camera shutter sound]

765
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:46.531
[Lonely music]

766
00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:09.661
(Yoonyoung) Do you have any regrets?

767
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:11.161
things you did

769
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:18.931
Good things are just good.

770
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:21.571
Pain just hurts

771
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.441
(Misuk) Envy is just envy.

772
00:56:25.141 --> 00:56:27.411
I wish I had been more honest, but I

773
00:56:31.111 --> 00:56:32.911
Because I couldn't do that

774
00:56:34.051 --> 00:56:36.051
Because it's already too late

775
00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:43.591
I keep wandering around other people

776
00:56:45.491 --> 00:56:46.931
I might live like that

777
00:56:53.031 --> 00:56:54.971
It's not too late

778
00:56:56.841 --> 00:56:58.501
Even now

779
00:56:59.641 --> 00:57:01.511
Because it’s the past for you in the future

780
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:06.981
Is that so?

781
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:12.851
[Laughs]

782
00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:28.901
(Yoonyoung) That person’s present
I don't know what it is like

783
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:31.371
maybe a little bit

784
00:57:32.301 --> 00:57:35.571
I don't know if I'm being honest
I thought

785
00:57:35.641 --> 00:57:37.181
[Sound of crashing waves]

786
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:38.911
(Haejun) And I

787
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:42.181
Still the future and the past

788
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:45.251
I'm thinking about it

789
00:57:51.691 --> 00:57:53.531
[Calm music]

(Soonae) Sleep well

792
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:01.701
(Man) Ah, but

793
00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:03.401
(Man) Ah, but

794
00:58:03.471 --> 00:58:05.471
up close just once
Can’t I go see it?

795
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:06.771
my mom's face

796
00:58:06.841 --> 00:58:08.411
later

797
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:10.541
Because it would be difficult if we met now

798
00:58:10.611 --> 00:58:11.781
(Man) Why?

799
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:15.711
It's not fun if you know the ending in advance.

800
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:19.491
Our future love

801
00:58:19.551 --> 00:58:21.951

803
00:58:26.331 --> 00:58:30.531
(Man) As expected, the person I will encounter is
I guess we'll run into each other somehow

804
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:34.731
Mom and Dad
We meet again here like this

805
00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:36.401
In the end again

806
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.071
Seeing that I fell in love

807
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:41.241
(Haejun) Um

808
00:58:42.241 --> 00:58:46.151
Oh, that person you know
What do you like best?

809
00:58:46.881 --> 00:58:49.581
What I already found out
Give me a hint and go

810
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:52.221
Later, when you give something like a gift
Please know in advance

And my father sometimes buys it for me
a flower

00:59:05.131 --> 00:59:06.501
I really liked it

817
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:32.191

I love it so much

00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:46.141
Isn't it too simple?

00:59:46.211 --> 00:59:48.311
I just like it this much

823
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:51.711
Receive more gifts from gifts
What should I do?

824
00:59:55.411 --> 00:59:57.121
ah

(Yoonyoung) But that time machine
Is it over now?

829
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.331
(Haejun) Just once
I only have a chance to go

830
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:11.731
wherever it is

Did you know it’s May 16th?

Are you thinking the same thing as me?

if

834
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:29.751
If I go just one more time

835
01:00:31.051 --> 01:00:32.581
What do you think?

836
01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:36.961
This time properly
I think I can try it

837
01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:42.861
Shall we go one more time?

838
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:45.001

What if there are variables?

844
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:54.471
maybe

845
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:56.671
The future will find us

846

(Haejun) Somehow we
Because we'll be together

847

We didn't run into each other by chance

848
01:02:05.241 --> 01:02:08.051
It's fate that we have no choice but to meet.

849

Are you ready?
