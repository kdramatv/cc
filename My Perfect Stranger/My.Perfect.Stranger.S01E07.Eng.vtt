183
00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.960
Thank you very much

[heavy music]

185
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.770
This doesn't make sense

186
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.280
(Haejun) Not at all
Have you not noticed?

187
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.780
It's like meeting an aunt who never existed.

188
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.310
Because my body is weak

189
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.020
They said he left early due to illness.
I thought it was just like that...

[Haejun sighs]

191
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.390
(Yoonyoung) I didn’t say anything other than this.
Is there more?

192
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.800
The second floor was opened.
Then it's all done.

193
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.100
You have a plan this time too, right?

194
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.770
I got a house across the street
Does it seem like a coincidence?

195
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.580
Then everything from the beginning...

196
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.860

198
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200
(Haejun) I’ve been watching you for a month

199
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.210
Today is the most difficult
It's going to be a tricky day.

What we need to save

201
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.140
Because I'm not an ordinary person

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.940
I found it, my father’s emergency fund.

213
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.580
Ha, I thought about this a long time ago
You should have done it, Kyoung-ae.

214
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.450
Wow, I just need to save a little more.

The craziest person in town
[breathing sound of joy]

223
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.450
Why do you do it, what do you do

224
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.490
Dare to think logically
You can't try to understand

225
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.430
So it was specifically the house in front.

226
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.190
Because I don’t know where I’ll end up

227
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.530
[Haejun sighs]

228
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.910
The movements themselves revealed by the police at the time were also
Are you saying it's hard to believe anymore?

229
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.950
There's so much I missed

230
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.520
(Haejun) Since last night
That fact became even more clear.

231
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.060
Ah...

232
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.090
[sigh]

233
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.770
(Yoonyoung) Anyway, those people
The last thing I found was

234
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.130
9pm tonight
You mean Bongbong Cafe?

[Meaningful music]

236
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.370
Is it the same as Jooyoung Lee?

237
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.010
After leaving there
You must have encountered the criminal.

238
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.580
Today is different

239
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.550
'Cause we'll be behind it

Really this time

241
00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.600
It will happen, I'm sure

242
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.310
What about our school?

243
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.570

[Yoonyoung chuckles]

248
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.690
Ah, then! Is school the problem now?
I need to get to the hospital quickly, uh

249
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.100
Yeah yeah
You know that intersection in town? uh

250
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.000
Well, don't even think about class.
Just stick close and do your best to nurse.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.210
(Byung-gu) It won’t work today, right?

254
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.410
I guess I can go to the hospital and see.

255
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.410
(Byung-gu) Oh, so you’re on your way?

256
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.620
By the way, are the kids okay?

Ah, yes

You can be discharged from the hospital
I said I would leave it for one more day.

If I don’t do this at least

I can't see it refreshed, uh

Well, 'It's so bad and
'Don't spend money'

338

Because I wasn’t listening to my sister.

What? Not...

340
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.150
Wow, now
Are you saying you're going to be outright dismissive of this?

341
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.120
(Soonae) No, I didn’t mean that.

342

You think you’re the only one who’s smart, right? uh?

Mistress, that pin
I asked you to buy that too.

I didn’t bother to buy it just for you.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.870
That's all there is to it.

348
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.350
Because my father really has no money
Do you know that I don’t give you tutoring?

349
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.680
What does that mean?

350
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.680
you

351
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.590
I have no intention of sending him to college, my father said.

[Sad music]

353
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.760
(Soonae) How does she know that?

354
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.260
(Kyeongae) Only you don’t know, only you

355
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.630
Hey, what was your father’s wish in the first place?

356
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.970
you and me

357
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.170
He came from a good family early on.
Get married, huh?

358
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.440

Letting people live without being buried

359
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.580
Have Obok study.
Having a good job and making a living

360
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.310
That's just two

361
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.150
But you're not in this direction

362
00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.950
So?

363
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.520
Are you going to live like that?

364
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.520
- what?
- (Soonae) Do as your father tells you.

365
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.260
I won't live like that

366
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.960
Little things
I can do it without any tutoring.

367
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.670
If you need it too,

368
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.610
[Kyeong-ae’s embarrassed voice]
At least add this

369
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.910
I never thought of it funny

370
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.720
[Kyeong-ae’s absurd breathing]

371
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.250
(Kyeongae) Well, read it
Are you talking about being smart or something?

372
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.920
That's it till the end
I'm sitting there ignoring you

373

Mistress

374
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.800
Oh, I'm annoyed

375
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.910

[Haejun sighs]

378
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.510
I can go alone

379
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.750
no

380
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.650
For now, follow that side.
I hope so too, mom

(Yoonyoung) Grandpa
This is the first time I feel resentful

385
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.050
It was my mother's lifelong wish.

386
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.080
In the end, I couldn't go to college.

387
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.990
That's so rare
Probably not, here

388
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.090
Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not a tragedy.

389
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.260
It means you didn't know.

390
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.330
The choice that blocked my daughter
How will you look back later?

391

395

Until the culprit shows up
We just watch.

396

[Interesting music]

405
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.990
But what are they all?

406
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:30.320
What is it? with you
These are friends preparing for Miss Korea.

407
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.760
(Man 1) First of all, he
I'll do the Jeonnam line first.

408
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.730
Uh, this is Daegu Jin

409
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.630
That guy over there is Gyeongbuk Mi

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.380
What is the cause of 500,000?
These are the people who say they will make you Miss Korea.

426
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.590
(Haejun) I’m here
I've been working on it since I first arrived.

427
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.390
Well, even if you get money

428
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.260
In the middle, with the price of drinks and the price of food.
Use it all up

429
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.260
You can't be defeated if you try to be defeated
It was a fraud that never happened

430
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.000
(Yoonyoung) Then, that money
That's my mom's money!

431
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.200

Were you born an only child?

Why is he like this all of a sudden?

442
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.560
We should go to Seoul together, quickly.

443
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.760
That's because it probably won't work.

So, I'm leaving then.
Next year! really

[People are noisy]

702
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.810
- (Kyeongae) Goodbye, goodbye
- (Woman 5) I have to go to the second round.

703

(Kyungae) Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
[Everyone says hello]

705
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.150

[nervous music]

707
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.070
(Soonae) How far are we going?

708
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.040
(Beomryong) Oh, I have something to talk about.

709

[Rough breathing]

710
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.190
This is Jooyoung Lee’s last move, right?

711
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.190
[Meaningful music]

712
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:31.030
Miss, what are you doing?

713
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.310
(Soonae) What are you doing?

714
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.480
You said there was something you wanted to talk about.

715
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.580
Let's break up

716
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.850
Okay, I'll give you what you want.

717
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.750
Then please listen to what I want

718
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.320
(Soon-ae) Hey, Yoo Beom-ryong

719
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.820
Breaking up without being able to do anything
I'm the only one who regrets it so much

720
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.060
I told you
There's a lot of time I've spent

721
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:03.630
Isn't it?

722
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.530
(Soonae) Let go, help me!

723
00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.570
help!

724
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:11.100

[Yoonyoung’s heavy breathing]

726
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.340
[laughter]
No, I told you so.

727
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.380
Where are you going?
Let's just have one more drink and let's go

728
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.410
Hey

729
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.750
They told me to sit at the same table
What do I think of as your friend?

730
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.550
(Kyeongae) Because of other kids
I stopped by for a moment.

731
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.690
With trash like you
I'm not embarrassed, I

732
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.960
(Minsu) You speak nicely?

733
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.000
If you don’t want to hear prettier words, go away.

734
00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.930
Because I’m already in a bad mood today

735
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.600
[Sighing] Today
I tried to just quietly go.

736
00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.340
[Kyeongae’s surprised voice]

737
00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:52.380
[Urgent music]

738
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.850
[groans with difficulty]

739
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.890
Did you hit him first?

740
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.430
(Soonae) Yoon, Yoon Young-ah
[Soonae’s scared voice]

741

[Beomryong’s moan]
[Heeseop’s angry breathing]

742
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.100
Are you okay, Sunae?

743
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.500
Hey, head
Are you not hurt?

744
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.470
(Heeseop) Hey, you bastard.

745
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.270
You're not even friends anymore

746
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.680
[Beomryong’s moan]

747
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:29.650
(Yoonyoung) Let’s go, Sunae.

748
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.590
[Kyeong-Ae’s labored moans]

751
00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:39.820
(Kyeongae) Hey! Mr. Huh?

752
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.360
[Thump]

753
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:46.160
[Kyeongae’s surprised voice]

754
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.070
Lady, ah, what should I do?

755
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.270
What should I do, I guess he’s dead, ah, what should I do?
[Sound of running footsteps]

756
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.910
[Kyungae’s heavy breathing]

(Haejun) I won’t die

(Kyeong-ae) Oh, my, my!
[Meaningful music]

759
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.950
[Minsu’s sound of pain]

760
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.560
(Minsu) Ah, my fingers, my fingers
Oh, I guess it's broken

761
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.890
I guess it's broken, ah

762
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:25.170
Oh, I guess it's broken, ah!

763
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.870
I won't be able to tie anything like thread for a while.

764
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.440
[Sound of pain]

765
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.580
[Crying] My mom, please
call me please

[Nervous breathing]

768
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.390
Let's go, Lee Kyung-ae

769
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.430
(Haejun) Oh no
Why did you disappear?

770
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.560
until the police come
Didn’t you hear me say there is?

771
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.370
(Kyungae) Oh, really
Can I leave it like that? yes?

772
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.640
He even drank alcohol, huh?

773
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.500
If something goes wrong...

774
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:02.410
(Haejun) It’s okay
Because I am the only witness

775
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.780
I was the only one who saw you pushing

776
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.710
[Embarrassed sound]

777
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.180
Witness?

778
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.980
So be careful for now

779
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.950
(Haejun) Drink alcohol in moderation
I go home early too

780
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.260
The price for him is going to be high, if he gets caught.

781
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.290
You know?

782
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.160
no

783
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.660
Drink alcohol in moderation

784
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.830
If you go home early

785
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.540
How do you see your mom and dad’s faces?

786
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.240
(Kyungae) Ah, my brother’s face
How else can you look at it, because you’re embarrassed?

787
00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:35.140
uh?

788
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.910
(Kyungae) Ah, I’m already 22 years old.
I don't know how to do anything properly

789
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.880
It's already so pathetic

790
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:44.150
Now I've been scammed

791
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.720
Ah, now I really
I don't deserve to live

792
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.250
Mistress, Lee Kyung-ae, Mr.

793
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.820
Oh, I can't live, really.

794
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.760
[Kyung-ae grins]

795
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:58.560
Ah, Miss Korea is honest.

796
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.000
It wasn't

797
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:02.470
(Kyeongae)

798
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.040
But as a result of what I have observed so far,

799
00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:10.580
Well, it's roughly true that Woojeong-ri is Kim Wan-seon.

800
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.950
(Haejun) I always dance at the club
Well, that dance isn't bad either.

801
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.450
Being funny in front of friends
You're pretty good at it

802
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.420
What about decorating?

803
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:22.290
I have a sense
[Calm music]

804
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:25.220
Even if it's not Miss Korea
There are a lot of people watching TV

805
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.630
If you get the direction right
Twenty-two years old?

806
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.890
Well, I'm young, it's okay

807
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:32.430
really

808
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.030
Do you think so?

809
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.070
Oh, again
You're not cheating, right?

810
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.810
On the topic of losing all my money
How else can you get scammed?

811
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.980
(Kyungae) I, that money

812
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.210
Oh, that's really me too

813
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.180
pure love girl tuition
I was trying to do it for you, really.

814
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.080
You're not cheating, are you?

815
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.720
Spend it all on drinking, really

816
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:57.760
(Kyungae) Yes?

817
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.090
(Haejun) Now
[Kyeongae’s surprised voice]

818
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.260
I snuck it out earlier, take it with me.

819
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.330
[breathing sound of joy]

820
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.700
Oh my, oh my god

821
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.400
Oh no...

822
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.140
(Kyeongae) This, oh my, that...

823
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.440
Can I give you a kiss?

824
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:21.650
[Sound of door slamming]
(Haejun) What?

825
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:22.780
(Yoonyoung) No, go in.

826
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:26.280

[Crying] Hey, Lee Soon-ae

828
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.460
(Kyeongae) Because of this I

829
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.390
Do you know what happened today?

830
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.330
[Sisters cry]

831
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.370
- (Soonae) Sister
- (Kyeongae) I’m sorry, Sunae.

832
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.970
[Emotional music]
I'm sorry for getting angry at you

833
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.110
[Sound of raindrops pattering]

835
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.560
“Lee Hyung-man”

836
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.780
(Yoonyoung) Thank you, everything for today.

837
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.480
(Haejun) I didn’t see the culprit in the end.

838
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:37.120
I thought I was getting out of the fog now.
What's gone wrong again?

839
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:40.690
Now is the chance
There's only one time left.

840
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.730
Still, it’s become quite clear

841
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:52.200
I got that picture today
That's enough, okay?

842
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.550
[telephone ringing sound]

843
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.230

848
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.140

[Rhythmic music]

858
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.020
What happened?

859
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.520
I have to explain

860
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.590
(Haejun) What you saw, what you did

861
00:59:56.650 --> 00:59:58.860
I have to explain everything from beginning to end.

862
00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.520
You said you never left?

863
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.160
(Haejun) The time and place have changed.
The person just died

864
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.060
I've never died in a place like that.

865
01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.530
Everything is the origin
This is the end for us

866
01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.900
(Class leader) I’m not even from this village.
