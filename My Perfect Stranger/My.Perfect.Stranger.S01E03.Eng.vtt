[Doorbell sounds]
[Policeman sighs]

176
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.480
[Continued doorbell sound]

177
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.850
No, Detective Baek Dong-sik
Why did you come here?

178
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.090
(Haejun) Just a moment
I'll go out and come back

179
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.700
[Sound of door opening]

180
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.380
What's going on at this hour?

181
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.110
friendship police station
This is Baek Dong-sik, a homicide detective.

182
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.120
Because I have something to check
Please excuse me for a moment

183
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.220
no

184
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.850
explain what's going on
I think you missed it?

185
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.020
[laughter]

186
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.090
I need something like that now
Are you thinking, here?

187
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.690
(Policeman) Me, sir.

188
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.630
Try calling the chairman.

189
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.660
Moon Knight Youngnok and his son
It's nonsense that I say all the time.

190
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.430
Ha, how much trouble you must be in...

191
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.640
[Policeman sighs]

192
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.540
[Exciting music]

193
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.810
[sigh]

194
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.150
Let’s take a look at your ID, this time properly.

195
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.660
- yes?
- (Dongsik) Didn’t you hear?

196
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.630
Report of a suspicious person
Because I received it

197
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.160
Take out your ID.

198
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.270
I lost it last time

199
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.150
(Dongsik) If there wasn’t that level of sincerity

200
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.650
Is there another way to prove your identity?
I don't think it even exists

201
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.360
All right

202
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.360
let's go together

203
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.460
Oh, the police station?

204
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.760
- Follow me.
- (Yoonyoung) Brother, detective...

205
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.570
- (Dongsik) Follow me!
- (Yoonyoung) Hey...

206
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.270
[Dongsik sighs]

207
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.940
[Dongsik laughs]

208
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.450
Are you crazy?

209
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.880
Are you doing this because you trust the chairman?

210
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.150
This is happening now because of performance.
I know you're desperate.

211
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.620
(Haejun) I’m afraid your efforts will be in vain.
I'm here to help.

212
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.290
You're wasting time.

213
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.490
He's a friend with a solid identity.
Because there is a way to prove it

214
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.160
If you want
I can check for you directly.

215
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.560
[Interesting music]

216
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.000
[absurd gasping sound]

217
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.540
Do you have a clear identity?

218
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.810
yes

219
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.440
This friend...

220
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.920
This friend

221
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.920
Woojung High School 3rd grade class 1
Because I'm a student

222
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.190
(Yoonyoung) Yes

223
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.260
(Yoonyoung) Yes

224
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.370
[light sigh]

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.080
[bright music]
[Sound of female students talking]

226
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.590
- (Coast Guard) Hello
- (Yuri) Hello

227
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.820
(Eunha) Hello

228
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.150
(Yoonyoung) What year were you born?

229
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.250
Ah, born in 1965

230
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.290
650515-2...

231
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.990
(Female Student 1) Hello, teacher.

232
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.330
(Haejun) Uh, okay, hi, Miseon.
Is he immature?

233
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.860
- (Female Student 1) This is Mi-seon.
- (Haejun) Oh, okay.

234
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.530
I'm really sorry

235
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.470
What was next to that resident number 63?

236
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.370
[lively music]
[sigh]

237
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.540
Wait time, yeah

238
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.840
(Haejun) Come to work, come to work

239
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.080
(Yoonyoung) Why? why?
Where are you going when school is right around the corner? Why, why!

240
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.880
- (Haejun) Oh, come back to work, wait a minute.
- (Yoonyoung) Here, why? what?

241
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.980
[Haejun sighs]

242
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.490
[in a low voice] Why are you here?

243
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.860
(Haejun) Now this
how dangerous it is

244
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.990
You know that, right?

245
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.360
If something goes wrong, you or I

246
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.500
A very ambiguous ending here
that you will see

247
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.970
I know, I saw it and felt it yesterday.

248
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.770
I go to school to avoid making mistakes.

249
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.440
You have to speak clearly

250
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm going there for my own purposes.

251
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.710
Well, it was a crisis situation.
I admit it's a benefit

252
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.680
‘Dog profit’

253
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.450
(Haejun) Using words like that
Okay, sorry, I'll be careful.

254
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.520
Okay, sorry, I'll be careful.

255
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.290
It's my first time traveling through time

256
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.490
therefore

257
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.160
This is your first time traveling
Why on earth do you go to school?

258
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.970
There must be a story, just like you.

259
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.700
[Interesting music]

260
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.140
Did you think you wouldn't know?

261

Someone who says it is possible
Someone who says it is possible

262
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.410
In a different era
While preparing a house

263
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.910
Pretending to be a normal teacher
I was commuting to and from work regularly.

264
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.950
Commuting to and from work

265
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.150
It's a terrible thing just in this life.

266
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.830
Well, so sincere
a dangerous lie

267
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.300
As much as I put effort into it
There must be important and personal circumstances, right?

268
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.770
But I won’t ask, what is the situation?

269
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.740
'If you don't have the confidence to say it,
'Don't ask', what does that mean?

270
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.680
(Yoonyoung) Correct answer
[Haejun laughs]

271
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.810
Instead, like yesterday

272
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.450
Instead, like yesterday
Things that make things difficult

273
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.950
I will try my best not to

274
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.960
Until we go back
Because we're in the same boat

275
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.620
I just go to school

276
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.890
(Haejun) When I’m done, I come straight home.

277
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.230
Quietly so as not to stand out as much as possible

278
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.430
If what I do
If it gets in your way

279
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.530
School will be over by then.

280
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.970
Anytime that is

281
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.400
call

282
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.180
But will the detective from yesterday come visit again?

283
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.950
well

284
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.150
Let's go first

285
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.250

(Byung-gu) Ah, yes, yes, uh

289
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.670
Oh my, what is that again?
Are you worried?

290
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.840
Uh, don't worry, uh

291
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.240
Ah, when young people work
It could be, well, uh

292
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.450
Oh, and soon
Bring a bottle of makgeolli and come in, uh

293
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.480
I sent my only son away

294
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.790
Even thoughts of hostile friends
Do something, my friend.

Okay, okay.

Oh my, sorry, sorry

298
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.560

I am the first transfer student since the school was founded.

Ah, two by two.

303
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.770
And on the same day
[Byunggu’s laughter]

304
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.410
They even look a little like this

305
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.040
I'm sure you saw it roughly.

This is Mr. Hae-Jeon Yoon.

If you look this closely...

311
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.560
(Haejun) We don’t look alike

312
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.830
Doesn't look like...

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.300
(Byunggu) Anyway

314
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.310
Well, starting today, this way
I'm going to be your nephew's homeroom teacher.

Thanks to these friends, our village
It's so good to live like this

321
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.230
You should always be grateful, okay?

322
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.300
I would like to ask you to take care of me

Why did you do that yesterday?

325
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.340
Oh, I'm sorry, Chairman.

326
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:14.940
(Byunggu) Tsk, no.

327
00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.280
Well, I guess he’s a member of our family.
You didn't know, huh? uh

328
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.680
Now I'm a homeroom teacher and a parent.
We are all friends and family together.

329
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.190
So in the future
Take care of yourself, okay?

330

(Hee-seop) The second head?

331

Hey, with the first head
We all meet here and have fun

Boy, it's obvious

345
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.100
Are there people who don't come even though they are there?

[puck]

522
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.840
(Eunha and Yuri) Uh, are you okay?

523
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.180
- (Yuri) [surprised] Blood
- (Eunha) Blood me

524
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.980
[The Coast Guard grins]

525
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220
(Coast Guard) Is this crazy!

526
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.990
(Misuk) Could you please be quiet?

527
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.360
I can't see the letters

528
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.970
I think I've done enough.

529
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.040
[Coast Guard's exasperated breathing]

530
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.140
[Sound of running footsteps]

531
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.250
The five kings are coming, the five kings are coming!

532
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.890
(Yoonyoung) Why?

533
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.360
[Sparkling sound effect]
[Soft music]

534
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.020
- (Female Student 2) Dress up
- (Haejun) It’s okay, sit down.

535
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.180
(Pure Love) 5

536
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.190

537
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.790
- What are you counting?
- (Soonae) Shhh

538
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.560
this moment
You have to enjoy it as much as possible

539
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.760

1

542
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.640
After school
What did I tell you to do right away?

543
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.500
[Female students sigh]

544
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.610
(Female students) Home

545
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.110
(Haejun) Yes, straight home

546
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.210
[humorous music]
Don't stay out after 10pm

547
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.480
Studying doesn't even work in the reading room.

548
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.880
Just do it at home

549
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.990
If it doesn't work out, just sleep

550
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.620
Sleep is good for you

551
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.330
Mountains and rivers, not even during the day

552
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.990
Just don't go

553
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.530
Don't trust anyone

554
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.500
Don't trust anyone

555
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.870
Bad guys come with a smile

556
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.900
For now, school, home
Me, my friend next to me

557
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.870
Just wait a few months until you turn twenty

558
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.310
Just wait a few months until you turn twenty

559
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.140
From then on, I’m free

560
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:13.150
- also...
- (Yuri) Just teach, teacher.

561
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.890
open the book

562
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.590
(Soonae) That nagging bombardment
Just 5 seconds before it starts

563
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.670
[Interesting music]
They say I'm a prince for 5 seconds, so I'm a prince for 5 seconds

564
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.830
Ohwangi is my nickname.

565
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.440
Do I really have to listen to that every time?

566
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.000
It's terrible?

567
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.640
(Soon-ae) Don’t do anything, so
Also known as Prince Mara

568
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.580
Oh, it can't be too early.

569
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.650
(Yoonyoung) But constantly
Why do you name a prince?

570
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.220
How do you not put it on?

571
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.790
(Haejun) ‘Yongbieocheonga’
Production motive and

572
00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:59.090
Understand its purpose

573
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.300
The formal characteristics of ‘Yongbieocheonga’ and
About expressions

574
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.770
I understand

575
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.600
Okay, first one.

576
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.570
From the value of ‘Yongbieocheonga’
let's talk

577
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.710
As I briefly said yesterday

578
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.540
Uh, ‘Yongbieocheonga’ is in Korean.
It is the first Korean epic poem.

579
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.680
And of Akjang literature
Even in the sense that it is a representative work,

580
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.880
It has Korean literary value

581
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.150
This work was written in the late Goryeo Dynasty.
To study the language of the early Joseon Dynasty

582
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.690
As historical material
It has great value...

583
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.260
[School bell rings]
[Female students are noisy]

584
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.860
(Female students) Hello, teacher.

585
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.600
(Yoonyoung) Eoyu, I hate old people so much

586
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.110
I also absolutely hate ssambakjil

587
00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.440
(Haejun) Stay calm
That's what I said

588
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.410
From the first day of school
He must be like a UFC fighter, right?

589
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.980
Let's each do our own thing.
Do not criticize each other

590
00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.920
That's what I was trying to say

591
00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.760
in class
Please stop staring at me

592
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.390
[humorous music]

593
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.930
After class later
don't go anywhere

594
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.530
I stay in the classroom
I'll come pick you up

595
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.570
- (Misuk) Teacher
- (Haejun) Oh

596
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.700
Go your way

597
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.270
- gaga
- (Yoonyoung) Mistress

598
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.340
Informal...

599
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.710
Thank you earlier.

600
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.780
(Inexperienced) Writing homework
You praised me

601
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:32.120
(Haejun) Uh, no, whatever.
I said it was well written and well written.

602
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.620
It's not something to be thankful for

603
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.560
(Misook) This is for no reason
I was a little embarrassed to show it to you.

604
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.690
I really want to become a novelist later
Do you think it can be done?

605
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.300
then

606
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.630
Maybe not very later

607
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.900
I might become very famous

608
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.870
So try hard

609
00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.950
[Yoonyoung sighs]

610
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.350
(Yoonyoung) Do you know Go Mi-sook?

611
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.020
Well, he's a best-selling author.

612
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.530
There wasn't one in the bathroom.

613
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.900
Where did you go?

614
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.410
[Sound of a door slowly closing]
[secret music]

615
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.680
(Misook) Did you bring it?

616
00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.950
(Soonae) Uh, that...

617
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.120
Correct the awkward sentences

618
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.790
Some of the content is not correct
I fixed it a bit

619
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.100
[Sighing] Because of the writing.
You're the only one suffering for no reason

620
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.730
(Misuk) But

621
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.320
(Misuk) But

622
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.890
Almost all of the sentences I wrote are gone?

623
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.660
Ah, that...

624
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.600
(Misook) It’s okay

625
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.340
Well, that's the only way to get good results.

626
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.870
I wrote the original anyway.

627
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:38.180
Rewrite it, anyone can do it.

628
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.410
Isn't it?

629
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.650
Yeah, that's right

630
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.020
Then come out later

631
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:50.620
(Soonae) Yes

632
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.330
[dark music]

633
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.310
(Middle-aged immature) It has to go through your hands
Because the response is good

634
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.410
I don't really have any complaints either.

635
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.180
Rewrite it, anyone can do it.

636
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.310
You've been doing it this way forever?

637
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.450
(Yoonyoung) I was just wondering.
He was just the same person

638
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.360
You don't need anyone's help
Do you know how to write?

639
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.390
I've seen this for 6 years

640
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.500
Even just one writing assignment
I heard it was completed with someone else's help.

641
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.060
It's a bit surprising

642
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.630
Anyone can do it
If you think it can happen

643
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.800
you could do it yourself

644
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.440
Why other people's time
Even if you use someone else’s abilities

645
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.040
Are you that confident?

646
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.310
No, it's not proud.

647
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.520
yourself too
Because I think it's embarrassing

648
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.650
Hiding somewhere like this again
I'm talking about it

649
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.520
Something like this

650
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.130
At least we can't keep it a secret here

651
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.760
Let's go to the teacher's office.

652
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.770
[Immature scream]
[nervous music]

653

[Misuk sobs]

654
00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:59.280
(Soon-ae) Mi-sook, are you okay?

655
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.720
[Misuk continues to sob]

656
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.130
this

657
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.800
I do it because I want to.

658
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.200
Class is about to start, come quickly.

659
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.010
Baby, let's go

660
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.330
(Yoonyoung) What on earth did you do?

661
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.740
Mom like that
Are you stuck?

662
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.870
There's definitely something

663
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.620
Is this your first time seeing this face?

664
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.320
Is this 3rd grade class 1?

665
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.660
[Beomryong’s urgent sound]

666
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.200
Is Sunae Lee in your class?

667
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.030
Pure love?

668
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.940
Why Sunae?

669
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.670
Ugh, to that kid.

670
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.170
Could you pass this on to me?

671
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.950
Yoo Beom-ryong

672
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.980
[Beomryong’s embarrassed sound]

673
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.120
Now you
Do you know how suspicious it looks?

674
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.800
(Haejun) The hallway where the girls’ classroom is located
Are the school rules funny?

675
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.700
Are the school rules funny?
[Beomryong’s shy sound]

676
00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.140
Oh, no, sir.
Sin, sin, sin, I'm sorry

677
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.440
you follow me

678
00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.910
you follow me

679
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.690
“Let’s move toward autonomy, creativity, and intelligence.”
[Grass bug crying]

680

[dark music]

681
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.560
(Female Student 3) See you tomorrow, bye.

682
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.730
(Yoonyoung) Go Mi-sook really
If they even stole the novel my mother wrote,

683
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.870
Today's work is just the beginning

684
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.210
(Yoonyoung)

685
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.550
I feel uncomfortable leaving it like that
I can't even sleep properly

686
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.030
Ah, but why don’t you come like this?

687
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.800
He told me to wait and not go anywhere.

688
00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.600
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

689
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.370
[Meaningful music]

690
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.210
be careful

691
00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.850
what?

692
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.850
Be careful, Yoon Young-ah.

693
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.840
(Teacher) Are you really going to just leave?

694
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.300
The principal said today's dinner party is really

695
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.210
