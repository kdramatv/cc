Just standing still and looking at me

77
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.690
At first I wondered what it was, but

Suddenly a bit
I feel like I'm getting sad

Did you feel a little strange?

No, well, before I saw it.
Should I say so?

Don’t you know how to eat Ssanghwacha?

109

(Haejun) No, it’s someone else
No matter how I eat it or not, why...

Just eat it with seaweed, it’s easy

117

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.910
Today is the day I am discharged from the hospital.

173
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.650
I have something to talk about, so I'll do it at the same time

174
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.120
I guess my uncle knows everything now.

175
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.630
Who are the dead people in this town?

176
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.230
[Calm music plays]
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

177
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.150
[sigh]

178
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.690
(Haejun) And the murder case
I know it has nothing to do with it.

179
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.900
But

180
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.300
With two victims
What had the most contact points was

181
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.140
Because it's not Baek Hee-seop, it's you

182
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.170
Can you tell me something?

183
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.940
[Meaningful music]

184
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.940
[sigh]

185
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.520
(Haejun) Jooyoung Lee
I came back to the village again

186
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.750
It was because of Baek Yu-seop.

187
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.820
They wanted to leave together

188
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.620
The reason I came to this town in the first place
It was thanks to Baek Yu-seop

189
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.460
maybe

190
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.030
A simple relationship between seniors and juniors
I don't think it was

191
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.630
But why didn't you leave?

192
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.770
A few days later
It was Baek Yu-seop's parents' anniversary.

193
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.170
(Haejun) If you leave to avoid the police,

194
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.840
When will I be able to come back?
Because I don't know

195
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.610
For that day, I was with my younger brother Baek Hee-seop.
I wanted to be with you

196
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.250
So just for a few days
They said they decided to hide in this town.

197
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.590
But somehow
The place where the two people hid

198
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.620
It was an abandoned house.

199
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.090
- No way...
- (Haejun) That’s right.

200
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.200
The abandoned house where Lee Kyung-ae was found

201
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.940
(Yuseop) Probably
Even on the night of the incident

202
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.710
I think he was trying to find us.

203
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.010
(Yuseop) Are you okay?

204
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.250
(Haejun) When he disappeared that day

205
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.920
Secretly following Baek Yu-seop
Looks like I stepped on it

206
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.660
[clattering sound]

207
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.570
[Embarrassed laughter]

208
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.570
[Yuseop’s voice]

209
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.710
(Haejun) Anyway
The three became friends

210
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.410
Lee Kyung-ae kept a secret.
[Sound of friendly conversation]

211
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.580
[dark music]
After hearing our situation

212
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.320
I want to help you with something

213
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.990
I asked if you needed anything

214
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.790
[Grass bug crying]

215
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.090
(Yuseop) Probably

216
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.500
I think he was trying to bring that to me.

217
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.730
(Yuseop) At that time, I
Even if I didn’t go to Seoul

218
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.000
Even if it wasn't so different

219
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.140
I could have protected them both

220
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.350
[Meaningful music]

221
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.420
In the meantime, to me
The biggest question was

222
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.360
(Haejun) It was this sentence.

223
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.660
‘Women who read books are dangerous’

224
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.160
What on earth does this mean?

225
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.000
Why did the criminal use this sentence?
Did they leave it for the victims?

226
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.000
[intense music]

227
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.980
To Jooyoung Lee
There was a book

228
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.780
But

229
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.750
It was only Jooyoung Lee.

230
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.590
[Soaring music]

231
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.730
There was nothing for Lee Kyung-ae.
[Music getting heavier]

232
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.330
I knew that

233
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.930
(Haejun) That night
The reason Lee Kyung-ae went to an abandoned house

234
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.470
Baek Yoo-seop, Joo-young Lee

235
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.510
These two are the only ones
things you said you needed

236
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.140
What was that?

237
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.380
It was a book?

238
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.650
[nervous music]

239
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.320
"Jane Eyre"

240
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.630
(Haejun) If that happens

241
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.930
To the victims
We really have something in common.

242
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.660
the book I had

243
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.240
I don't know if this is some kind of warning

244
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100
But where did the book go?

245
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.810
Why weren't you there?

246
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.010
So much so that I even wrote this sentence
If you were paying attention

247
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.980
The criminal may have taken it.

248
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.650
(Haejun) I don’t know why

249
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.590
[sound of door slamming]

250
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.360
[sound of banging]

251
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.160
[Someone’s soft moan]

252
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.700
[Sound of opening]

253
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.500
(Yeonwoo) Uh, bro, over there

254
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.540
I know the terms we promised

255
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.440
[Yeonwoo’s labored groans]

256
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.480
I decided to just go in and out of the garage.
I know I did it

257
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.050
Uh, I know.

258
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.380
[groan]

259
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.850
[Sound of Yeonwoo taking a breath]
why so

260
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.920
Are you breathing foul?

261
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.020
I feel like I'm dying, number two

262
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.390
(Yeonwoo) Something big, something big

263
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.630
- Wait.
- (Yeonwoo) Uh oh

264
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.560
No, no...
[Interesting music]

265
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.430
(Haejun) Mr. Yoonyoung
I need to get rid of that quickly...

266
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.500
Ah...

267
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.810
[groans with difficulty]

268
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.440
[Yeonwoo’s heavy breathing]

269
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.580
(Yeonwoo) Where are you? Where...

270
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.520
Huh?

271
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.420
[Yeonwoo’s urgent breathing]

272
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.750
[Yeonwoo’s labored groans]

273
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.190
[urgent sound]

274
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.460
[Moon So-ri]

275
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.310
[refreshing sound]

276
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.280
[Sound of clicking lock]

277
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.590
(Haejun) Sometimes I do that

278
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.790
I forgot that I'm the type with a weak gut.

279
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.860
(Yoonyoung) You can do it like this, okay?

280
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.160
I stay almost all day

281
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.670
The reason they can’t even use the bathroom is
Too thin for our hero

282
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.600
(Haejun) Yes

283
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.810
But why was it a book?

284
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.440
‘Women who read books are dangerous’

285
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.250
After all, the person who read that book and made it
That's me

286
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.450
[Meaningful music]

287
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.820
(Yoonyoung) This is everything
Is this a coincidence?

288
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.590
In the end, my mom too
He was a person who wanted to write a book

289
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.360
So did Go Mi-sook.

290
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.730
Maybe all of this

291
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.770
It might not be just a coincidence
I keep thinking about it

292
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.880
[Meaningful sound effects]

293
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.130
[light sigh]

294
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.370
[Emotional music]

295
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.140
[Rain sound]

296
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.180
[Dryer operating sound]
(Kyeongae) What are you going to do for me?

297
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.740
(Soonae) What?

298
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.510
(Kyeongae) No
[Sound of dryer running silently]

299
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.350
I also pay your tuition
What are you going to do for me?

300
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.190
(Soonae) Sister also has this
They say I stole my father’s emergency fund.

301
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.920
(Kyeongae) Ah
Is stolen money not even money?

302
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.320
This won't work very well

303
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.430
You give this to me, father, father!

304
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.830
(Soonae) What can I do for you?

305
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.960
[Kyungae’s heavy breathing]

306
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.630
my name

307
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.500
(Kyeongae) Ah, you later
Well, if I become a novelist

308
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.810
In that corner

309
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.310
Please type my name in three letters.

310
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.480
What is that?

311
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.810
Ah, what a girl.
It's so amazing

312
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.380
(Kyeongae) Hey, huh? People

313
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.250
Well, at best
I may die before I live even a hundred years, but

314
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.420
Books last a thousand years, ten thousand years.

315
00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:02.160
So, there are three letters of my name
If I just write it down like this, okay?

316
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.870
‘This Lee Kyung-ae
'I once lived in the world'

317
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.670
That's what stays, forever

318
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.040
do you like that?

319
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.470
Why is it bad?

320
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.970
Hey, even after a thousand years, huh?

321
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.610
Lee Kyung-ae
This world just knows everything?

322
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.720
(Kyungae) My sister is definitely
I will become a famous person

323
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.120
[Pure love’s laughter]

324
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.350
Are you laughing?

325
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.190
Hey, the Korean language teacher next door too.
I said I have a lot of sense

326
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.460
Well, even if it's not Miss Korea
I heard there is a way to get it on TV?

327
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.300
Ah, Sunae.

328
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.600
When I become very famous

329
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.200
I'm just blocking my tracks

330
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.640
Here and there, here and there
Are you going to leave it all behind?

331
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.440
[Smirk] ‘Everyone!
Here in this friendship'

332
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.040
‘With our Lee Hyung-man,
‘Our Park Ok-ja’s first daughter’

333
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.980
‘Our Miss Lee Kyung-ae’

334
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.180
'Very fun'

335
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.180
‘Ah, I had a fun life.’
[Pure love’s laughter]

336

[Kyung-ae is humming]

337
00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.720
Like this

338
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.590
So you must write it down too.
Okay?

339
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.630
Ha, it's not responding again.

340
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.730
[Soonae’s surprised voice]

341
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.260
(Soonae) No, no, no
Oh, no, no, no.

342
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.100
(Kyungae) Come to work
Do you know how many times this is now?

343
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.400
[Both laugh]

344
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.670

519
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.690
Especially that drumming saint.

520
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.560
One day, to that saint
A big crisis has come

521
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.500
What crisis?

522
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:38.800
[Heeseop sighs]

523
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.240
sudden poop

524
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.610
[lively music]

525
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.650
(Heeseop) Die or die?

526
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.550
A decision must be made immediately
It was like that

527
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.290
At that time, the saint
I mean, I looked around.

528
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.090
No, at least it's a town club performance.

529
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.590
stop it
What's going on?

530
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.090
But that saint was for the audience

531
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.130
I stayed there until the end.

532
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.330
Cheap? On the spot?

533
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.300
uh

534
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.410
[scareful breathing]

535
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.210
What is the moral of this dirty talk?

536
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.910
I started it once and it blew.
That it has to end

537
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:23.950
[Resolute breathing]

538
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.320
[Heeseop sighs]

539
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.690
the novel

540
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.230
It's yours, Sunae.

541
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.700
(Hee-seop) Oh, that’s right.
I have to risk my life to protect it until the end.

542
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.570
I go out in front of you
I'm cheering you on while shaking so hard

543
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.110
What if you give up? huh?

544
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.810
What should I do if I forget?

545
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.420
[Sound of running footsteps]

546
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.260
(Okja) This damn bitch

547
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.290
- (Soonae) Mom
- Why aren't you proud of me? uh?

548
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.760
- (Soonae) Huh?
- (Okja) You

549
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.330
I am your sister
When you say you're doing Miss Korea

550
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.000
When you say you're a singer

551
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.610
You didn't nod even once

552
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.670
Do you know how much I regret that?

553
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.780
[Calm music]

554
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.480
[patting sound]

555
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.020
Don't be discouraged and have a nice trip, okay?

556
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.760
[lively music]
[Oncoming bus engine sound]

557
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.540
let's go

558
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.180
[Crying] What?

559
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.820
How far did the rumor go?

560
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.160
Originally a bad thing
You have to spread the word far and wide

561
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.690
(Yoonyoung) So the bad bitch gets punished

562
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.270
(Yoonyoung) That’s quite a bit
It was a familiar road

563
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.640
About 30 years in the future
It was the publishing company I was going to work for.

564
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.880
Going with my mom is
Although this was my first time

565
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.690
[Knocking sound]

566
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.130
(Yoonyoung) And there

567
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.030
I was very familiar with it
The face was sitting

568
00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.540
The real novelist has arrived

569
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.610
Would you like to talk about it properly?

570
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.280
Not really

571
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.680
(Misuk) These two
I'm just doing this now

572
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.950
What are you doing here?
This is not usually a problem

573
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.860
The book has already been published

574
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.590
At bookstores nationwide
With my name and my photo

575
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.260
Everything is selling out

576
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.490
If this gets bigger
Can you take responsibility?

577
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.230
Is there any evidence?

578
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.000
It's already your parents
You're so heartbroken

579
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.840
Is it really okay to do things like this?

580
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.440
(Misook’s mother) When the lawyer comes
Let's talk, senior.

581
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.110
(Yoonyoung) The criminals were definitely looking for evidence.

582
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.880
the evidence you say

583
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:48.320
The note you stole
If you're talking about it, there's no such thing.

584
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.020
But to write a novel

585
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.590
Do you think it will end with just one notebook?
[Meaningful music]

586
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.940
This is a novel I've been writing for two years.

587
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.050
(Soon-ae) If you look at the sentences that were erased while being written.

588
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.350
What meaning does a word contain?
Things I scribbled

589
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.860
The chapter I tried to add but left out
It's all in there

590
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.990
You'll know when you see it.

591
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.500
You'll know it when you see it, it's true

592
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.330
After reading all my novel notes,
He made it himself.

593
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400
If you ask me, I can answer everything.

594
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.470
It's all about the novel

595
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.970
I can do everything, I

596
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.140
you can't do that

597
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.240
Go Mi-sook

598
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.020
[Publishing company representative sighs]

599
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.730
(Misuk Mo) Senior, what are you doing?

600
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.070
[Sound of paper turning]
(Publishing company representative) You know it when you see it.

601
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.700
Then you should see it

602
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.870
And I have to ask

603
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.470
I have a lot of questions, I too

604
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.440
[Immature mock embarrassing noise]

605
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.280
(Misuk) Mom, mom

606
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.080
[Misook’s urgent breathing]

607
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.850
[Sound of door closing]

608
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.390
(Publishing company representative) Yes
First of all, what has been distributed so far is

609
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.000
We plan to retrieve the entire amount.

610
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.730
All author interviews are canceled.

611
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.140
No, very soon
We will republish it.

612
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.570
Oh, the content of the novel doesn't change.

613
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.810
With the author's name
There will be some changes to the cover.

614
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.510
yes, yes

615
00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.120
Let’s schedule the interview again then.

616
00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.550
[Laughing] Yes, thank you.

617
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.390
(Yoonyoung) In my mother’s name
On the first page of a new novel

618
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.460
My mom said this phrase
I asked you to put it in

619
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.060
[Emotional music]

620
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:16.140
(Soonae) Living in Ujeong-ri
The first daughter of Lee Hyeong-man and Park Ok-ja

621
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.540
I dedicate this novel to Lee Kyung-ae.

622
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.280
(Yoonyoung) And
I learned even the smallest secret

623
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.650
[Yoonyoung’s relieved breathing]

624
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.790
[Yoonyoung laughs]

625
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.030
I have a question

626
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:49.300
In a letter to Y
Who is Y?

627
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.270
[Soonae’s light smile]

628
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.640
(Soonae) Um...

629
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:59.910
I

630
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.080
Name of a friend you would like to meet later

631
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:14.290
(Yoonyoung) In the distant future

632
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.700
When you give birth to your own daughter
The name you want to give

633
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.800
They said it was the first initial.

634
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:23.240
In other words, like the Y in ‘Yoonyoung’

635
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.310
(Soon-ae) Thank you, Yoon Young-a

636
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.680
It's all thanks to you that I found my novel

637
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.580
me too

638
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.790
It's all thanks to you

639
00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.580
(Yoonyoung) Really

640
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.320
It was a really happy day

641
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.520
So far in my life
A perfectly happy day

642
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.230
I don't think there was one

643
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.410
(Misuk) Mom, mom, don’t do this

644
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.510
[Sobbing] Mom

645
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.510
If you're going to do something ignorant like this
What do you read books for?

646
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.520
(Misuk’s mother) I have to tear it all up, huh?

647
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.150
I was wrong, Mom.

648
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.320
(Misook’s mother) A gift for me?

649
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:51.260
Achieve my unfulfilled dream instead?
[dark music]

650
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.030
[Laughs] It's not even funny

651
00:43:54.690 --> 00:44:00.000
I'm not good enough like you
It's my shame to have you as my daughter

652
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.070
Do you know?

653
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.040
[Misook’s angry voice]

[Tense sound effect]

[Meaningful sound effects]

[sigh]
[Sound of the door slowly opening]

666
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.810
(Yoonyoung) What are you doing here?

667
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.110
It looks like you were sleeping soundly

668
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.820
Surely again?

669
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.920
[sigh]

670
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.990
(Yoonyoung) Can I come next to you?
It's scary

671
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.480
It's better now

672
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:46.060
(Haejun) I’m tired from going to Seoul
I thought I could sleep well

673
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.830
Something good happened

674
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.840
(Yoonyoung) That’s right

675
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.240
I thought I could do that too

676
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.410
Like I drank about 100 glasses of cider

677
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.150
Under Go Mi-sook’s power
My 6 years worth of sadness

678
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.450
It was completely washed away, obviously

679
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.220
[Yoonyoung sighs]

680
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.960
But the nightmare never ends

681
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.730
What kind of dream was this?

682
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.000
Is it really a secret until the end?

683
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.940
(Yoonyoung) One day nearby
I think it was work

684
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.780
I fixed the time machine
I went back to the future

685
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.950
(Haejun) Um

686
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.420
Mom and Dad too

687
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.720
Everything is just as I imagined
It had changed

688
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.450
It looked really good

689
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.390
Everything looked good, but why?

690
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:47.030
(Yoonyoung) But

691
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.970
[Calm music]

692
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.000
No

693
00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.210
Oh, you’re going to hang up here like this?

694
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.770
Oh, that's just a dream

695
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.610
It's not fun and it's meaningless
A weird, messy movie

696
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.380
(Haejun) Um

697
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.750
[Haejun laughs]

698
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.960
I did it a while ago
I actually came to see a movie.

699
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.800
I also saw a person called Mom, there

700
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:28.870
I felt strange

701
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.270
Facing the person who abandoned me

702
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.140
[ringing footsteps]

703
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:42.410
(Haejun) 1988
1 year from now

704
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.380
Someone who will leave me as soon as I am born

705
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.820
(Yoonyoung) Oh, this is

706
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.090
It's not a dream, it's a real story, right?

707
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.700
Should I pretend it was a dream?

708
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.740
(Haejun) If you tried to find it
I'm sure you could have found it

709
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.140
Well, what a wide world it is

710
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.550
Even if there was no such thing as a time machine
As much as you want

711
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:18.980
Where and how do you live?
I could have figured it out

712
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.620
But I didn't do it

713
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.820
I didn't find it, not even once.

714
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.700
Because it was his choice

715
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.900
To each other forever
Let's live as someone who doesn't have anything

716
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.870
Because it means you wanted that for me.

717
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:43.210
Yeah

718
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.550
So until now
I've lived so well

719
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.280
This damn car...

720
00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.360
Is this just an excuse?

721
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.890
I just wanted to see you once.

722
00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.000

[Haejun sighs]

724
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.640
(Haejun) Because I saw it, it’s really over

725
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.640
I guess I was just dreaming for a moment
I think it will pass like that

726
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.780
I'm here anyway
Because that's what needs to be done

727
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:31.020
To people who shouldn't interfere
What not to do

728
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.770
It's a dream

729
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.940
Actually in my dream...

730
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.810
[Sound of door opening]
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

731
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.350
(Yeonwoo) I...

732
00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.350
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

733
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.150
brother

734
00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.130
(Minsu) [in a drunken voice]
You want to talk more?

735
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.660
[Laughs] With me?

736
00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.370
What kind of crazy thing are you talking about again?

737
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.570
[Blubbering] Huh?

738
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.470
[secret music]

739
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.810
Do you remember?

740
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.020
(Misook) During summer vacation when I was thirteen years old

741
00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:35.850
you are the first

742
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.720
You started hitting me in your room.

743
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:44.760
Lucky for me

744
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.400
엄마가 봤지

745
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.200
그날 얼마나 슬프셨겠어

746
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.940
평생을 남편한테
두들겨 맞으면서 살았는데

747
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.710
하나뿐인 딸이

748
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.690
너 같은 새끼한테
또 얻어맞는 걸 봐야 한다는 게

749
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.690
진짜 뭐라는 거야, 이 미친년이?

750
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.160
(Misuk) But
Was it because he was so sad?

751
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.630
You pretended not to notice and passed by?

752
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.540
That's right

753
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.520
There were many moments after that.

754
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.520
Am I by any chance an invisible person?

755
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.390
[heavy music]
It hurts

756
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.490
Even if I scream and cry because it’s painful

757
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:50.860
At that house I just

758
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.570
You were a nobody, brother.

759
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.500
So I wanted to show you

760
00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:00.870
To mom

761
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.140
I wanted to show it to my mom

762
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.580
[sigh]

763
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.950
Is your hand completely healed?

764
00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:17.220
(Minsu) What?

765
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.800
Because I keep drinking alcohol

766
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.980
It takes this long

(Minsu) Are you crazy?

770
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.020
How long has it been since you called me? Come now!

771
00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:50.760
What about an umbrella?

772
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.090
Oh, it's raining like this
Well, write something and go!

773
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.900
Did you bring any money?

774
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.300
[Laughing] Hey

775
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.600
If you treat me like this
Do you think mom will just leave it alone?

776
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.670
uh?

777
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.170
[Blubbering] Hey, why don’t you wake up quickly?

778
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.580
Mistress

779
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:18.380
Ah, gently, gently

Hey, you bastard

784
00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.160
Ah...

785
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.430
I told you it hurts!

786
00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.860
be careful

796

Does it hurt a lot?

797
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.000
How much does it hurt?

798
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:15.740

Uh, you know, write it.

803
00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.350
Sometimes when I look at this car

804
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.320
(Yeonwoo) Do you feel a little strange?

805
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.130
Oh, I know it doesn't make sense.
I know, but

806
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.330
Things that shouldn't be here
Do you feel like you're being watched?

Uh, no
No, no, no, uh

Ah, well, something like that.
I guess it doesn't matter

810
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.280
Uh, right

811
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.250

(Misook) From now on, what I’m saying is

820

Everything is a secret
Can you do it?

821
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.710
If it becomes known, I might die.

You won't get hurt

It was an incident in the village.
