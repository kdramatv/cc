let's go

869
01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:55.455
(Misuk) At the intersection in town
There is a big hospital

870
01:00:55.535 --> 01:00:57.785
My mom is a doctor there.

871
01:00:57.875 --> 01:01:00.165
If it gets worse
Take me right away

872
01:01:00.245 --> 01:01:01.665
I'll talk to you nicely.

873
01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:06.795
(Yoonyoung) Let’s go, let’s go, Sunae.

874
01:01:09.595 --> 01:01:11.845
(Coast Guard) I’m sorry, Sunae.

875
01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:14.975
See you at school tomorrow

876
01:01:21.315 --> 01:01:23.395
[Grass bug crying]

877
01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:26.145
[Dog barking in the distance]

878
01:01:30.695 --> 01:01:33.405
(Soonae) I’m sorry, sister.
Because I can't swim

879
01:01:33.495 --> 01:01:35.075
Because of me...

880
01:01:45.415 --> 01:01:47.505
Are they all from the same school as you?

881
01:01:48.545 --> 01:01:49.885
Go Mi-sukdo?

882
01:01:50.465 --> 01:01:53.265
Yes, we are classmates

883
01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:56.765
I fell into the water and couldn't save myself.
How can you be a friend if you just watch?

884
01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:00.805
[Angrily breathing]

885
01:02:04.985 --> 01:02:06.735
(Yoonyoung) To me
You can be honest

886
01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:11.445
Are they harassing you?

887
01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:12.615
I was just kidding.

888
01:02:13.285 --> 01:02:15.195
I was just kidding.

889
01:02:16.075 --> 01:02:17.705
[Sighing] Just kidding...

890
01:02:19.245 --> 01:02:21.375
How can something like that be a joke, Sunae?

891
01:02:23.705 --> 01:02:25.665
Just pretend you didn't see it, sister.

892
01:02:26.545 --> 01:02:27.665
[sigh]

893
01:02:27.755 --> 01:02:29.215
(Soonae) Still

894
01:02:29.295 --> 01:02:32.215
something we can talk about at school
They are the only kids

895
01:02:34.385 --> 01:02:37.725
Everyone doesn't like me very much.

896
01:02:38.515 --> 01:02:40.975
[Calm music]

897
01:02:41.055 --> 01:02:44.185
So with me
They don't want to talk about it.

898
01:02:44.855 --> 01:02:46.395
therefore

899
01:02:47.355 --> 01:02:49.775
I have to continue to be friends with them.

900
01:02:51.485 --> 01:02:53.945
It should all just be a joke

901
01:02:55.695 --> 01:02:57.115
therefore

902
01:02:59.205 --> 01:03:01.245
So...

903
01:03:08.545 --> 01:03:10.545
[Crying] I want to die

904
01:03:29.815 --> 01:03:31.025
(Kyung-ae) Hey, Lee Soon-ae!

905
01:03:32.605 --> 01:03:34.065
What are you doing there?

906
01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:35.405
Don’t you come in quickly?

907
01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:40.035
Today's work must be done
You have to keep it a secret.

908
01:03:42.995 --> 01:03:44.375
(Soonae) Come in quickly.

909
01:03:49.375 --> 01:03:51.125
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

910
01:03:54.135 --> 01:03:56.845
[Roaring sound]

911
01:04:10.775 --> 01:04:12.895
[Car starting sound]

912
01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:15.815
"Time travel system"
[dark music]

913
01:04:22.575 --> 01:04:24.115
[Haejun sighs in relief]

914
01:04:40.715 --> 01:04:42.595
[Sound of door opening and closing]

915
01:05:00.535 --> 01:05:02.285
I think I realized it too late

916
01:05:04.905 --> 01:05:07.245
I think I realized it too late

917
01:05:10.245 --> 01:05:11.495
Have you ever tried it?

918
01:05:11.585 --> 01:05:13.715
[heavy music]

919
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.755
If only I had noticed a little earlier

920
01:05:20.805 --> 01:05:22.715
If only I had known a little earlier

921
01:05:24.765 --> 01:05:26.685
Everything might have been different

922
01:05:29.265 --> 01:05:30.475
[sigh]

923
01:05:31.685 --> 01:05:33.315
But not here

924
01:05:35.735 --> 01:05:37.775
Not here yet
It's not too late for anything

925
01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:39.155
Because before everything happened

926
01:05:41.985 --> 01:05:44.495
[nervous music]

927
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:46.615
I'm sorry

928
01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:51.205
me now
I don't think I can go back

929
01:05:54.915 --> 01:05:56.875
'Cause there's work to be done, here

930
01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:08.185
[Soaring music]

931
01:06:14.525 --> 01:06:16.605
[Rhythmic music]

932
01:06:40.715 --> 01:06:42.925
(Yoonyoung) School.
I need to go there, I

933
01:06:43.005 --> 01:06:45.555
When you remove your makeup, the accumulated time
Because it’s a face I can’t tell well.

934
01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.475
That's it now
Do you think it makes sense?

935
01:06:47.595 --> 01:06:49.185
(Haejun) Even
Not as a teacher but as a student?

936
01:06:49.265 --> 01:06:51.305
(Dongsik) Let’s look at your ID.
This time properly

937
01:06:51.395 --> 01:06:53.145
Do you have a clear identity?

938
01:06:53.225 --> 01:06:56.525
This friend is from Woojung High School
I'm a 3rd year, 1st class student.

939
01:06:56.605 --> 01:06:58.565
- (Soonae) What happened?
- (Yoonyoung) Nice to meet you?

940
01:06:58.645 --> 01:07:01.155
(Coast Guard) I sat down with my shit on.

941
01:07:01.235 --> 01:07:03.275
(Haejun) At that time
List of likely suspects

942
01:07:03.365 --> 01:07:04.405
There are three people in total.

943
01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:07.495
as close as possible
I will watch among them.

944
01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:10.155
School, we'll start there.

945
