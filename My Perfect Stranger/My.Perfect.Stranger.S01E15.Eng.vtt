Is it true?

39
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.900
I came to your house during the day too.

40
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.870
Anyway, my plan was already ruined.

41
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.010
I heard you wanted to hear that

Although it's easier to miss

What happens?

98
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.660
I completed my research well.

99
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.730
They should be punished properly.

100
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.730
(Dongsik) That’s it

101
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.500
This is probably what Teacher Hae-jun Yoon also wants.

102
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.250
(Yoonyoung) As long as I get caught
I thought it would all end

I don't know if it's possible

106

Still...

[sigh]

108
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.280
But now to that person

109
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.220
maybe it never ends
I feel like it's happened

110
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.020
I'm so scared of that

111
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.290
How could that person
Can you give me this answer?

112
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.230
That's so pitiful

113
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.900
[sniffling]

114
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.250
(Byung-gu) That kid

115
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.080
That kid really did it
You mean they made it like that?

[Byunggu’s trembling breathing]

117
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.370
When Yeonwoo returns
I personally picked you up at the airport.

118
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.240
no, in my car
After driving for over four hours round trip, I

119
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.310
He said he came back with that kid next to him.

120
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.010
And at that time
There was already a dead person in town

121
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.310
There was chaos
on my way back

122
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.550
I saw it with that kid.
But how...

123
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.120
Chairman

124
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.490
Have you checked your passport?

passport?

[Meaningful music]

127
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.710
(Dongsik) Yeonwoo is in this village
The first time I came

128
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.280
More than the Chairman knows
It was much earlier

129
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.850
I was suspicious from the beginning
The reason why it couldn't be done

130
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.310
That's why

131
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.220
Yeonwoo

132
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.820
He fooled everyone from the beginning.

133
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.990
Even the day I returned to this village.

134
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.460
[Slight moan]

135
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.830

[Dongsik sighs]

137
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.540
(Dongsik) When, where, and how
Did you commit a crime?

138
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.570
Now say it with your own mouth

139
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.080
It hurts

140
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.580
Don't be fooled, Mr. Lee.

141
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.780
(Dongsik) Speak straight!

142
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.520
(Yeonwoo) It hurts

143
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.020
This arm that you shot

144
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.520
Are you saying it hurts?

145
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.830
I guess I need some treatment
I think I should get it

146
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.430
my father
Can you please call me?

147
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.900
(Dongsik) You now
Do you know where this is?

148
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.170
you are here
You don’t know why I came in!

149
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.110
I'm not sure

150
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.750
Could it be that you are
Could you explain?

151
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.050
what?

152
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.420
It's like evidence.
[dark music]

153
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.590
If you could at least show me something like that...

154
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.500
Why?

155
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.340
Nothing like that?

156
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.340
[light laughter]

157
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.510
By now, my house, my room

158
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.380
You've probably already searched everything.

159
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.260
But what's missing?

160
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.260
[Yeonwoo laughs]

161
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.100
Of course not

162
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.670
Because I didn't do that

163
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.810
Right?

164
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.280

Are you okay?

168
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.180
(Yoonyoung) Can you come to your senses?

169
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.920
What happened to the culprit?

170
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.090
It's over, now

171
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.560
(Yoon Young) Detective Baek Dong-sik took him away.
I'm investigating

[Haejun sighs]

173
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.520
Are you going to keep avoiding my eyes?

[Calm music]

175
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.260
I'm sorry

176
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.040
(Haejun) I made you lose your family
I hurt you

177
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.740
He was my father

178
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.640
I too from that horrible person.
I'm the one who started it

179
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.620
That terrible person
I hurt you too

180
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.850
(Yoonyoung) But why are you
Are you sorry?

181
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.620
you and me

182
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.190
What our family had to go through
In all of this

183
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.100
It's not your fault at all

As soon as I found out, I ran away.

I saw that you even lied about your entry date.

I don't think it's just one or two things.

But just

201
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.960
There isn't a single solid evidence

It's just leisure

Probably enough to not be noticed
Looks like they put it away properly.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.810
Is it the same as what was written on the note?
Have you checked?

It's not something you can hide.

227
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.990
(Dongsik) So it’s frustrating.

228
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.830
Just like when Go Min-su

He's probably left town by now.

240

Because I was the one who wanted to do that.

(Byung-gu) No, what is that...

(Haejun) Yes

721
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.570
(Okja) Where are you going?
Can you please tell me?

722
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.710
‘Where are you probably now?’
so that you know

723
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.910
At least somewhere

724
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.880
It's a bit far away.

725
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.990
(Haejun) Stay healthy for a long time

726
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.690
I will definitely come to see you

727
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.980
(Yoonyoung) We are really leaving, we are leaving

728
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.780
(Haejun) That’s right

729
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:01.680
It's been a while since I'm going to travel back in time

730
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.980
I'm a little nervous

731
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.920
Aren’t you sad?

732
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.890
What is it?

733
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.560
Just leaving without saying goodbye

734
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.870
(Yoonyoung) With your grandfather
To my mother

735
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:24.040
Especially my mother goes here
It might really be the last time

736
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:28.010
To see those people
I didn't even come

737
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.140
If you do this, you've seen a lot.

738
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.710
It's enough

739
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:42.590
What are you going to do first when you get back?

740
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.060
(Haejun) What do you want to do?

741
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.390
(Yoonyoung) Iced Caramel Macchiato
Let’s drink something super sweet.

742
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.230
If you eat it with salt bread,
Do you know how delicious it is?

743
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.100
(Haejun) As expected, that guy’s sweet salty salty salty

744
00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:56.970
[Both laugh]

745
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:17.920
[Gear operation sound]

746
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:27.470
[Yoonyoung’s nervous breathing]

747
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.710
[Yoonyoung sighs]

748
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:35.910
(Yoonyoung) I’m really a bit nervous.

749
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.310
don't worry

750
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.710
It's over in the blink of an eye

751
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.080
(Haejun) As long as you pass through that tunnel,

752
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.350
Like a lie, it’s our home ground

753
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.990
It will arrive in 2021

754
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.860
[deep breath]

755
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.860
Okay, let's go.

756
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.160
[Nervous breathing]

757
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.530
[Dreamy music]

758
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.150
[Soaring music]

759
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.500
[Music cuts out]

760
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.370
Have you arrived?

761
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:40.570
(Yoonyoung) Have you arrived?

762
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.280
Is it 21?

763
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.650
It’s smoother than you think, isn’t it?

764
00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.350
(Haejun) It’s been a while since I came here so I’m confused.

765
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.390
Is that right, 2021?

766
00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.030
Or is it not possible?

767
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.590
[The sound of rustling gets closer]

768
01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.170
- (Chief) Teacher Yoon!
- (Haejun) Ah, yes, yes

769
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.070
(Chief) Hey, Teacher Yoon!

770
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.510
[Sound of clanking tiller]

771
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.580
I didn't say anchor.
In 21?

772
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:24.220
[Rhythmic music]

773
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.500
[Haejun sighs]

774
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:47.370
(Haejun) June 14, 1987
10:40 PM

775
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.440
we are here
After finishing everything, I tried to leave, but

776
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.810
still remained here

777
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.320
(Yoonyoung) Maybe we will be together forever

778
01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.150
I might be trapped here
It was fate
