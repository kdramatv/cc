00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.670
(Yoonyoung) Two nights before the teacher died
[Dreamy music]

2
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.610
Something that suddenly disappeared
I said there was

3
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.640
to someone
It looked like he was being chased.

4
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.040
If it's close to the driver's house,
It should be around here.

5
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.050
(Haejun) Jooyoung Lee
[Jooyoung’s scared breathing]

6
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.880
(Jooyoung) Ah! no! Not me!

7
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.720
[Jooyoung sobs]

8
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.590
(Haejun) Last night
He spied on a student and ran away.

9
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.090
Then who is that man?

10
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.660
I think that's me
I think he's the guy I've been waiting for

11
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.770
Then the man in the blue hat
Maybe we can meet again

12
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.200
The 20 minutes Lee Joo-young stayed in the coffee shop

13
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.070
The only person I met there

14
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.670
But the guy I chased last night
I was writing

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.170
that blue hat

16
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.940
So I did that
I plan to see it in person tomorrow.

17
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
[tired breathing]

18
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.250
[Moon So-ri]
[Door bell sounds]

19
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.980
[ringing footsteps]

20
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.070
[Grass bug crying]

21
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.440
[heavy music]

22
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.010
[sigh]

23
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.620
(Haejun) Ah

24
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.890
Ah...

25
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.560
[Hae-joon sounds embarrassed]

26
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340
(Yoonyoung) Could it be now?
Do you know what time it is?

27
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.310
(Haejun) Ah...

28
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.710
Then maybe

29
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.350
alone this night
A person who went out to meet a murderer

30
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.150
Do you know how it feels to wait?

31
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.590
(Yoonyoung) Just the face
He said he would check for a moment and then come back.

32
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.890
Dark news for over three hours

33
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.390
Wow, what is this?

34
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.120
[Yoonyoung sighs]

35
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.690
Chase after you like last time
Didn't he get hurt...

36
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.930
Are you hurt?

37
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.900
no

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.370
Can you report it to the police?
Can I go out and see?

39
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.600
(Yoonyoung) It’s fucking 87
Can you make a phone call?

40
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.810
I thought I was going crazy.

41
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.150
Did you show up, Blue Hat?

43
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.990
(Haejun) Ah...

44
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.490
Who was it?

45
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.700
[Moon So-ri]
[Door bell sounds]

46
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.000
[nervous music]
[ringing footsteps]

47
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.390
[Emphasis sound effect]

48
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.270
[Soaring music]

49
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.340
(Haejun) Your father

50
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.540
Baek Hee-seop

51
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.850
I'm going crazy

52
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.900
(Haejun) May 14, 1987

53
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.900
the first murder case
The very day it happened

54
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.170
I met the victim Lee Joo-young.

55
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.640
That person's father?
[heavy music]

56
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.040
If the blue hat is the real culprit

57
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.250
[sigh]

58
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.750
That person's mother, that is.

59
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.480
He even killed his own wife.

60
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.760
And me...

61
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.280
[sigh]

62
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.780
(Haejun) You can’t think biasedly.

63
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.180
calmly, cool-headedly
[sigh]

64
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.650
Let's summarize

65
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.730
As always, Lee Joo-young
I arrived first 7 minutes ago

66
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.860
(Jooyoung) If everything goes as it is, tonight

67
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.800
After school
I was planning to go to a coffee shop.

68
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.770
I drink coffee alone

69
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.640
I want to finish reading the book I was reading.

70
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.480
Something like a promise to meet someone
There really wasn't any

71
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.480
(Haejun) But it was unplanned
I ran into someone

72
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.550
[Jooyoung’s speaking voice]

73
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.290
Blue Hat, Baek Hee-seop

74
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.130
whatever the reason
A fight began between the two people

75
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.230
[Hee-seop’s excited speech]

76
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.370
At the same time, the situation
the only person who watched

77
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.100
The owner of Bongbong Cafe...

78
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.780
Where did they go?

79
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.310
[Moon So-ri]
[Door bell sounds]

80
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.480
(Beomryong) W!

81
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.360
There were more people

82
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.860
Oh, are you here?

83
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.660
(Beomryong) Oh, sorry, sorry

84
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.000
I came here after hearing great rumors.
It's a little late, I

85
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.200
[makes a loud noise]

86
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.500
school in the morning
It's completely turned upside down.

87
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.940
the teacher teacher

88
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.370
[Small] Do you know why that is?

89
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.670
As it turns out

90
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.880
They say he was a communist

91
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.980
[dark music]

92
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.480
Don't you watch the news?

93
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.150
College students are going crazy
Doing a demo

94
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.620
Last time we had a picnic
That strange song she sang

95
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.660
That's what it's called, too.

96
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.990
In the end, even us

97
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.200
[Small] I guess they were thinking of dyeing it.

98
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.700
[surprised gasp]

99
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.670
Isn't it totally creepy?

100
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.640
It gives me chills

101
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.300
(Beomryong) Right?

102
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.740
Hey, it's really dizzying.

103
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.110
[Laughing] My mom and dad
Very big...

104
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.480
Why would a friend do something like this?

105
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.490
How did you know?

106
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.070
[Sound of a matchbox being struck]

107
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.390
I'm pooping
I wonder why I always smell bad

108
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.660
Hey, Yoo Beom-ryong, have you gone far yet?

109
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.260
(Beomryong) Uh, uh

110
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.530
[Beomryong’s struggling sound]

111
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.870
The amount is a bit large today, isn’t it?

112
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.470
Hey, I don't know what's going on.
School is crazy

113
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.370
The police came and took the blame
I'm just looking for a teacher...

114
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.210
-Who are you looking for?
- (Hee-seop) Teacher, student

115
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.850
Ah, that thing, that thing

116
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.750
[sigh]

117
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.260
I didn't flush the water.

118
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.760
Ah, you dirty bastard.
That, shit, shit.

119
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.460
[Heeseop sighs]

120
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.920
[Meaningful music]

121
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.690
(Hee-seop) That’s the teacher’s, right?

122
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.490
Did you, well, steal that?

123
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.960
Are you going to tell me?

124
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.530
what?

125
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.000
This

126
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.110
Are you going to tell someone else?

127
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.940
[laughter]

128
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.310
Hey, you can't say this
Did you do it because you knew?

129
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.550
Stealing someone else's things
In the back corner...

130
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.550
Hey, you did something like this
If Sunae found out...

131
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.880
Pure love?

132
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.490
you are my girlfriend's name
How do you know?

133
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.520
Oh, okay!

134
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.330
Don’t you think about how much it will hurt?

135
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.040
The person I like

136
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.270
Don't be embarrassed

137
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.440
(Heeseop) The basics of a boy, that is

138
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.610
[sigh]

139
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.120
[Door bell sounds]
(Beomryong) Wait a minute, wait a minute

140
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.490
Heeseop, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

141
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.530
[Beomryong’s trembling breathing]

142
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.860
Okay

143
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.730
Okay

144
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.770
I'll give it back

145
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.300
I did something ugly out of curiosity.
I apologize directly

146
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.540
I'll give it back

147
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.910
So give me that

148
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.610
[Beomryong’s urgent breathing]

149
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.950
I'm serious

150
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.690
So as you said
To the girl I like

151
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.920
And more than anything
To you, my favorite friend

152
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.590
That's because I don't want to do anything embarrassing.

153
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.760
[Heeseop sighs]

154
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.300
[Sighing] I’ll keep it a secret.

155
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.710
Oh, I'm not telling anyone

156
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.210
I'll pretend you didn't see it
Be sure to keep your promise too

157
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.080
(Beomryong) Yes

158
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.160
Thank you, my partner.

159
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.460

161
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.370
(Beomryong) Hello

162
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.040
Have a good time with our Hee-seop.

163
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.000
yes

164
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.770
What's wrong? huh?

165
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.240
[Yuseop laughs]

166
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.350
[Meaningful music]

167

(Haejun) Jooyoung Lee’s ring
The one who stole it is Yoo Beom-ryong

168
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.130
ran away from the bridge that night
The blue hat is Baek Hee-seop

169
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.200
At that time, Baek Hee-seop had a companion.

170
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.170
Beomryong Yoo was heading in the same direction as the victim.

171
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.900

[Soaring music]

174
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.710
(Man 1) Come quickly!

175
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.550
Are you kidding me?

176
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.950
Go Minsu?

177
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.990
(Middle-aged Minsu) It’s really unfair.

178
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.530
The day the incident occurred

179
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.160
I live in this neighborhood of Woojeong-ri
Because it didn't exist

180
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.330
At that time, I went to a boarding school in the entire province.
I was staying

181
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.940
My mother told me to focus
This is where you sent me

182
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.270
[laughter]

183
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.510
I was in the middle of a mountain far away without a phone.

184
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.310
[nervous music]
(Minsu) Do you want to die? uh?

185
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.750
Why is Go Min-soo...

186
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.150
[Heavy breathing]

187
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.720
(Minsu) If my brother asks for it,

188
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.230
I'll give it to you quickly and get it over with, right?

189
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.130
I have a long tongue
This [mute sound effect] *bitch

190
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.800
[Misook’s moans]

191
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.230
Huh? Hey

192
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.540
[sigh]

193
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.010
Is this your money? uh?

194
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.810
Anyway, you too
You stole your mom’s wallet.

195
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.550
Isn't it?

196
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.650
premature baby

197
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.750
(Misuk) You boring bastard

198
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.460
In the end, I got kicked out by my mom.

199
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.500
The bravado

200
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.370
[laughter]

201
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.740
(Minsu) IC

202
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.300
[Kicking sound]
[Minsu’s moans]

203
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.010
[Urgent music]
[Minsu’s sound of pain]

204
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.180
(Haejun) Are you okay?

205
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.950
(Minsu) Oh, really! Ouch!

206
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.050
[Minsu’s sound of encouragement]

207
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.720
[Minsu’s groans of difficulty]

208
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.620
[Minsu’s exasperated breathing]

209
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.760
[Minsu’s moans]

210
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.860
arm, arm, arm

211
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.600
Arm, arm, ah!

212
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.670
[Minsu’s groans of difficulty]

213
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.170
I saved trash like you
I regret the future

214
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.670
What should I do with you?

215
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.610
[Crying] This is it
It's because of you, you bastard!

216
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.380
- (Minsu) Because of you!
- Are you okay?

217
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440
yes?

218
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.850
(Haejun) Go to the nearest public phone
First report it to the police

219
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.690
I don't think it's very believable though
Because I have to keep a damn record.

220
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.690
No matter what happens this time
I will help you get the punishment you deserve.

221
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.630
(Minsu) Go Mi-sook, think carefully.

222
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.890
[Minsu’s moans]

223
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.400
[heavy music]

224
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.230
(Inexperienced) Report

225
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.540
I don't want to do it

226
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.740
[Minsu’s laughter]

227
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.380
Because I got the money anyway

228
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.590
If you feel better after playing for a while
I'm going to go to a boarding school.

229
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.760
That's it then

230
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.560
If that bastard has a problem again

231
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.430
I told my mom I was going to die.

232
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.470
So

233
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.240
This is the teacher and me
I just want to know

234
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.750
[nervous music]

235
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.330

[absurd gasping sound]

238
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.420
[Haejun sighs]

239
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.160
(Haejun) Turn around
They're running around, really, Mr.

240
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.930
[sigh]

241
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.310
(Haejun) Lee Joo-young’s movements tonight

242
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.210
one of those in it
Most likely to be the culprit

243
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.780
But tonight

244
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.420
The three suspects
everyone was there

245
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.890
[Meaningful music]

246
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.090
(Hee-seop) [Sighing]
I'll keep it a secret

247
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.860
Oh, I'm not telling anyone

248
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:34.910
[sigh]

249
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.810
(Beomryong) Okay, I’ll give it back to you.

250
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.210
I apologize and give it back.

251
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.020
[Detective 1 blows air]

252
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.530
I'll never show up in this neighborhood again

253
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.340
Okay?

254
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.820
(Haejun) Everyone who was there

255
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.060
Everyone is telling their own lies.

256
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.360
[sigh]

257
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.100
Why?

258
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.270
Why?

259
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.780
Why are you silent?

260
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.020
the blue hat

261
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.550
my mom
The man who might have killed

262
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.790
You saw it, right?

263
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.600
Who was it?
Is this a face we know?

264
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.440
Couldn't confirm

265
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.040
(Haejun) I missed it like last time

266
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.080
It's my fault, I'm sorry

267
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.680
lie

268
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.360
You said you weren't hurt, but you were hurt

269
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.130
It hurts every time I touch it...

270
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.000
(Haejun) Oh, it’s no big deal, yeah

271
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.600
By the way, how is Lee Joo-young?

272
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.370
I feel anxious, but it's okay.

273
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.580
(Yoonyoung) Just in case the police
I'm afraid they'll notice and follow me here

274
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.380
Then we'll be in trouble too.

275
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.280
don't worry

276
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.220
Because no one will come tonight

277
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.890

If you're going to whisper, don't knock

283
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.980
(Haejun) If you’re going to knock
Whisper it or not

284
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.520
strategy to one side
Shouldn’t it have been decided?

285
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.120
Oh, sorry, late at night.
[lively music]

286
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.590
Is there a Yunyoung by any chance?

(Soon-ae) [Surprise] Yoon Young-a

288
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.960
Are you okay?

289
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.460
Why me?

290
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.470
I heard it all from my father

291
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.030
At the driver’s house during the day

292
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.070
Just pointed a knife at me
They say something scary happened

293
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.410
Were you very surprised?

294
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.310
Oh, it's no big deal.

295
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.440
It's no big deal

296
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.450
(Soonae) Maybe

297
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.080
Tonight, our Yoonyoung

298
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.480
Just like in that house
Are you planning on putting me to sleep?

299
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.190
With the student teacher?

300
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.050
uh?

301
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.030
(Haejun) Oh, no, that...

302
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.490
(Soonae) Then at my house
Shall I sleep in it, just for one night?

303
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.400
Yeah, yeah

304
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.400
That would be nice, that would be nice

305
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.200
[Soonae’s light smile]
(Haejun) Ah, I was short-thinking.

306
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.210
Come back

307
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.680
(Yoonyoung) No, it’s okay
There was just some misunderstanding.

308
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.150
Just take a break and use that as an excuse.

309
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.790
After passing away
I heard you came straight from here.

310
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.690
(Haejun) Take it easy, just for one night

311
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.430
Come stay next to mom
It's a good opportunity

312
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.300
[Emotional music]

313
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.270
[Soonae’s encouraging sound]

314
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.380
(Soonae) Is your room a little messy?

315
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.180
They say they are going to clean it up.
Mom always blows from the back

316
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.080
I'll throw it all away when I'm not around
They even threatened me

317
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.220
Oh, my mom was just like that too.

318
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.350
Right?

319
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.860
(Soonae) Ah, mothers
I don't know why everyone does this

320
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.530
[sigh]

321
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.030
Even if I have a daughter later
It will never happen.

322
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.530
[Sound of holding back laughter]

323
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.770
I'm going to take a shower, I'm resting comfortably.

324
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.640
(Yoonyoung) Uh, go wash up.

325
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.110
[Sound of door closing]

326
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.990
no

327
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.630
There's no way you can hide it

328
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.800
[sigh]

329
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.510
where are you at this night

330
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
Would you like to call me?

331
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.280
I heard you were anxious all day.

332
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.220
(Haejun) Check the barricade
[Button operation sound]

333
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.790
[Noisy chattering noise]

334
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.490
(Byung-gu) No
Even though I checked something!

335
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.260
Oh, I'm really in a hurry
I'm going crazy, really, yeah

336
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.430
Wow

337
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.370
Uh, we're all gathered here, so, yeah.

338
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.770
- Chairman
- (Byung-gu) Yes, wait a minute.

339
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.770
Chairman, what are you doing here now?
It's the chairman's turn.

340
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.640
(Byung-gu) Oh, yeah
Okay, okay, uh

341
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.670

(Class leader) Now, now
The Chairman is singing!

345
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.180
Big applause!

346
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.390
(Byung-gu) No, no, no

347
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.290
Well, I'm done with singing

348
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.090
Eh, just our crime-free town.

349
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.760
For peaceful friendship
Working tirelessly day and night

350
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.330
The happiness of our police officers!
[Police's exclamation]

351
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.730
That's all you need
[Byunggu’s laughter]

352
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.100
(Detective 2) Now, applause!
[Police cheering]

353
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.870
(Byung-gu) Oh, and like I said
Today's meeting is

354
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.310
As village maintenance

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.390
But

530
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.660
The person who asked me to return the stolen ring
Why did they kill him?

531
00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.770
Something doesn't make sense

532
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.170
[sigh]

533
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.610
Are you hoping it doesn't hit?

534
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.240
[Sound of door opening]

535
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.710
[Sound of door slamming shut]

536
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.690
I got everything important, teacher.

537
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.520
- Let's go then.
- (Jooyoung) Yes

538
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.760
[Interesting music]

539
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.400
(Hyungman) Mistress

540
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.210
How could I have such a dangerous neighbor?
Have a meet, Mr.

541
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.280
[bird chirping]

542
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.680
Once you leave the village
It won't be dangerous

543
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.150
(Haejun) Because you never know

544
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.550
At a friend's house
Contact me as soon as you arrive

545
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.820
My house number is...

546
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:10.960
(Jooyoung) I know

547
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.560
Ah

548
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.290
The day I arrived here
You told me

549
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.230
[Calm music]
(Haejun) Ah...

550
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.500
[Jooyoung’s light smile]

551
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.970
I know it's nonsense

552
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:27.910
(Jooyoung) Teacher Yoon, definitely

553
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.080
To save me
I think you came here on purpose.

554
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.480
I should come here
I knew in advance and waited

555
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.620
How should I save you?

556
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.690
for a long time
Does he seem like a person who has thought about things?

557
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.820
Oh, that can't be right

558
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.030
(Jooyoung) That’s right

559
00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.260
It can't be like that
You helped me just like that.

560
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.470
Thank you

561
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.070
If it weren't for Teacher Yoon

562
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.410
I don't know what would have happened by now

563
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.410
thank you so much

564
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.580
(Haejun) This

565
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:14.990
Don't lose it

566
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.990
live well

567
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.990
Stay long and healthy until you become a grandmother

568
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.400
Teacher too

569
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.440
(Haejun) Oh, it’s coming.

570
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.650
Take care

571
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.690
[Birdsong]

572
00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.770
[Sound of difficulty]

573
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.170
(Dongsik) Oh, I’m dying.

574
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.410
Is the bus already running?

575
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.620
[nervous music]

576
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.220
Uh oh, oh!

577
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.650
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

578
00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.620
Tea, tea!

579
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.690
Mr.

580
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.260
[Dongsik’s embarrassed voice]

581
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.130
[surprised gasp]

582
00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.210
(Dongsik) You...

583
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.720
you bastard

584
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.480
You! Mr.

585
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:54.920
You bastard

586
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.820
under the bridge that day

587
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.860
How dare the police
Help the demonstrators

588
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.900
secretly sending a signal
In that corner

589
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.570
Ha, I'm just oblivious
I thought he was a foolish teacher.

590
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.500
Now that I see it, was it a gang?

591
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.770
okay?

592
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.510
(Haejun) How much did you drink?

593
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:18.640
What card are you talking about?
I was just passing by

594
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.950
(Dongsik) Ha, is that so?

595
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.910
You'll know the exact details if you look into it.

596
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.780
Let's go to the store and talk, okay?

597
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.790
Ah, why are you taking away a healthy person?

598
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.490
Stop talking nonsense and follow me, you bastard!

599
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.190
(Haejun) Boy...
[siren sound]

600
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.580
(Resident 1) What’s going on?
What's going on, how...

601
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.480
(Dongsik) Uh, sister, sister

602
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.850
(Resident 1) Uh
[Resident 1’s urgent breathing]

603
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.020
(Dongsik) What is it? Where is the fire?

604
00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.890
No, in the persimmon tree house over there
I think the fire started really big.

605
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.620
[Meaningful music]
(Dongsik) Uh, uh, where?

606
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.930
(Resident 1) With his grandmother and grandson
That persimmon tree house where you two live.

607
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.200
Wow, you should be safe.
What should I do? Wow

608
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.370
(Haejun) Fire incident on the 15th

609
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.970
There were no casualties

610
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.470
(Dongsik) My kids are at that house.

611
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.940
[Urgent music]

612
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.310
(Haejun) What are you talking about?

613
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.150
There should be only two people there.

614
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.820
Last night I
I should have gone to pick you up

615
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.690
Because I couldn't pick him up...
[Dongsik’s devastated voice]

616
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.960
(Resident 1) Oh my, what should I do?
Oh my, what should I do?

617
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.090
Oh my, what should I do now, what should I do

618
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.660
What should I do? oh my god?

619
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.100
Oh my, what should I do, Dongsik?

620
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.530
(Dongsik) Yongwoo, Yongsoon

621
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.570
(Resident 1) Oh my, what should I do?
Oh my, what should I do, oh my

622

[Sound of spraying water]

623
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.270

Yongwoo!

626

628
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.950
[Crying] Yongwoo, Yongsun!

629

- (Resident 2) Here, here!
- (Resident 3) Here, here, here

630
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.220
- (Dongsik) Yongsoon!
- (Resident 3) Dad, Dad

631
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.520
(Dongsik) Yongsoon, are you okay?

632
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.490
Yongsoon, Yongsoon

633
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.430
I'm sorry, Dad, Yongsun.

634
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.270
(Haejun) I, old man

635
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.700
Where are the rest of the kids?

636
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:22.830
(Resident 4) I don’t know.

637
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.240
I am my grandson
I think he brought me out.

638
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.670
[Crashing sound]
[People sound surprised]

639
00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.150
(Resident 5) Oh my!
Oh, it's about to collapse over there!

640
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.680
Oh, what should I do, oh, oh oh

641
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.210
(Dongsik) Yongwoo!

642

Yongwoo!

650
00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:54.800
(Haejun) Yongwoo!

651
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.500
(Haejun) Until the sun rises
I want you to hold on to everything.

652
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.140
Especially Baek Dong-sik

653
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.110
at our school today
Bring all the detectives

654
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.940
I turned it over arbitrarily
It's all his doing.

655
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.550
I should have gone to pick you up yesterday.

656
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.750
Because I couldn't pick him up...

657
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.620

- (Dongsik) Yongwoo, Yongwoo!
- (Haejun) Here, here, here

669
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.710

I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry.

681
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.470
(Resident 6) I’m glad, oh my.

682
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.670
(Resident 7) You’re amazing, ah!

683
00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:13.650
(Yongsoon) Oppa!

684
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:15.210
[Heeseop’s surprised gasp]

685

(Hee-seop) Uncle

686
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.420
your homeroom teacher
I need to take you to the hospital.

687
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.550
(Hee-seop) Yes?

Oh, you're hurt too

690

[heavy music]

692
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.900
Oh, what are you talking about?

693
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.240
Will you hurry up?

694
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.690
(Haejun) Jooyoung Lee safely
The act of trying to get away

695
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.060
It became another variable

696
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.800
That variable
I created another situation

697
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.370
Instead of allowing someone who almost died to live

698
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.840
The person who had to live

699
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.210
I almost killed him

700
00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.910
I

701
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.360
[sigh]

[Sound of the door slowly opening]

705
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.850
(Yoonyoung) Jooyoung Lee, have a nice day...

706
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:58.980
What happened?

707
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.920
(Haejun) Oh, it’s nothing.

708
00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.220
With my mother
Did you have a good time?

709
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.860
(Yoonyoung) Yes

710
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.200
(Haejun) But why is that...

711
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.930
I think I can figure it out.

712
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.170
What?

713
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.140
I mean the blue hat.

714
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.600
(Yoonyoung) Who is that?

715
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.640
Because it might be in here

716
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.220
A novel is not a report.

717
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.190
I wrote about something that really happened

718
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.890
Even your real name
Because there’s no way I put it in as is.

719
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.300
The story of the blue hat in Ko Mi-sook's novel
I thought there wasn't one?

720
00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:49.870
But here is a similar phrase
It occurred to me that there was

721
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.800
[Sound of rushing]

722
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.670
‘Man with blue hair’

723
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.610
The blue hair here
I have been

724
00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.180
hair color
I thought you meant

725
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.080
[Hae-joon’s sound of pain]

726
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.320
[sigh]

727
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.350
What happened?

728
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.590
(Haejun) [Sighing] Tell me everything
Should I do it, should I?

729
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.790
Every single thing that happens here
Should I share everything?

730
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.460
Are you doing that over there?

731
00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.730
enough to do that
Were we even close?

732
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.740
(Yoonyoung) You know, right?

733
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.520
blue hat

734
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.590
You're not curious at all

735
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.220
Did you find out who it was?

736
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.690
I didn't miss it at the coffee shop last night.

737
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.240
There is no reason to tell you
Is there no reason to hide it?

738
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.200
why? Why?

739
00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.870
I feel like I'm misunderstanding something
I'm just letting you know

740
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.010
Think about it carefully.

741
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.810
i really
If you are here for reporting

742
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.950
Why did you go this far?
Are you overly obsessed with chasing the criminal?

743
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.250
(Haejun) The dead victims
Because you feel bad?

744
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.490
There are many things in this world
It's such a tragedy

745
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.790
Enough to go out and save all those people
I'm not an idle person, I

746
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:23.030
(Yoonyoung) Then for what reason...

747
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.930
I am a victim too
[heavy music]

748
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.070
fifth victim

749
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.880
I didn't get it right here
Because of the criminal

750
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.880
like your mother
I was going to die too

751
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.180
(Haejun) So purely
to save my life

752
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.780
In this town in 1987
Everything that happened!

753
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.490
Newspapers, news, and police materials
I entered everything.

754
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.460
In just one small variable
Everything might get distorted

755
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.900
That alone makes my head
I'm about to explode, now

756
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.230
But you know what?

757
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.270
Who is the biggest variable here?

758
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.710
So last night
Was it sent to your mom?

759
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.380
(Yoonyoung) Variables
Don't wonder anything

760
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.180
Don't intervene

761
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.450
comfortably

762
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.090
You want me to stay quiet?

763
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.630
I'm sorry, but that won't work.

764
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.830
Now that I've come this far, I too

765
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.270
sit still like a fool
I don't want to wait

766
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.580
If you don't want to tell me, do that.

767
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.010
I'll find it out on my own

768
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.860
[Sound of door opening and closing]

769
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.490
(Soonae) I’m so uncomfortable here

770
00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.990
[Sigh of pure love]

771
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.600
Beomryong is crying
What if you cling to me?

772
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.970
I said I was the only one in this world

773
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.610
What are you doing?

774
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.310
Hey, Baek Yunyoung

775
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.950

This will be this afternoon

A man with blue hair
If you really mean the blue hat

787
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.730
Where is the distance between the sun and the moon?

I don't know

789
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.740
What is this? scary

790
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.740
Just go back, to Yoo Beom-ryong

791
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.810
Anyway, once
It's something you have to go through.

792
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.120
(Soonae) I understand

793
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.360
But you are like that
Don't play with bitter people

794
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:43.560
I don't like it

795
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.630
How do you know I didn't write it?

796
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.200
Are you stupid?

797
00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.270
The sentence you wrote
There's no way he doesn't know

798

(Soonae) Everyone knows who wrote it

799

I'm the one who was chosen on purpose.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.980

‘Between the sun and the moon’
What does it mean?

Even though I know I have to tell you
I made my own decisions and hid it.

But what I sent yesterday
I didn't mean that.

845
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:27.870
I know

Blue hat, you...

847
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.910
(Yoonyoung) I know, that too

848
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:39.740
I saw it myself

849
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.680
Why did you have to hide it from me?
I think I know why

850
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.920
Because we are family

851
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.490
Just one of the suspects.

He must be that kind of person
I never thought about it

my father
He's a terrible thinker.

855
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.810
more than us

856
00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:16.050
What?

857
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.450
yes?

(Haejun) Ah...

859
00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.520
Who are you talking about now?

860
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.130
I'm talking about the blue hat
Wasn't it?

861
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.360
(Haejun) So

862
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.500
No, why did Baek Hee-seop identify himself?

Baek Yu-seop

869
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.920
Baek Yu-seop was not even a suspect at the time.

870
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:31.260
I wasn't even in the line last night...

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.110

876
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.570
I had someone to meet
I don’t think you came, did you?

877
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.700
No, I also want to meet someone
I have some

878
01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:20.700
Then shall we go in and talk?

879
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:22.840
No, it's stuffy inside.

880
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.040
If you finish early
I'll be waiting in front of you

881
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.480
- Oh, draw it?
- (Yuseop) Yes

882
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.650
Then it's good for me
[Yuseop’s laughter]

883
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.720
(Hee-seop) Hey, it’s cool, Seong.

884
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:45.360
(Yuseop) Now

885
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.430
Look look

886
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.970
Atame, it’s pretty.

887
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.040
Write it down, get out a little more
Do you think it suits you well?

888
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.270
[laughter]

889
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.040
[Thumping Hee-seop] Come out quickly.

890
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.270
(Hee-seop) Okay, Seong.

891
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.710
[Door bell sounds]

892
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.940
[Sound of door closing]

893
01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.410
[sigh]

894
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:23.430
[ringing footsteps]

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.440
[Rhythmic music]

896
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.590
(Haejun) Nothing, nothing about Baek Yu-seop.

897
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.460
None of this data is available.

898
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.800
(Yunyoung) Baek Yoo-seop
No one knows better than me

899
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.830
I'll fill everything you need
From now on

900
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.730
(Haejun) If Baek Yoo-seop is the real culprit

901
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.470
We'll meet again tomorrow night

902
01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.840
Because we'll have to kill the second victim.

903
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.640
(Yoonyoung) Where on earth?
What are you doing?

904
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.570
There are all paths...

905
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.910
Probably not, not yet

906
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.210
(Haejun) Hello?

907
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:08.950
