1
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.970
(Misuk) It was an incident that happened in the village.
[Dreamy music]

2
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.970
I saw the culprit

3
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.610
I saw it myself, killing it.

4
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.710
Are you my brother?

5
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.750
(Detective 1) Ah, I finally caught it.
This bastard, this

6
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.420
(Haejun) No, Go Mi-sook

7
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.520
I was a witness, not the culprit.

8
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.690
The culprit is a man

9
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.790
The only person who knows that face
This is Go Mi-sook.

10
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.460
[telephone ringing sound]

11
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.790
- (Beomryong) [Crying] Teacher
- (Haejun) Yoo Beom-ryong?

12
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.630
(Beomryong) Sunae!

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.900
[Soonae’s surprised voice]

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.430
[Rough fighting sounds]

15
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Soon-ae Lee, wake up quickly!

16
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.580
[Soon-ae’s terrified voice]

17
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.110
Sunae, I’m a teacher.

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950
(Yoonyoung) Someone died again

19
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.350
This time it's a boy

20
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.320
A boy who was fine
died in an abandoned house

21
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.980
Otherwise
Because Lee Soon-ae is probably dead

22
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.290
(Soonae) If it weren’t for the teacher
I would have been caught right away, I

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.730
Since when has this been here?

24
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100
[Tense sound effect]

25
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.770
[siren sound]

26
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.820
(Hyungman) Oh, you’re so shameless
What a horrible bastard!

27
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.920
Come and find out where I am!

28
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.790
How dare you have a note like that?
Are you threatening me?

29
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.800
I am that shameless bastard
You should have seen it in person!

30
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.930
(Detective 2) Calm down.
Get on board, father.

31
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.100
(Hyungman) Oh!
That shameless bastard, I...

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.740
(Okja) Yoon Young-ah, get in, huh?

33
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140
Let's go to my house first, okay?

34
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.840
yes

35
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.280
(Dongsik) Like this
You're crazy, Mr.

36
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.780
This guy this
I'm not usually a bold guy.

37
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.660
Come all the way here
Leisurely issuing a warning?

38
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.430
[Laughing] Whether you get caught or not
I'm saying there's nothing to be afraid of.

39
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.460
Huh? This is

40
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.600
[Dongsik sighs]
(Haejun) Does it look like that?

41
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.370
Exactly in my eyes
It seems the opposite.

42
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.340
[Meaningful music]

43
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.380
He's really scared right now.
I'm scared of getting caught

44
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580
Threatening me like this
They're trying to silence you.

45
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.690
It was my first time

46
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.150
I failed to kill someone

47
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.790
The fact that the victim is alive
I'm embarrassed by that itself, now.

48
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.830
[Haejun sighs]

49
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740
But why two detectives?

50
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.640
(Dongsik) Huh?

51
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.980
More than this in this town
Is there an important event?

52
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.950
(Haejun) But why was it reported?
Were there only two detectives who came running?

53
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.950
(Dongsik) Ah...

54
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.350
That...
[Embarrassed breathing]

55
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.820
I want to make it big
Probably not, the police

56
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.890
This time too

57
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
[dark music]

58
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.280
(Dongsik) Ah, just the two of us now
Does it make sense to go?

59
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.410
Even if everyone is dispatched, it won't be enough, right?

60
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.550
I heard the culprit went there, the culprit

61
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.050
Who is the culprit?

62
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.620
What?

63
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.990
Some guy got a note
What if you were just joking?

64
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.120
Are you already concluding that he is the culprit?

65
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.490
[Dongsik sighs]

66
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.930
(Class President) Don’t make a fuss for no reason.
Go quietly

67
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.060
That note is all
Bring it straight to me

68
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.370
I'll check, okay?

69
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.320
[nervous music]

70
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.630
[Dark sound effect]

71
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.370
(Detective 1) Try to catch him somehow.
What should I do if I make a fuss?

72
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.300
Let alone the police commissioner

73
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.970
Because my current position is also precarious.
I can't give you time

74
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.710
Ah, then what should the class president do?

75
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.940
Go Go Min Soo, who caught everything
There is no choice but to say ‘the culprit, hit the ground’

76
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.850
(Detective 3) Then, with Jooyoung Lee
Lee Kyung-ae was killed by Go Min-soo.

77
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.580
After that
Was it just someone else's doing?

78
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.850
(Detective 1) That’s right.

79
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.780
Then first we

80
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.490
at least one case
Because it has been resolved

81
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.960
(Detective 3) But that Yoo Beom-ryong
Although it didn't come out

82
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.460
To that female student, Lee Soon-ae
You have the proof, right?

83
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.960
the same writing

84
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.430
‘Women who read books are dangerous’

85
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.700
(Detective 1) So

86
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.570
Without that note
Doesn't make sense

87
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.570
(Detective 3) Then today
That note from the hospital room...

88
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.170
(Detective 1) Child
It's something that shouldn't exist.

89
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.840
[sigh]

90
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.090
(Okja) Ah, that’s me

91
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.760
For taking me there
Thank you so much, Detective.

92
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.130
(Detective 2) Oh, what is it?

93
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.070
Me, by the way
What happened tonight

94
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.670
Where are you going for the time being?
You can't talk

95
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.770
Because it may interfere with the investigation.

96
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.340
You know what I mean, right?

97
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.040
Oh, sure

98
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.350
Please just give me the culprit.
Please catch me, detective.

99
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.590
(Yoonyoung) Why are you just leaving?

100
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.060
Among those who visited the hospital

101
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.760
There could be a culprit.

102
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.860
But who went there?

103
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.370
Why don't you ask?

104
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.640
Oh, that's it
There are separate procedures for everything.

105
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.000
If you wait a little bit...

106
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.370
(Yoonyoung) Until when
Do I have to wait?

107
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.310
What to do next
Are you planning to do it?

108
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.150
I even received a threatening note from the criminal.

109
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.120
Just send it back home
It's not the end, is it?

110
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.490
[Detective 2 lightly clears his throat]

111
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.730
(Detective 2) Oh, that’s
Let me go and check it out.

112
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.100
[heavy music]

113
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.970
[Car starting sound]

114
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.840
[Exciting music on TV]

115
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.040
[The sound of exploding firecrackers plays]

116
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.650
[heavy music]

117
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.890
[Birdsong]

118
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.060
[Sound of TV crackling]

119
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.370
[Moon So-ri]

120
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.180
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

121
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.930
Where have you been and are you coming now?
You said you would come soon

122
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.460
I have to find a way to do something
I thought I could see your face

123
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.000
Are you inside?

124
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.300
Let's go in and talk.

125
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.680
You mean news?

126
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.150
yes

127
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.920
What happened last night
It will be broadcast on air.

128
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.790
[Hyungman sighs]

129
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.860
(Haejun) After leaving the hospital last night
I walked all over town

130
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.400
But the villagers and the police

131
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.400
As if something happened when
It was too quiet

132
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.040
That silence is now for Sunae
It will never be safe

133
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.280
Moreover, to the criminal
I even received a threatening note.

134
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.480
The police guarding the front of the house
There isn't a single one

135
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.690
now in a big way
A public investigation is needed.

136
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.860
police become more active
We need to start an investigation.

137
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.330
If the police don't have the will to do it
We have to make it like that.

138
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.870
The surest way to do that is
I think it's news

139
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.500
[Hyungman sighs]

140
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.910
If we disclose the case first,

141
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.010
Even the police can't move
There won't be

142
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.210
When the police start moving

143
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.320
Even criminals are recklessly next to Soon-ae
You won't be able to access it.

144
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.820
For now this is

145
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.660
Keeping Sunae safe
able to catch the criminal

146
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.420
I think that's the way to do it

147
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.790
But

148
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.000
To do that, eventually

149
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.630
Sunae also appears on TV
Shouldn’t it be transparent?

150
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.800
[heavy music]
(Hyungman) That, interviewing the victim, that kind of thing.

151
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.470
I know how worried you are.

152
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.180
Face and voice
Make sure it's never recognizable

153
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.180
(Haejun) Worthy of doing that
I know reporters well.

154
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.580
(Hyungman) I believe it’s Teacher Yoon.

155
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.150
But

156
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.190
Even if that happens

157
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.490
Even if other people don’t know
Aren't you going to find out the culprit?

158
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.230
Because it's my child's problem

159
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.830
It's like this for no reason
It could become more dangerous

160
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.970
[Sighing] Honestly
I really don't feel like it

161
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.430
(Okja) I told the teacher

162
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.130
I’ve never cooked a meal for you, right?

163
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.110
(Okja) Whenever and once
I wanted to do it for you

164
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.210
Suddenly getting ready
It's a bit cold, but enjoy it.

165
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.380
Eat now, baby.

166
00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.620
(Yoonyoung) Yes

167
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.830
no matter what happens

168
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.960
Even

169
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.900
Do this to my baby
Even if my heart breaks

170
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.380
In the mouths of the remaining family members
I have to put rice in it somehow.

171
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.180
That's my mom's heart

172
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.620
(Okja) Teacher Yoon
He's not my son

173
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.150
Still

174
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.120
I think of ourselves as family, I

175
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.960
Or in the meantime
how can we do that

176
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.490
Pay attention and think about it
Worry about me and help me

177
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.330
Could it have happened?

178
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.300
Like the teacher said, it’s someone else’s business.

179
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.400
It's all someone else's business

180
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.940
So such a teacher

181
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.240
really that news
If you say it's important

182
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.250
I want to believe it
[Calm music]

183
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.320
Don't let our pure love become dangerous

184
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.250
그렇게만 해 줄 수 있겠어요?

185
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.590
honey

186
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.490
The police have told us so far
Do you know what was talked about the most?

187
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.990
(Okja) ‘Calm down’

188
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.360
'Be quiet'

189
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.730
So until now
Has anything been resolved?

190
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.800
If you let go like this because you're scared
Our pure love

191
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.410
How long like that
Do I have to hide?

192
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.610
(Soonae) I want to, that news

193
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.290
I want to do it too, me too

194
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.590
[heavy music]

195
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.060
Because it wasn't me who was at fault

196
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.160
What you should be afraid of

197
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.930
Because it's not me, it's the culprit

198
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.510
(Reporter) I know it must be difficult for my family.

199
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.240
Because it's an important interview
Please take care of me

200
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.650
Focus mainly on family

201
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.320
Reporter Kim, Reporter Kim
Wear your shirt straight

202
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.750
(Reporter Kim) Yes

203
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.250
The face is clear
Please make it a mosaic.

204
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.820
The voice is completely
You need to modify it

205
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.330
What I'm curious about is not the victim.
It has to be the face of the perpetrator.

206
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.330
(Reporter) Of course, ah...

207
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.430
If you can show it directly
I think it would be better

208
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.540
The matchbox and note from last night
Of course the police took it, right?

209
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.370
(Hyungman) Yes, I submitted everything.

210
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.540
(Reporter) Yes, I understand.

211
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.410
I'll go in like this.

212
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.510
Reporter Kim, let’s begin the interview.

213
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.320
What are you doing here?

214
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.830
Then you
What are you doing?

215
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.760
over there

216
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.100
[Interesting music]

217
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.680
(Dongsik) A case being investigated by the police

218
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.110
So carelessly
What if I expose it to the media?

219
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.110
Without any evidence

220
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.420
But

221
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.350
Evidence like this
Is it okay to steal it without permission?

222
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.420
If you're in it

223
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.660
When and how will it disappear?
Because I don't know

224
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.130
(Dongsik) You were right.

225
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.830
Well, a person from the future
I guess I lied

226
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.900
Still, that much
We didn't know it would be the worst, we

227
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.010
There's one more thing that's really gone

228
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.780
(Dongsik) Student Soonae Lee
When running away from an abandoned house

229
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.290
The note that was in my pocket
That's gone

230
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.920
You know what that means, right?

231
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.530
That's not why I called you
People at that broadcasting station

232
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.530
Never just cover it up
I won't let it go

233
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.010
There's going to be a lot of chaos.

234
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.510
[sigh]
(Detective 3) Captain!

235
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.510
- Captain, Captain!
- (Class President) Why?

236
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.080
[Detective 3’s heavy breathing]

237
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.650
At Seoul Broadcasting Station

238
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.480
What are you doing now, covering the incident?
It looks like it's moving around.

239
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.420
The whole town is in an uproar just now.

240
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.990
At a Seoul broadcasting station?

241
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.720
[nervous music]
(Photographer) One, two, three, start

242
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.260
(Reporter Kim) 5 consecutive years
Selected as a crime-free village

243
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.490
In Ujeong-ri Village, Ujeong-eup, Ujeong-gun

244
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.560
A total of three cases in the past month
A murder case occurred

245
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.370
(Haejun) The village is becoming more and more
It's going to be noisy.

246
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.400
(Reporter Kim) Last May

247
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.040
two women
The criminal who brutally murdered

248
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.470
Each victim's body

249
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.040
Your own unique mark
I left it behind

250
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.210
One of them is

251
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.640
your own message
With this matchbox written on the note

252
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.650
young people in the village
most frequented

253
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.450
It was made in a coffee shop.

254
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.550
The police judged this fact to be

255
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.450
The criminal frequents Bongbong Cafe.

256
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.190
in the same village
I assume it's a young man

257
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.960
Among the coffee shop guests, you will be considered a suspect...

258
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.490
(Haejun) Everyone, every day
They'll be talking about the criminal.

259
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.800
Surely somewhere
The criminal must have seen that too.

260
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.430
(Reporter Kim) The culprit has not been caught.
While the village is shaking with anxiety

261
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.100
In the past 4 days, an additional incident occurred
survived a murder

262

surviving victim

263
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.340
From the criminal again
It was reported that a threat had been received

264
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.440
The whole town was in shock.

265
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.720
The moment I see this text

266
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.390
Must be the culprit

267
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.120
me next to me
I felt like I was being watched.

268
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.430
(Okja) However, the police are now

269
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.200
take no action
I'm not getting you drunk.

270
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.130
(Class president) [Awkwardly]
Well, could that be possible? Uh...

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.940
To protect victims
He will do his best

273
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.770
(Haejun) The situation is
It will start to change little by little

274
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.750
(Detective 2) While patrolling
If there is anyone suspicious

275
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.850
Right to me
allow you to report

276
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.980
Oh, hello.

277
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.620
From now on, we will operate 24 hours a day
Because I'll be guarding right in front of you

278
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.220
You can rest assured.

279
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.690
Has the investigation been carried out?
A month has passed

280
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.460
Are you getting no results?

281
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.500
(Class President) Oh, of course not.

282
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.400
We have already identified a prime suspect.
We have secured it.

283
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.970
Uh, we'll be there soon
It will be sent to the prosecution...

284
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.480
(Haejun) The situation that doesn’t change is
We have to change it

285
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.110
(Class President) You can rest assured.

286
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.680
(Dongsik) Even if the incident is covered up

287
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.220
I'm going to have a good time
Looks like they're going to make me a criminal.

288
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.820
Probably like now
As long as I'm still caught

289
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.420
I think a proper investigation will be difficult.

290
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.960
Are you still on Go Mi-sook’s side?

291
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.930
[sigh]

292
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.840
(Misook) [Sighing] What the hell?
What are you saying?

293
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.440
I've really lied
None, detective.

294
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.670
(Dongsik) Go Mi-suk

295
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:08.980
you

296
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.580
fooling the police
how dangerous it is

297
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.280
Do you know?

298
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.480
To be honest even now
I'll pretend not to notice your mistakes

299
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.290
This is what you can give me
It's your last chance

300
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.190
[heavy music]
Later, when the real culprit is revealed

301
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.860
At that time

302
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.760
what sin do you have
I don't know how much I'll ask

303
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.260
My one and only brother
Being accused of being a murderer

304
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.370
Do you think it's easy?

305
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.000
(Misuk) Reporting a family member
In guilt

306
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.540
Hesitating and worrying hundreds of times a day
I barely told you

307
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.810
If you doubt me like this...

308
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.550
[sigh]

309
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.880
I really saw it

310
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.050
That day at the river, my brother

311
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.890
(Dong-sik) Probably Go Min-soo
Even if there is evidence that he is not the criminal

312
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.190
They'll say they can't see it

313
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.860
For that kid

314
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.530
Because that will be the last exit

315
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.500
Just waiting for that answer
It can't happen anymore, now

316
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.070
(Haejun) The more the reporters pressure

317
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.570
The police also respond faster
Because I'm going to get off

318
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.910
[sigh]

319
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.580
Well, if we do it our way,

320
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.280
confess within a few days
I might get it

321
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.080
No matter how trashy he is
I can't let a sin that doesn't exist be covered up.

322
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.550
(Haejun) That’s only for the criminal
It's a good thing too

323
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.720
[sigh]

324
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.090
Go Mi-sook is like that.
I'm not even budging.

325
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.930
How do I get it out?

326
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.060
[dark music]

327
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.300
Maybe

328
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.470
Can I meet you sometime?

329
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.720
(Dongsik) That

330
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.990
I'll be guarding whoever comes.
Complete it in 5 minutes

[Sound of door slamming shut]

332
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.830
(Haejun) The night of the 16th

333
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.470
Do you remember running into me?

334
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.800
(Kyungae) Oh, what should I do?

335
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.570
[Kyungae’s heavy breathing]

336
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.980
(Haejun) I won’t die

[Minsu’s sound of pain]

338
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.650
(Minsu) Ah, my fingers, my fingers
Oh, I guess it's broken

339
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.620
(Haejun) I am now
I'm trying to get you out of here.

340
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.860
Don't use your head
Think about it

341
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.430
Where and what have you been doing since then?

342
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.830
Lee Kyung-ae's story

343
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.540
Are you going to tell the police?

344

This is Go Min-soo’s alibi.

How many people do you think will be on the broadcast?

385
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.770
(Reporter Kim) Honestly, at first
I thought about it for 1 minute and 30 seconds.

386
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.140
But when I came, it was 3 minutes, 5 minutes.

I think you're saying that because you don't know much.

You can just push it

407
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.700
Will that work?

408
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.130
Do you think it will work?

I think this name is a pseudonym.

429

From the night of the 16th to the 18th
Because it says he was hospitalized.

(Byunggu) How is it going?
I'm curious too

524
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.750
I called because I was worried.

525
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.520
The town was noisy.
Are you okay?

526
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.220
(Dongsik) My grandson
This is a situation you created.

527
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.300
If you thought it would be dangerous
I should have stopped him, right?

528
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.070
No, I'm not from here either.
I made a fuss for no reason

529
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.640
What if I get noticed?

530
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.310

A lot has been resolved

I can now be protected

532

I almost stopped driving myself.

(Byung-gu) Yes

534
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.350
That's enough, huh?

535
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.850
Now it's up to the police to do the rest.

536
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.260
Are you listening to me now?

537
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.330

Now never again
Don't get involved in dangerous things

Are you staying still? huh?

(Haejun) Yes, and me
I have something to ask you.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.130
Because I was suddenly discharged from the hospital
You probably didn't receive proper treatment.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.170
(Haejun) In a safe place
I wish I was with my family

554

Not this town

I was already worried about it

To a good hospital in Seoul
I'll get it right away, okay?

557

I'll send it to you as is.

(Yoonyoung) What car is this?

565
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.170
I'll take questions as I go.

566
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.070
It's going to take a while anyway

567

Where are we going?

568
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.140

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.230
(Haejun) How about the sea in 1987?

573
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.900
(Yoonyoung) I think it’s a little more blue.

574
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.110
Is it because of my mood?

575
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.740

Check it out, how it is

But I don't plan on coming here
How did you do it?

When I think about it

580

'Haejun'

698

If we make eye contact

705

So, that's why you left?

864
00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.760
