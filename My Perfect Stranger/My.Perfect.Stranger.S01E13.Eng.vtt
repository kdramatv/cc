00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.310
[Dreamy music]
(Misook) What do you mean, stealing?

2
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.670
my novel

3
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.280
Even in front of me
Don't lie shamelessly

4
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.440
(Soon-ae) I’ll tell you everything

5
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.680
(Misuk) Why like this?
Are you being annoying, Sunae?

6
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.150
I was acting out for no reason
Don't be like your sister, Sunae.

7
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.820
In the meantime, to me
The biggest question was

8
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.990
(Haejun) It was this sentence

9
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.920
‘Women who read books are dangerous’

10
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.920
To Jooyoung Lee
There was a book

11
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.660
(Haejun) The reason Lee Kyung-ae went to the abandoned house

12
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.730
Baek Yoo-seop, Joo-young Lee

13
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.200
The only two people
things you said you needed

14
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.430
"Jane Eyre"
(Yoonyoung) It was a book?

15
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.070
(Haejun) To the victims
We really have something in common.

16
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.270
the book I had

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.770
I don't know if this is some kind of warning

18
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.680
(Misook) Women who like books
I wondered why everything was like that

19
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.210
As if I were a special person
I have no luck not being able to see it.

20
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.310
[Misuk’s laughter]

21
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.180
(Minsu) What is it?

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020
[Sound of pain]

23
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.430
(Haejun) For the time being, there are no threads
I can't tie it up.

24
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.230
(Misuk) Does that hand hurt a lot?

25
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.260
[Misuk’s laughter]

26
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.970
Because I keep drinking alcohol

27
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.110
(Misuk) It takes this long

28
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.140
It was an incident in the village.
I saw the culprit

29
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.480
(Misuk) I saw it myself.
Killing it

30
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.890
Are you my brother?

31
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.720
“Even as time passes, love remains”

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.460
[Calm music]

33
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.250
(Byung-gu) Yes
[Byunggu’s sigh]

34
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.880
This is really good stuff, right?

35
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190
(Store owner) Oh, sure.

36
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.290
If you take good care of this, it will last 100 years...

37
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
No, it won't last even 200 years.

38
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.730
Uh, that should be it.

39
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030
Because my grandson will use it later

40
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.260
(Store owner) You mean grandson?

41
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.070
[Surprise] Yeonwoo...

42
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.570
Yeonwoo, have you found a woman to marry?

43
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.040
Is it really a speeding violation?

44
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.440
Wow, this guy
You're talking about big trouble

45
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.940
[Laughing] It’s not like that.

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.680
Isn't it like that?

47
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.280
No, well I did some time ago
Did you have a dream while you were sleeping?

48
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.220
(Byunggu) I was just walking down a foggy road.

49
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.020
Over there, on the mountain behind
You know there's an old tunnel, right?

50
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.020
But inside that tunnel

51
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.260
'Ugh!' And
Just a tiger

52
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.260
Something like this popped out

53
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.490
Ah, you are so kind and held in my arms

54
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.060
It's good, it's a dream

55
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.970
So just
I'm going to take it away in advance

56
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.070
To my grandson's dream

57
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.840
[Both laugh]

58
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.200
(Store owner) Hey
I don't know when it will be

59
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.510
A very smart grandson
I guess he will be born?

60
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.940
You and I
To commemorate the first time we met

61
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.910
I'm buying it in advance

62
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.920
Write, the real meeting is
When will it be?

63
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.020
Wow, I'm really curious, huh?

64
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.350
[Byung-gu and the store owner laugh]

65
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.820
[dark music]

66
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.390
[Sound of running footsteps]

67
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.930
[surprised gasp]

68
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.150
(Yoonyoung) Wait a minute, wait a minute

69
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.120
Wait a minute

70
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.090
It's a misunderstanding

71
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.120
What the detective thinks
That's not the situation

72
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.290
Get out of the way, you'll get hurt.

73
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.790
(Yoonyoung) Hey, no

74
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.500
Hey, I explained it to you earlier.

75
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.900
Tell me to go see the detective.
I'm the person who did it

76
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.370
How could you kill someone?

77
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440
That doesn't make sense!

78
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.070
[Blubbering] Can’t you hear the word ‘Biki’?

79
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.210
(Haejun) It’s okay, Yoonyoung.

80
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.940
It's okay

81
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.850
Please let me talk for a moment.

82
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.920
You will have to stay alone while I am gone.

83
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.460
This is my family

84
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.470
[sigh]

85
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.800
Finished in 3 minutes

86
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.350
You believe me, right?

87
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.250
Why are you asking the obvious?

88
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.420
when i arrived

89
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.890
The situation was already over.

90
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.930
(Haejun) Probably to save his mother

91
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.130
I think I ran into the criminal directly.

92
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.460
[sigh]

93
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.530
What should I do?

94
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.840
What should I do?

95
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.610
I'll be back soon
don't worry too much

96
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.110
I'm going to my mother first.

97
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.250
(Haejun) In the safest place possible
I need to be with people

98
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.220
And maybe

99
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.790
Are you driving?

100
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.030
driving

101
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.160
Do you know how to do it?

102
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.000
[Sad music]

103
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.330
Why are you asking that?

104
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.440
[Crying] He said he'd be back soon

105
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.440
Why are you asking me that now?

106
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.710
if

107
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.020
Even if I...

108
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.320
There's no such thing, there's no such thing as 'what if'

109
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.160
I told you
What kind of future do I want?

110
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.860
No matter what happens, I

111
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.470
I'll be waiting for you at my house

112
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.430
alone

113
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.370
While very scared

114
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.410
So come quickly

115
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.350
Don't get hurt anywhere

116
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.120
I will

117
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.390
I will definitely do that

118
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.670
[shaking breathing]

119
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.910
(Class President) Ah, you shameless bastard.
This, Mr.

120
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.810
Hey, it's done, the evidence is clear.

121
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.220
I'm going to get a confession for no reason
There's no need to waste any more time

122
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.750
Organize what you have well

123
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.850
As soon as I wake up tomorrow morning
Let's send it over

124
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.750
(Detectives) Yes

125
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.090
(Class President) Oh, this disgusting thing.
It's over now, it's over

126
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.460
[Detective 1’s sigh of relief]

127
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.900
[dark music]

128
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.070
[Class leader sighs]

129
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.590
(Class President) Hey, this
Hey, what is this?

130
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.920
Lady, it’s going to spin, really! Mr.

131
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.260
(Hyungman) They said they caught the culprit!

132
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.760
that bastard
It's like they caught it all!

133
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.600
But why does this happen again?

134
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.670
Why to our child again!

135
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.570
What would you have done if something was wrong with him? uh?

136
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.570
(Obok) Father, stop it.
[Hyungman chuckles]

137
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.320
[Hee-seop sobs]

138
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.660
(Hyungman) Because our love is not enough
[Crying breathing]

139
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.900
This bastard of mine
If I get caught, I'll tear you to pieces!

140
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.140
[Okja sobs]

141
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.910
(Okja) Ah, my baby
Oh, what should I do, oh

142
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.510
Sunae, huh? Wow
[Sobbing]

143
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.460
[Meaningful music]

144
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.630
(Detective 2) Wait a minute.

145
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.240
[nervous music]

146
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.740
[Okja’s surprised gasp]

147
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.720
(Detective 2) From student Lee Soon-ae
Bongbong Cafe matchbox has arrived.

148
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.730
There was also a note in it.

149
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.600
Sentence that women who read books are dangerous
From what is written to the handwriting

150
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.700
I'm sure

151
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.400
With the things he wrote before
It's exactly the same

152
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.140
(Haejun) Go Mi-sook
I was a witness, not the culprit.

153
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.880
The culprit is a man

154
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.610
That face
The only person who knows

155
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.880
I'm Go Mi-sook

156
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.620
(Detective 2) I guess
The guy in that abandoned house

157
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.390
I think he's the real culprit

158
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.560
Uh, yeah

159
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.760
(Dongsik) As soon as student Lee Soon-ae wakes up
Contact me right away

160
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.770
yes

161
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.500
[Dongsik sighs]

162
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.640
Mr. Hae-jun Yoon

163
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.850
Between the night of the 16th and the early morning of the 17th

164
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.920
So

165
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.390
Jooyoung Lee, Kyungae Lee
The time he was murdered

166
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.530
Where were you and what were you doing?

167
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.230
[nervous music]

168
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.370
(Misuk) What is it?

169
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.400
Who is the culprit?

170
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.010
Who is the criminal?

171
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.870
Why are you asking me that?

172
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.340
Someone died again

173
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.020
(Yoonyoung) This time it’s a boy

174
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.020
Same school, same grade as you

175
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.550
A boy who was fine
He died in an abandoned house, why?

176
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.620
Otherwise
Because Lee Soon-ae is probably dead

177
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.960
What are you saying?

178
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.960
To the real criminal
Soonae almost died

179
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.770
He died trying to save it.

180
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.170
He died because of you!

181
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.300
Why is it all because of me?

182
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.980
(Yoonyoung) In the first place, you
Even if you report it properly

183
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.380
Yes, with those lies

184
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.390
Instead of the real culprit
Putting in the wrong people

185
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.750
Even if you didn't do anything stupid

186
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.320
This kind of thing
It wouldn't have happened

187
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.900
I heard something from someone and came
I don't know if it's like this

188
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.700
i don't know anything

189
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.100
[Rough breathing]

190
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.340
Cut the bullshit and tell me

191
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.180
[Screaming] Who is the culprit?

192
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.980
(Misuk) What are you?
Do you keep telling me this and that?

193
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.820
What is it that keeps appearing in front of me?
Is it a distraction, huh?

194
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.290
Anyway, your plan is now

195
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.160
You're wrong, Go Mi-sook.

196
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.330
Korean language teacher was caught

197
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.970
[Sound of stepping back]

198
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.570
(Immature) What?

199
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.010
Now that person is everything
It might turn over

200
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.380
What do you mean?

201
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.280
It's all messed up

202
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.590
(Yoonyoung) To the police
Go Min-su, who was caught

203
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.520
Who could he have killed?

204
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.560
It's the police anyway.
We'll need a new criminal

205
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.190
After all, that’s it!

206
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.560
[Yoonyoung’s heavy breathing]

207
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.770
[heavy music]

208
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.610
I know why you did that, Go Mi-sook.

209
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.410
But not this

210
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.180
too many people
It's getting dangerous.

211
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.480
If you need another way
let me help you

212
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.150
So me
Help me just once, Mi-sook.

213
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.050
If you just tell me who the culprit is...

214
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.190
Let go

215
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.930
I don't need help from you

216
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.130
I don't know anything so just go

217
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.140
[shaking breathing]
[Sound of door opening and closing]

218
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.640
(Dong-sik) Lee Kyung-ae at the scene
I already know that you showed up

219
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.640
I'm asking about before that.

220
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.610
Where were you and what were you doing?

221
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.550
With Yoo Beom-ryong
We were together back then too

222
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.460
I got a call from Yoo Beom-ryong.

223
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.660
Even then
[Meaningful music]

224
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.960
(Beomryong) He’s dead, teacher.

225
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.800
dead

226
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.630
That's what happened in the end

227
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.340
[Rough breathing]

228
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.640
[Feeding away]

229
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.440
You were looking at Lee Joo-young’s body?

230
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.450
In a very scared state
They found me, their homeroom teacher.

231
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.580
I was afraid to tell the police

232
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.520
(Beomryong) [Crying] They say you’re a communist.

233
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.660
Even after seeing it twice
That I didn't report it

234
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.260
If I get caught, I...

235
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.060
(Haejun) Getting involved with teacher Jooyoung Lee
The reason I was so scared

236
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.730
You probably know better.

237
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.130
Because I also have a nephew

238
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.370
[laughter]

239
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.470
No way, this right now

240
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.440
If you plan on leaving it all to Beomryong Yoo...

241
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.640
(Haejun) They asked me about my alibi.
I'm just answering honestly.

242
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.110
Beomryong Yoo is not the culprit.

243
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.820
You can tell just by looking at the handwriting.

244
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.120
That's the same in my case too

245
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.090
When you go to school
You will know more accurately

246
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.320
Meanwhile, taking exams and doing homework.

247
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.360
That much
Because I couldn't have faked it all

248
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.060
[sigh]

249
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.570
[Dongsik sighs]

250
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.810
(Dongsik) Then what is this?
[secret music]

251
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.340
Why is this
Did it come out of your pocket?

252
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.380
[sigh]

253
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.980
I picked it up, it was

254
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.150
(Dongsik) [screaming] You
Are you kidding me?

255
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.890
(Haejun) It’s so fucking twisted
I know this is the situation.

256
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.360
There are many ways to check.

257
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.820
my handwriting

258
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.590
And student Lee Soon-ae

259
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.260
Listen when you wake up

260
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.630
Who were you running from?

261
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.770
Yoo Beom-ryong
Why did I have to die there?

262
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.670
Because I’m so curious, it’s driving me crazy.
[Soaring music]

263
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.940
[laughter]

264
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.780
Every time we run into each other

265
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.920
What was suspicious
It wasn't once or twice, you

266
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.930
(Dongsik) So, this opportunity
To find out more properly

267
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.230
Why was it everywhere?

268
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.730
Look forward to it

269
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.540
Because it will be difficult to escape this time

270
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.720
[The door slams shut]

271
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.710
[Lonely music]

[Sound of flowing water]
[surprised gasp]

273
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.730
(Jooyoung) That’s ridiculous
I know it's a sound

274
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.230
Teacher Yoon, definitely

275
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.200
To save me
I think you came here on purpose.

276
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.940
Thank you

277
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.070
Oh, that's really me too

278
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.310
pure love girl tuition
I was trying to do it for you

279
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.150
[Soonae’s frightened breathing]

280
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.580
(Haejun) Oh, Sunae, I’m a teacher.

281
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.520
[Crying] Teacher

282
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.220
The criminal is chasing me from behind.

283
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.220
(Haejun) Come to your senses
Beomryong, beomryong

284
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.030
(Yoonyoung) No matter what happens, I

285
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.800
I'll be waiting for you at my house

286
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.370
So come quickly

287
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.500
Don't get hurt anywhere

288
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.000
I will definitely do that

289
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.280
[Lonely music]

290
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.320
(Hyungman) But who is he?
Have you been crying since last night?

291
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.930
The kid who went up to the roof of our house

292
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.460
(Hyungman) What?

293
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.000
Then that kid...

294
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.370
(Okja) Oh, just leave it alone.

295
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.070
You're the one who suffered because of us.

296
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.270
Without any sin
When caught by the police

297
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.280
I think of our pure love
Keep your mouth shut

298
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.720
I feel like I haven't eaten all day

299
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.750
Why are you starving?

300
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.390
(Hyungman) Who are you?
Are you starving because of Sunae?

301
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.860
(Okja) It’s a big shock, right?
Because there is nothing wrong

302
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.800
You'll wake up soon

303
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.730
Huh? Eat it quickly

304
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.310
[Hyungman sighs]

[Heeseop sighs]
[Sound of chopsticks being placed]

306
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.990
I don't think it will pass

307
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.060
(Hee-seop) I heard that Sun-ae is lying down.

308
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.860
Oh, how scary it was...

309
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.760
Oh, how terrible it was.

310
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.000
I can't even break it

311
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.670
[Heeseop’s exasperated breathing]

312
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.900
The guy who will kill me

313
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.170
As soon as I get caught
I really won't leave you alone.

314
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.340
That's what you need to eat more, man

315
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.140
(Hyungman) The boy
Squeeze, tsk

316
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.580
quickly

317
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.810
'Ah'

318
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.420
'Ah'

319
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.820
Eat like this, quickly.

320
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.590
Uh-huh, hurry up and grab your chopsticks
[Calm music]

[Dongsik sighs]
[Sound of opening]

322
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.330
come out

323
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.530
[Meaningful music]

324

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.440
(Dongsik) What is it?

327
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.200
What happened?

328
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.870
Your ID, resume, teacher certification

329
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.740
It's all fake
[Soaring music]

330
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.680
What happened?

331
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.980
Just in case
Previous place of work, previous address

332
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.580
everything you wrote down
I searched everything, but

333
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.350
There was a person called you, Yoon Hae-jun.
There were no traces anywhere

334
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.690
[Dongsik laughs]

335
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.920
no

336
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.290
You were never even born?

337
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.900
What does this mean
Do you know if it's acceptable?

338
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.660
more dangerous than murder
Do you know what the situation is?

339
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.570
When given the chance, speak straight and quickly.

340
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.380
You and Baek Yunyoung

341
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.580
Both tied up tightly
I want to pass it off as a spy

342
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.920
Hold on tight
Because I want to listen to you.

343
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.520
Because of that damn debt

344
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.120
(Hee-seop) My uncle was wrong.

345
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.000
While hospitalized
You never came to visit me

346
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.000
I guess you don’t know.

347
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.470
My surname and I
If it weren't for you,

348
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.600
I didn't know what would happen

349
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:43.440
Come to the hospital every day
I tapped my shoulder for no reason

350
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.550
It was like a guardian.
[heavy music]

351
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.220
No more for Brother Woodel

352
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.750
Guardian

353
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.350

(Dongsik) These ridiculous things

357
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.060
No need to ask any more
I did some suspicious things

358
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.970
Because I brought it to you

359
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.100

Please explain, okay?

361
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.110
If you do

362
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.080
Are you going to believe it?

To be honest,

Can you trust me?

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.660
What?

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.830
I have something to show you

I want to think of it as a debt
I have no preference

(Haejun) If you think so
Just one more time

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.550
No, this...

383
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.020
“The serial killer, Mr. Koh, is in prison for life.”

384
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.220

[Meaningful sound effects]

Why is the report I wrote here...

387

I think you have to see it to believe it.

388
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.580
(Haejun) I

It won't be that distant a relationship.

The one who is my father's father

394

It's Baek Yoon-young.

You may have already encountered it several times.

398

(Byung-gu) No, that’s right

Does this mean you came here?

(Haejun) Yes

401

Because the wrong culprit was caught

402
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.470
(Dongsik) So you die

403
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.910
So I came to catch the criminal myself.

404
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.910
Is this it?

405
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.110

No, you wake up.

Wake up, you bastard!

412
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.500
A bastard like you should send the National Intelligence Service
send me to a mental hospital

413

Anyway, one of the two
Because I will definitely send it to you!

Just one thing from abroad
They said it was brought in with difficulty.

'Waiting for me'

709
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.790
‘So you bought something like this’ Well, then

710
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.570
As time goes by
[Calm music]

711
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.340
Even if I have to leave this world forever

712
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.010
My thoughts about my baby
100 years, 200 years left

713
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.850
I hope you will protect him reliably.
Well, with that feeling

714
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.490
[Byunggu’s sigh]

715
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.430
By the way

716
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.570
Who on earth is our Yeonwoo partner?

717
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.370
(Byung-gu) [in a drunken voice]
No, then Bongbong Cafe Cheongah

718
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.880
Are you saying that you are my mother and my daughter-in-law?

719
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.080
really?

720
00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.880
(Haejun) Ah, no matter if it’s real or fake
walk straight, fast

721
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.380
Walk straight, child.

722
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:52.780
(Byung-gu) Hey, hey, hey
Wait, wait, here

723
00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:54.590
Ah, that's where your mom is!

724
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:57.120
- (Haejun) Baby, please
- (Byung-gu) [Laughing] Hey

725
00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.360
Let's go up

726
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.060
Haejun, let’s go, okay?

727
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.460
what is your mom doing now

728
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:07.400
Take a quick trip with Grandpa
Let's just see it once, let's go

729
00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.770
(Haejun) Hey, what are you looking at?

730
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.700
Go straight, go straight

731
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.670
- Go home, go home
- (Byung-gu) Hey, let’s go.

[Byunggu’s laughter]
[Hae-joon’s struggling voice]

733
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.840
(Haejun) Oh my
Walk straight, walk straight

734
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.840
(Byung-gu) Ah, grandfather

735
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.510
(Haejun) Oh my, oh my

It comes out well, it comes out well

737

Damn old man, oh

[Byung-gu’s faint groan]

739
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.490
I tell you to drink a little bit, a little bit.

740
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.260
You'll suffer from blood pressure later, yes?

741
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.700

(Cheongah) Winner

752

Everything is free today

753
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.940
Just Bongbong Cafe
I won as the 20,000th customer.

754
00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.410
That makes sense...

755
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:30.670
Is it true?

756
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.150
Don't talk unnecessarily
I know I shouldn’t recommend menus.

757
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.120
(Cheongah) When we reach the 20,000th customer,
I can't give in either

758
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.250
Sit down, I’ll make you a Ssanghwacha.

759
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.390
Huh?

(Haejun) Why are you sitting?

763
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.580
(Cheongah) Hmm

764
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.620
20,000th customer

765
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.020
pretend to be

766
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.330
I'm going to make an excuse and try to mix things up.

767
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.060
With you, Yoon Hae-jun

768
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:31.000
How among so many names
I don't know why he did it

769
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.770
Did your lover tell you my name?

770
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.610
before

771
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.210
When we meet at the movie theater
Why did you look at me like that?

772
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:44.520
(Haejun) How did I see it?

773
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:48.590
(Cheongah) And then for a while again
Why did you ignore me?

774
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.160
Are you interrogating me now?

775
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.460
It's not like that

776
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.500
[Cheongah’s sigh]

777
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.370
Because I want to eat a lot of good things
I can't eat it because it's so soggy.

778
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.810
This is my tenth twin car.
[Sound of putting down glass]

779
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.940
Why can't I eat it?

780
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:17.380
Because it's the last time

781
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.380
Because you are the last customer, you

782
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.620
It's the last time?

783
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.660
[sigh]

784
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.860
I'm going to close this cafe now.

785
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.460
This town will open

786
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.200
[sigh]

787
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.980
Are you leaving this town?

788
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.880
Yeonwoo, no

789
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.550
Does your lover know?

790
00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.120
Of course you don't know

791
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.530
Only for you
I'm telling you something special.

792
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.060
Why to me?

793
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:06.430
I don't know

794
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.770
I guess you were meant to hear it

795
00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:10.900
(Cheongah) So
Didn’t you come at just the right time?

796
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:14.100
I'm just trying to become lighter
Aiming for this time

797
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.780
What is your reason for leaving?

798
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.610
[Sound of intake of breath]

799
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.280
If you wanted to know that too

800
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:29.150
You should have become closer to me a long time ago.

801
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.550
It's too late now

802
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:33.320
(Cheong-ah) I have to sort things out soon, now.

803
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.310
[sigh]

804
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.580
Why are you leaving already?

805
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.890
(Yeonwoo) Huh? When did you come here, bro?

806
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:11.700
(Haejun) Uh, just now

807
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.770
It was pretty late

808
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.970
Is that so?

809
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.740
Ah, focus again
I forgot how time passed

810
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:25.980
(Yeonwoo) Who else?
I forgot something like toast.

811
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.650
Oh, sorry, you didn't have dinner, right?

812
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:32.580
Oh, that’s okay, if you feel bloated.
My head doesn't work well

813
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.920
(Yeonwoo) You had a hard time, right?

814
00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.560
I was misunderstood for no reason

815
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.360
They said they saved someone

816
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.100
He was a really good person, bro.

817
00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.500
[Laughing] I didn’t even know that
I just...

818
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.410
Oh, my girlfriend's face
I have to go see it.

819
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.640
Going to see your girlfriend, now?

820
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:03.380
Yeah, I guess
Since I've been here these days

821
00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.420
I can't even see your face properly

822
00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.050
(Yeonwoo) Maybe that’s why
Looks like he's a little upset

823
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.620
I need to go quickly and get some points.

824
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.660
Is that okay? Toast next time

825
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.660
[Sound of running footsteps]

826
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.200
[Sad music]

827
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.900
[People sob]

828
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:51.930
[Yeonwoo’s sigh]

829
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.010
Did you meet your lover yesterday?

830
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.340
Yeah, it's been a while since we had a good date.

831
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:08.850
[Yeonwoo’s light smile]

832
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:10.510
Yeah?

833
00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.620
Well, nothing special happened, right?

834
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.480
It was the same as usual?

835
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.350
(Yeonwoo) Why? There has to be something special?

836
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.790
No, I was just asking.

837
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.430
(Yeonwoo) [Laughing] What is it?
It's bland, it's bitter

838
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.500
- (Yoonyoung) Now
-Thank you

839
00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.140
(Yoonyoung) Oh, there are so many, but

840
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.440
(Soonae) So
I don't know what brought so much

841
00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.980
It's really okay

842
00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.150
(Yoonyoung) Even so
I guess he wanted to comfort me

843
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.450
Shake it off and get up again

844
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.380

[Hae-joon’s awkward laugh]

850
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:19.820
(Haejun) Are you feeling okay?

851
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.150
(Soonae) Yes

852
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.720
Ah

853
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:29.790
Because of me, you were misunderstood for no reason.
I heard you had a hard time...

854
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:34.460
Because I couldn't find it sooner
I'm sorry, Sunae.

855
00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.670
Oh no

856
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:41.270
(Soonae) If it weren’t for the teacher
I would have been caught right away, I

857
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.910
On that dark and scary road
When I saw the teacher's face

858
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.310
'I lived' for a moment

859
00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.750
How relieved I was after this.

860
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.430
But how did it come out?

861
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:04.490
(Haejun) Ah

862
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.500
Now I can come out

863
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.440
[Yoonyoung and Haejun’s light laughter]

864
01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.910
It looks like a lot of people came to visit?

865
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:22.810
(Yoonyoung) Yes
Many village people also came.

866
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.780
my homeroom teacher
You know the personality of the drill teacher.

867
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.120
Kids in every class
Bring a bunch of them and bring them

868
01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.090
So noisy

869
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.720
(Soonae) Far from stability
Because I was out of my mind.

870
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.190
[Yoonyoung’s light smile]

[Soaring music]

872
01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.860
Since when has this been here?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.310
[Tense sound effect]

874
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.180
[intense music]

875
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.540
(Haejun) The culprit is
have been here before

876
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.150
Maybe traces of failure
to get rid of it again

877
