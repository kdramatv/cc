00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.830
What is this, stupid?

700
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.880
you want to protect someone

701
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.350
I want to abandon someone

702
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.130
Hopefully we can each other
Can you help?

703
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.860
What do you want to do with me?

704
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.910
What your brother did

705

[laughter]

706
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.010
Oh, you stupid bitch.

707
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:29.810
I don't even know what I know

708
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.280
(Heeseop) What and how do you know?
I don't know if you came.

709
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.150
This is mine

[intense music]

711
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.530

Why are you like this, ah!

715
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:07.880
(Man 4) No.
I'm not really

716
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:09.220
(Detective 3) But why does it jump out?

717
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.620
(Man 4) Hey, you too, detective.
Oh my god, what did I do?

718
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.420
(Detective 3) Where did you lie?
Baby, it's so real

719
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:17.590
Hey, don't you speak straight, are you? uh?

[Soaring music]

723
00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.560
I did it all

724
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.090
(Yoonyoung) Who am I?

725
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.800
Where am I?

726
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.240
such a long time
To me who came over, you are the only one

727
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.640
Should I have told you this?

728
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.380
[with a trembling voice] Everything
It finally becomes clear

729
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.080
to me you are

730
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:55.890
Incomprehensible from beginning to end

731
00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.190
No, I don't want to understand

732
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:04.160
He must have been a pathetic human being
That was all

733
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.510

[Painful sound]
must live well

739
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.330
You must live, right?

740
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.000
Come to your senses, Baek Hee-seop, come to your senses.
[Heeseop’s heavy breathing]

741
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.670
(Heeseop) It’s so bad, really.

(Haejun) Come to your senses and look straight!
[Passionate music]

743
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.880
Listen carefully

744
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.180
This is

745
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.690
your whole life

746
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:03.920
The future of your entire family
It's a problem that can be changed

747
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.890
If you're lying...

748
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.670
what will happen
No one knows better than me

749
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.300
Don't meddle and go cheap.

750
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.540
(Heeseop) procrastinate
If you don't want to see blood together,

751
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.610
(Yoonyoung) Let’s go

752
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.180
There's nothing more to hear
He said he did it

753
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.250
Let's make sure they pay for their sins properly.

754
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.460
I don't know if that's possible

755

Keep with me
Meeting each other like this

769
00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.340
never to you
It won't be a good thing

770
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.580
Just be aware, understand?

771
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:12.520
go

I start thinking about others again

781
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.160
It's all my father
It was something I did.

782
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:35.570
(Yoonyoung) You
The reason I came this far

783
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.570
That's why I ended up here
What followed me

784
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.210
I don't know if it's all because of that

785
00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:52.420
how to forgive
I don't know if I should pray

[Yoonyoung continues to sob]

787

no

791
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.620
You won't be able to do that.

792
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.460
This time my father confesses
Because even the police heard it

793
01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:36.730
You will be properly punished

794
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.630
Mom will find out soon too.

795
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.940
Then something like marriage
Of course it will be in vain

796
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.940
- Then I...
- (Haejun) Because he disappeared

797
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.880
Would it be comforting to me?

798
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.190
I'm sorry

799
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.890
That won't happen and I'll make sure it doesn't happen.

뭐야, 이거?
Why did you hide this here?

808
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.060
But when asked why
The answer I came up with was ‘mine’.

809
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.790
Don't hesitate to ask for items from your room.

810
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.730
(Yoonyoung) I’m sure

811

From a young age, my uncle

812
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.860
It's his
Because I couldn't even touch it

813
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.800
(Dongsik) Hee-seop, this is

814
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.900
This is Yusuf’s, right? huh?

This is mine

816
01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.240
Even if my younger brother gets caught instead
I'm a person who pretends not to know and hides.
