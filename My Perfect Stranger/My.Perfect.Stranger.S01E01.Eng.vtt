(Haejun) I lived as a reporter for 7 years
[Throwing sound]

23
00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:10.722
To the person who only chased after facts
That's too fantasy

24
00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:16.402
The protagonist of such an absurd fantasy
I don't even have the slightest intention of becoming

[Haejun sighs]

26
00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:21.282

path completely
It was like leaving.

49
00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:47.302
Like this in front of you
Because you're talking nonsense

50
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:53.472
(Child 1) You seem like a crazy man, brother.

51
00:05:55.062 --> 00:05:57.892
(Child 2) It’s pitiful.
Let's just listen

52
00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:01.902
Do you have what I gave you earlier?

(Hyungman) How much trouble have you had?
[People are noisy]

63
00:06:31.802 --> 00:06:32.932
Take care of adults well

[Chief's urging]

88
00:07:33.572 --> 00:07:35.242
Ah, what's wrong, you man!
I told you not to do it

- (Byung-gu) Ugh...

100
00:08:07.562 --> 00:08:09.612
(Haejun) We love each other like that
Even though I don't know much

101
00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:12.612
Because I blindly believe it
It was a tragedy

(Resident 3) What do you mean?
[Residents are upset]

each in a different direction
will start running amok

107
00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:28.712
They've all inhaled the bond.

108
00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:31.342
Three of them are female students from this village.

109
00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:33.132
(Hyungman) What do you mean, what is that now?

110
00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.422
(Byung-gu) The kids in our village
Doing bond?

(Hyungman) Who are you?

118
00:08:48.352 --> 00:08:49.862
Somewhere in someone else's village

119
00:08:49.942 --> 00:08:52.652
Somewhere in someone else's village

(Yuri Jomo) No

127
00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:08.042
Is this our granddaughter?

128
00:09:08.122 --> 00:09:10.672
(Haejun) Are you okay? yes?

(Byung-gu) Over there
First of all, it's a kids problem, uh.

135
00:09:33.732 --> 00:09:34.652
Let's believe it

[Eunha’s laughter]

147
00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:10.192
I lost my footing on that cliff

148
00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:12.652
I decided to end my life at nineteen
your destiny was already in place

149

(Haejun) Shall I push you?

170
00:11:06.202 --> 00:11:08.952
You're the one who lured the kids into bondage.

171
00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:11.122
You have to pretend to be in danger there.

172
00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:13.422
It was the other kids who really died.

173
00:11:13.502 --> 00:11:16.422
I almost sent away two fine kids.
Because I have no intention of helping you.

174

what?

190
00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:18.772
What do you know

191
00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:22.362
your mother
Even if you are so different

192
00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.242
I live because of you

193
00:12:27.822 --> 00:12:31.492
So don't take the kids again
Don't do this, okay?

194
00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.502
It's annoying me too

195
00:12:39.712 --> 00:12:41.882
(Haejun) There’s no need to add you too

196
00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:44.672
This town in the future
It's full of people who need to be saved

uh? Ah, oh, oh, oh

214
00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:29.222
Should I say thank you...
Should I say thank you...

215
00:13:29.302 --> 00:13:31.682
It was just one deviation

216
00:13:31.762 --> 00:13:34.392
Students who are still young
Rather than driving them out unconditionally

217
00:13:34.472 --> 00:13:37.482
(Haejun) Embrace me inside
What leads me

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:40.352
of our adults
Isn't it a natural obligation, yes?

219
00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:43.572
(Byunggu) No, how can I change my mind?
Those words that make me feel like I've looked into them...

220
00:13:43.652 --> 00:13:45.942
(Hyungman) No, but
How did you know all that?

221
00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:48.112
What about 30 seconds, what about 5 minutes?

222
00:13:48.192 --> 00:13:50.242
until that time
It all fit perfectly.

(Haejun) One month
It's been like that for a long time
