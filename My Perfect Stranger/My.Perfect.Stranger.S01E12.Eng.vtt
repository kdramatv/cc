(Haejun) For the time being, there are no threads
I can't tie it up.

12
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.850
(Haejun) Both of them are wearing red yarn
Because he was found tied up.

(Yunyoung) What Yoo Beom-ryong was afraid of
It wasn't about murder.

(Haejun) What Baek Hee-seop was trying to cover up
It wasn't murder

What do you mean, that?

Who do you want me to be?
I wonder if I found this place

28
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.690
If you really wanted to know who I am
I should have gone to the police

(Haejun) At my house
I found something like that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.560
In my garage
There were even more strange things.

31
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.600
He is a very suspicious person.

32
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.630
I should have asked the police to reveal it.

33
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.600
It could have been

34

You came to me in the end

Because I probably couldn't do that.

So till the end
I tried to pretend not to know

179
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.200
(Haejun) To us
Although I don't have much time

180
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.570
Wait a minute

181
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.440
You think it's stopped, well

182
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.570
[Reporters are buzzing]

183
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.770
[Siren sounds getting closer]

184
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.210
(Reporter 1) Oh, it’s coming, it’s coming!

185
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.710
[Reporters’ busy sounds]
[nervous music]

186
00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.950
[Continuous camera shutter sound]

187
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.580
(Detective 2) Hey, come out

188
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.350
(Reporter 2) Is this the real culprit?

189
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.220
- Please say something!
- (Detective 2) Come on, come out, come on, come on

190
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.390
[Continued question baptism]
(Reporter 2) Don’t push!

191
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.020
(Reporter 3) Is this the real culprit?

192
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.830
The wool found at the scene
I heard there was a matchbox too.

193
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.460
(Detective 2) Oh, why are you doing this already?
Still a suspect, shit

194
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.870
(Reporter 4) If you think it’s almost right,
It will work, right, Brother Jang?

195
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.630
Brother Jang himself arrested you?

196
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.340
(Detective 2) Child
Well, that's right, but

197
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.910
Just wait and see

198
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.710
Always on the road in front of our chief
Stop writing those shit-sprinkling articles.

199
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.610
(Reporter 4) Oh, then
Now you should get promoted as usual.

200
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.980
Turning a crisis into an opportunity?
[Reporter 4 laughs]

201
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.620
(Detective 3) Now, now, now
Please move out of the way

202
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.390
[Noisy]

203
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
[Moon So-ri]

204
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.930
Oh, yeah, I think I'm here now, yeah
[Detectives urging]

205
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.690
(Class President) Ah, yes
We will sort it out as soon as possible

206
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.300
Yeah, yeah yeah
[Detective 3’s laughter]

207
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.530
Minsu

208
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.440
They say you were the culprit?

209
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.840
(Detective 2) [Laughing] Child

210
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.240
(Minsu) Yes?
[Minsu’s hiccups]

211
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.080
- Yes
- (Class President) Oh my!

212
00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:08.120
How much alcohol did this bastard drink?
Why are you so out of control and drunk?

213
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.020
Oh, because I drank alcohol.
Let's blow it, Captain.

214
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.350
[Detectives laugh]

215
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.520
(Minsu) Misook

216
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.630
Where is my younger sister Misuk?

217
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.300
[Detectives clear their coughs]

218
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.470
(Class president) Hey, let him sleep for now.

219
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.010
As soon as you come to your senses, confess
Let's finish it as quickly as possible

이제 집에 갈 수 있겠다, 아유

226
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.420
드릴 말씀 있습니다

227
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.390
성냥갑은 나왔지만
쪽지는 없지 않았습니까

228
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.460
쪽지야 그 자리에서
적어 가지고 찢어 넣었겠지

229
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.400
(반장) 빈 성냥갑이 있었다는
사실 자체가 중요한 거 아니야?

230
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.700
What I prepared in advance, that
[dark music]

231
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.600
[Dongsik sighs]

232
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.470
(Dong-sik) In Go Min-soo’s room
When I looked through my notes,

233
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.840
The handwriting was completely different.

234
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.340
Do you do emotions?

235
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.710
(Class President) And if it’s like you
Would you have written it as usual?

236
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.410
I probably just passed it off
[Dongsik’s frustrated breathing]

237
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.480
This is definitely better
You need to do some research.

238
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.420
Hey, Baek Dong-sik

239
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.490
They say there's a kid who saw it in person.
What else should you consider?

240
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.990
(Class President) And not you.
What kind of idiot ruins my family?

241
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.690
Reliable eyewitness testimony
Even the evidence

242

This is all over

243

Ah, I thought I was doing well in the past.
You drink water from me and then you are like a bastard.

your mother and my future self
Save it well

250

Let's go back together

251
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.580
(Haejun) And
Let's play for a long time with me

252

(Yoonyoung) [surprised] Grandfather

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.260
(Hyungman) Oh my
It was dark so I was quiet.

(Haejun) Oh my

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.160
Grandpa?

256
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.790
Looking at me?

257
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.930
You said you got a call from your grandfather?

258
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.540
Uh, I'll have to go in and call you back.
[Yoonyoung’s awkward laughter]

259
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.710
(Haejun) Stop
Let's go in, yeah

260
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.640
(Hyungman) Wait a minute

261
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.910

Our pure love
[Embarrassed laughter]

264
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.820
You say you became a novelist?

265
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.290
That's awesome, right?

266
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.700
Ah, of course
[Calm music]

267
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.930
(Haejun) It’s such an amazing thing.

(Hyungman) Yes

269
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.100
It's a good thing

270
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.570
I have nowhere to brag about.

271
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.070
I'm afraid people will make fun of me

272
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.940
I laugh heartily after losing my first child

273
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.350
(Haejun) Still, there is something to celebrate
You should celebrate

274
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.620
Congratulations
You must be very proud.

275
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.320
Thank you

I think I should try ordering more.

Absolutely

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.200
Let's go in, yeah

282
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.140
Yes, take a break.

[dark music]
Go Min-soo...

289
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.780
(Haejun) Probably by now
I might have been caught

290
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.590
If you've already been caught
It would be difficult to get it out right away.

291
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.730
the police

292
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.490
Because there’s no way I’ll give up easily.

293
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.370
(Yoonyoung) I witnessed it myself.
The person who reported it was a family member.

294
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.440
Who would doubt that?

295
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.740
In the end, the real culprit

296
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.040
You have to have solid evidence for that too.
I think they'll release it

[Gyeongae’s encouraging sound]

(Hae-jun) Go Min-soo has an incident happen.
I was seriously injured just a few hours ago.

[Minsu’s sound of pain]

301
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.390
exactly since that time
completely disappeared

302
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.020
Only after I got better did I show up and get caught.

303
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.260
Go Min-soo himself did all of that.
You probably didn't plan it

304
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.840
(Yoonyoung) Even that
If it was Go Mi-sook’s plan,

305
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.240
There was a murder that night
Immediately after

306
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.580
Go Min-soo is in that kind of state.
Even hiding it from others

307
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.020
So you're saying it's all done?

308
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.520
It must have been a very busy night.
Go Mi-suk

309
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.890
Not a fake witness

310
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.600
(Yoonyoung) The real witness
It would be nice if you come forward and give it to me.

311
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.900
Hae-kyung Kim.

312
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.540
I guess you're very scared

313
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.610
(Haejun) If Go Mi-sook’s novel is true
After all, you must have seen something firsthand.

314
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.850
But now again
I don't know how it will change

315
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.320
I probably would have done it until now, but

316
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.190
Go Min-soo is really getting caught.
Because I got to see it

On my wrist like this
tied red yarn

321
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.740
That's Mi-sook, in her brother's room.
I heard you came out

322
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.980

He's terrible too
I said it was scary

That's all what your brother did.

Hey, honestly, the one I feel sorry for is Lee Soon-ae.
Are you Go Mi-sook?

328
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.660
(Yuri) He also took away Lee Soon-ae’s novel.

329
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.430
Their brother is their sister
They say they even killed me

330
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.740
(Eunha) Ugh
Still, I feel sorry for Mi-sook

331
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.870

I told you I didn't know!

Where do I keep hearing things from and to me...

341

Okay, okay.
I won't ask anything

342

Just say something to the teacher...

It's not because I'm dissatisfied.

352

Please give me this instead

(Hee-seop) When the doctor leaves the hospital
I was told to practice walking a lot.

371

While blowing the bond
There was an uproar, huh?

[heavy music]

705
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.710
(Dongsik) Hey, you bastard, come to your senses

706
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.650
Get the kids to the hospital first, quickly.

707
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:24.650
(Detective 5) Ah, yes

708
00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.980
Wait a minute, piggyback

709
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:29.190
one, two, three
[Detective 5 and Hee-seop’s encouraging sounds]

710
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.590

[Passionate music]

715
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.420
Yoo Beom-ryong

716
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.320
(Haejun) Beomryong-ah

717
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.590
Come to your senses, Beomryong.

718
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.930
Beomryong, come to your senses! Yoo Beom-ryong!

(Beomryong) [Sobbing] But
teacher

722
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.020
About me

723

No matter what happens I
I really want to find it

724
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.190
please help me

725
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:24.660
Earlier in the mountain

726
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.530
Sunae is looking at me
I saw your eyes

727
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.940
You look at me with so much fear in your eyes

728
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.680
I'm such a terrible person
I think it's done

729
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.650
teacher

730
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.220
maybe

731
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:52.920
Maybe this is my chance
You don't know, do you?

732
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.070
[Sound of running footsteps]

733
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:06.670

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:32.200
[nervous music]

736
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.140
Come down with your hands up, you bastard!

737
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.860
[Soaring music]

738
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.400
[Dongsik’s surprised gasp]

739
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.300
you bastard

745
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:30.670
-Who is the culprit?
- (Misuk) Why are you asking me that?

746
01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.980
Someone died again

747
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.840
(Yoonyoung) Same school, same grade as you

748
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:35.710
A boy who was fine
died in an abandoned house

749
01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.050
Otherwise
Because Lee Soon-ae is probably dead

750
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.220
(Dongsik) Come out

751
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.350
Your ID, resume, teacher certification
It's all fake

752
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.490
Previous place of work, previous address

753
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.790
everything you wrote down
I searched everything, but

754
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.930
You weren't even born?
