00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.100
I have news
I'm sorry for not paying attention.

178
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.640
Were you watching?
no

179
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.810
no

180
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.250
It's not like that
It's about imagining different things, right?

181
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.720
(Yoonyoung) That’s a topic I live on, but
I want to be guaranteed safety

182
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.260
Then I
Well, because of reporting or something?

183
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.960
Well, it kind of feels like that.

184
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.100
When does the incident happen?

185
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.480
[sigh]

186
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.340
One case occurred two days later, on the 14th.

187
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.150
It happened again two days later, on the 16th.

188
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.050
(Haejun) A total of two women
I lost my life

189
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.290
- On the 20th...
- (Yoonyoung) One person disappeared.

190
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.960
Because I left a note
Although I was treated as a runaway

191
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.290
Actually he died

192
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.900
[Meaningful music]
What did you say now?

193
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.630
He died

194
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.500
Because there were three victims in total.

195
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.680
(Haejun) For over 30 years

196
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.910
There is no trace of anything, let alone a body.
has never been found

197
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.650
Neither the police nor the victim's family know
How do you...

198
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.490
(Yoonyoung) It may be hard to believe, but I just

199
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.260
I just said what was written here.

200
00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.900
It's a novel

201
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.270
Written by Go Mi-sook

202
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.740
(Host) Teacher

203
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.180
Can you please give me a little spoiler?
Can you please give me a little spoiler?

204
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.750
(middle-aged immature) Hmm

205
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.850
What kind of confession is this?

206
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.880
Confession?

207
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.950
30 years ago

208
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.290
someone did it
About a perfect crime

209
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.990
A person who exposes every detail
Because he’s the main character.

210
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.660
For the rest of my life, I will be alone in knowing

211
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.130
[Sighing] Was it a waste?

212
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.130
(Host) [Laughing] Wow

213
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.300
But 30 years ago

214
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.570
I'm guessing it's almost the same time as this.

215
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.510
"wicket"

216
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.840
This time, I really want to talk about myself.

217
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.850
Just a joke, it's all fake

218
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.620
You really wrote it all here

219
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.990
(Host) [Laughing] Oh, of course.

220
00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.660
Oh, teacher too

221
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.230
(Yoonyoung) I like writer Go Mi-sook
I was an editor who had been in charge for a long time.

222
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.030
Go Mi-sook?

223
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.110
Thanks to you, it hasn't come out yet
Go Mi-sook's new novel

224
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.080
I could have it

225
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.450
(Yoonyoung) Since I came here
I completely forgot

226
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:24.520
After seeing that teacher earlier
I keep feeling a strange sense of déjà vu

227
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.520
When I opened it again

228
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.990
Was it the same as in the novel?

229
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.430
I don't think it would have been written about something that actually happened.
I couldn't even imagine

230
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.930
(Yoonyoung) Anyway
It was written like that.

231
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.530
Starting with that teacher

232
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.100
three women died

233
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.370
The real culprit is
I was never caught.

234
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.370
[Meaningful music]

235
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.880
Are you talking about the real culprit?

236
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.780
Second page last paragraph
Check the last sentence

237
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.080
[Sound of paper turning]

238
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.880
(Haejun) ‘The truth is
'It was never revealed'

239
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.010
‘The one who created all these deaths’

240
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.410
(Middle-aged immature) It was me

241
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.450
Even that pleasant truth

242
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.320
[Sound of drawer closing]

243
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.740
[Exhales deeply]

244
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.820
Because you are not in this house

245
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.050
It's really good

246
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.260
[laughter]
[Soaring music]

247
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.660
[laugh]

248
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.480
[Sound of paper turning]

249
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.680
Did Go Mi-sook really do that?

250
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.090
In fact, the culprit is
It's not captured properly, is it?

251
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.430
I was caught

252
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.560
Although I denied it until the end,
Well, the truth is unknown

253
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.630
(Yoonyoung) Yes

254
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.570
That's why I said that

255
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.840
The first novel
You stole my mom's story.

256
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.980
Because now it was really about himself.

257
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.180
Then this
Could this be new evidence?

258
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.750
I can't be certain

259
00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.620
Anyway, this is a novel

260
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.790
(Haejun) The actual incident
Even if it was based on

261
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.290
You can add as much imagination as you like.

262
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.730
‘I’ here

263
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.900
This is the real Go Mi-sook
There is no guarantee that it will be pointed out.

264
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.900
There is no guarantee that it is fake.

265
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.300
(Yoonyoung) You saw it earlier.

266
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.040
The teacher who disappeared
It even says where it was

267
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.280
Someone who knows more than you

268
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.510
Isn't that the culprit?

269
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.810
Because we are from the same village

270
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.680
(Haejun) At that time, people around me
I may have written what I saw and heard.

271
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.750
And no matter how much I researched

272
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.260
That's mostly
Because it's just an official record

273
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.660
Are you just saying no?
Are you just saying no?

274
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.790
why so
Are you trying to push me away?

275
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.770
Do you hope Go Mi-sook is the culprit?

276
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.180
They said we already knew each other
Why so...

277
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.840
The Go Mi-sook I know

278
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.510
The Go Mi-sook I know

279
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.550
Because I'm a person who can do that.

280
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.890
(Soonae) What did you just say?

281
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.860
Are you saying you want to get married, with me now?

282
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.400
[Coughing]

283
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.730
(Hee-seop) Yes?

284
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.530
Ah, when did...
[Sound of running footsteps]

285
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.900
ah! What...

286
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.700
[humorous music]
Oh, is it you again?

287
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.240
what? marriage?

288
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.870
We haven't even dated so what...

289
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.270
(Yoonyoung) In my head
A student whose blood has not even dried

290
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.840
So like that
I had an accident early!

291
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.150
At what point did you call me?
Let's meet alone, tonight!

292
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.650
(Haejun) Yoon Young-ah
Hey, why is he like this? Why is this happening?

293
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.350
(Hee-seop) Baby, get out
What kind of accident are you talking about?

294
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.650
This stone head, truly!

295
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.020
I never said that!

296
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.920
gave birth to one son and one daughter

297
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.960
gave birth to one son and one daughter
Let's live well

298
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.260
[Yoonyoung’s angry voice]

299
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.330
(Hee-seop) No, Sun-ae.

300
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.200
Are you a little deaf?

301
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.830
When did you decide to live together?
They said I just wanted to live

302
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.870
When you ask me what my dream is, I just lose

303
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.670
I wish I had a family, me too!

304
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.850
I'm sorry
I'm already dating a guy

305
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.350
So Hee-seop’s heart
I can't receive it

306
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.080
- (Yoonyoung) What is there?
- (Heeseop) What do you have?

307
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.450
(Soonae) Still, later
Let's meet in front...

308
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.050
uh? There it is

309
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.230
[Interesting music]

310
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.600
Truly, that bastard, that...

311
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.000
Are you Sunae’s lover?

312
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.910
(Yoonyoung) They said it was my first love

313
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.450
It's true

314
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.820
It's true
That's what I came out to talk about.

315
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.260
(Soon-ae) Then, that’s enough.

316
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.670
And I hate those flowers

317
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.000
good bye

(Yoonyoung) Sunae! seed

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.450
Sunae!

321
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.590
[Haejun sighs]

322
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.660
What is the picture I just saw?
I think I should explain it first, right?

323
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.660
I tried to explain slowly

324
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.170
no way

325
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.070
Are you family?

326
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.910
In ‘One Son, One Daughter’

327
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.410
I think it was me who took the daughter's part.

328
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.280
[heavy music]
(Haejun) You

329
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.320
She's the daughter of suspect Baek Hee-seop?

(Jooyoung) I’m so scared

336
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.780
[Sighing] How do I report it?

337
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.710
[sigh]

338
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.850
You can't have anything to do with the police.

340
00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.160

342
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.900
Who the hell knows me?

343
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.840
Uh, okay

[Sound of the receiver being put on the phone]

345
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.370
I really did too

346
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.210
I really did too

347
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.740
No, over 30 years due to a car accident.
It was just a time traveler who hit me.

348
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.940
It was just a time traveler who hit me.

349
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.750
In front of that person's house
My mother's family lives in a row.

350

and

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.920
Why on earth did you go to school?

352
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.050
(Haejun) No

353
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.390
Earlier, in the coffee shop
Why on earth is that like that?

354
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.360
Ah, that's a bit complicated.

355
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.500
The cafe is for mom and dad
Trying to tear it apart...

356
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.410
What are you tearing?

357
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.410
mom and dad
I was just trying not to meet you

358
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.350
[Sighing] Now that I'm here...

359
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.410
No, are you stupid?

360
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.180
What?

361
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.150
What?

362
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.620
Okay, well, let’s just say it’s all a coincidence.

363
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.920
(Haejun) Without thinking
I was hit by a car and woke up

364
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.660
young parents
Let's say it was right in front of you.

365
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.530
But in between
Do you think I will tear it apart?

366
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.930
What results will that have?
Haven't you thought about it?

367
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.470
You may lose yourself...

368
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.000
(Yoonyoung) What’s wrong with that?

369
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.110
What?

370
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.780
What's wrong with that?

371
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.010
[absurd gasping sound]

372
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.150
Do you think I didn't know that?

373
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.490
One small action can determine someone else's future
It could change everything

374
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.860
You said that to me the first day I came here.

375
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.400
(Yoonyoung) But what’s wrong with that?

376
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.470
before coming here

377
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.140
by the river
I asked you what you were doing?

378
00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.440
[siren sound]
[Sad music]

379
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.110
(Yoonyoung) That day at that river

380
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.380
Mom left us

381
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.120
[Yoonyoung sobs]
I had no right to complain

382
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.450
Maybe I abandoned my mother first

383
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.760
Because I don't know if it was us

384
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.530
like a fool
I only give love that I can't get back

385
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.160
[cell phone vibrating sound]

386
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.030
like a fool
It became a name that could be erased

387
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.040
[laughter]
One day suddenly

388
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.110
Maybe mom realized

389
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.780
An irreversible moment
There are too many

390
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.050
It's already too late
[sigh]

391
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.320
(Yoonyoung) That day at that river
I thought earnestly

392
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.160
'Just one time for me
'If the opportunity comes'

393
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.430
'Even just for a moment
'I wish I could turn it back'

394
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.100
Yeah, I might look stupid.

395
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.880
But really
I don't care what happens

396
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.810
Until my mother went to the river

397
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.880
That I didn't do anything
When I think about it, I

398
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.690
Because I don’t think I could bear it any longer anyway.

399
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.040
I'm sorry, I even said this
I didn't mean to do it...

400
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.270
(Haejun) Come in.

401
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.510
Take some rest today
Because I think it would be good

402
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.650
yes

403
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.400
[Sound of door opening]

404
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.870
[Sound of door closing]

405
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.030
[Calm music]

406
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.610
[frustrated breathing]

407
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.020
I should have asked this

408
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.120
[heavy music]
[sigh]

409
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.330
[sigh]

410
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.940
No way, no way

411
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.540
[siren sound]
(Yoonyoung) That day at that river

412
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.740
Mom left us

413
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.250
[sigh]

414
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.890
(Haejun) You picked it up, right?

415
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.160
by chance?

416
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.930
When and where?

417
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.230
Floating on the river in this town
I saw it by chance

418
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.070
I just took it carelessly.

419
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.170
So why was it there?

420
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.810
[sigh]

421
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.980
[intense music]

422
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.200
[Birdsong]

423
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.140
Where did it come from?

424
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.650
There's something you need to know

425
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.590
(Yoonyoung) Because of what I said yesterday
If that's the case

426
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.760
don't worry

427
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.660
That's just my personal thing

428
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.870
So that no harm is done to your work...

429
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.070
To me, mom is

430
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.040
It's not an affectionate name.

431
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.810
(Haejun) gave birth to me
Without hugging you even once

432
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.010
The person who ran away
Because she's my mom

433
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.650
Something like a mother's heart
So I don't know

434
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.090
As others say, what is there?
Is there anything special and heartbreaking?

435
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.920
Without even knowing

436
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.830
I never wanted to know

437
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.660
But whoever it is

438
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.170
The person who receives love feels the same way
I know you can't not know

439
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.540
No matter what happens to yourself
So much so that you don't think it matters

440
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.010
The heart that thinks of mom

441
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.480
your mother
Do you think you didn't know?

442
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.720
What is that...

443
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.350
Did you make that choice?
Did you make that choice?

444
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.620
What are you saying now...

445
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.890
(Haejun) Listen carefully.

446
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.860
It will happen tomorrow night
In the first murder case

447
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.460
The stuff you know will come out

448
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.400
[nervous music]
[siren sound]

449
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.370
(Haejun) Matchbox

450
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.750
And the note inside it

451
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.560
This is...

452
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.560
At the time, the police

453
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.500
The criminal intentionally placed
I thought it was a sign.

454
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.300
(Haejun) The second victim
Even in your belongings

455
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.100
Because the same thing came out

456
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.440
A mark?

457
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.440
(Yoonyoung) Then why is this...

458
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.950
Why was the object used in the crime 34 years ago

459
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.720
Will it be discovered again in 2021?

460
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.550
That too, of course

461
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.760
why your mother
By the river where he died

462
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.660
no way...

463
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.200
Nothing is certain

464
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:58.140
Yeah, what, your mind? sincerity?

465
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.210
That's what your mother said
Maybe you didn't know

466
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.110
(Haejun) But what if

467
00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.980
[Soaring music]

468
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.120
[Soaring music]

469
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.850
[Middle-aged Soon-ae's scared voice]

470
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.290
(Haejun) That day by the river
your mother

471
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.820
If I had met someone else
[Screaming scared]

472
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:23.200
That wasn't caught 34 years ago
If it was the real culprit

473
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.070
then now you
You're doing it wrong

474
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.100
(Haejun) Carelessly
hating myself

475
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.870
You tried to give up again

476
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.040
The person who has to save mom until the end

477
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.350
Isn't it you?

478
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.780
[Music getting heavier]

479
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.370
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

480
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880
(Soonae) Yoon Young-ah

481
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.590
Were you very surprised yesterday?

482
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.360
sorry

483
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.690
I lied to you on purpose

484
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.790
Baek Hee-seop, that person
I never meant to meet you

485
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:33.670
(Yoonyoung) Yes

486
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.640
Why did I miss this?

487
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.510
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) Curly grandmother
until it happens

488
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.840
I want to play with Yoonyoung forever
[Calm music]

489
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.610
my beloved mother

490
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.380
(Yoonyoung) It wasn’t a will, it was a letter.

491
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.590
I will stay by your side forever
Mom like always

492
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.490
It was something I promised
[sniffling]

493
00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.030
how do you do that
Could it have been a misunderstanding?

494
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.530
how do you do that

495
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.270
until the end
How could I not have known?

496
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.570
(Soonae) Yoon Young-ah

497
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.340
Are you that disappointed?

498
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.380
Sorry

499
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.350
[Crying] Every day
Why are you so sorry?

500
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.880
I'm the one who didn't know

501
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.920
(Soonae) No, no.
I really didn't know either

502
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.320
It was written on a piece of paper in a matchbox.

503
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.860
[Yoonyoung sniffles]

504
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.300
[Yoonyoung sniffles]

505
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.400
don't worry

506
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.300
never again

507
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.540
Never do such a terrible thing again
I'll protect you so you don't have to go through this

508
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.410
(Yoonyoung) No matter what happens
(Soonae) Thank you

509
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.920
(Soonae) Thank you

510
00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.090
Even if I drink some juice

511
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.620
Even if I drink some juice
Doesn't it work?

512
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.090
I'm not even going to marry Beomryong.

513
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.270
(Misuk) Jiyoonah

514
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.210
What are they doing?

515
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.310
I don't know

516
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.110
I heard my grades came out
Didn’t Soon-ae’s grades fall?

517
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.920
- (Teacher 1) Thank you

518
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.120
- (Teacher 1) Thank you
- (Byung-gu) Oh, thank you for your hard work.

519
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.390
- Hey, Mr. Choi.
- (Teacher 2) Yes

520
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.390
(Byung-gu) Oh
You too, have one of these.

521
00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.030
- (Teacher 2) I will eat well.
- (Byung-gu) Oh

522
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.900
(Teacher Park) Yes, yes, yes

523
00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.100
- (Byung-gu) This is
- (Mr. Park) Yes

524
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.800
(Byung-gu) My son
It was sent to me from America.

525
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.100
(Teacher Park) Oh, in America?

526
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.770
(Byung-gu) How are you?
Isn’t it a little different in color?

527
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.310
(Teacher Park) Hey, this is...

528
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.340
Hey! Is this because it came from the US?
There's something different

529
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.510
- (Byung-gu) You can touch it.
- (Teacher Park) Thank you, fish oil.

530
00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.510
(Haejun) Then now you
You're doing it wrong

531
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.910
[Calm music]

532
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.380
I hate myself carelessly
You tried to give up again

533
00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.720
[sigh]

534
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.630
Speak kindly
Speak kindly

535
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.560
Ayu, ayu, ayu, ayu

536
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.170
- (Teacher Park) Oh, that’s right.
- (Byung-gu) It’s a big country after all.

537
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.900
(Mr. Park) After all, it is a big country.
The flowers are also very big

538
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.770
Well, the leaves are big too
Very nice, yes

539
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.240

[Sound of conversation between Byung-gu and Mr. Park]

541
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.920
(Byung-gu) Uh, Teacher Lee Joo-young, come here.

542
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.750
It flew for a whopping 14 hours
It flew for a whopping 14 hours

543
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.590
I'll give you a precious jelly.

545
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.260
(Haejun) What happened last night
While you're gone, please bring me some too.

546
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.140
While you're gone, please bring me some too.

548
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.570
Jelly from America

549
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.480

[Jooyoung’s light smile]
(Byung-gu) [Laughing] Is it better?

553
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.520
- (Mr. Park) It’s definitely American.
- (Byunggu) Welcome, now, now, now.

554
00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:16.960
Try one of these, uh

[lively music]
(Yoonyoung) 1st place?

(Yoonyoung) Oh my god

563
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.810
Did you study so well?

Oh my, you’re amazing!

565
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.880
No, how do you get first place?

566
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.690
Wow, 1st place

567
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.120
1st place in the entire school, 1st place in the entire school!
[Soon-ae and Yun-young’s laughter]

568
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.760
1st place in the whole school!

569
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.330
(Pure Love) 1st place
[Yoonyoung’s elasticity]

570
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:57.600

[Yoonyoung’s happy voice]

573
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.690
(Yunyoung) Oh, you’re amazing

574
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.890
[laughter]

575
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.800
(Coast Guard) Wow, what is it?

576
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.570
People who can't study
Are you going to live this sad life?

577
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.640
Hey, come out

578
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.250
[nervous music]

579
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.090
You pretended like you didn't pass the test

580
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.190
That's what Lee Soon-ae does all the time, right?

581
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.360
Is it that good?

582
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.930
Very close
Can you put it on the big door?

583
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.330
- (Yoonyoung) Is that crazy?
- (Soonae) Yoon Young-ah

584
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.240
(Teacher Park) Hey, you crazy Kim Hae-kyung!

(Teacher Park) Kim Hae-kyung!

587
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.780
Can’t you get in quickly?

588
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.650
[Students grumbling]

589
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:27.990
(Soonae) Let’s go

590
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.730
(Teacher Park) [Blubbering] That’s it.
Don't you bring it?

591
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.200
[Heeseop sighs]

592
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.000
This school is amazing

593
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.810
I'm only putting it in last place.

594
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.810
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

595
00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.980
[Heeseop’s faint sigh]

596
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.150
[humorous music]

597
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.350
No, why are you like that...

598
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.890
What kind of charm does it have...

599
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.860
(Beomryong) Ah!

600
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.300
This formula
It was applied like this

601
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.700
[humorous music]
Hmm, isn't it so much fun?

602
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.470
Please come to your senses.

603
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.380
Please come to your senses.

604
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.150
Ah, this stupid guy really! seed

605
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.350
Ah, this stupid guy really! seed

606
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.620
[Heeseop sighs]

607
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.420
(Beomryong) What’s wrong?

608
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.120
[Heeseop’s heavy breathing]

609
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.390
(Hee-seop) Oh my, Mr.

610
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.000
Oh no

611
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.930
Done

612
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.570
I can't even lose my friendship

613
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.670
no way

614
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.640
(Beomryong) Didn’t things go well yesterday?

615
00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.780
Didn't the flowers I gave you work?

616
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.710
[Humorous sound effects]

617
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.680
(Beomryong) What is that?

618
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.350
(Beomryong) What is that?

619
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.780
[Heeseop sighs]

620
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.120
Why are you going through so much trouble?
Did you pick it yourself?

621
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.760
Life is much prettier

622
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.660
Oh, really

623
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.860
Take this

624
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.270
Women are like that
I don't like it because it's shabby.

625
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.570
Oh, is that it?

626
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.940
(Beomryong) But

627
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.010
Who are you going to confess to?
Are you really not going to tell me?

628
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.850
[laugh]

629
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.920
Hey, that's out, that's out

630
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.480
I'll tell you when it goes well, just, Mr.

631
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.720
[Beomryong’s excited sound]

632
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.290
(Beomryong) Okay, fighting

633
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.490
(Heeseop) Thank you

634
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.630
(Beomryong) Hee-seop, fighting!

635
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.800
It sounds like a flower

636
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.270
Do you like your girlfriend?

637
00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.270
Do you like your girlfriend?

638
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.840
of course

639
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.210
(Beomryong) Fish oil! I always say I hate it

640
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.180
That's all good

641
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.750
coy, cowardly

642
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.750
If you don't like it, you don't like it.
[Heeseop’s strange breathing]

643
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.490
[Heeseop’s strange breathing]

644
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.460
(Hee-seop) Hey, you
I'll give you just one flower

645
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.520
Give me one
What about the other one?

646
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.090
Oh, that?

647
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.330
Ah, well, again
[Sound of door slowly opening]

648
00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.130
I wrote it because it was good

649
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.240
[Sound of running footsteps]
(Male Student 1) Huh? hello

650
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.500
[secret music]

651
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.810
[secret music]

652
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.250
[Coast Guard sigh]

653
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.130
[rustling sound]

654
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.360
Are you saying it's not?
Are you saying it's not?

655
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.460
If the culprit here is really

656
00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.600
He committed another crime 34 years later.

657
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.000
That's my mom
If you made me die

658
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.540
The culprit is even more
I think it could be Go Mi-sook, I

659
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.540
That could be enough, right?

660
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.810
(Haejun) But

661
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.680
Last night, I spied on a teacher and ran away.
Then who is that man?

662
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.720
[Meaningful music]

663
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.420
I think that's me
I think he's the guy I've been waiting for

664
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.390
For so long I

665
00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:58.520
There is an answer in Jooyoung Lee’s movements.
I waited while thinking

666
00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.890
Lee Joo-young was murdered
The movements of that night

667
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.600
“Let’s move toward autonomy, creativity, and intelligence.”
[Students chattering]

668
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.930
(Haejun) That night

669
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.400
Lee Joo-young finished work
I left school at 10pm

670
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.610
The place I headed straight to

671
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.980
Bongbong Cafe we ​​went to yesterday
It was there

672
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.490
[Sound of door opening and closing]
[Door bell sounds]

673
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.690
(Cheongah) Welcome

674
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.630
(Haejun) After staying in there for 20 minutes

675
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.300
At 10:30, Jooyoung Lee came out.

676
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.740
The next destination is of course
It was Friendship Inn.

677
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.110
[Meaningful sound effects]

678
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.420
[Soaring music]
But that day

679
00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.090
Lee Joo-young
I didn't make it to the inn.

680
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.240
From a coffee shop to an inn
Even at a slow pace, it only takes 3 minutes

681
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.610
within that short distance
It's gone

682
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.140
Until the body was found the next day.

683
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.980
within that short distance
There were no witnesses?

684
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.320
Who did you meet in there?
no one saw that

685
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.290
So I did that
I plan to see it in person tomorrow.

686
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.290
(Haejun) Same time, same place

687
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.690
On the same route

688
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.030
Because I will be behind Jooyoung Lee

689
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.600
Then the man in the blue hat
Maybe we can meet again

690
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.440
Blue hat?

691
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.740
The 20 minutes Lee Joo-young stayed in the coffee shop

692
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.940
The only person I met there

693
00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.950
[Jooyoung’s speaking voice]

694
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.090
They were arguing?

695
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.130
Even though he was a very suspicious person,

696
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.130
Who were the police at the time?
I couldn't figure it out until the end.

697
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.600
But the guy I chased last night

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:18.760
(Kyungae) Something like this...

869
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.110
(Haejun) It’s all because of me

870
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.940
Because my judgment was wrong
Due to variables...

871
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.150
(Yoonyoung) I guess

872
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.820
Sending it to a coffee shop tonight
I think it's dangerous

873
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.650
(Haejun) Yes, for now
Take it somewhere safe...

874
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.250
(Jooyoung) I...

875
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:49.360
(Jooyoung) I...

876
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.500
I thought I was alone

877
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.570
sorry

878
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.410
sorry

879
00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:03.810
I'm sorry

880
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.540
[Jooyoung continues to sob]

881
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.590
[heavy music]

882
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:21.130
(Yoonyoung) Even if I really go alone
Are you okay?

883
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.460
(Haejun) Just the face
I'm coming to see you, okay?

884
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.830
[Door bell sounds]

885
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.240
[Sound of door closing]

886
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.590
If you're lucky

887
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.730
Even without Jooyoung Lee

888
00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:58.430
same time, same place
He might show up

889
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:09.070
[tired breathing]

890
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:12.640
[sigh]

891
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.260
[sigh]

892
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:31.460
(Yoonyoung) If you’re lucky,

893
00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:33.600
that face

894
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.700
Please check it out

895
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.100
That person is

896
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:41.940
34 years later my mother
Because I will become a murderer

897
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:57.260
[Moon So-ri]
[Door bell sounds]

898
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.660

899
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.000
[nervous music]

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.940
[Soaring music]

902
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.850
[surprised gasp]

903
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.290
Ha, Mr.

904
01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:07.020
I'm going crazy

905
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.630
[Rhythmic music]

906
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.530
(Haejun) One of the actual suspects
hidden blue hat

907
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.900
Everything matches, even the movement line.
The person closest to the culprit

908
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.130
Baek Hee-seop

909
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.500
If the blue hat is the real culprit

910
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.010
that person's mother
He even killed his own wife.

911
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.240
Blue hat, you...

912
01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.780
(Yoonyoung) I know
I saw it myself

913
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.350
I never thought about it
I never thought about it

914
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.080
Just one of the suspects.

915
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:06.020
blue hat
You're my father, now?

916
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.920
What?

917
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.390
[dark music]
This doesn't make sense

918
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.890
How do I...

919
01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.900
[shaking breathing]

920
01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:19.900
how

921
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.070
After doing something like that...

922
01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.870
[Middle-aged Soon-ae's frightened breathing]

923
01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.000
(Middle-aged Soon-ae) Don’t come closer.

924
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.810
[Frightened breathing]

925
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.540
Don't come any closer!

926
01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.710
[scream]
