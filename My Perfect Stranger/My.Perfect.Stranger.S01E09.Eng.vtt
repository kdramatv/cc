It would have been impossible

I did it all

16
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.390
(Yoonyoung) This answer
Should I have told you?

17
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.990
Everything finally becomes clear

to me you are
Incomprehensible from beginning to end

I heard it

25
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.120
Ask a question and get an answer that doesn't fit at all

26
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.490

Why did you hide this here?

30
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.500
But when asked why
The answer I came up with was ‘mine’.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.750
Without a single excuse
Would you confess like that?

(Yoonyoung) Who is it already?
You guessed it, right?

178
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.420
(Haejun) If the confession was wrong

179
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.090
The reason Baek Hee-seop deserves it is
Because there is only one

180
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.420
(Yoonyoung) As expected, my father
What I wanted to protect

181
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.890
It wasn't my mom

182
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.390
[Rough fighting sounds]

183
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.760
(Yuseop) Are you hurt?

184
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.030
(Yoonyoung) That night, Lee Kyung-ae
The last person I went to see

185
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.030
Blue hat, Baek Yu-seop

186
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.440
I felt terrible my whole life
That damn brother again

187
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.370
I was trying to cover it up, my father

188
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.080
It was Hee-seop earlier.
Is it Yusup this time?

189
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.380
(Dongsik’s wife) Last time
For saving our dragon

190
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.120
Thank you so much
I think so, teacher.

191
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.150
What the hell is at my house
Why are you doing that?

192
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.960
(Yoonyoung) Doing more difficult work
There is also a house that is going through hardships.

193
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.220
Don't you know, in this town now?

194
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.430
(Dongsik’s wife) Solving that problem
It's up to our kids' father.

195
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.130
Personally, I really want to ask you
That's because

196
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.330
(Haejun) Anyway
You should have contacted me.

197
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.870
To deliver news about Baek Hee-seop

198
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.370
It has to be

199
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.510
Haven't you even come to the boarding house?
They say it’s already been 3 days

200
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.850
It happens often.

201
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.720
(Dongsik’s office) in Seoul
Even though I went to that good university

202
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.190
I said I would come pick up my brother later.
It's an anime that goes to the factory every now and then.

203
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.660
[Meaningful music]
(Yoonyoung) Uncle?

204
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.930
(Dongsik’s wife) My younger brother
How terrible I think

205
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.000
In the meantime
[sigh]

206
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.700
Come down every weekend

207
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.070
among themselves
I said I was going to see your face.

208
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.740
Well, I stayed at the boarding house properly.
Do you even have time to sleep?

209
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.410
Oh my, oh my, it hurts, really

210
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.110
(Haejun) The location of the boarding house is
What happens?

211
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.950
I said it was near the school

212
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.620
I said somewhere in Sillim-dong.

213
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.950
Sillim-dong?

214
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.060
(Yoonyoung) He was a student at Seoul National University.
Uncle?

215
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.260
Seoul National University, Department of Korean Literature, 3rd year

216
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.730
(Byunggu) From now on, with you all
We will be together for a month

217
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.870
This is student Lee Joo-young.

218
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.870
Seoul National University Department of Korean Literature
I'm a 4th grade student

219
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.670
Same school, same department

220
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.940
[sigh]

221
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.080
Even with the first victim
I mean there was a point of contact.

222
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.720
(Yoonyoung) Everyone
Because you hid it like that

223
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.420
How could you have doubted

224
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.860
My father said he would protect his brother.
Instead, they even got caught.

225
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.660
My maternal grandfather
I pretend not to know because the rumors in the neighborhood are scary

226
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.300
Thanks to Baek Yoo-seop
I was able to hide away.

227
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.400
But it's still like that

228
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.570
How is it not even mentioned?

229
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.240
It happened once, very briefly.

230
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.080
As if passing by once

231
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.380
(Detective 2) Listen straight, you bastard!
[crash sound]

232
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.550
[clacking sound]
(Detective 1) Hey, come to your senses.

233
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.320
Look here, huh?

234
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.120
Look at me!
[sigh]

235
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.530
[The sound continues]

236
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.290
Ic, that's gross, really, ah

237
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.230
(Detective 2) Talk to me, really!

238
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.030
(Detective 3) Captain

239
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.900
Police officer Kim near an abandoned house
I heard you picked something like this up

240
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.640
- (Class leader) Near an abandoned house?
- (Detective 3) Yes

241
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.170
Should I upload this as evidence?

242
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.340
(Class President) What is this again?

243
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.940
(Detective 3) Write, ya
This looks like a necklace, right?

244
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.080
(Class President) Hey, try it.

245
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.310
(Detective 3) What is this?
Just put it around your neck...

246
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.480
[Dongsik’s urgent breathing]
[nervous music]

247
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.420
(Class President) Hey!

248
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.490
(Detective 2) Ah, earlier
He said he confessed...

249
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.090
[Heeseop chuckles]

250
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.700
(Dongsik) Hee-seop, Hee-seop

251
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.330
Are you okay? uh? Hee-seop

252
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.180
[Sound of clicking open]
(Detective 1) What is it?

253
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.380
(Class President) Hey, Baek Dong-sik!

254
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.080
What are you doing, this!

255
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.650
(Dongsik) Hee-seop
Hee-seop, come to your senses, okay?

256
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.380
This, this

257
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.990
Your brother, huh?

258
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.520
It’s Yusuf, right? huh?

259
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.620
Get it straight, man!

260
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.490
This is mine

261
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.230
(Detective 2) Hey
This idiot, this, this

262
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.070
The mouth that won't open even if you get hit
It's finally opened, this

263
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:38.970
[Detective 2 laughs]

264
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.540
I lent it to you for a short time.
It's been a while since I got it back

265
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.340
(Heeseop) This
It was all mine from the start

266
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.010
(Yoonyoung) No, it’s my father’s

267
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.910
I'm sure

268
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.410
From childhood

269
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.850
My uncle said it was his
Because I couldn't even touch it

270
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.420
Baek Hee-seop will insist that it’s his.

271
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.090
(Haejun) It will work in reality

272
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.760
If it's the way it is, no matter what you do anyway
Although I am set to be released

273
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.560
This time because of a confession
I don't know how things will turn out

274
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.370
We need to find Baek Yu-seop as quickly as possible.

275
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.700
Is it really all you have to do is find it?

276
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.710
Anyway, that necklace

277
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.840
Proving the circumstances of the murder
I told you it would be difficult

278
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.340
Because the time and place of separation are ambiguous

279
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.950
So in advance
I'll find one

280
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.520
[Meaningful music]

281
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.050
lost evidence

282
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.190
[sigh]

283
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.630
(Haejun) That shirt from earlier

284
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.930
That's much more important evidence than you think
It could have been

285
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.870
- (Detective 3) Police Officer Kim
- (Officer Kim) Oh my, Detective Lee.

286
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.340
- (Detective 3) Hey
- (Police officer Kim) Loyalty

287
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.340
- (Detective 3) Is Jesu okay?
- (Police officer Kim) Oh, of course.

288
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.780
(Haejun) There is still no such thing as scientific investigation
In a very unfamiliar era

289
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.480
One small mistake

290
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.420
[Sound of car door closing]
[Car starting sound]

291
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.760
[tire rubbing sound]

(Haejun) Everything in an instant
Even if I didn't ruin it

Mistress

294
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.030
(Haejun) Contaminated evidence
[Police officer Kim sighs]

295
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.040
So no results
What I didn't get wasn't enough

296
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.740
After the investigation is concluded
I even lost it forever.

297
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.780
To the possibilities of the distant future
It was completely destroyed.

298
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.390
It will be different this time

299
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.090
If only the evidence survives, Baek Yu-seop

300
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.190
Now nowhere
You won't be able to hide.

301
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.830
[Police officer Kim is humming]

302
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.380
(Haejun) Oh, I
It's dangerous to drive with something like this.

303
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.140
(Police officer Kim) Oh, what is it?

304
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.810
(Haejun) Is that it?

305
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.920
Detective Lee forgot.

306
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.520
Because it's important
Please put it in well and take it with you.

307
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.920
yes

[Interesting music]

309

[Car starting sound]

312
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.680
(Haejun) Until the results come out
I'll come find Baek Yu-seop

313
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:48.320
Schools, factories, boarding houses
I'll search every possible place.

314
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.990
Sillim-dong, Seoul

This isn't it

What other people say
What's important?

Talk about yourself with your own mouth
I'm saying I'll never bring it up.

324
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.390
I hate myself so much too

325
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.530
I never thought my sister would become like this
Without knowing it completely

326
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.330
If I had stopped you from going then

327
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.710
Sister, it wouldn't have happened like that.

328
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.710
I should have caught you then

329
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.120
I feel like it's all my fault

330
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.660
I'm really so terrible

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.530
I hate you so much

we are sisters

No matter what happens to other people
Leave it as is

If you're being caught, you need to make it clear.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.310
I have to go quickly

348
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.010
(Yoonyoung) Stop it

349
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.550
Now is not the time for you to step out

350
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.480
What does it mean?

351
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.190
Adults will take care of everything

352
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.560
(Yoonyoung) So
If you just wait...

353
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.860
What adults?

354
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.660
(Soonae) Even though I don’t really know

355
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.660
Recklessly, my nephew
Put them in handcuffs and drag them away

356
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.130
Made the rumor spread around the neighborhood
An adult like that?

357
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.670
For you, Mr. Yoon
To me, mom and dad

358
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.980
I will protect you and protect you unconditionally.
If there were adults, I wouldn't be like this either.

359
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.510
[Crying] But for Hee-seop
There's no one

360
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.450
I have to go

361
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.820
(Yoonyoung) If you don’t know, just stay still.

362
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.660
Are all police idiots?

363
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.760
Baek Hee-seop became like that
It's all your fault!

364
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.700
(Soonae) What do you know!

365
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.170
I have to go

366
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.170
Let go!

367
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.170
Let go, please

368
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.980
I have to go

369
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.260
[Sobbing]

370
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.390
I have to go

371
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.170
I promised

372
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.110
I promised...

373
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.810
[Grass bug crying]

374
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.800
[Heeseop laughs]

375
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.970
(Hee-seop) Really put soybean paste on it?

376
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.340
You agreed to do that.

377
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.850
Quickly show me your face

378
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.380
(Hee-seop) Oh, by the way
Do you think it's going to get a bit funny?

379
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.990
It smells like shit

380
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.090
(Soonae) Huh?

381
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.860
Quick!

382
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.820
(Heeseop) Ah...
[lively music]

383
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.230
You can't open your eyes
[Heeseop’s embarrassed voice]

384
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.130
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.

385
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.840
[Heeseop’s nervous breathing]

386
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.790
[Hee-seop's sound of pain]

387

[Sniffles]

388
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.540
[Soon-ae smiles]

389
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.240
(Pure love) Who in this era
Do you put soybean paste on it? You idiot

390
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.770
(Hee-seop) [Laughing awkwardly] Ah, that...

391
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.440
[Heeseop clears his cough]

392
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.450
words

393
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.920
It's short?

394
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.220
no?

395
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.860
ok

396
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.560
(Heeseop) [Hesitating] But

397
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.070
Because I like it

398
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.170
It's scary

399
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.940
I guess you said to me

400
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.710
I think it will become too precious

401
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.250
Why is that?

402
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.550
[Calm music]

403
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.220
I could easily lose it

404
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.930
Our tusks, our father, and our great son

405
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.400
I love you and love you

406
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.170
Everyone leave

407
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.810
[Heeseop laughs]

408
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.780
[Sigh of pure love]

409
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.660
(Soonae) Um...

410
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.560
I sometimes

411
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.830
When I feel lonely and scared

412
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.430
Imagine a small door

413
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.370
Small door?

414
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.110
(Soonae) Yes

415
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.580
There's a little door in my heart

416
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.720
Behind that door

417
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.290
always me
There is someone waiting for me

418
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.560
You're scared too
When I feel lonely

419
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.270
Close your eyes and imagine that door

420
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.270
Then always
I'll wait behind that door

421
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.780
All you have to do is open it

422
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.320
Really?

423
00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.020
(Soonae) Yes

424
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.600
[Heeseop’s surprised voice]

425
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.870
(Heeseop) Huh?

426
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.310
[Dog barking in the distance]

427
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.850
[Heeseop chuckles]

428
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.220
[heavy music]

429
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.190
(Yoonyoung) Come to your senses, Lee Soon-ae

430
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.730
as much as you think
Baek Hee-seop is also thinking of you.

431
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.400
It's all your imagination

432
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.370
What do you know that makes you say that?

433
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:34.840
[Sound of running footsteps]

434
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.740
(Hyungman) Sunae!

435
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.650
I'm disappointed in you

436
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:42.850
I'm disappointed, to my heart's content.

437
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.420
Let's end it now
Because it will be much better for you

438
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.620
[snapping sound]

439
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.600

(Yuri) Really with my own two eyes
I saw it clearly

442
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.940
My mom and dad watched it together too.
[Sounds of surprise from female students]

443
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.710
When we went on a picnic back then

444
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.820
He played the guitar amazingly
There's that cute boy

445
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.980
(Female students) Yes

446
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.350
He's wearing handcuffs like this
[Sounds of surprise from female students]

447
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.590
(Yuri) With delicate eyes
I was shaking so much

448
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.460
(Eunha) ‘He should have said’?

449
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.260
(Yuri) Her, her, her, her, her
[secret music]

450
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.430
(Eunha) Oh, my, what’s really going on?

451
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.330
(Female student) Do something like that
Doesn't it look like that?

452
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.730
(Yuri) So

453
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.900
[Female students chattering]

454
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.810
stupid bastard

455
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.510
You make things complicated

456

[The male students are noisy]

457
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.530
(Byung-gu) Well, your homeroom teacher
for personal reasons

458
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.560
I haven't been able to come out for a few days.

459
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.830
You all have been
Don't cause trouble

460
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.430
Everyone should focus on their studies...

461
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.940
Who is that yet?

462
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.610
(Male student 1) It’s the murderer’s seat.

463
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.370
[Boys giggle]

464

[Tapping sound]
(Byunggu) Hey, you immature bastards.

466
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.650
I'm still not sure about anything
To my classmate

467
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.450
Those are sounds like a big problem!

468
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.520
(Male student 2) My father said that

469
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.190
our village
They say there is no one who would do such a rough thing.

470
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.360
But Baek Hee-seop is a transfer student.

471
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.590
Came from far away

472
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.890
(Male student 3) Their uncle
You're a police officer.

473
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.730
But seeing as he was caught
Isn’t it obvious?

474
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.970
[Boys are murmuring]

Are there any adults here?

483
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.070
Wait a minute

Where have you been all day, today?

[Middle-aged Hee-seop's puzzled voice]

(Yoonyoung) My father

490
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.210
He chose his brother again this time.

491
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.480
no matter how sad mom is

492
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.110
No matter how twisted your life gets
Just like that again

493
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.880
To my uncle, we

494
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.290
I was just pushed out.

495
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.160
Like it's been like this all my life

[Haejun sighs]

497
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.640
Seoul is quite large.

498
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.190
Even if his younger brother is captured instead

499
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.550
I'm a person who pretends not to know and hides.

500
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.790
It's even weirder that it's easy to find

501
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.800
we were wrong

502
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.630
What Baek Hee-seop tried to cover up

503
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.300
It wasn't murder

504
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.340
[Meaningful music]

505
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.810
(Haejun) It was strange.

506
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.380
Even before we came
Even without a confession or anything like that.

507
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.180
Baek Hee-seop was equally a suspect.

508

the shirt, the lock

509
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.320
They say it's all theirs
I said it wasn't just murder.

510
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.420
A person determined to overwrite
Sin is denial?

511
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.330
That's it

512
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.700
Because I think the evidence will become ambiguous.
Trying to get out...

513

no

514
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.840
It wasn't really

515
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.940
(Haejun) To everyone I met there
I asked the same question

516
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.280
The last time I saw Baek Yu-seop was
When was it?

don't ask

(Man 3) That night

523

Being dragged to the front like that
Even though I saw it clearly with my own two eyes

524
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.730
I couldn't do anything

525
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.070
I couldn't even think of chasing after you.

526
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.470

I told half the story.

532
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:10.930
That night of the 16th
Everyone was watching Baek Yu-seop.

Then my father...

535
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.000
Unless it's Baek Yu-seop

536
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.240
my father
What happens now?

537
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.540
But that shirt
It will help you

538
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:27.610
What the police want
Because it won't be there

539
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.950

(Detective 4) To our chief
I called in advance

559

- (Class President) Well, ah, yes, yes

561
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.280
(Detective 5) Why is this happening?
Have you been doing unnecessary things?

562
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.380
It probably won't be his anyway.

563
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.820

564
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.250
