00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,602
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,804
-I'm alive!
-Wow.

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:05,872
I'm alive.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,041
Hey, Amotti.

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,609
This is for skincare.

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,078
It's for skincare.

7
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,480
Try it on your skin.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,249
There's horse poop in it.

9
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,984
Horse poop?

10
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,120
How do people even get here?

11
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,321
Can cars actually get here?

12
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,023
This place is amazing.
I can't believe I'm here.

13
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,492
-I'm on a Mongolian plain.
-Seriously.

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,194
It really is a Mongolian plain.

15
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,329
Let's check it out.

16
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,597
Wow, this is so cool.

17
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,635
They have all sorts of animals.

18
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,138
When you look at them this way,

19
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,572
they seem to belong to another era.

20
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,774
-I know.
-Seriously.

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,311
Their animals and clothing
are from back in the day.

22
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,882
Is that what they wear every day?

23
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:49,816
I think they do here.

24
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,418
It looks like traditional attire.

25
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,485
That horse is cool.

26
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,220
It's waving its front leg.

27
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,257
Hey!

28
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,592
Hey, our feet sink right in!

29
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,894
Look at our shoes.

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,462
No, please!

31
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,330
Hey, what the heck?

32
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,398
Hold on!

33
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,500
-My feet are wet now.
-Come on.

34
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,935
-I'm serious.
-Give me a break.

35
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,438
I'm in trouble.

36
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,840
Dong-hyun, mine only come up to here.

37
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,610
Wow, look at the dogs.

38
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,812
They're so cool.

39
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,285
Sain baina uu.

40
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,920
-Sain baina uu.
-Hello.

41
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,021
-Hello!
-Hello!

42
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,391
Is he the chief?

43
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,397
Welcome to Mongolia!

44
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,566
LKHAGVA-OCHIR
TEAM MONGOLIA

45
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,533
It's Ochir!

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,634
-But tomorrow--
-Look!

47
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,903
-But tomorrow--
-Look!

48
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,774
Let's go!

49
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,676
EDDIE WILLIAMS
TEAM AUSTRALIA

50
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,845
Eddie, what are you doing here?

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,855
I didn't recognize you.

52
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,592
I didn't recognize Eddie at all!

53
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,164
LET ME IN THE GROUP HUG

54
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,269
TOGETHER

55
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,606
He looks totally Mongolian.

56
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,677
Mongold tavtai moril.

57
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,984
I didn't expect to see them here.

58
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,453
Meeting up like this feels like

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,523
something from centuries ago,

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,660
given the surroundings and the horses.

61
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,401
Hold on!

62
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,802
I'm scared.

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,970
I'm riding already?

64
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,505
Amotti! Take your horse and go!

65
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,074
-Dong-hyun, you're riding?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,342
This feels really stable.

67
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,343
What are you riding?

68
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,978
-A camel?
-No, it's a yak.

69
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,879
Oh, a yak?

70
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,592
Wow, he looks cool.

71
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,492
Go!

72
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,596
Do I hold onto this?

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,697
What do I hold?

74
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,165
This right here?

75
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,474
-Change to a camel.
-Yes, please.

76
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,980
Do I grab the hump--

77
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,452
Wow, I've never been on a camel before.

78
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,354
This hump though…

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,456
It's not meant to be a handle, right?

80
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,858
This hump is so weird.

81
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,527
It's so weird and hard.

82
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,096
-It's really comfortable.
-Yeah.

83
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,530
The humps make it perfect to sit.

84
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,666
-It feels like riding a sedan.
-Yeah.

85
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,172
It really feels like a handle, though.

86
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,540
It makes it easy to sit.

87
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,878
FROM DONG-HYUN'S PHONE

88
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,815
This is great.

89
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,817
I woke up

90
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,886
and suddenly found myself here.

91
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,255
I never could've imagined this.

92
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,932
Do they live here?

93
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,676
Head.

94
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,244
Right hand. Left hand.

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,046
Right leg. Left leg.

96
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,347
Butt.

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,492
Let's go.

98
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,595
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

99
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,897
This is my first time.

100
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,365
It's a real ger.

101
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,969
-Hey, there's food.
-Awesome.

102
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,238
It's warm.

103
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,773
-Wow.
-It's so warm.

104
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,776
It smells like the cheese
we had yesterday.

105
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
The heating is amazing in here.

106
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,514
There are sitting rules here.

107
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,583
Certain people sit in the middle,
on the right,

108
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,051
on the left, and so on.

109
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,354
-You're going to go here.
-I'm an elder.

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,722
Right, the elder sits first.

111
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,324
Oh, we sit in order.

112
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,497
Younger people here.

113
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,866
Oh, you're the host.

114
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,234
The host sits all the way inside.

115
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,169
Some sit here too.

116
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,505
I think the father and mother, right?

117
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,145
What's that?

118
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,385
How do I do it? Like this?

119
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,221
I don't smell anything.

120
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,288
Try it. I don't smell it.

121
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,995
Hey, there's powder.

122
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,430
Powder?

123
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,701
Won't you sneeze?

124
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,018
IMMEDIATELY GREETS HIM,
MONGOLIAN-STYLE

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,787
How are you?
Have you been well this winter?

126
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,555
Yes, I have.
Have you been well this winter?

127
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,424
Oh, and then you exchange.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,628
You exchange with each other.

129
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,898
This smells different.

130
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,568
I think they exchange
their own distinct scents.

131
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,469
Right?

132
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,811
-Very simple.
-Is it deep-fried?

133
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,897
Hey! These two taste great together!

134
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,099
It's like really fresh butter.

135
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,634
Like whipped cream mixed with butter.

136
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,404
Like this.

137
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,107
Holy cow!

138
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,609
It's so good.

139
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,179
YET ANOTHER GIFT PRESENTATION

140
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,149
This is the traditional costume we wear
for Naadam in the summer.

141
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,557
Like this?

142
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,890
Are they the same people from yesterday?

143
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,058
It's a group performance.

144
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,101
It seems they'll use those stones too.

145
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,112
Holy cow.

146
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,524
It sounds so grand.

147
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,954
Wow, I couldn't tell their voices apart.

148
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,854
That was so cool.

149
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,724
Maybe it's because we're inside,
but it sounded majestic.

150
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,822
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

151
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,758
Wow, it's sunny.

152
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,143
So many horses!

153
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,685
Listen to the hoofbeats.

154
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,854
That's the sound of war coming.

155
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,424
You hear hoofbeats pounding
when there's a war.

156
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,495
-They're beautiful.
-These horses have great stamina.

157
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,063
They're built for long distances

158
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,097
and don't eat a lot.

159
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,701
Mongolian horses are the best warhorses.

160
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,803
What is it? What's going on?

161
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,374
Seriously?

162
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,876
For real?

163
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,477
Are you serious?

164
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,347
FAILED

165
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,955
-Can he really catch it?
-He's really doing this?

166
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,994
Don't be scared! You got this!

167
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,028
Show us how it's done!

168
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,699
FAILED

169
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,368
Let me try.

170
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,470
Doing it that way will tangle the rope.

171
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,205
They're running away!

172
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,676
It looks like your first time.

173
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,845
It's because he's from the city.

174
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,722
-Can Ochir do it?
-I think he can pull it off.

175
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,160
Did he catch one?

176
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,707
Wait a minute.

177
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,545
He's getting dragged away!

178
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,582
These horses are so strong.

179
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,483
Ochir.

180
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,218
HORSE SKIING

181
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,319
Horses are so strong.

182
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,938
It was amazing.

183
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,944
He's really strong.

184
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,514
This one looks a bit weak.

185
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,082
The white horse.

186
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,884
A DOCILE HORSE

187
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,418
-Elder.
-It's the elder's horse!

188
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,587
-Hey, elder!
-This is an elder's horse.

189
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,095
Hold on a second.

190
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,934
Hey, Orkhon.

191
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,835
TAKES AMOTTI'S REINS

192
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,470
No, Orkhon!

193
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,320
What do I do?

194
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,622
Orkhon, you can't leave me here.

195
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,336
This is nice.

196
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,304
EVERYONE HEADS OUT

197
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,683
Wow, the camels are so cool.

198
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,486
Gosh.

199
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,754
Let's go around that way.

200
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,789
Where? Over there?

201
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,657
Make a wider turn! Keep going!

202
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,993
Let's go farther out.

203
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,197
THE CAMELS FOLLOW BEHIND

204
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,186
This is so much fun.

205
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,797
So this is how the nomads get around.

206
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,201
The yak and camels pull their belongings.

207
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,306
This is incredible.

208
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,048
No, no!

209
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,255
Hey, the pace is picking up.

210
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,257
A little bit faster, okay?

211
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,560
Hey, my horse is going faster.

212
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,564
Go, go.

213
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,536
We're picking up speed.

214
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,105
We're going fast!

215
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,908
Jeez, I'm so scared.

216
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,943
We're galloping.

217
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,848
They're getting ready to gallop.

218
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,016
-Orkhon?
-Yes?

219
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,524
Holy cow, that's so cool!

220
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,459
That's amazing!

221
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,668
Riding is a basic skill for everyone here.

222
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,338
He's riding with no hands!

223
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,778
Not bad, Orkhon.

224
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,583
Look at them coming. It's so cool.

225
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,361
THE EXCITED PAIR

226
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,875
That was really cool.

227
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,711
Riding isn't scary anymore. It's fun.

228
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,113
It's really fun.

229
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,850
Hey, there.

230
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,720
Let's get off now and do some archery.

231
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,391
Warriors, mount up!

232
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,833
QUICK EQUIPMENT CHECK

233
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,402
Hey, there.

234
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,375
Oh, no.

235
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,514
I know I shouldn't laugh, but…

236
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,786
PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

237
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,855
We're going to try archery now.

238
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,057
Right here?

239
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,563
So we hit the target from here?

240
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,564
You shoot from here.

241
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,901
Competition?

242
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,159
1ST MINI QUEST:
AIM FOR THE TARGET

243
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,962
The players I feel most pressured by

244
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,398
are the Mongolians because they have

245
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,833
this celebration gesture.

246
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,903
Seeing this makes me think
they'll be good at archery.

247
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,540
I'm really confident.

248
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,446
ARCHERY DEMONSTRATION

249
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,249
He moved his index finger down.

250
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,319
Draw back as much as possible.

251
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,558
GOT CLOSE ON HIS FIRST SHOT

252
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,031
ORKHON TAKES HIS STANCE

253
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,402
Go ahead and try, city boy.

254
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,226
PLAYER 1: KIM DONG-HYUN

255
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,928
I'm a southpaw, so…

256
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,163
-A southpaw?
-Yeah.

257
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,074
You need to be really strong.

258
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,243
It's an individual match,

259
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,248
but since Mongolia, Australia, and Korea
went up against each other before,

260
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,050
I'll do it with that mindset.

261
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,594
KNOCKS DOWN TWO ON THE SIDE

262
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,962
-Hey, it worked.
-You got two.

263
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,130
I think I can do it.

264
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,400
The moment I saw the bow,
I felt as if I'd shot with it long ago.

265
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,834
If past lives exist,

266
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,804
I think I remember
shooting from the top of a castle.

267
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,540
Orkhon, you seem nervous.

268
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,811
SECOND ARROW

269
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,550
HITS ONE

270
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,952
It keeps going to the left.

271
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,019
One more left.

272
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,221
Why?

273
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,257
He has one more arrow left.

274
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,428
Don't forget the rules.

275
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,129
City boy is competitive.

276
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,865
THIRD ARROW

277
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,508
Invalid.

278
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,743
-The ground.
-It hit the ground.

279
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,314
It's invalid.

280
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,385
It'd still hurt if you got hit with it!

281
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,854
It'd still hurt
if it bounced off and hit you!

282
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,623
But it hit the ground first.

283
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,959
There's no rule that says that!

284
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,665
THE LAST SHOT WAS INVALID

285
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,668
KIM DONG-HYUN: 3

286
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,370
You have to draw back really hard.

287
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,481
South Korea is famous for gukgung,
traditional Korean archery.

288
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,350
I'll show them
what Korean genes are made of.

289
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,524
This is his thing.

290
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,327
For some reason,
he doesn't lose at games like this.

291
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,229
Jeez, this really hurts.

292
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,431
Hey, I told you it wasn't easy!

293
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,002
I do live in an apartment.

294
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,472
Hey, I can't pull this.

295
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,940
I told you it wasn't easy, Amotti.

296
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,315
My hands are frozen!

297
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,582
My hands…

298
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,953
He drew back,
but it fell right in front of him.

299
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,323
It was really funny and cute.

300
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,058
His muscles are for show.

301
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,697
That really hurt.

302
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,170
-Draw back really hard.
-I can't. My hands are frozen.

303
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,474
NO UNSOLICITED ADVICE

304
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,476
You have to pull really hard.

305
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,783
That was all recoil.

306
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,419
I got it now. I'm going for an arc, then.

307
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,721
You got this!

308
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,424
Pull back hard.

309
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,502
Gosh, it's so cold.

310
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,749
Aren't his hands cold?

311
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,152
Wow, he'll hit all the pink targets.

312
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,654
Warriors!

313
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,656
Mount up!

314
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,908
Hey, I'm in first place.

315
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,777
This is harder than expected.

316
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,392
Eddie, what was that?

317
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,366
He looks so cool.

318
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,934
I think he'll do well.

319
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,902
Look at his stance.

320
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,103
What the heck?

321
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,779
TAKES CAREFUL AIM

322
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,281
Look at that draw.

323
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,825
No more adjusting.

324
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,104
KNOCKS DOWN THREE

325
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,172
Didn't it bounce off?

326
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,847
Good aim.

327
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,858
OCHIR: 3 (NOT 2 POINTS)

328
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,926
LAST PLAYER: CITY BOY

329
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,228
Let's go, city boy.

330
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,263
Right, city boy.

331
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,334
Looking good.

332
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,468
He's going to break it.

333
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,452
Gosh, he's strong.

334
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,420
Wow.

335
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,992
VERY STRONG, BUT NOTHING ELSE

336
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,962
You're getting closer to the punishment.

337
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,038
Don't pull back too hard.

338
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,508
The way I see it,

339
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,410
Orkhon isn't very good

340
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,379
because he lacks experience.

341
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,782
One of the Mongolians
will win first place.

342
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:11,970
It's Mong Ji-hun.

343
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:12,971
It's my circus family.

344
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:13,972
He's incredible!

345
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,542
It's khorkhog!

346
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,476
This is so good!

347
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,314
I hope you'll be good students.

348
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,214
That hurts!

349
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,954
I don't think
I've ever seen him this excited.

350
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,388
