{\an8}PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:09.509
{\an8}BÖKH TRAINING CENTER

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.312
{\an8}I don't like this at all.

4
00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.247
{\an8}It's too scary here.

5
00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.315
{\an8}Look at this place.

6
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.721
{\an8}THE ATHLETES GREET THEM WITH APPLAUSE

7
00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.358
{\an8}ORKHON'S BÖKH TEAM

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.631
{\an8}BÖKH: YOU LOSE IF ANY PART OF YOUR BODY
EXCEPT HANDS OR FEET TOUCH THE GROUND

9
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.141
{\an8}Everyone looks really strong.

10
00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.009
{\an8}It's insane.

11
00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.045
{\an8}All athletes share the same expression.

12
00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.280
{\an8}It's like seeing
Korean judokas and wrestlers.

13
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.215
{\an8}Their attire...

14
00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.551
{\an8}I think I feel intimidated
because of their attire.

15
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.220
{\an8}It's their attire, shoes, and everything.

16
00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.688
{\an8}Wow.

17
00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.058
{\an8}Today is all about you two,

18
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.461
{\an8}so pick the strongest opponents
and face them.

19
00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.930
{\an8}- Why?
- Choose the biggest person.

20
00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.432
{\an8}Go easy on us.

21
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.633
{\an8}I thought today

22
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.169
{\an8}we could just watch Orkhon train...

23
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.070
{\an8}Amotti.

24
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.071
{\an8}Amotti.

{\an8}Who's stronger?

27
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.887
{\an8}I'll show you later.

28
00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.690
{\an8}I don't think
I've ever seen him this excited.

29
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.358
{\an8}Why are you so excited?

30
00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.328
{\an8}He's picking on us.

31
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.030
{\an8}Don't pick on weak people like us.

32
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.873
{\an8}- Amotti!
- Yes?

33
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.312
{\an8}Hurry, let's toss him up together.

34
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.852
{\an8}Please!

35
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.859
{\an8}A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME

36
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.460
{\an8}That's scary.

37
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.062
{\an8}Wow.

38
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.000
{\an8}We prepared traditional Bökh attire
for Amotti and Dong-hyun.

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.402
{\an8}It's from everyone on our wrestling team.

40
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.638
{\an8}But I really like what I have on.

41
00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.073
{\an8}I like what I'm wearing.

42
00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.207
{\an8}This is really nice.

43
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.609
{\an8}It's warm.

44
00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.477
{\an8}I hope you'll be good students.

45
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.779
{\an8}Okay.

46
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.817
{\an8}I hope you become a good wrestler.

47
00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.756
{\an8}I'll soon be 50 years old.

48
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.992
{\an8}I can't even untie this.

49
00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.094
{\an8}I'm so old that I can't even untie it.

50
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.129
{\an8}Amotti.

51
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.931
{\an8}Got it.

52
00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.299
{\an8}What a clever idea.

53
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.001
{\an8}Great.

54
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.335
{\an8}Okay.

55
00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.336
{\an8}Is this underwear?

56
00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.971
{\an8}- Undies?
- <i>Shuudag.</i>

57
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.240
{\an8}This is pretty revealing.

58
00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.010
{\an8}Mongolian wrestlers
deeply value this attire,

59
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.446
{\an8}so they never set it down below the hips.

60
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.382
{\an8}So you hold it up like this?

61
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.254
{\an8}When you take a break,
you put it around your neck like this.

62
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.456
{\an8}- Like this?
- Yes.

63
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.195
{\an8}Come on, let's go and change.

{\an8}He can find out later.

{\an8}The wrestler I feel most pressured by

118
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.090
{\an8}is absolutely nobody.

119

{\an8}<i>I'll make sure to win.</i>

120
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.606

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:06.679
{\an8}A SINGLE PULL ENDS THE MATCH

123
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.288

133
00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.361
{\an8}I think they picked
the wrong opponent for me.

134
00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:57.930
{\an8}They chose someone way too strong,

135
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.566
{\an8}so I didn't stand a chance.

136
00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.869

{\an8}<i>The one I feel most pressured by
is Kim Dong-hyun.</i>

144
00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.240
{\an8}But I'm Mongolian,

145
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.311
{\an8}so I know I can beat a Korean athlete.

146
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.681
{\an8}<i>I held my ground for the most part
during UFC matches.</i>

147
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.349
{\an8}I'll show you what I've got.

148
00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.361
{\an8}Ochir is aggressive.

{\an8}THEY GO DOWN AT THE SAME TIME

153
00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.516

161
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.151
{\an8}Who are you pulling for?

162
00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:35.755
{\an8}Ochir.

163
00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:37.757
{\an8}Ochir.

164
00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.029
{\an8}Because we're in Mongolia.

165
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.164
{\an8}It's a Mongolian sport.

166
00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.510

167

{\an8}HANDS CAN TOUCH THE GROUND

169
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.493
{\an8}I can't get a grip on him.

170
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.728
{\an8}Where can I grab him?

171
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.631
{\an8}Wow, they're so competitive.

172
00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:23.135
{\an8}What was that for?

173
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.771
{\an8}What was that for?

174
00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:27.873
{\an8}What is it?

175
00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.441
{\an8}Why did he hit me?

176
00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:30.910
{\an8}What for?

177
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.012
{\an8}A GESTURE OF ENCOURAGEMENT

178
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.085
{\an8}GRAPPLING HAND TO HAND

179
00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:56.202
{\an8}He engaged his back muscles
to stay balanced.

180
00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:58.337
{\an8}I've never seen
an athlete like him before.

181
00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:01.407
{\an8}How am I supposed to take him down?

182
00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.045
{\an8}You got this!

183
00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.314
{\an8}Come on, Dong-hyun!

184
00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:14.854
{\an8}What the heck?

185
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.056
{\an8}What the heck?

186
00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.658
{\an8}THIS IS INSANE

187
00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:20.726
{\an8}IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS

188
00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.993
{\an8}He won't go down.

189
00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.062
{\an8}Jeez, come on.

190
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:26.365
{\an8}He won't go down.

191
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.368
{\an8}I can't flip him.

192
00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.004
{\an8}He won't go down. His balance is insane.

193
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:41.080
{\an8}SOLID BACK MUSCLES

194
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:45.417
{\an8}<i>I saw Ochir's grit and tenacity.</i>

195
00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.018
{\an8}He was really something.

196
00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:50.289
{\an8}With that skill,
I felt he should take first place.

197
00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:56.962
{\an8}Hey!

198
00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:57.997
{\an8}My undies.

199
00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.032
OCHIR GRABS ONTO DONG-HYUN'S UNDIES

200
00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.301
{\an8}Hey.

201
00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.602
{\an8}Hey!

202
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.675
{\an8}That's my behind!

203
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.977
{\an8}Hey!

204
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:16.215
{\an8}HELPLESS AGAINST THE UNDIES ATTACK

205
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:33.165
{\an8}OCHIR ATTACKS WHILE DONG-HYUN IS OFF GUARD

206
00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:40.205
{\an8}Who won?

207
00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:44.443
DONG-HYUN'S ELBOW HIT THE FLOOR FIRST

208
00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.913
{\an8}<i>Jeez, how humiliating.</i>

209
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.015
{\an8}I didn't know you could grab
inside the undies too.

210
00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:53.452
{\an8}Ochir said it was his first time,
but clearly it wasn't.

211
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.688
{\an8}USING YOUR OPPONENT'S ATTIRE
IS ALSO A SKILL

212
00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.894
{\an8}THE LOSER PASSES UNDER THE WINNER'S ARM

213
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.400
{\an8}VICTORY RITUAL

214
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.535
{\an8}So cool.

215
00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.277
TEAM ORKHONBAYAR
WINS ROUND 3

216
00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.113
WINNER:
ORKHONBAYAR, AMOTTI, LKHAGVA-OCHIR

217
00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:28.454
{\an8}It was a pleasure to have

218
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.124
{\an8}such amazing people
join us for today's training.

219
00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:42.001
{\an8}Now let's raise our voices
and sing with confidence.

220
00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:45.871
{\an8}"MY BELOVED HOMELAND"
(MY BELOVED HOMELAND, FOREVER IN MY HEART)

221
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.374
{\an8}REGARDED AS MONGOLIA'S "SECOND ANTHEM,"

222
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.677
{\an8}THIS PATRIOTIC SONG IS OFTEN SUNG
AT NATIONAL CELEBRATIONS LIKE NAADAM

223
00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.928
{\an8}DOING AN INTERVIEW

224
00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.931
{\an8}What is it?

225
00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.133
{\an8}What are you doing?

226
00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:21.073
{\an8}DONG-HYUN & AMOTTI VS. ORKHON

227
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.076
{\an8}They're like little kids.

228
00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:28.914
{\an8}TRIES THE UNDIES-GRABBING TECHNIQUE

229
00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:31.950
{\an8}PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

230
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.021
{\an8}Wow, what's all this?

231
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.190
{\an8}Holy cow.

232
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.291
{\an8}This is amazing.

233
00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.459
{\an8}Look at the meat!

234
00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.396
{\an8}There's Japanese food, Korean food,

235
00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.098
{\an8}Mongolian food, and everything.

236
00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.637
FAREWELL DINNER

237
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:56.241
{\an8}Tonight's dinner has been prepared
by Team Mongolia.

238
00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.510
{\an8}- Gosh.
- Thank you.

239
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.778
{\an8}Thank you.

240
00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.649
{\an8}It's like the meal we had
before the final match in <i>Physical: Asia</i>.

241
00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:18.630
{\an8}What do I dip this in?

242
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.998
{\an8}This sauce?

243
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.541
{\an8}This meat is delicious.

244
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:30.776
{\an8}It's so good.

245
00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.077
{\an8}This looks really good.

246
00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.324
{\an8}ADIYASUREN
TEAM MONGOLIA

247
00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:49.728
{\an8}Good to see you.

248
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.365
{\an8}- Wow.
- You really scared me.

249
00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.733
{\an8}Seriously.

250
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.168
{\an8}You scared me more.

251
00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:57.936
{\an8}Gosh, my heart...

252
00:18:58.003 --> 00:18:59.404
{\an8}I flew up about 10 cm.

253
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:00.439
{\an8}I jumped.

254
00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.575
{\an8}- I saw it coming and still got startled.
- You came running.

255
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.079
{\an8}So that's why there are empty seats.

256
00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.814
{\an8}He jumped up like a grasshopper.

257
00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.323
{\an8}Then who is this seat for?

258
00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.560
{\an8}- Is someone else coming?
- Another surprise?

259
00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:25.097
{\an8}A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION

260
00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.431
{\an8}Yun Sung-bin?

261
00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.900
{\an8}Seriously, maybe it's him.

262
00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.034
{\an8}Sung-bin.

263
00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.302
{\an8}Hey!

264
00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.236
{\an8}Just kidding.

265
00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.009
{\an8}Acting isn't for you.

266
00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:42.681
{\an8}Actually, Dulguun and I
were going to surprise you together,

267
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:48.320
{\an8}but he had a game today,
so he couldn't come.

268
00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:49.922
{\an8}I see.

269
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.123
{\an8}He had a game?

270
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.391
{\an8}DULGUUN'S SEAT

271
00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:58.163
{\an8}I think Team Korea members
meet up pretty often.

272
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.531
{\an8}Maybe not altogether,

273
00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.568
{\an8}but we'll meet in small groups
and work out and such.

274
00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:05.070
{\an8}Do Team Mongolia members meet up often?

275
00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.039
{\an8}We haven't had the time.

276
00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:11.643
{\an8}Everyone has been very busy
with their own training and work.

277
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.252
{\an8}All of you are still active athletes,

278
00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.989
{\an8}and Khandsuren plays
in the Japanese league.

279
00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:25.123
{\an8}But for us...

280
00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:27.059
{\an8}I...

281
00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:28.126
{\an8}I'm retired.

282
00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:28.994
{\an8}I'm an elder,

283
00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:31.196
{\an8}so I have a lot of time to hang out.

284
00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:34.600
{\an8}You won <i>Physical: Asia</i>,
so you're not an elder.

285
00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.278
{\an8}I'll help you make it to the UFC.

286
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.080
{\an8}Yeah.

287
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.314
{\an8}UFC and Bökh.

288
00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:52.050
{\an8}I want to go against you two in judo

289
00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.619
{\an8}and win.

290
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.053
{\an8}Amotti!

291
00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.089
{\an8}Please don't.

292
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.999
{\an8}I saw you use judo techniques
while doing Bökh today.

293
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.567
{\an8}You used three judo moves on me.

294
00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.235
{\an8}You tried to take me down.

295
00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.037
{\an8}Right, I did.

296
00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:13.972
{\an8}You almost fell, then recovered.

297
00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.941
{\an8}Almost fall, then recover.

298
00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.876
{\an8}I didn't know how to defend against it.

299
00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:20.412
{\an8}He was this close to the floor.

300
00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.381
{\an8}Ochir doesn't have any bones,

301
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.715
{\an8}so he just bends backward.

302
00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:26.084
{\an8}That's so true.

303
00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.052
{\an8}I thought I took him down,

304
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.453
{\an8}but then...

305
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.321
{\an8}Seriously.

306
00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:32.056
{\an8}You thought you won a few times, right?

307
00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.293
{\an8}You're really something.

308
00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.260
{\an8}That's me.

309
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.996
{\an8}Amotti ended up cheering for Mongolia.

310
00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.035
{\an8}He was the underdog in terms of weight,

311
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.436
{\an8}so that's why I cheered for him.

312
00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:47.673
{\an8}What makes Bökh distinctive
is that there are no weight classes.

313
00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:51.008
{\an8}By the way, Adiyasuren,

314
00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.911
{\an8}Korea is also good when it comes to judo.

315
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:55.247
{\an8}Have you gone to Korea for training camp?

316
00:21:55.314 --> 00:22:00.319
{\an8}I went there for training camp
a couple of times a while back.

317
00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.421
{\an8}I had a great time
with the Korean athletes,

318
00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.456
{\an8}and the food was really good.

319
00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.091
{\an8}I've really liked Korean food since then.

320
00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:12.898
{\an8}Kimchi <i>jjigae.</i>

321
00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:14.599
{\an8}- Kimchi <i>jjigae?</i>
- Wow.

322
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.568
{\an8}There's a really good kimchi <i>jjigae</i> place.

323
00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:17.803
{\an8}They only sell kimchi <i>jjigae.</i>

324
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.071
{\an8}- Kimchi?
- Seriously.

325
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.807
{\an8}They put tons of meat
in their kimchi <i>jjigae.</i>

326
00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:23.040
{\an8}Just let us know,

327
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.109
{\an8}and Amotti will handle it.

328
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.578
{\an8}He'll take care of everything.

329
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.048
{\an8}I'll show you the full experience.

330
00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:32.050
{\an8}Amotti will buy you everything
at Olive Young.

331
00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.160
{\an8}You might age suddenly.

332
00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.000
{\an8}I see.

333
00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:07.819
{\an8}I want to learn that phrase.

334
00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.889
{\an8}The subtitles said, "Warriors, mount up!"

335
00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:13.091
{\an8}<i>-Daichid,
- Daichid,</i>

336
00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.559
{\an8}<i>morindoo!</i>

337
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.929
{\an8}<i>Daichid morindoo.</i>

338
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.699
{\an8}If that's your memorable moment,

339
00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:23.033
{\an8}mine is when they counted,
"One, two, three."

340
00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.838
{\an8}The feeling that washed over me
during the wall pushing match...

341
00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:29.040
{\an8}<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.
- Neg khoyor gurav.</i>

342
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.842
{\an8}<i>-Neg khoyor gurav.
- Neg khoyor gurav.</i>

343
00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:34.045
{\an8}Let's push. <i>Neg khoyor gurav</i>!

344
00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:37.916
{\an8}After the final match,

345
00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.050
{\an8}Ochir went to the Mongolian flag

346
00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:43.488
{\an8}and showed a gesture of respect like this.

347
00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.990
{\an8}He did something like that.

348
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.260
{\an8}Is that a traditional Mongolian ritual?

349
00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:52.731
{\an8}It's hard to give a clear-cut answer.

350
00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.199
{\an8}Even though it was a small flag,

351
00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:57.035
{\an8}it embodied everything
our country stands for.

352
00:23:57.135 --> 00:24:01.072
{\an8}That small flag felt bigger
than anything else in my heart.

353
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.380
{\an8}So I think my body just reacted
to what I was feeling.

354
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.650
{\an8}Before I knew it,
I was kneeling and paying my respects.

355
00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:15.554
{\an8}- It really resonated with me.
- That scene was touching.

356
00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:17.522
{\an8}In Korea,

357
00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:20.258
{\an8}people talk about how we won
and congratulate us,

358
00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.393
{\an8}but more than that,

359
00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.094
{\an8}they say how amazing Team Mongolia was.

360
00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:25.764
{\an8}Even though a winner was declared
in the final match,

361
00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.300
{\an8}it didn't feel like anyone lost.

362
00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:29.734
{\an8}It felt like both teams had won.

363
00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:33.572
{\an8}I think that was the result of the match.

364
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:38.176
{\an8}Right. It's not every day
that you see competitions end like this.

365
00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:41.046
{\an8}This particular show was created

366
00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.113
{\an8}because Orkhon said

367
00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:45.550
{\an8}that Team Mongolia would win first place
and invite Team Korea.

368
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.552
{\an8}That's how all of this started.

369
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:50.021
{\an8}It's obvious how much you love Mongolia.

370
00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:54.960
{\an8}We really appreciate both of you

371
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.129
{\an8}taking the time to come all the way here.

372
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:01.633
{\an8}Even though the trip was short,

373
00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.902
{\an8}it was full of good, lasting memories.

374
00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.604
{\an8}We had a truly wonderful time,

375
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:10.041
{\an8}and it was the most meaningful
and heartfelt experience of the year.

376
00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:12.042
{\an8}I never thought
this would actually happen.

377
00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:14.479
{\an8}But it did come true,

378
00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.681
{\an8}and I'm happy that I spent quality time

379
00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:17.949
{\an8}with good friends.

380
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:20.552
{\an8}Every photo we took was a masterpiece,

381
00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:22.354
{\an8}like the plains of Mongolia.

382
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:27.092
{\an8}<i>My friend said
his dream destination was Mongolia.</i>

383
00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:28.493
{\an8}<i>And now I know why.</i>

384
00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:31.029
{\an8}<i>We tried our best to share with you</i>

385
00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:33.632
{\an8}<i>Mongolia's most beautiful culture
and traditions</i>

386
00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:35.233
{\an8}<i>during your brief visit.</i>

387
00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:40.205
{\an8}<i>I hope our friendship lasts
for many years to come.</i>

388
00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:43.742
{\an8}And as always, we'll greet you with,
"Welcome to Mongolia."

389
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.011
{\an8}We'll see you again.

390
00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.412
{\an8}Let's see each other in Korea.

391
00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.014
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Thank you.

392
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.882
{\an8}Thank you so much for inviting us.
