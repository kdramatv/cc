35
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,763
{\an8}I was laughing on the outside,

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,266
{\an8}but inside I was serious.

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,068

{\an8}It's probably the only one in the world.

174
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,255
{\an8}Hey, younger guy.

175
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,525
{\an8}Oh, that's right.

176
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,526
{\an8}If the host sits there,

177
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,862
{\an8}you have to sit here, Dong-hyun.

178
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,664
{\an8}- Why?
- The older guy sits here.

179
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,565
{\an8}- Right, the rules.
- Like yesterday.

180
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,401
{\an8}Got it.

181
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,472
{\an8}You're the elder.

182
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,308
{\an8}Right, I'm the elder.

183
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,013
{\an8}We came very early in the morning,

184
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,883
{\an8}so we feel bad
for the trouble you went through

185
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,651
{\an8}to get everything ready.

186
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,287
{\an8}There's no need to worry at all.

187
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,856
{\an8}It's Mongolian tradition to welcome guests

188
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,060
{\an8}who have come a long way,
so please relax and enjoy yourselves.

189
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,027
{\an8}No worries at all.

190
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,629
{\an8}<i>-Bayarlalaa.
- Bayarlalaa.</i>

191
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,698
{\an8}We're very thankful.

192
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,700
{\an8}I hope we'll have the opportunity

193
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,134
{\an8}to return the hospitality.

194
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:18,243
{\an8}We prepared a traditional Mongolian meal
especially for you.

195
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,121
{\an8}This is <i>airag</i>.

196
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,189
{\an8}Fermented horse milk?

197
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,791
{\an8}- I've never seen this before.
- It's like Korean <i>makgeolli</i>.

198
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,760
{\an8}Mongolians enjoy this drink,

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,529
{\an8}and they serve it to special guests.

200
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,031
{\an8}I see.

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,535
{\an8}But if you drink that much,

202
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,304
{\an8}won't you get completely drunk?

203
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,144
{\an8}You can hold your liquor.

204
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,713
{\an8}Hey, it's cold. It's not warm.

205
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,682
{\an8}Guests who come over

206
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,518
{\an8}have to sing a song
to bring good luck to the home.

207
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,619
{\an8}Really?

208
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,089
{\an8}Yes, really.

209
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,126
{\an8}What song do I sing?

210
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,230
{\an8}There are lots of kids,
so I'll sing a kids' song.

211
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,613
{\an8}<i>There are three bears in a house</i>

212
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,415
{\an8}<i>Daddy bear, mommy bear</i>

213
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,616
{\an8}Oh, she doesn't look happy.

214
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,084
{\an8}<i>And baby bear</i>

215
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,788
{\an8}<i>Daddy bear is fat</i>

216
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,391
{\an8}- <i>Mommy bear is slim</i>
- <i>Mommy bear is slim</i>

217
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,995
{\an8}- <i>Baby bear is really cute</i>
- <i>Baby bear is really cute</i>

218
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,165
{\an8}- <i>Shrug, shrug! Good job!</i>
- <i>Shrug, shrug! Good job!</i>

219
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,402
{\an8}BABY BEAR FEELS DAZED

220
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,504
{\an8}How do you say, "I'm sorry" in Mongolian?

221
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,177
{\an8}This smells strong, like <i>makgeolli</i>.

222
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,382
{\an8}I'm sipping it to make it last.

223
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,184
{\an8}Down it in three gulps.

224
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,518
{\an8}Okay.

225
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,029
{\an8}He takes tiny sips,
but his reactions are huge.

226
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,499
{\an8}AMOTTI DRINKS TOO

227
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,568
{\an8}AS WELL AS THE HOST

228
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,776
{\an8}He looks a little out of it.

229
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,077
{\an8}And he's more talkative.

230
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,928
{\an8}PHYSICAL: WELCOME TO MONGOLIA

231
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,965
{\an8}Here's the <i>khorkhog</i> Amotti ordered.

232
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,066
{\an8}It's <i>khorkhog!</i>

233
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,405
{\an8}There's also fried dumplings and <i>buuz</i>,
so help yourselves.

234
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,308
{\an8}I hope you enjoy the food.

235
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,179
{\an8}This is so good!

236
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,749
{\an8}- Wow.
- It's delicious.

237
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,056
{\an8}This is amazing. It's the best.

238
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,227
{\an8}It's so good.

239
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,695
{\an8}And it's barely seasoned.

240
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,868
{\an8}I'm curious about something.

241
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,005
{\an8}Do the kids train with you regularly,

242
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,174
{\an8}or did they practice
only for yesterday's show?

243
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,409
{\an8}We train and practice together regularly,

244
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,379
{\an8}but we specifically prepared
yesterday's performance for you.

245
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,817
{\an8}Right now, I'm teaching my kids

246
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,154
{\an8}to pass on my expertise and knowledge
of traditional Mongolian acrobatics,

247
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,456
{\an8}but when they grow up,

248
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:57,796
{\an8}they'll decide for themselves
and follow their own paths.

249
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,767
{\an8}The children must be very proud

250
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,068
{\an8}of their father.

251
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,574
{\an8}I think your youngest is close in age
to my second child.

252
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,046
{\an8}Really?

253
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,416
{\an8}If we go to Korea,
I think our kids will hit it off quickly.

254
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,190
{\an8}My kids can teach your kids acrobatics.

255
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,327
{\an8}My kids are learning a bit of gymnastics.

256
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,297
{\an8}When kids use the trampoline
at a kids' café,

257
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,233
{\an8}they usually just jump and fall over.

258
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,268
{\an8}But Ochir's kids will flip in the air.

259
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,937
{\an8}It'll be really amazing to watch.

260
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,906
{\an8}- Parenting for a day, done in a snap.
- In a snap.

261
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,943
{\an8}What I found amazing yesterday

262
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,612
{\an8}was the hanging performance.

263
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,547
{\an8}I was so moved by it.

264
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,316
{\an8}Your whole family is amazing.

265
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,287
{\an8}My wife took up acrobatics later in life.

266
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,223
{\an8}It was after we got married
when she was about 25.

267
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,560
{\an8}That's when she decided
to become an acrobat.

268
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,997
{\an8}Wow, that's amazing.

269
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,565
{\an8}It's not easy once you're an adult.

270
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,701
{\an8}What did you do
before becoming an acrobat?

271
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:15,207
{\an8}I worked for Korea Visa Application Center
for about two years.

272
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,411
{\an8}I also worked for Mongolian Airlines.

273
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,683
{\an8}Those jobs had nothing to do
with circus performing.

274
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,954
{\an8}I turned an office worker
into a circus acrobat.

275
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,657
{\an8}How hard did she have to train
to catch up?

276
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,627
{\an8}She became this good

277
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,598
{\an8}because she trained harder
than anything on <i>Physical: Asia</i>.

278
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,867
{\an8}That must've been so hard.

279
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,136
{\an8}Was your training difficult?

280
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,404
{\an8}Was he very hard on you?

281
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,472
{\an8}Of course.

282
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,541
{\an8}- Of course.
- Of course.

283
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,446
{\an8}I think Ochir would've scolded her a lot.

284
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,783
{\an8}If I'd tried to scold her,
I'd have only gotten into trouble.

285
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,692
{\an8}OCHIR CALLS SOMEONE OVER

286
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,761
{\an8}Come here.

287
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168
{\an8}I'm Narantsetseg.

288
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,236
{\an8}- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,572
{\an8}You're a handsome man.

290
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,207
{\an8}And your mother is very beautiful.

291
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,510
{\an8}So I think you're handsome
because you take after her.

292
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,453
{\an8}Last month was a difficult time
for our family

293
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,823
{\an8}because my father passed away.

294
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,460
{\an8}It's been exactly one month.

295
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,996
{\an8}He passed away
the day before <i>Physical: Asia</i> aired.

296
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,166
{\an8}So we were in the hospital
when the first episode aired.

297
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,503
{\an8}It was a very difficult time.

298
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,807
{\an8}I offer my deepest condolences
on your father's passing.

299
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,212
{\an8}But I'm sure your father
is watching you from above,

300
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,116
{\an8}filled with pride and joy
at the life you're living.

301
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,217
{\an8}Thank you.

302
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,854
{\an8}I was happy that <i>Physical: Asia</i>

303
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,089
{\an8}reached so many people,

304
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,025
{\an8}and that people around the world
cheered for Mongolia.

305
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,763
{\an8}But even though I felt joy and happiness,

306
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:24,236
{\an8}my heart ached even more,
as if it were breaking.

307
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,773
{\an8}Before my dad passed away,

308
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,608
{\an8}I told him
I participated in <i>Physical: Asia</i>,

309
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,779
{\an8}and that his name and mine
were becoming known worldwide.

310
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,681
{\an8}He cried when he heard that.

311
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,952
{\an8}Even more people in Mongolia now

312
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,456
{\an8}see you as a hero and support you,

313
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,726
{\an8}so if your father were still here,
he'd be even more pleased.

314
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,662
{\an8}I imagine that part hurts you the most.

315
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,199
{\an8}But as Orkhon said earlier,

316
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,036
{\an8}I think he's always by your side,
watching over you

317
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,372
{\an8}and supporting you in that way.

318
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,043
{\an8}So I hope everything
continues to go well for you,

319
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,046
{\an8}and I'll also always support you,
right by your side.

320
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,116
{\an8}Thank you.

321
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,387
{\an8}There are so many people in Korea

322
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,255
{\an8}who love Ochir and Orkhon.

323
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,559
{\an8}So I'd like to invite both of you
to Korea someday.

324
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,962
{\an8}Some Korean fans have told me

325
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,732
{\an8}that I look a lot like
the actor Kim Ji-hun.

326
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,502
{\an8}If I go to Korea,
will it be possible to meet him?

327
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,871
{\an8}I'll try my best to make that happen.

328
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,307
{\an8}Because you resemble Kim Ji-hun,

329
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,942
{\an8}you're known as "Mongolian Kim Ji-hun."

330
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,478
{\an8}Your nickname is actually "Mong Ji-hun."

331
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,580
{\an8}Mong Ji-hun.

332
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,448
{\an8}You look the same.

333
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,983
{\an8}Totally the same.
