00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:09.805
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.419
Where did the key go?

3
00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.053
Dingchen

4
00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:45.153
Dingchen

5
00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.186
I probably didn't drink much today

6
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:16.971
who are you

7
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.679
I ask who you are

8
00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:27.079
it's me

9
00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.246
It seems that I miss you too much

10
00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.246
This is impossible…

11
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.465
How is it possible...

12
00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:51.565
Are you a scholar?

13
00:02:57.432 --> 00:02:58.865
Douxue

14
00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.715
(Episode 13)
If you had contacted me earlier

15
00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.449
I will definitely go to Japan to find you

16
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:21.882
I wanted to do that too

17
00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.882
But if Tetsuo finds out

18
00:03:24.882 --> 00:03:26.615
I should never come back to Korea again

19
00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.615
Do you think Tetsuo will kill you?

20
00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:30.649
It was at my uncle's cemetery

21
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.515
It was Tetsuo who gave you the key to unlock the handcuffs.

22
00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:36.249
That's the deal between him and you

23
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.182
Because he thought that after I smuggled in

24
00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:41.382
It's absolutely impossible to come back

25
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.049
Just like a dead person

26
00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.849
Douxue Tetsuo is not that bad

27
00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:51.790
I'm not speaking for him

28
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.624
But I know very well
How did you grow up along the way?

29
00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:57.690
You are brothers
When others see it, they think you are brothers.

30
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.890
I've found it

31
00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:01.324
what to find

32
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.724
The person who killed my dad

33
00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:06.090
What, that hit-and-run driver?

34
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.157
No, it's the guy who ordered him to kill someone.

35
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.557
So that car accident was not an accident?

36
00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:14.324
Who is it?

37
00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:15.457
Who is behind the scenes

38
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.057
The person who is my brother-in-law

39
00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:27.129
It was that person who ordered me

40
00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.963
I don't know his name

41
00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:31.529
See clearly

42
00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:34.796
is it him

43
00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:39.796
Or is it him?

44
00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:47.796
That guy is wearing sunglasses and I'm not sure...

45
00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:49.629
Brat, what about this one?

46
00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:02.135
That's right

47
00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.303
It's this person

48
00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:09.813
He said there was going to be a drunk guy walking into the middle of the road

49
00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:14.746
He also said he would be charged with negligent death.
Will release me soon

50
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.713
So who is behind the scenes?

51
00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:48.051
How is it possible

52
00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:51.751
That family is all accomplices

53
00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.918
Dou Xue, don’t think so wildly

54
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:55.218
How could things be like this?

55
00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:56.718
They're the ones who would do this kind of thing

56
00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:59.085
Douxue, you must have made a mistake

57
00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.962
I hope so too

58
00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:03.162
Not only you have told me

59
00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.029
I also see everything

60
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.929
Compared to your son
Uncle, he loves Tetsuo even more

61
00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:09.929
How could Tetsuo repay kindness with hatred?

62
00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:14.696
I know you are dissatisfied with Tetsuo

63
00:06:14.696 --> 00:06:15.929
But this is outrageous

64
00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:17.396
Douxue, things are definitely not what you think.

65
00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:23.996
Otherwise, let's do this
Let's go see Tetsuo as soon as possible

66
00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:26.929
If he knew you were alive
He's definitely happier than anyone else

67
00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.596
By the way, ask him about this case.

68
00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:32.196
Maybe the investigation can be reopened and the truth revealed...

69
00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:38.576
Douxue…

70
00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:41.043
Do you think that guy will reveal the truth?

71
00:06:41.043 --> 00:06:43.710
He's better at hiding the truth than anyone else

72
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.576
what does this mean

73
00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:48.876
Did Tetsuo cover up some truth?

74
00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:51.721
You don’t understand Tetsuo so well

75
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:06.248
About Lishui
The murder that ruined my life

76
00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:09.241
You always ask me again and again every time you come to visit the prison

77
00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.507
"Did you really kill someone?"

78
00:07:13.274 --> 00:07:15.441
I lied to you then

79
00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.907
I didn't kill anyone, but I became a murderer

80
00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:25.553
And then...went to jail

81
00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:28.141
So that case at that time...

82
00:07:30.574 --> 00:07:32.941
Is the real murderer Tetsuo?

83
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.470
Is the murderer really Douxue?

84
00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:42.236
Do you think the murderer is someone else?

85
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.903
Do you think I am the murderer?

86
00:07:46.336 --> 00:07:47.570
right

87
00:07:48.003 --> 00:07:50.470
As long as it's for you
I can do anything

88
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.203
You can kill someone if you want me to

89
00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:54.370
Just think that I killed Yingzhuo.

90
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.436
If I really killed the person

91
00:07:57.741 --> 00:07:59.407
I would do that all for you

92
00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:20.596
Tetsuo was crying and begging me

93
00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:22.130
Brother Douxue…
Want me to save him

94
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.863
Please help me

95
00:08:23.863 --> 00:08:26.930
Then he came with his mother to beg my father.

96
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.696
Please save me. Please save me just once.

97
00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:32.563
Just save me once
uncle…

98
00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:36.362
people who know about this

99
00:08:36.362 --> 00:08:39.095
Only me Tetsuo

100
00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:43.195
My dead father and Tetsuo's mother

101
00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:45.528
Do you understand this?

102
00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:49.662
Even if he killed me and my father, it wouldn't be a surprise

103
00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.128
(Restaurant rice soup)

104
00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.394
Yeah, we've all heard it

105
00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:25.894
When did it happen?

106
00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:28.027
After that guy Li Yongde confessed,

107
00:09:28.027 --> 00:09:30.027
Douxue said this while drinking here

108
00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:32.762
(Snowy Soup)

109
00:09:32.763 --> 00:09:34.830
We were also shocked

110
00:09:35.497 --> 00:09:38.030
Brother Douxue is not a liar

111
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.797
That guy Choi Cheol-woong is really hateful

112
00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:45.530
How could he help him?
Brother Douxue who took the blame and went to jail is like this

113
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.763
Although I don’t know Douxue’s father
why do that

114
00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:51.563
But he used Douxue to help Zhexiong take the blame

115
00:09:51.563 --> 00:09:54.497
Threaten Tetsuo and Tetsuo's family?

116
00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:57.263
That’s why he was brutally killed

117
00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.630
Douxue was also hunted down for this reason.

118
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.897
This is the most reasonable guess

119
00:10:01.897 --> 00:10:05.797
So are you all going to be part of the revenge plan?

120
00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:14.465
Even if this is true

121
00:10:14.466 --> 00:10:17.300
But those who know the truth
Only Tetsuo and his family

122
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.200
Will they openly admit it?

123
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.133
Besides, who would believe what a drug addict says?

124
00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.533
Isn't it?

125
00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:25.100
Besides, he has a huge backer behind him.

126
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.766
Please stop Douxue and don't help him

127
00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:33.866
Revenge will make Douxue finally survive
die again

128
00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:36.863
We tried to dissuade him

129
00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:41.064
But he said he hopes to restore everything to the way it was before

130
00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:43.364
He said if he didn't do that he would die.

131
00:10:43.364 --> 00:10:47.164
Even if I'm alive, I can't live with it safely

132
00:10:47.164 --> 00:10:49.831
No one can stop him now

133
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:51.197
except you

134
00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:04.334
You are here

135
00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.831
Boss, long time no see

136
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:10.297
Alas, has the sun come out in the west?

137
00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:13.131
You are actually reading a book
It's really not like what you would do

138
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:13.931
what book is this

139
00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:16.581
(Note: Korean Buddhist classics)
"Nothing"?

140
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:18.948
Wow, you are really amazing

141
00:11:18.948 --> 00:11:23.348
Ms. Ma Qingzi plans to
Live life with a "nothing" spirit?

142
00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:24.881
That's not the case

143
00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:27.115
Both spiritually and materially

144
00:11:27.115 --> 00:11:30.781
Everyone must know how to empty and let go first
Only then can we welcome prosperity again

145
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:33.981
So now I
Really in a state of "nothing"

146
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.281
why

147
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:37.248
Because I'm a pauper now

148
00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:39.481
If I make a lot of money and become a rich man

149
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:40.615
Might have to go to jail again

150
00:11:40.615 --> 00:11:42.381
You might as well go to the temple

151
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:46.315
Let’s chant sutras and learn Buddhism while leaning on crutches...

152
00:11:46.315 --> 00:11:48.615
Hello, brothers and sisters.

153
00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:50.415
You are here

154
00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:53.381
I seem to smell the scent of a big case.

155
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.981
You are very keen

156
00:11:56.033 --> 00:12:00.033
How rich is the other person?
We still need to investigate the property under our name first.

157
00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:01.267
That is to say

158
00:12:01.268 --> 00:12:03.868
Is that the aunt?
Is Jung Joo-young still Lee Byung-cheol?

159
00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:05.602
What's going on

160
00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:08.402
She is no ordinary entrepreneur

161
00:12:08.402 --> 00:12:11.402
She made a lot of money through illegal means

162
00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:13.935
Tell us who she is.

163
00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:18.468
She is the lady from Nanshan

164
00:12:20.002 --> 00:12:23.735
Brother, are you crazy?

165
00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:28.202
Brother, have you taken a break for a few years?
My brain is starting to have problems

166
00:12:28.202 --> 00:12:29.335
Go see a doctor quickly

167
00:12:29.335 --> 00:12:30.435
Don't count me out

168
00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:32.868
I'd rather be a pauper with nothing

169
00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:34.068
you are absolutely crazy

170
00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:35.902
Hello…

171
00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.302
As the saying goes, the higher the risk, the greater the profit.

172
00:12:38.302 --> 00:12:42.902
And that lady is very concerned about real estate.
Extremely ambitious

173
00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:44.216
Hello…

174
00:12:44.216 --> 00:12:47.382
How long can we do it again after that?

175
00:12:47.382 --> 00:12:50.182
Just treat it like it was before we retired.
last business

176
00:12:50.182 --> 00:12:52.482
Plan for retirement living expenses

177
00:12:52.482 --> 00:12:55.982
And if someone in a higher position uses illegal means,
Making money was exposed

178
00:12:55.982 --> 00:12:57.949
People will also support us

179
00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:00.716
Look at the righteous thief Zhao Shiheng

180
00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:04.049
if successful
You can also donate money to those in need

181
00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:07.216
(Note: an organization that robs the rich and gives to the poor)
Let’s follow the example of the Living Poor Party

182
00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:09.749
Whether it is Zhao Shiheng or the Living Poor Party

183
00:13:09.749 --> 00:13:12.149
In the end, they are still a bunch of thieves

184
00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:13.282
That is to say

185
00:13:13.282 --> 00:13:18.549
I don't think so no matter how much I think about it
This is the plan you came up with, brother

186
00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:20.316
Big brother

187
00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:21.516
There must be someone behind your back who is instructing you.

188
00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:23.383
Not at all

189
00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:27.550
if there really is

190
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.916
That's what love drives me to do, right?

191
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:33.816
the last love of my life

192
00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.550
Big brother

193
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.050
Do you want to participate? Just say a word.

194
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.716
How many last loves did you have in your life?

195
00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.116
one two three…

196
00:13:43.116 --> 00:13:45.716
Is it Mi-sook or Ying-ja?

197
00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:49.977
Awesome

198
00:13:49.977 --> 00:13:53.977
This nightclub has a completely different style.

199
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.910
in my eyes

200
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.977
These magnificent decorations are all made of money

201
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.677
How much does it cost to decorate like this?

202
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:04.777
do you know

203
00:14:06.777 --> 00:14:08.644
I'm not sure either

204
00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:10.777
But if it succeeds

205
00:14:10.777 --> 00:14:13.144
You can earn 500 million won by talking less.

206
00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:14.877
Five hundred million won?

207
00:14:18.177 --> 00:14:19.410
It's not difficult

208
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.277
Just borrow the name of the company's bank number.

209
00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:24.144
Funds needed for operations

210
00:14:24.144 --> 00:14:26.344
It will be produced by the developer

211
00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:27.710
Is it okay if I just borrow my name?

212
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.419
What kind of investment is this?

213
00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:35.579
As long as you know
It's fine if it's real estate development

214
00:14:35.579 --> 00:14:37.812
Settlement will be carried out after the investment case is completed

215
00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:39.912
By then, each person will receive 100 million won

216
00:14:43.412 --> 00:14:44.545
100 million won

217
00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:46.479
Can I get 100 million won just by borrowing my name?

218
00:14:46.912 --> 00:14:50.345
It seems to be a very large investment project.

219
00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:51.912
Otherwise this is the case

220
00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:55.145
You also let us participate in investment

221
00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.045
This may not be possible

222
00:14:58.045 --> 00:14:59.879
Because even I couldn’t participate

223
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.833
It’s true, you’re less likely to come

224
00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:18.161
(registration certificate)

225
00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:20.296
Give me a little more danger next time

226
00:15:22.553 --> 00:15:25.387
Why does she have so many houses?

227
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:32.696
Hey, are these all true?

228
00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:35.196
How many buildings are there?

229
00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:42.596
I heard that, Vice-President, you look at ancient works of art.
Extraordinary vision

230
00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:45.996
How can I have any vision?

231
00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:49.829
(Cha Wanji, deputy director of the Supreme People's Procuratorate)
When I was a judge and prosecutor

232
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:51.662
Many tomb robbers have been arrested

233
00:15:51.662 --> 00:15:53.429
I also learned some superficial knowledge from this

234
00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:54.562
It's just a subtle impression

235
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:59.296
Just learn some relevant knowledge

236
00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:01.229
when i'm doing business

237
00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:04.896
occasionally encountered
Debtors who use antiques to pay off debts

238
00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.233
Can you help me determine it?

239
00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:14.666
This…

240
00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.833
Although I accepted this artwork

241
00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:18.699
But this is not Goryeo celadon either

242
00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:20.666
Looks like a chamber pot

243
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:22.099
This…

244
00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:25.126
(Note: Famous porcelain during the Joseon Dynasty)
Is it the Moon Pot?

245
00:16:25.127 --> 00:16:27.160
Moon pot?

246
00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:28.128
Is this precious?

247
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:30.729
Needless to say

248
00:16:32.327 --> 00:16:38.927
Although it has not been designated as a national treasure or treasure

249
00:16:38.927 --> 00:16:41.194
But in the world of ancient art

250
00:16:41.194 --> 00:16:45.227
This is porcelain considered a treasure

251
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.327
Really?

252
00:16:48.327 --> 00:16:50.927
It seems that this porcelain pot has finally met its owner.

253
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.560
what

254
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.994
A layman like me

255
00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:57.427
I would just think it was a chamber pot

256
00:16:57.427 --> 00:16:59.160
It would be too unlucky for it to meet me.

257
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.860
Whether it is a person or an object

258
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.294
You have to meet someone who understands you
to reflect its value

259
00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:08.027
are you serious

260
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.394
I'm so lucky I didn't receive this kind of ancient art.

261
00:17:10.394 --> 00:17:12.627
I'll trouble you to help me with the inspection later.

262
00:17:13.894 --> 00:17:16.694
it's my pleasure

263
00:17:16.694 --> 00:17:18.960
Come and have a drink

264
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.027
OK

265
00:17:42.264 --> 00:17:44.031
20% more than last time

266
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:45.164
You want to make a lot of money

267
00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:49.564
The one who makes the big money should be Chairman Yoo Young-pil, right?

268
00:17:49.564 --> 00:17:51.364
Aren’t you opening more and more rooms?

269
00:17:52.331 --> 00:17:55.364
Protection fees and management fees

270
00:17:55.364 --> 00:17:57.331
There are many places to spend money

271
00:17:58.498 --> 00:18:00.064
If the police officer in charge hadn't been replaced

272
00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.698
Just pay the contract fee and monthly salary once

273
00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:07.364
But recently the police officer in charge keeps changing.
I paid several times the contract fee

274
00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:11.231
I think even the owner of a professional baseball team
Running a football team is easier than me

275
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.980
Stop pretending to be poor

276
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.413
Okay, honestly
Opening a casino is easier than selling drugs

277
00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:22.213
Most problems can be solved with money

278
00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:23.446
The fine is not high

279
00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:26.436
What's the matter I asked you to do?

280
00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:27.770
Wu Wanxu?

281
00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:32.203
Since he was assigned to Busan

282
00:18:32.203 --> 00:18:34.136
I just swallowed a lot of money

283
00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:36.270
As long as it is a hotel with an electronic arcade

284
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.336
No matter the size

285
00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:38.903
He squeezed them all

286
00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:45.170
This guy is really better than a black-hearted loan shark.
Even more hateful

287
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.870
Loan sharks at least
And borrow money from people

288
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.270
This guy didn't even invest half a dime

289
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.603
Just rob everywhere

290
00:18:51.603 --> 00:18:54.636
Is there any chance of catching him and raiding him?

291
00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:56.470
We're investigating behind his back
I also feel frightened

292
00:18:56.694 --> 00:18:58.794
This guy always has a gun on him

293
00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:00.228
Unless he hands over the gun

294
00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:01.896
Otherwise, it would be impossible to touch him.

295
00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:07.795
Then you have to make him hand over the gun.

296
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:12.224
(report letter)

297
00:19:12.225 --> 00:19:14.392
Although not named

298
00:19:14.392 --> 00:19:17.159
But this seems to be from Busan
Industry report letter

299
00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:20.492
Where is the Busan branch?

300
00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.559
It seems they don't know about this yet

301
00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:23.892
Do you want to tell them?

302
00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:29.616
(report letter)
No need

303
00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.689
We received a report

304
00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:39.289
So I have submitted it to the minister

305
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:41.956
People say that a dog is abandoned by its owner

306
00:19:41.956 --> 00:19:44.523
The master won't give you food

307
00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:47.589
I have to find a way out.

308
00:19:48.089 --> 00:19:49.623
I think so

309
00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:52.856
But what if the dog bites a passer-by?

310
00:19:52.856 --> 00:19:54.989
The master should be scolded for this.

311
00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:58.800
Use your position to threaten

312
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.867
There is also the crime of accepting bribes

313
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.467
These penalties are not light

314
00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.233
If you are dismissed
I won’t be able to get retirement annuity in the future.

315
00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:07.100
So you want me to leave on my own?

316
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.667
I heard your father is not in good health

317
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.967
You take this opportunity to go back and take care of your father

318
00:20:11.967 --> 00:20:13.600
Do your best to be filial

319
00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:16.833
If you decide

320
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:19.533
I will ask the minister to deal with you leniently.

321
00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.600
I'll give you three days to think about it

322
00:20:26.824 --> 00:20:28.557
Cui Zhexiong

323
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.200
I've already apologized to you

324
00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:36.075
I treat you like a young master
Served obediently

325
00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:39.675
Aren't you satisfied with this?

326
00:20:39.675 --> 00:20:41.208
I treat you as my master

327
00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.108
Do you think you are really the master?

328
00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:49.175
Hello Wu Wanxu

329
00:20:49.175 --> 00:20:51.175
You are still the same no older or younger

330
00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:59.333
I regard you as my master's son
Only you can have this kind of treatment

331
00:20:59.334 --> 00:21:02.634
If not, I would call you a prosecutor
Or what identity?

332
00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.734
I will tie a dog leash around your neck

333
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.000
I advise you...

334
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.067
Better not mess with me

335
00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:12.634
Although you can't do it

336
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.667
The minister seems to trust you very much

337
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:20.634
But if you are sued
Do you still dare to say such things?

338
00:21:20.634 --> 00:21:25.134
Hey, you dead mole

339
00:21:26.022 --> 00:21:30.422
Since your handle
From the moment it fell into my hands

340
00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.322
until death
You can't escape my grasp

341
00:21:32.322 --> 00:21:36.122
You can't beat me

342
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:37.922
do you know why

343
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:42.622
You've ever pushed someone's head into the water
Until the other person dies?

344
00:21:43.489 --> 00:21:47.022
Have you ever shot someone through the heart?

345
00:21:47.022 --> 00:21:49.522
I have done these things for my country
Just got to this point

346
00:21:49.522 --> 00:21:53.256
It's not like you just memorize the laws and get to the top in one step.

347
00:21:53.256 --> 00:21:55.589
so

348
00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:58.231
what do you want

349
00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:02.814
Are you threatening me? Are you?

350
00:22:04.132 --> 00:22:05.665
Threat?

351
00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:11.832
It seems you have a weakness worthy of threat.

352
00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.532
For example

353
00:22:14.532 --> 00:22:16.532
after killing

354
00:22:16.532 --> 00:22:18.165
A friend goes to jail on your behalf...

355
00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.965
Try saying another sentence

356
00:22:23.965 --> 00:22:28.465
Or the most important witness was killed.

357
00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:30.165
Still the person closest to you

358
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.910
Actually…

359
00:22:43.243 --> 00:22:45.543
there are other things

360
00:22:47.243 --> 00:22:48.943
But it would hurt if you knew

361
00:22:48.943 --> 00:22:50.743
And it will hurt badly

362
00:22:52.643 --> 00:22:55.143
each of us

363
00:22:55.143 --> 00:23:00.410
deep inside
There is a Pandora's box that cannot be opened.

364
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.743
It's in the deepest corner of my heart

365
00:23:02.743 --> 00:23:04.977
Whether it’s me or you Choi Cheol-woong

366
00:23:04.977 --> 00:23:07.110
Or both the minister and his wife are the same

367
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:11.422
if even so
You still want to leave me behind

368
00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:13.722
I will open this Pandora's box

369
00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:17.889
It will consume us all

370
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:20.222
If I leave alone

371
00:23:20.222 --> 00:23:22.056
It's too lonely, right?

372
00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:26.822
So Prosecutor Choi

373
00:23:28.327 --> 00:23:30.527
Let's keep our differences

374
00:23:32.735 --> 00:23:34.368
acknowledge the other person’s existence

375
00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:36.001
Let's live in harmony together

376
00:23:36.968 --> 00:23:41.301
Stress is bad for your health, you know that, right?

377
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.894
Team Leader Wu

378
00:24:01.061 --> 00:24:03.494
When did you come to Seoul?

379
00:24:03.494 --> 00:24:04.694
How are you doing lately?

380
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:07.028
Cui Tefu and I have something to discuss.

381
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.428
That's why I came to see him

382
00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:11.928
Really?

383
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:14.094
Let's have a drink together before we go

384
00:24:14.094 --> 00:24:16.528
No, it doesn't matter

385
00:24:16.528 --> 00:24:19.428
I also have something to talk to you about

386
00:24:19.428 --> 00:24:21.294
are you free tomorrow

387
00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:29.268
What happened?

388
00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:38.068
Mom, between you and Wu Wanxu
Could it be involved?

389
00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:48.268
That's right, the dinner party where you and Qin Yanxi met

390
00:24:49.201 --> 00:24:51.168
It is indeed related to Team Leader Wu

391
00:24:51.168 --> 00:24:53.001
I asked him to arrange it

392
00:24:53.468 --> 00:24:55.201
Don't blame mom

393
00:24:55.201 --> 00:24:57.468
I did it for you

394
00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:00.980
That's not it. Have you ever...

395
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.073
What's going on

396
00:25:04.173 --> 00:25:05.573
What's wrong

397
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.106
Forget it

398
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.940
(Restaurant rice soup)

399
00:25:29.006 --> 00:25:30.573
What's wrong with you

400
00:25:52.647 --> 00:25:54.381
I think a lot

401
00:25:55.506 --> 00:25:58.339
You go to jail instead of Tetsuo

402
00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:01.973
And my uncle's death
Things related to Tetsuo’s family

403
00:26:01.973 --> 00:26:03.773
I didn't confirm

404
00:26:03.773 --> 00:26:06.173
but i believe you

405
00:26:07.973 --> 00:26:09.106
But you'd better stop

406
00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:12.172
why

407
00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:14.872
Things can't be restored to their original state anyway.

408
00:26:14.872 --> 00:26:17.739
The dead uncle cannot be resurrected

409
00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:20.772
You will not be compensated for your unjust imprisonment.

410
00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:23.206
The most important thing is

411
00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:24.839
I don't want to lose you again

412
00:26:25.406 --> 00:26:28.072
Do you think I'm hitting a rock with an egg?

413
00:26:28.072 --> 00:26:28.939
No chance at all?

414
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:30.872
Even if it is 100% successful

415
00:26:30.872 --> 00:26:32.606
I also hope you don't do this

416
00:26:32.878 --> 00:26:35.511
What can be done to restore the original state?

417
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:39.078
Tetsuo or Tetsuo's family members are dead or in jail
Is this considered restoration to the original state?

418
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:52.744
Are you worried about Tetsuo?

419
00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:54.511
Really?

420
00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:55.644
what did you say

421
00:26:55.644 --> 00:26:57.278
i can understand

422
00:26:57.278 --> 00:27:01.111
I also know that Tetsuo likes you very much
He also helped you a lot

423
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:03.244
Li Douxue

424
00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:04.911
you really are...

425
00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:17.551
Okay, even if you really get your wish for revenge

426
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:20.884
But your hands will be stained with blood
what should you do

427
00:27:20.884 --> 00:27:23.151
I see this in my eyes next to you
How should I hold on?

428
00:27:23.817 --> 00:27:27.017
The day you were covered in blood

429
00:27:27.017 --> 00:27:29.184
Have you forgotten what I said?

430
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.417
Have you forgotten the promise you made to me?

431
00:27:35.117 --> 00:27:37.050
Let's break up

432
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.117
Seeing you injured and bleeding like this

433
00:27:42.117 --> 00:27:44.017
And he looks like he's beating someone with his hands

434
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.384
Want me to continue watching

435
00:27:48.503 --> 00:27:49.903
i can't do it

436
00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:52.836
Dingchen, please don’t give up on me

437
00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:57.370
I won't be a gangster anymore

438
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.436
I will find a legitimate job and life

439
00:28:01.103 --> 00:28:02.836
I can't live without you

440
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.970
Do you want things to go back to the way they were?

441
00:28:10.103 --> 00:28:12.703
if you want to do that

442
00:28:12.703 --> 00:28:14.270
Just go back to the you you were then

443
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.416
The one who said he loves me

444
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.616
You who said he was willing to give up everything for me

445
00:28:48.175 --> 00:28:50.608
What Dingchen said is correct.

446
00:28:51.868 --> 00:28:53.701
she's not wrong

447
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:55.268
Dingchen and I are both right

448
00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:59.101
It's those guys who are wrong

449
00:29:00.568 --> 00:29:02.034
so what are you going to do

450
00:29:17.097 --> 00:29:18.730
I am loyal to you

451
00:29:19.197 --> 00:29:23.630
Although I understand Prosecutor Choi
Have an old grudge against me

452
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.030
It is precisely because of this

453
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.364
I serve the three of you more sincerely

454
00:29:28.397 --> 00:29:30.464
Yes

455
00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:33.464
I'm always grateful to you

456
00:29:33.464 --> 00:29:35.497
However

457
00:29:35.497 --> 00:29:41.764
Tetsuo seems to be concerned about his past entanglement with you.
Hard to let go

458
00:29:43.003 --> 00:29:48.070
So do you want me to resign?

459
00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.170
I saw the picture you were taken

460
00:29:59.284 --> 00:30:01.550
That thing seems to be your fault

461
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.984
You have been transferred because of this matter

462
00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:06.750
Why did you make the same mistake again?

463
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.017
What about you, madam?

464
00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:13.684
what does this mean

465
00:30:13.684 --> 00:30:15.817
Not only Prosecutor Choi

466
00:30:15.817 --> 00:30:20.284
Madam, when did you start
What about excluding me?

467
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.784
Are you referring to abandoning West Coast development?

468
00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:27.584
I've already explained it to you, right?

469
00:30:27.584 --> 00:30:29.917
No, you have no explanation

470
00:30:32.878 --> 00:30:36.078
You didn’t tell me because President Qin Manchul
That's what the proposed investment case does

471
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:43.011
But I can also understand

472
00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:45.411
After all, this is an opportunity to make a lot of money.
You don't want to share

473
00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:49.411
it's human nature

474
00:30:49.411 --> 00:30:54.244
So I also follow the human nature of survival
Came to see Madam

475
00:30:55.698 --> 00:30:57.898
Although I don’t want this day to come either

476
00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:09.098
The recipient is the Supreme Prosecutor's Office

477
00:31:09.098 --> 00:31:11.798
Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong of the Criminal Division 2

478
00:31:23.003 --> 00:31:24.603
Tetsuo

479
00:31:24.603 --> 00:31:26.669
I am Uncle Zhong Hao

480
00:31:27.103 --> 00:31:32.403
I originally thought I would never have a chance in this life
write this letter

481
00:31:32.403 --> 00:31:37.169
I thought you read this letter
How much of a blow will it be?

482
00:31:37.169 --> 00:31:40.403
Uncle feels bad

483
00:31:40.403 --> 00:31:48.469
but to right all wrongs

484
00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:51.469
My uncle endured his grief and wrote this letter

485
00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:55.525
I'll just tell you the conclusion.

486
00:31:55.525 --> 00:32:00.691
Your parents are Master Choi Young-sik
and Mrs. Jiang Ruzhen

487
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.800
But your biological father is me, Lee Jong-ho

488
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.633
Your biological mother is Douxue’s mother Xu Guili

489
00:32:26.854 --> 00:32:28.588
I'm sorry for scaring you.

490
00:32:31.854 --> 00:32:36.454
Where did you go to forge such a letter?
come threaten me

491
00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:39.188
This is me in the pocket of dead Lee Jong-ho
found letter

492
00:32:40.188 --> 00:32:43.088
The person who wants to threaten you is Lee Jong-ho

493
00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:46.988
So I had to get rid of him for you.

494
00:32:50.754 --> 00:32:52.354
Stop talking nonsense

495
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.090
You thought you did this

496
00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.523
Will the minister let you go?

497
00:33:03.123 --> 00:33:04.890
That's a copy

498
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.534
And the minister won’t let it go

499
00:33:09.534 --> 00:33:13.167
It's probably not me, it's the lady, right?

500
00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:18.667
Technology has advanced very much recently

501
00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:21.334
I don’t know if you have seen it in the news

502
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.503
There is a test called genetic testing

503
00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:28.137
The results are very accurate

504
00:33:29.003 --> 00:33:33.970
I'll take the minister's and Prosecutor Choi's hair
Got a genetic test

505
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.170
You see

506
00:33:36.603 --> 00:33:39.170
Two people…

507
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.603
Not a parent-child relationship

508
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.770
It's really surprising

509
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.403
I didn’t just go to Lishui

510
00:33:51.403 --> 00:33:53.603
I also went to your hometown to do some research.

511
00:33:53.603 --> 00:33:56.737
But your preparations are impeccable

512
00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:04.290
What do you want

513
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.090
Fortunately, I am still loyal to the minister.

514
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.356
Please let me return to my original position
Minister's side

515
00:34:11.356 --> 00:34:12.623
Is that enough?

516
00:34:12.623 --> 00:34:14.023
How is it possible

517
00:34:14.023 --> 00:34:16.390
That was my seat

518
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.190
Give me 30% of your and President Geum Man-cheol’s
income shares

519
00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:22.244
what

520
00:34:22.244 --> 00:34:24.744
Share it with me and you'll still make money, right?

521
00:34:26.744 --> 00:34:30.344
If the minister knew
Everything will be in vain

522
00:34:32.877 --> 00:34:36.244
I will be like before

523
00:34:36.244 --> 00:34:39.177
Help the three of you wholeheartedly

524
00:34:41.177 --> 00:34:45.944
These things will never appear again
in front of the world

525
00:34:46.677 --> 00:34:49.811
Then please contact me again

526
00:34:52.877 --> 00:34:54.177
good

527
00:34:56.925 --> 00:34:58.959
As long as you keep the promise

528
00:34:58.959 --> 00:35:03.559
Give me the letter and the inspection report

529
00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:08.559
What's the problem

530
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.092
madam

531
00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:19.525
I have to be there for you and the minister.
will feel happy

532
00:35:20.433 --> 00:35:21.933
let me stay with you

533
00:35:21.933 --> 00:35:25.499
I will never betray you and the minister

534
00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:29.433
Don't you know this yet?

535
00:35:39.766 --> 00:35:41.899
By the way…

536
00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:45.899
In fact, I was shocked at first

537
00:35:47.214 --> 00:35:49.714
How did you plan all this?

538
00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:54.282
How can you be so calm
Tell those lies

539
00:35:56.715 --> 00:35:59.482
But after a while, I think about it again

540
00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:03.315
you are a respectable person

541
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.406
Targeting the most dangerous man in the Republic of Korea

542
00:36:07.406 --> 00:36:10.173
Pull out such a scam

543
00:36:10.173 --> 00:36:11.806
Don't you think it's amazing?

544
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.773
I will stand with you

545
00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:20.840
let me stay by your side

546
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.406
your life…

547
00:36:23.406 --> 00:36:25.773
There will definitely be a happy ending

548
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.903
i assure you

549
00:36:38.315 --> 00:36:41.248
The report you uploaded about Team Leader Wu
I watched

550
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:44.848
He actually got into that kind of trouble again

551
00:36:44.848 --> 00:36:46.315
Really

552
00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:49.781
Should he let him go?

553
00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:50.415
This…

554
00:36:50.415 --> 00:36:52.181
Don't do this

555
00:36:53.515 --> 00:36:54.848
That level of error

556
00:36:54.848 --> 00:36:56.715
Anyone can commit it

557
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:59.048
Fixed salary for civil servants

558
00:36:59.048 --> 00:37:02.115
His father is seriously ill again

559
00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:03.848
He probably needs money very much

560
00:37:05.597 --> 00:37:07.597
Think about Team Leader Wu

561
00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:11.698
for you these years
and things to do for our family.

562
00:37:11.698 --> 00:37:13.898
We can't be too mean

563
00:37:14.998 --> 00:37:16.231
Isn't it?

564
00:37:16.864 --> 00:37:18.598
You privately...

565
00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:20.298
Have you met Team Leader Wu?

566
00:37:21.098 --> 00:37:22.931
No

567
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:26.064
I just saw Tetsuo and Team Leader Wu meeting

568
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.540
Dad…

569
00:37:33.373 --> 00:37:35.306
I think too

570
00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:38.506
It seems too heartless to fire Team Leader Wu like this.

571
00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:42.062
You'd better teach him a lesson

572
00:37:42.062 --> 00:37:44.962
It would be better to ask him not to do it again next time

573
00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.296
Really?

574
00:37:46.296 --> 00:37:48.929
Actually, I don’t feel very good either.

575
00:37:48.929 --> 00:37:50.296
Then…

576
00:37:50.296 --> 00:37:53.029
I'll do what you said and talk to him carefully.

577
00:37:53.796 --> 00:37:55.296
Come, we are a family of three

578
00:37:55.296 --> 00:37:57.029
Let's have another drink

579
00:38:18.081 --> 00:38:20.514
Long time no see, Special Assistant

580
00:38:20.514 --> 00:38:22.948
thank you for having me back

581
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:35.212
Just tell me if you're short of money

582
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.778
Don't do that shameful thing

583
00:38:38.078 --> 00:38:40.445
I don't have the face to see you. I won't...

584
00:38:40.445 --> 00:38:42.212
Don't do that kind of thing again

585
00:38:42.212 --> 00:38:43.578
accept

586
00:38:45.045 --> 00:38:46.178
It doesn't matter

587
00:38:46.178 --> 00:38:47.445
Take it quickly

588
00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:49.345
I know your dad had surgery

589
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.240
This is what I plan to give you when you retire

590
00:39:08.964 --> 00:39:10.231
what

591
00:39:10.231 --> 00:39:11.964
is that true

592
00:39:13.298 --> 00:39:16.164
Has he returned to Seoul?

593
00:39:17.464 --> 00:39:19.798
Hey, did you really report it?

594
00:39:19.798 --> 00:39:23.298
I also attached the photos and sent them.

595
00:39:23.298 --> 00:39:24.964
I don't understand either

596
00:39:26.878 --> 00:39:27.945
This way…

597
00:39:27.946 --> 00:39:29.646
Can't we catch that guy?

598
00:39:31.431 --> 00:39:33.364
Yes

599
00:39:35.026 --> 00:39:37.893
We think too simply

600
00:39:40.093 --> 00:39:41.559
Obviously a gangster

601
00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:43.393
Still believe there is justice in this world

602
00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:49.693
This place is full of Chow Yun-fat and Leslie Cheung.

603
00:39:50.059 --> 00:39:53.493
If I could also post a few pictures of my favorite Joey Wong...

604
00:39:53.493 --> 00:39:55.693
Wang Zuxian doesn’t like you

605
00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.893
i know

606
00:39:58.493 --> 00:39:59.859
aunt

607
00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:04.426
Why are you so surprised?

608
00:40:04.426 --> 00:40:06.159
Can't I come here?

609
00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:07.626
Hello, Boss Wu

610
00:40:07.626 --> 00:40:09.259
long time no see

611
00:40:09.693 --> 00:40:11.626
Aren’t you cutting off my ties with me?

612
00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:14.726
Even if fate is broken

613
00:40:14.726 --> 00:40:16.493
I can at least be considered a guest.

614
00:40:17.425 --> 00:40:18.692
Hey, you girl

615
00:40:18.692 --> 00:40:20.858
Have we severed ties too?

616
00:40:20.858 --> 00:40:24.158
Auntie is here. At least pour me some juice.
Entertain

617
00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:28.258
What's going on with you two?

618
00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:31.458
What are you in a hurry for?

619
00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:33.525
Let me moisturize my throat first.

620
00:40:37.558 --> 00:40:39.725
I heard that Hong Kong movies are very profitable

621
00:40:39.725 --> 00:40:41.592
More than good

622
00:40:41.592 --> 00:40:45.525
It’s so profitable

623
00:40:45.525 --> 00:40:47.925
The video copyright income is also very good

624
00:40:48.892 --> 00:40:50.192
How

625
00:40:50.192 --> 00:40:54.025
You don’t want to get a share of the pie, do you?

626
00:40:54.925 --> 00:40:58.025
Please be quiet

627
00:40:58.025 --> 00:40:59.892
Or I'll tear your mouth apart

628
00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:08.885
Can you take a breath now?

629
00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:10.751
It's just the beginning

630
00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:11.918
And…

631
00:41:11.918 --> 00:41:14.085
The funds are all provided by loans.

632
00:41:14.585 --> 00:41:16.951
before i came here

633
00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:19.551
I went to that film school to watch it.

634
00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:23.785
I heard how many movies you chose?
A script by a director born there

635
00:41:24.518 --> 00:41:27.251
What is that..."marriage story"?

636
00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:31.085
The script looks interesting

637
00:41:31.085 --> 00:41:34.985
It tastes like the first time I eat food

638
00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:36.718
I read it to her

639
00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.507
So, are you planning to invest?

640
00:41:38.507 --> 00:41:42.307
No, I just want to say that your vision is very accurate.

641
00:41:42.307 --> 00:41:44.440
Interested in that college

642
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.073
So are you here to praise me?

643
00:41:46.073 --> 00:41:47.107
Just come now

644
00:41:47.107 --> 00:41:50.440
No matter what, I am also your adoptive mother

645
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.107
Will I only come to praise you?

646
00:41:52.107 --> 00:41:53.873
Of course I'll give you a prize

647
00:41:53.873 --> 00:41:54.973
what are you doing

648
00:41:54.973 --> 00:41:56.273
Yes

649
00:41:58.773 --> 00:42:00.140
Come

650
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.607
Boss Wu Dingchen, please accept the award

651
00:42:06.542 --> 00:42:07.975
what is this

652
00:42:07.976 --> 00:42:10.676
Shares of our South Road Film Company

653
00:42:10.676 --> 00:42:12.343
what

654
00:42:12.976 --> 00:42:15.376
(Nandao Film Share Transfer and Cooperation Agreement)
I remember I have no shares

655
00:42:15.376 --> 00:42:16.809
Yes

656
00:42:16.809 --> 00:42:19.443
But…

657
00:42:19.443 --> 00:42:21.843
We decided to put our shares

658
00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:23.709
Give them all to you

659
00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:27.309
Contains cinema
Give it all to you, 100%

660
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:31.076
Oh my God, what is going on?

661
00:42:31.076 --> 00:42:33.043
(Nandao Film Share Transfer and Cooperation Agreement)
Auntie, are you really...

662
00:42:33.043 --> 00:42:35.776
Do you want to hand over the film company to Dingchen?

663
00:42:40.612 --> 00:42:42.278
What the hell are you planning?

664
00:42:42.279 --> 00:42:43.779
Ghost idea

665
00:42:47.846 --> 00:42:49.646
yes yes yes

666
00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:52.713
I don't want to work anymore

667
00:42:52.713 --> 00:42:55.846
I want you to spend your old age comfortably

668
00:42:56.479 --> 00:42:58.979
I'm going to have a bowl of cold noodles and then come back

669
00:42:59.847 --> 00:43:01.913
Take your time and watch

670
00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:03.480
Then stamp it

671
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.147
Why is this happening again?

672
00:43:09.147 --> 00:43:12.180
I kicked you out before

673
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.613
It’s not the boss’s intention

674
00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:16.813
She was forced

675
00:43:16.813 --> 00:43:19.513
She felt very sad too

676
00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:21.513
You will know later

677
00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:23.413
What are you doing? Why don't you come out yet?

678
00:43:23.413 --> 00:43:24.613
OK…

679
00:43:24.613 --> 00:43:27.013
I'll go out now

680
00:43:27.013 --> 00:43:28.247
I'm leaving

681
00:43:30.745 --> 00:43:32.445
Dingchen

682
00:43:32.445 --> 00:43:34.879
what's going on

683
00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:37.212
why so

684
00:43:37.779 --> 00:43:39.745
(youth)

685
00:43:44.345 --> 00:43:48.445
Who is this?

686
00:43:48.445 --> 00:43:51.512
I'm still thinking that I can't contact you no matter what

687
00:43:51.512 --> 00:43:53.112
you are still alive

688
00:43:53.112 --> 00:43:55.845
The boss has been looking for you

689
00:43:55.845 --> 00:43:58.445
You don’t have to repay your revenge, but you must repay your kindness.

690
00:43:59.589 --> 00:44:01.523
I brought someone here today

691
00:44:01.523 --> 00:44:04.123
I said I was working for someone, right?

692
00:44:04.123 --> 00:44:05.689
People doing business in Japan

693
00:44:07.123 --> 00:44:08.856
I remember

694
00:44:08.856 --> 00:44:10.423
please come in

695
00:44:16.389 --> 00:44:17.823
My name is Li Hengguo

696
00:44:20.189 --> 00:44:22.123
The person in charge of the branch...

697
00:44:22.784 --> 00:44:27.584
You...you are not with Dingchen...

698
00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:30.984
Yes, I was the one who was going to marry Dingchen.

699
00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:37.850
That woman used tax inspection as a weapon

700
00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.917
come threaten me

701
00:44:39.917 --> 00:44:42.150
That kind of person cannot confront her head-on.

702
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.917
Although I am full of anger

703
00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:46.450
But there's nothing I can do

704
00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:49.792
So that's it

705
00:44:49.793 --> 00:44:52.726
But she still made it through

706
00:44:52.726 --> 00:44:54.426
You don't need to worry too much

707
00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:55.826
she is very smart

708
00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.426
So we can definitely overcome it

709
00:44:57.426 --> 00:44:59.826
Boss, how is your current situation?

710
00:44:59.826 --> 00:45:02.293
Stop talking

711
00:45:02.293 --> 00:45:05.460
If you want to sell a movie, someone will make trouble

712
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.326
Last time…

713
00:45:07.326 --> 00:45:10.426
Some people want to set fire to the cinema

714
00:45:10.426 --> 00:45:13.793
We just feel a little annoyed

715
00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:16.393
I heard they will also release snakes in other cinemas

716
00:45:16.393 --> 00:45:19.460
There are also recently invested theater movies

717
00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.260
The box office is very bad

718
00:45:22.188 --> 00:45:27.221
Boss, can you open the cinema
and the company sold it to me

719
00:45:27.222 --> 00:45:29.122
I will buy it from you at a high price

720
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:36.656
Even if you helped me

721
00:45:36.656 --> 00:45:40.822
Young people can't do it just because they have money
Just say this casually

722
00:45:41.766 --> 00:45:43.432
No matter how hard it is

723
00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:47.267
This is what I'm betting my life on

724
00:45:47.267 --> 00:45:49.233
Please come back

725
00:45:49.233 --> 00:45:50.700
life

726
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.167
Shouldn't it be passed down properly?

727
00:45:52.167 --> 00:45:54.000
Let it bear fruit?

728
00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.367
Can you hand over the company to boss Wu Dingchen?

729
00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:01.800
what

730
00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:09.067
Let's go

731
00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:10.533
Yes

732
00:46:13.852 --> 00:46:16.586
thank you ma'am

733
00:46:16.587 --> 00:46:20.887
I heard that many people are willing to lend your name

734
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.520
Then I can invest now, right?

735
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.753
How much do you plan to invest

736
00:46:28.712 --> 00:46:31.612
Is it okay to invest 5 billion won?

737
00:46:32.712 --> 00:46:34.612
Do you have the means to prepare the money?

738
00:46:35.445 --> 00:46:36.612
Sell stocks bonds

739
00:46:36.612 --> 00:46:39.712
It should be enough to get some more loans.

740
00:46:40.278 --> 00:46:41.612
Very good

741
00:46:41.612 --> 00:46:45.412
I'm going to meet those people anyway
Also need cash

742
00:46:45.412 --> 00:46:48.812
The most important thing is that my wife is my insurance

743
00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:52.607
You bought the insurance very well

744
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:59.912
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

745
00:46:59.912 --> 00:47:02.778
It's nice to be powerful

746
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.612
That Ms. Li

747
00:47:04.612 --> 00:47:07.112
There are three buildings in Jiangnan alone

748
00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:08.678
They are all above five floors.

749
00:47:08.678 --> 00:47:11.178
And in Apgujeong

750
00:47:11.178 --> 00:47:13.245
There is also a parking lot

751
00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:16.459
She bought the original Paris salon

752
00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:20.059
Plus the house they live in

753
00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:21.426
How much do you think it’s worth?

754
00:47:22.259 --> 00:47:26.193
I'm all about real estate
At least more than 10 billion won

755
00:47:27.526 --> 00:47:29.359
She saved a lot of money

756
00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:32.426
What's the use of just having more money?
Such a bad character

757
00:47:36.326 --> 00:47:38.926
I should have slapped her back

758
00:47:39.693 --> 00:47:41.326
what happened?

759
00:47:42.196 --> 00:47:43.429
No, it's okay

760
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:47.263
All in all, it doesn’t look like it’s a small amount of money.

761
00:47:47.263 --> 00:47:48.730
How is it

762
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.830
Is there any way to get her money?
Did you cheat them all?

763
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.497
10 billion all?

764
00:47:53.497 --> 00:47:54.597
Yes

765
00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:55.830
All done at once

766
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.297
It’s not easy to just rely on ordinary real estate, right?

767
00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:00.497
At least like a golf course

768
00:48:00.497 --> 00:48:03.330
Or a hotel, maybe that kind of thing

769
00:48:04.363 --> 00:48:07.463
Hey, just in case you make a mistake

770
00:48:07.463 --> 00:48:09.163
Will our lives be at stake?

771
00:48:09.163 --> 00:48:12.597
Just think this is in Korea
last act

772
00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:13.663
As long as it succeeds

773
00:48:13.663 --> 00:48:14.697
I'll wash all that money away

774
00:48:14.697 --> 00:48:16.263
Send you abroad

775
00:48:17.946 --> 00:48:19.813
That's a good idea

776
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:20.547
I'm leaving

777
00:48:20.547 --> 00:48:21.880
Right

778
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.714
I heard Ma Qingzi say

779
00:48:24.714 --> 00:48:28.914
That lady is making a fortune recently

780
00:48:28.914 --> 00:48:30.847
A big real estate investment

781
00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:34.014
real estate investment

782
00:48:34.014 --> 00:48:34.947
Yeah

783
00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:38.180
I heard that the lady put in a lot of effort

784
00:48:39.094 --> 00:48:41.428
That thing...

785
00:48:41.428 --> 00:48:43.294
Also go and investigate.

786
00:48:49.328 --> 00:48:50.828
Sorry

787
00:48:50.828 --> 00:48:54.161
(Choi Jong-jin, Director of the Ministry of Construction and Housing)
Specific agencies, media and military joint

788
00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:56.161
Request special sale

789
00:48:56.161 --> 00:49:01.261
You also know that the Ministry of Construction
I have said many times that I cannot do that.

790
00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:02.494
Director

791
00:49:02.494 --> 00:49:05.261
This matter has been settled with the Blue House.

792
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:06.961
You should receive a call shortly

793
00:49:06.961 --> 00:49:08.194
is that true

794
00:49:08.194 --> 00:49:13.694
Let people who have contributed to the country buy first

795
00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:15.994
It can also boost morale by the way
Isn't this a good thing?

796
00:49:15.994 --> 00:49:17.494
What about Seoul City?

797
00:49:17.494 --> 00:49:20.094
The city of Seoul will change its stance soon.

798
00:49:21.415 --> 00:49:26.281
And I put a box in your car
ripe apple

799
00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:27.615
Please enjoy

800
00:49:28.915 --> 00:49:30.548
You are so...

801
00:49:31.248 --> 00:49:32.948
Oops

802
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:35.315
President, you are here

803
00:49:35.315 --> 00:49:36.915
lady

804
00:49:36.915 --> 00:49:38.281
You are here

805
00:49:38.281 --> 00:49:39.881
Chief, say hello.

806
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:44.015
This is the Security and Enterprise Department
Minister Huang Zhongcheng’s wife

807
00:49:44.015 --> 00:49:46.181
Sorry didn't recognize you

808
00:50:10.266 --> 00:50:12.799
Have you found your target?

809
00:50:14.025 --> 00:50:19.325
I'll make you eat a construction company

810
00:50:20.063 --> 00:50:21.129
Which room

811
00:50:22.896 --> 00:50:24.329
prosperous construction

812
00:50:24.329 --> 00:50:27.063
Changsheng Construction, ranked 20th in the financial sector

813
00:50:27.063 --> 00:50:31.229
Yes, but you have to give me a bonus when it's done

814
00:50:31.229 --> 00:50:32.429
Okay, you go and try it.

815
00:50:33.429 --> 00:50:34.729
thank you

816
00:50:52.782 --> 00:50:53.848
Hello

817
00:50:55.815 --> 00:50:57.582
Who is this?

818
00:50:58.082 --> 00:51:00.648
I thought you were still in the United States

819
00:51:00.648 --> 00:51:01.815
when did you come back

820
00:51:01.815 --> 00:51:05.015
I've been back for more than a year

821
00:51:05.015 --> 00:51:07.082
There because of the language barrier

822
00:51:07.082 --> 00:51:08.915
I don't even dare to go out

823
00:51:08.915 --> 00:51:12.215
Except for stores opened by Koreans
I can't even buy anything

824
00:51:12.215 --> 00:51:14.948
That kind of life is not for humans to live.

825
00:51:14.948 --> 00:51:18.348
That’s why I ignored my family’s dissuasion

826
00:51:18.348 --> 00:51:19.848
Still back

827
00:51:19.848 --> 00:51:24.182
Oh, so you went back to Wuqiaodong again?

828
00:51:24.182 --> 00:51:25.815
Re-establish the organization

829
00:51:25.815 --> 00:51:27.715
what are you talking about

830
00:51:27.715 --> 00:51:31.382
I have to live on this crutch now

831
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:33.797
Life... of course is sad

832
00:51:35.313 --> 00:51:36.846
then what are you doing

833
00:51:36.847 --> 00:51:41.647
I am currently working in the game industry

834
00:51:42.847 --> 00:51:43.814
Game?

835
00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:45.347
Yes

836
00:51:45.347 --> 00:51:48.347
Maybe my life was not too bad in the past

837
00:51:48.347 --> 00:51:53.814
So I have the opportunity to invest in the younger generations
pachinko casino

838
00:51:53.814 --> 00:51:58.281
Now I live on the money I earned there.

839
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.947
Of course it's legal

840
00:52:03.247 --> 00:52:04.814
Boss Lian

841
00:52:05.102 --> 00:52:07.269
Upgraded

842
00:52:07.269 --> 00:52:08.702
congratulations

843
00:52:08.702 --> 00:52:10.335
you are too polite

844
00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:12.302
But I heard that this part of the industry

845
00:52:12.302 --> 00:52:16.335
It is also managed by your company

846
00:52:16.335 --> 00:52:17.802
Please give me more advice in the future

847
00:52:17.802 --> 00:52:21.602
I have already told my descendants

848
00:52:21.602 --> 00:52:25.502
They want to pay you for physical training every month

849
00:52:25.502 --> 00:52:27.169
Wait until you leave office

850
00:52:27.169 --> 00:52:31.869
Ask them to give you a nice arcade

851
00:52:32.835 --> 00:52:35.335
Even if it's just a polite word

852
00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:37.102
I feel very good after hearing that you are so considerate of me.

853
00:52:37.102 --> 00:52:39.769
what are you talking about

854
00:52:39.769 --> 00:52:41.635
This is definitely not a polite comment

855
00:52:41.635 --> 00:52:45.769
I've already negotiated everything for you, team leader

856
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.369
However

857
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.970
Where is the game arcade?

858
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.203
I want to see it myself

859
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:59.503
Of course

860
00:52:59.503 --> 00:53:01.203
Of course you should go and see

861
00:53:01.203 --> 00:53:02.503
Come... have a drink first

862
00:53:02.503 --> 00:53:04.570
I don't drink

863
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.370
I'll take you to the game arcade in person

864
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:11.337
We can discuss business there

865
00:53:11.337 --> 00:53:13.270
Hey, call the boys in

866
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:18.737
"On the green grassland"

867
00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:19.537
So handsome

868
00:53:19.537 --> 00:53:22.937
"Build a picturesque house"

869
00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:26.771
"I want to be with you, my dear"

870
00:53:26.771 --> 00:53:28.471
"Live a lifetime"

871
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:31.971
Team leader I love you

872
00:53:33.804 --> 00:53:35.604
So good

873
00:53:36.537 --> 00:53:38.637
thank you all

874
00:53:38.637 --> 00:53:40.871
Handsome guy, why don't you sing a song too?

875
00:53:40.871 --> 00:53:42.971
Handsome guy, just have a drink

876
00:53:42.971 --> 00:53:44.271
No need
Just have a drink

877
00:53:44.271 --> 00:53:45.237
No need

878
00:53:45.237 --> 00:53:47.171
I'll pour it for you

879
00:53:50.798 --> 00:53:52.298
Come team leader

880
00:53:52.298 --> 00:53:56.998
Come and have a drink

881
00:53:56.998 --> 00:53:58.031
I don't drink

882
00:53:58.031 --> 00:53:59.864
of course i know

883
00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:02.231
This is water water

884
00:54:02.564 --> 00:54:03.798
Come

885
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:06.398
It doesn't matter

886
00:54:06.864 --> 00:54:09.464
for our loyalty

887
00:54:09.464 --> 00:54:11.564
Cheers

888
00:54:11.564 --> 00:54:13.298
thank you

889
00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.254
good

890
00:54:22.953 --> 00:54:24.753
water

891
00:54:29.782 --> 00:54:31.148
Are you awake?

892
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.730
who are you

893
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.197
We are the owners of the arcade

894
00:54:37.197 --> 00:54:38.563
Don't you want to see the arcade?

895
00:54:38.563 --> 00:54:40.197
This is our game room

896
00:54:41.197 --> 00:54:43.763
You little hooligans

897
00:54:43.763 --> 00:54:46.363
Where is Lian Guangzhuo?

898
00:54:46.363 --> 00:54:48.597
Brother Guangzhuo should go hangover.

899
00:55:02.579 --> 00:55:03.779
Have you waited for a long time?

900
00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:06.246
so cold

901
00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:09.912
When it’s chilly

902
00:55:09.912 --> 00:55:11.879
Eating fish plate with soju is the best, right?

903
00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:21.779
It's great to have a fish plate date so late at night.

904
00:55:24.046 --> 00:55:25.779
Dou learns from his father

905
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:32.876
Are you afraid that Douxue will go to jail for you?
be known

906
00:55:32.876 --> 00:55:34.210
Did he just kill Dou Xue's father?

907
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.710
Don't you know who I am?

908
00:55:43.543 --> 00:55:45.143
i know

909
00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.976
you are a civil servant

910
00:55:51.143 --> 00:55:52.776
Civil servants who lynch people

911
00:55:52.776 --> 00:55:54.643
Civil servants who can squander money

912
00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:56.310
civil servant who knows how to kill

913
00:55:57.923 --> 00:55:59.190
Did I say something wrong?

914
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.948
What do you want?

915
00:56:07.048 --> 00:56:10.582
Tell the truth and you can make it out alive

916
00:56:10.582 --> 00:56:12.015
Otherwise, prepare to die

917
00:56:15.852 --> 00:56:18.785
Do you know Lee Jong-ho who lives in the south of the city?

918
00:56:18.785 --> 00:56:22.152
It was you who instigated Li Yongde
Hit him with a truck

919
00:56:22.952 --> 00:56:24.085
I don't know

920
00:56:24.085 --> 00:56:25.452
It’s really…

921
00:56:27.485 --> 00:56:28.685
bring people

922
00:56:29.585 --> 00:56:30.785
bring people
Yes

923
00:56:45.837 --> 00:56:47.071
Optimistic

924
00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:48.637
Is it this guy?

925
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:56.037
Right…

926
00:56:56.037 --> 00:56:57.771
It's this guy

927
00:56:57.771 --> 00:57:00.004
He was the one who instigated me. This is the guy.

928
00:57:02.904 --> 00:57:04.704
what are you talking nonsense

929
00:57:05.804 --> 00:57:06.837
who are you

930
00:57:06.837 --> 00:57:08.771
You wanted me to hit him

931
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:10.304
He also gave me 30 million won

932
00:57:11.571 --> 00:57:12.871
I haven't done anything like that

933
00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:19.291
Li Yongde recognizes you

934
00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:21.891
But you don't recognize your own comrades

935
00:57:23.224 --> 00:57:24.258
take him away

936
00:57:26.458 --> 00:57:27.758
Come here, brat

937
00:57:32.924 --> 00:57:34.058
Say it quickly

938
00:57:34.558 --> 00:57:35.924
Are you going to say that again?

939
00:57:35.924 --> 00:57:37.524
Am I right?

940
00:57:38.424 --> 00:57:42.291
Douxue took the crime of murder for you and went to jail.

941
00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:43.658
i know

942
00:57:45.691 --> 00:57:47.658
It should be you and your parents

943
00:57:47.658 --> 00:57:49.924
I went to ask Douxue’s father

944
00:57:51.555 --> 00:57:52.955
Because he is a servant of your family

945
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:58.897
Hey, are you going too far?

946
00:58:00.031 --> 00:58:01.631
Didn't I say it wasn't like that?

947
00:58:03.097 --> 00:58:05.364
How is it

948
00:58:05.364 --> 00:58:07.264
What should I do so that you will believe me?

949
00:58:08.479 --> 00:58:09.779
Want me to cut my belly open

950
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.447
Let you take a look inside?

951
00:58:11.448 --> 00:58:12.748
Say it quickly

952
00:58:15.864 --> 00:58:18.764
If you have a brain, think about it

953
00:58:20.415 --> 00:58:22.715
If I don't say you will kill me

954
00:58:22.715 --> 00:58:25.081
Even if I tell you, you will kill me

955
00:58:25.081 --> 00:58:26.715
You waste

956
00:58:26.715 --> 00:58:27.781
Abominable

957
00:58:35.915 --> 00:58:37.781
The same goes for fighting over studies

958
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:40.581
It’s also about Dou Xue’s father
Even if the deceased cannot argue

959
00:58:40.581 --> 00:58:42.281
Are you really...

960
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:44.081
This really can't be done

961
00:58:44.837 --> 00:58:46.170
No

962
00:58:47.662 --> 00:58:50.262
Not really

963
00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:53.762
Dingchen, let’s not talk about this.

964
00:58:53.762 --> 00:58:54.962
Let’s talk about something else

965
00:58:56.729 --> 00:58:58.262
You…

966
00:58:59.367 --> 00:59:01.400
If Douxue is still alive

967
00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:05.559
If Douxue’s father is still alive
Can you say it in front of him?

968
00:59:15.587 --> 00:59:17.487
you guy

969
00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.120
Still alive

970
00:59:20.487 --> 00:59:21.753
Hello

971
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.320
I'm still wondering who it is...

972
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.087
Li Douxue

973
00:59:34.087 --> 00:59:36.087
you are still alive

974
00:59:36.087 --> 00:59:38.287
Your intuition has become worse?

975
00:59:45.532 --> 00:59:47.999
What does it feel like to die by your own gun?

976
00:59:51.232 --> 00:59:53.399
Yes

977
00:59:53.399 --> 00:59:55.599
I can speak

978
00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:57.299
I can say "no" to his face

979
00:59:57.299 --> 01:00:00.199
Even if I have to go to the underworld to see them two

980
01:00:00.199 --> 01:00:02.599
I can also say "no" in front of them

981
01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:15.232
Wu Wanxu, you have committed too many crimes

982
01:00:15.233 --> 01:00:17.866
The law alone is not enough to make you pay the price

983
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:34.199
"Can I come back to you again?"

984
01:00:34.199 --> 01:00:37.133
"trembling eyes"

985
01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.833
"Looks more sad"

986
01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:47.699
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

987
01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:50.899
"your name"

988
01:00:50.899 --> 01:00:53.899
(Oasis)

989
01:00:54.219 --> 01:00:55.019
Destroy them of course

990
01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.386
Don't let them unite

991
01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.053
Bingo

992
01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.519
Wu Wanxu threatened me

993
01:00:58.519 --> 01:00:59.819
right here

994
01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.319
On the information in the secret fund account book

995
01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:02.253
also has your name

996
01:01:02.253 --> 01:01:03.086
Mom said it

997
01:01:03.086 --> 01:01:04.019
Uncle Zhong Hao

998
01:01:04.019 --> 01:01:05.819
Mom, I am Douxue

999
01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:07.053
your son

1000
01:01:07.053 --> 01:01:09.186
I really hope it's not you

1001
01:01:10.653 --> 01:01:11.619
Hey brat

1002
01:01:11.619 --> 01:01:14.353
The one we want to deceive is the Ministry of Security and Enterprise
minister's wife

1003
01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:15.653
Do you want to send the information?

1004
01:01:15.653 --> 01:01:18.486
Send a copy first and let him return to Seoul.

1005
01:01:18.486 --> 01:01:21.219
The person who was responsible for monitoring Representative Wu not long ago

1006
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.153
told me an interesting thing

1007
01:01:23.153 --> 01:01:26.053
A man appeared near Representative Wu’s house
