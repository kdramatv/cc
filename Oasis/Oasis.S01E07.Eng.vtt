00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.367
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.600
(Seasoning, sesame oil, chili powder)

3
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
I need someone to follow a guy.

4
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.000
who do you want to follow

5
00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.433
Although Douxue will take action against gangsters

6
00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.467
But he won't bully innocent people

7
00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.267
His name is…

8
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.500
Li Douxue

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.567
Usually stalking someone…

10
00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.000
All for some purpose

11
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.667
If you tell me your purpose first

12
00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.167
things might go more smoothly

13
00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.067
(Episode 7)
You said you have the right to stay in Mingdangdong Dogeng

14
00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.067
Are there 100 places?

15
00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.533
It's true

16
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.600
I heard that the occupancy rights are 20 square meters.

17
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.167
Previously it cost less than 3 million won
can buy it

18
00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.067
Now it has risen to 40 to 50 million won.

19
00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.033
Oh my god

20
00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:26.467
first time i saw
A place where the price is so ridiculously high

21
00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:27.300
What right of occupancy?

22
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.733
This is not an ordinary apartment building right of occupancy

23
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.067
It is the right to occupy the apartment released during the city update.

24
00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:35.633
I heard the competition is very fierce

25
00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:39.600
Whether it is Cheong Wa Dae or relevant government departments,
Those guys from the city government

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.133
All before the news comes out

27
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.767
Just mobilize all your relatives
I'm snapping up the land over there.

28
00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.700
So how is the intelligence possible?
Has it reached us?

29
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.267
It's just like war

30
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.566
Take good care and don't let the deadbeat come back.

31
00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.067
It must never happen again
The bloody conflict just now

32
00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:55.800
Yes eldest brother

33
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.967
I'll come to hand over my shift tomorrow

34
00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:59.253
Thank you for your hard work

35
00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.815
Brother, please come quickly

36
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:01.675
Got it, brat

37
00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.471
Thank you for taking charge of this big case.

38
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.033
Take one portion and treat the brothers to barbecue

39
00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.900
Just use the other one where needed.

40
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.000
Hey what are you looking at

41
00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:18.467
Brother, these are really just enough to buy barbecue.

42
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.967
The brothers were injured and paid for medical expenses

43
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.800
It costs a lot of money…

44
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.333
If I make enough
How can I only share the money with you?

45
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.867
What's wrong...

46
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:33.833
Boy, I'm serious

47
00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:38.800
Am I going to give you your hard-earned money?
Do you swallow it yourself?

48
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.433
Everything must be accumulated slowly

49
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.933
If we can continue to take their cases

50
00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.033
I will definitely do it then
I'll give you a generous bonus, okay?

51
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.567
It's time for me to go

52
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:55.600
Jisoo, someone is vomiting in the toilet.

53
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.833
Go and clear it quickly

54
00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.500
So dirty

55
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.367
Yes, brother, I will handle it right away

56
00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.000
Brother, walk slowly

57
00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.000
How much does he give

58
00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.833
Two hundred for brothers, one hundred for me

59
00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:17.233
is he kidding

60
00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.300
The brothers’ medical expenses alone cost two hundred.

61
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.367
Damn you guy, this is too much.

62
00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:25.533
Go to the baseball stadium and sell tickets to scalpers.
I make about the same amount of money as this

63
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.800
Bro, give these to the brothers.

64
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.733
I know

65
00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:29.767
What about us?

66
00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.467
Don’t we get a monthly salary?

67
00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.167
But…

68
00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:39.433
Yeah, forget it if I can't subsidize it.

69
00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.900
At least we can't drain our brothers dry.

70
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.567
Brother, I brought people here

71
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.300
let her in

72
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.533
welcome you

73
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:52.233
(Lee Yunae)

74
00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:54.767
We suddenly came to you. Did it scare you?

75
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.800
Brother, did he tell you to remit money?

76
00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:58.933
How much does he want you to wire?

77
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.800
If the boss knew I told him...

78
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.000
I will really die miserably

79
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.700
Don't worry, we will keep it secret

80
00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:15.567
How much does he want you to wire?

81
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.267
50 million won

82
00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.433
Fifty million won?

83
00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:27.067
Brother Guangzhuo really called you
Do you want to remit 50 million won?

84
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.367
Yes it's true

85
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:31.600
Five checks for 10 million won in total

86
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.967
He also said that a man should be loyal

87
00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:34.700
I heard him fart

88
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.533
Really…

89
00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:38.267
Fifty million won…

90
00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:41.833
Brothers are very unhappy

91
00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.567
Now there is a valid reason

92
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.500
The time has come, right?

93
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.967
Just now

94
00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:54.400
Douxue, let’s get rid of Guangzhuo.

95
00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.433
I can be the first one

96
00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.667
The time has indeed come

97
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.100
Brother Guangzhuo was not like that before...

98
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.767
It's not all because of damn greed

99
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.700
Douxue also said

100
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.400
He will divide us when there is only petty profit

101
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.433
But when there is gold and silver, he will definitely keep it to himself

102
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.967
So…

103
00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:20.167
Are you about to take action?

104
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.500
No

105
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.000
Why not?

106
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.933
Because I have the final say

107
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.933
Hello Douxue

108
00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:41.733
Douxue

109
00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:42.833
Big brother…

110
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.567
(Diagnosis Choi Young-sik)
non-obstructive azoospermia

111
00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:55.533
The date of diagnosis was three months before the wedding

112
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.900
sorry

113
00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:12.567
If only I had known earlier

114
00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:14.733
I won’t let Mr. Tetsuo suffer like that.

115
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.900
I'm really sorry

116
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.467
The so-called life is really wonderful.

117
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.767
I really almost...

118
00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:27.033
Almost...

119
00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:35.100
(Violent clashes occurred at the Mingdangdong demolition site)

120
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.433
There's something I'm curious about

121
00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:40.467
You haven't seen Huang Cichang for a long time, right?

122
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.267
Right

123
00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.467
Chief Huang, isn't he coming now?

124
00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:44.900
It seems so

125
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.800
Without the backer of Chief Huang,

126
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.533
My husband will become isolated and helpless.

127
00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:50.267
That is to say

128
00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.433
Are we
It’s time to find another place to party.

129
00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:57.433
Oh my god, Chief Huang, welcome.

130
00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.367
We are about to break up the meeting

131
00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:02.100
Everyone, let's go

132
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.900
See you next time Luo

133
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.533
What a superficial woman

134
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:13.400
She doesn’t even know her husband
I get scolded by my superior every day

135
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.367
Be careful if others overhear you

136
00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.900
So what if I hear it

137
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.233
According to her husband's performance
I wouldn't be surprised if I get fired one day

138
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.067
Have you been busy recently?

139
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.500
Would you like a cup of coffee?

140
00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:25.533
No need

141
00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:27.667
Do you want to drink?

142
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.433
No, that's not what I need

143
00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:36.000
No matter how busy I am at work

144
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.667
How can you skip dinner?

145
00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:43.333
People think we eat delicacies from mountains and seas every day

146
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.767
But in fact, we often don’t have time to eat

147
00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:47.433
As the saying goes, all it takes is one missed meal

148
00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.433
No matter how much you eat, you can't make up for it.

149
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.600
So please eat on time

150
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.267
Ruzhen, please help me cook.

151
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.900
It's not too late to start now

152
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:11.233
Is that why you came to us so late?

153
00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.400
What else should I do?

154
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.333
My mother even called me and asked me to spend the night outside.

155
00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:19.833
I don’t know any relatives in Seoul

156
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.167
You want me, a weak woman, to stay in a hotel
Very scary

157
00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:26.467
Yes, it's a good bet you came to us

158
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.833
It seems she has a man

159
00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:33.867
That must be it

160
00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.933
Otherwise, why would I suddenly kick you out?

161
00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:37.500
What do you mean by that?

162
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.967
What's wrong?

163
00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:40.933
Anyway, her husband is gone. What does it matter?

164
00:08:40.933 --> 00:08:45.433
Do you want to be like the women of the Joseon Dynasty?
Be a widow until death?

165
00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:50.267
I will go to Zhenyu's room to sleep

166
00:08:50.267 --> 00:08:51.433
You guys should go to sleep too

167
00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:53.467
That room is very cold

168
00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:58.967
She actually has a man

169
00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.867
What's going on?

170
00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:07.133
Oh my god, I'm so shy...

171
00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:09.600
OMG…

172
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.233
So shy

173
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.333
These are the pajamas Tetsuo wore before
I don't know if it looks good on you.

174
00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:22.467
If you tell me beforehand
I can buy your pajamas first

175
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.633
Good night then

176
00:09:39.733 --> 00:09:42.267
You know it will fit you even without wearing it.

177
00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:44.067
After all, it's my son's pajamas

178
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.700
Brother Loyalty

179
00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:51.733
live with me

180
00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:54.467
Three meals a day with you

181
00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:56.567
Now I don’t want to miss it anymore

182
00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:05.200
What you have suffered over the years

183
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.767
I will make it up to you

184
00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:10.833
Brother Loyalty, I am satisfied now.

185
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.933
Brother Zhongzhong, thank you

186
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.700
I will find a chance to tell Tetsuo

187
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.133
Tell him about our relationship

188
00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:19.333
You see what I mean?

189
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:22.600
I know you said it many times

190
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.933
if someone asks me

191
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:28.167
I would say the lady's son
I delivered the baby myself

192
00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:29.700
Don't worry

193
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.833
(Diagnosis Choi Young-sik)
Is it non-obstructive azoospermia?

194
00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.433
(Dean Luo Yaoquan)
Dean, please

195
00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:44.900
Because of the child’s father’s political leanings

196
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.667
may affect
His appointment as prosecutor

197
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.067
(Dean Luo Yaoquan)

198
00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:54.133
Dean, please help me

199
00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:57.567
I only have that son left now

200
00:11:57.567 --> 00:11:59.867
If something goes wrong with him

201
00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:01.400
I…

202
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.700
I won't survive, Dean.

203
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.233
please help me

204
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.533
I will never forget this kindness

205
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.733
Keiko, you're back

206
00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:34.233
Yes

207
00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.867
How are you doing these days?

208
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:43.667
Keiko, sorry

209
00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:45.667
can you go out for a moment

210
00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.400
OK

211
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.200
so

212
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.167
How do you answer

213
00:12:56.167 --> 00:13:00.700
I was so scared that I couldn't speak

214
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.833
It was too late, but it was so fast that my husband happened to show up.

215
00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.067
Just say that Tetsuo is your biological son.

216
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.133
I've heard that if you want to serve in an important organization

217
00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:14.900
A wealth survey will be conducted

218
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.033
But the other person always makes me feel a little unusual

219
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:21.700
We are not in our hometown anymore
He also came here

220
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
And…

221
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.700
What's wrong?

222
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.467
That person looks familiar

223
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.700
When living in Lishui

224
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.933
I have followed guests from Mrs. Chu's house before
Passed by several times

225
00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:36.433
That person looked very similar to the guest at that time

226
00:13:36.433 --> 00:13:37.367
How is it possible

227
00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:38.800
You must have read it wrong

228
00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:42.933
I feel like that person seems to know something
Just came to the door

229
00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:44.767
It made me break out in a cold sweat

230
00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:46.533
How is it possible

231
00:13:46.533 --> 00:13:48.100
Is there something he should know?

232
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.300
what

233
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.200
Please completely forget the wrong ideas in your mind

234
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.833
Tetsuo is my son

235
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.267
Got it?

236
00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:04.000
I also hope to forget

237
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.033
But it's not something I can control

238
00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:08.533
you really are...

239
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.333
sorry

240
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.700
I will talk to her well when I go back

241
00:14:14.467 --> 00:14:17.633
Let's go first

242
00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:20.367
Get up quickly

243
00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:23.733
please wait a moment

244
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.967
A studious mother

245
00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:32.300
Could you please help me with something?

246
00:14:34.567 --> 00:14:35.700
what

247
00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:39.067
Our family has caused a lot of trouble for you before.

248
00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:41.733
If you come to help, you can also supplement the family income.

249
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.400
I remember you were good at driving a cultivator, right?

250
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:57.667
Life is really full of surprises

251
00:14:57.667 --> 00:15:00.067
The person who always avoids me

252
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.733
She actually asked me to do something for her

253
00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:05.300
I'm already this age
He actually asked me to take a driver's license test

254
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.367
It's so ridiculous

255
00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:12.367
Don't dwell on it, just help.

256
00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:18.033
No matter how I think about it, I feel
She was afraid that I would reveal Tetsuo's life experience.

257
00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.400
She just wants me to stay by her side
to monitor me

258
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.100
Why can’t you let go of Tetsuo now?

259
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.767
How could I forget him

260
00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.433
If there was an eraser in the world that could erase memories
Please bring it to me

261
00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:30.133
You are really...

262
00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:32.667
So you don't help me

263
00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.100
Of course I want to help

264
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.333
This way you can see it often
My son who became a prosecutor

265
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.833
Try saying that again

266
00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:42.800
Then I will really...

267
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.533
I know... I just won't say it...

268
00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:49.167
Really

Now these three places are left

273

I think it would be best if everyone can buy it

274

If you have to choose

275
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.867
Just buy it here...

Choi Cheol-woong, congratulations on your appointment as prosecutor.

282
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.600
I originally planned to keep my distance from you.

283
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.467
But you are now a prosecutor

284
00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:22.333
If I didn't come to say congratulations
You will definitely be angry with me forever

285
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.033
That's why I made up my mind to come see you

286
00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.267
That's right

287
00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:27.567
I was planning to do it if you didn't show up

288
00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:29.033
I'm going to sue you

I heard a lawyer I know say

291
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.833
I was fined just for parking illegally on the red line.
It would be difficult to become a prosecutor

292
00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.800
So honestly
I thought you had no chance

293
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.733
You are truly amazing…

294
00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:47.833
If you miss it because of the fine
It's a pity that I'm such a talented person.

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:10.867
I called him

304
00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:13.100
Really?

305
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.133
You are very clever at times like this

306
00:18:16.933 --> 00:18:18.133
Does he know I'm here too?

307
00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.667
I told him

308
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.567
Will he do it because I'm here?
If you want to hide from me, you won’t come.

309
00:18:25.867 --> 00:18:27.133
He will definitely come

310
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.900
He is better than anyone
They all still want me to become a prosecutor.

311
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.000
And I have something important to tell him.

What's going on

313
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.067
Promise me first that you won't be angry

314
00:18:41.367 --> 00:18:42.500
OK I'm not angry

But I was also shocked when I saw these photos

322
00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:13.467
"Should I say something to him?"

323

"I will also dream..."
You stinky gangster

329
00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:41.267
You moved behind my back
Is this just for doing this?

330
00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:47.933
Is that you in the photo?

331
00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:58.867
Yes

332
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.633

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:13.667

Why don't we just arrest him and imprison him?

338
00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:21.800
Why are you showing me these photos?

339
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.167
You really haven't changed at all...

340
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.200
Tetsuo, use your clever head
Use it in the right place

341
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.733

342
00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.467
Wait a minute...

343
00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:49.933
Every time the three of us meet
It doesn't end well

344
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.033
Please don’t take photos like this again.

345
00:21:01.233 --> 00:21:03.367
That's why I asked you to be a prosecutor

346
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.467
what do you want me to do

347
00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.633
If you get information like this
Just help me, right?

348
00:21:10.733 --> 00:21:14.033
Do you ask the prosecutor to protect gangsters?

349
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.867
have you forgotten

350
00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:20.167
I know I still owe you

351
00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:23.600
But it shouldn’t be repaid in this way, right?

352
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.033
No matter if I'm a gangster or not

353
00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:28.900
It doesn’t matter if you are a prosecutor or not.

354
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.733
You have to repay the debt you owe me
Until I yell stop

355
00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:34.167
I get it…

356
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:38.167
But don’t involve Dingchen

357
00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:39.967
Don't let her become unhappy because of you

358
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.000
I never involved her

359
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
That's why I moved

360
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.633
Also

361
00:21:44.633 --> 00:21:46.933
Same for you

362
00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:49.400
I know you are afraid that Dingchen will be taken away by me

363
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.433
why

364
00:21:51.433 --> 00:21:53.100
Because you are a sore loser

365
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.567
But you figure it out

366
00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:58.000
This is not love, but possessiveness

367
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.667
Brat

368
00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:12.700
Coming...

369
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.067
Brother, who is coming?

370
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.467
Don't know

371
00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:23.867
Brother, please come in

372
00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:39.267
Thank you for your hard work, Boss Lian.

373
00:22:39.267 --> 00:22:40.267
thank you

374
00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:41.400
As long as you can do your part for the country

375
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.167
We are always ready to be dispatched

376
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.900
Hello…

377
00:22:50.533 --> 00:22:51.800
Say hello

378
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.167
This is Team Leader Wu, our minister’s confidant.

379
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.233
He is the person with real power in our unit

380
00:22:57.233 --> 00:22:58.900
You know what I mean

381
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.700
Team leader Wu said he wants to see you
So we came together

382
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.367
My name is Lian Guangzhuo. Please give me some advice.

383
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.933
My surname is Wu

384
00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:15.033
This is the case
The brother in charge of on-site command

385
00:23:15.033 --> 00:23:18.167
He and I are like sworn brothers in Taoyuan
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei

386
00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:19.400
We are brothers

387
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.067
Come and say hello

388
00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:22.567
My name is Li Douxue

389
00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:34.633
Have we met before?

390
00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:36.567
Thank you for your hard work

391
00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:38.400
Although there was a bit of bloodshed

392
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.367
But you handled things well

393
00:23:40.367 --> 00:23:41.933
thank you for your compliment

394
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.867
Boss Lian, come here

395
00:23:43.867 --> 00:23:45.333
yes

396
00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:50.733
It is said that apartment buildings will be built in more areas in the future.

397
00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:51.933
Yes

398
00:23:51.933 --> 00:23:56.067
I'll contract out the window frames for the apartment to you.

399
00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.233
what

400
00:23:57.233 --> 00:23:59.633
Won't you give me the right to move in?

401
00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.833
Right of occupancy?

402
00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:06.667
Are you still not satisfied with this?

403
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:09.833
don't you know
How much can you earn from window frames alone?

404
00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:10.900
That's not what I meant

405
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.833
Section Chief Thank you

406
00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:14.933
Why are you still dumbfounded? Let the lady come in quickly.

407
00:24:17.633 --> 00:24:18.700
Section Chief

408
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.400
I found one for you
A special lady comes in

409
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.000
Really?

410
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.033
I'm looking forward to it

411
00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:27.100
Stay tuned

412
00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:28.900
Yeon Joo

413
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.133
boss

414
00:24:30.133 --> 00:24:31.800
Just promise me once
Wait a minute...

415
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800
This is my first time asking you to do this

416
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.900
I don't want

417
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900
Yeonjoo, I'm sorry

418
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.767
I really don't want to go in

419
00:24:37.767 --> 00:24:39.933
Yeon Joo, please save me just once.

420
00:24:39.933 --> 00:24:41.133
ok

421
00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:43.533
Boss, please let me go

422
00:24:43.533 --> 00:24:45.233
Don't you know very well that I hate this kind of thing the most?

423
00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:46.467
Of course I know...

424
00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:49.367
So just once is enough

425
00:24:49.367 --> 00:24:51.900
Yanzhu, please let me ask you for help

426
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.500
Today’s guest is a high-ranking guest

427
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.967
Go get acquainted
It will also be very helpful to you

428
00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:01.100
That's what you insist on
I won’t be an actor anymore

429
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.933
Hello…

430
00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:06.000
Hey, I've been begging you so hard

431
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.200
Do you really want to do this to me? Are you sure?

432
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.633
Boss, I just want to ask you not to do this to me.

433
00:25:11.633 --> 00:25:14.667
You really want to drink wine as a penalty instead of eating the toast...

434
00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.267
what is this doing

435
00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:18.100
What are you doing?

436
00:25:19.233 --> 00:25:20.500
Why don't you let go?

437
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.967
Wait a minute, it hurts...

438
00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:26.633
You little bastard, let go now

439
00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:28.367
This woman is really...

440
00:25:28.367 --> 00:25:30.567
my neck…
Hello

441
00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:32.067
Be more respectful

442
00:25:32.067 --> 00:25:33.633
ok sorry

443
00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:35.700
Hello…

444
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.767
I'm here to meet your boss

445
00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:40.667
Then please go in alone.
She even said she didn't want to go in.

446
00:25:40.667 --> 00:25:42.200
what

447
00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.167
Let's go

448
00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:49.633
Hello Song Yanzhu...

449
00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:51.400
stop

450
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.667
Wait a minute...

451
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:54.800
Why is it so noisy?

452
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.667
It hurts...

453
00:25:56.667 --> 00:25:58.800
Boss Yin, what are you doing before you come in?

454
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.200
Where is Song Yeon-joo?

455
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.833
I want to ask you

456
00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:05.000
This guy is the one who twisted my wrist

457
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.967
Let Song Yanzhu run away

458
00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:07.967
Abominable

459
00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.000
what

460
00:26:09.533 --> 00:26:10.700
Brother, sorry

461
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.700
Because Song Yanzhu doesn’t want to go in
But he dragged her here

462
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.300
Brat...

463
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.133
Don't you know how important this is?

464
00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:22.400
Who are you?
How dare you decide her stay or go without permission?

465
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.800
Brother, be gentle with your feet.

466
00:26:25.067 --> 00:26:26.800
how are you

467
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.233
Won't you get out of the way?

468
00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:31.367
Big brother

469
00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:33.300
Impolite brat

470
00:26:38.933 --> 00:26:41.233
Is this how you manage your younger brother?

471
00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.333
Catch Song Yanzhu quickly

472
00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:47.300
Go and get it back...

473
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.867
Big brother

474
00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:51.600
It's my fault. Hit me.

475
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.667
What are you guys like?

476
00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:56.433
Hello Li Douxue

477
00:26:56.433 --> 00:26:58.967
Now you teach him a lesson in front of me

478
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.300
Brat, hurry up

479
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:11.567
Good job

480
00:27:11.933 --> 00:27:13.533
are you kidding

481
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.200
This is a lesson, you brat.

482
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.433
Get up...

483
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.833
Hurry up and teach him a lesson

484
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.633
You boy

485
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.733
What do you want now?

486
00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:42.233
Brat

487
00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:47.833
enough

488
00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:51.567
Yeon Joo

489
00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:53.833
Boss Yin, bring her in quickly

490
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.533
I'll settle the score with you later

491
00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:00.400
Do you know?

492
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.467
Boss Yin, hurry up

493
00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:06.000
Yanzhu, come here quickly...

494
00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:11.833
Hello, I am movie star Song Yeon-joo.

495
00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:13.667
I love watching your movies

496
00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:17.167
I have read almost all of your works

497
00:28:17.167 --> 00:28:18.667
Of course, while my wife is away

498
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.900
Sirs, please take a look

499
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.600
She is both beautiful and good at acting

500
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.467
It's just impeccable.

501
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.067
Thanks for the compliment

502
00:28:28.067 --> 00:28:32.133
Let's listen to Miss Song Yeon-joo sing a song

503
00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:34.467
Come on, everyone applaud

504
00:28:36.567 --> 00:28:39.100
Thank you for your compliments

505
00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:41.633
But I'm not going to sing

506
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.900
I’m not going to pour wine for you either.

507
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.467
Song Yanzhu, what’s wrong with you?

508
00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:49.500
I plan not to be Song Yeon-joo anymore

509
00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:54.600
What you like
Is it the movie star Song Yeon-joo?

510
00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:58.100
My real name is Park Jung Mi

511
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.033
from this moment on

512
00:29:00.033 --> 00:29:02.633
I'm not a movie actor, and I'm not Song Yeon-joo either.

513
00:29:02.633 --> 00:29:05.900
I want to live as Park Jung Mi

514
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.467
Then I can go now

515
00:29:08.432 --> 00:29:11.799
-what is she talking about
-What's going on?

516
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.833
What are you doing?

517
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.867
Sorry, I took her away first.

518
00:29:14.868 --> 00:29:16.802
Sorry, what should I do now?

519
00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.800
Would you like a glass of soju with the omelette?

520
00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:33.733
Your tone of voice is too indifferent, right?

521
00:29:33.733 --> 00:29:35.867
Don't look at me like this. I have a baby face.

522
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.500
I don't drink with actors

523
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.367
I just decided not to do it

524
00:29:44.733 --> 00:29:47.000
I don't drink with my sister

525
00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:06.000
Egg hot compress is not effective for bruises

526
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.467
Apply this

527
00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:12.433
Apply ice once or twice and it won't hurt anymore

528
00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:15.433
If the bruise spreads, apply warm compresses with a towel

529
00:30:15.433 --> 00:30:16.600
It will get better soon

530
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.233
Are you a gangster too? You know so much

531
00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:26.200
I do know a lot

532
00:30:31.567 --> 00:30:33.833
The little bastard can at least fight back.

533
00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:38.400
But in this circle you can only get beaten

534
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.633
If you go to the hospital, the news will spread

535
00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:44.133
Over time I became an expert on bruises

536
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.133
If you're curious about other types of wounds
Just ask me how to deal with it

537
00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:55.067
What if you were hit with a stick and broke a bone?

538
00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:58.633
What's wrong

539
00:30:58.633 --> 00:31:00.200
Don’t you know this?

540
00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:06.167
Of course you have to go to the hospital, idiot

541
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.367
You are simply a psychopath

542
00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:18.300
really sorry

543
00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:19.867
please forgive me

544
00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:22.567
It doesn’t matter…

545
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.367
I didn't come here to drink in the first place.

546
00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:28.667
I came here because I have something to discuss with Boss Lian.

547
00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:29.567
So you don’t have to pay too much attention

548
00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:31.533
Is there anything I can do to help?

549
00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:33.400
I will definitely try my best to help

550
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.700
Only gives you the exclusive right to sell the window frame

551
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.733
You must be dissatisfied

552
00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:39.633
How is it possible

553
00:31:39.633 --> 00:31:42.033
Don’t just be responsible for driving away the demolition households

554
00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:43.833
How about participating directly in the program?

555
00:31:43.833 --> 00:31:47.267
What? Directly involved?

556
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.800
Of course I want to

557
00:31:52.633 --> 00:31:56.200
But we haven’t been able to raise that much money yet.

558
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.900
Boss Lian only needs to prepare 20% of the funds.

559
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.800
We can prepare the rest

560
00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:08.567
We will also personally allocate the land to be developed

561
00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:10.067
100% certain

562
00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:13.400
This is not just in Seoul

563
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.233
It is a metropolitan plan that covers the entire metropolitan area.

564
00:32:16.233 --> 00:32:17.900
Of course the profits are astronomical

565
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.867
But I have a condition

566
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:25.267
You say it

567
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:27.300
first

568
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.667
We hold 70% of the shares and you hold 30%

569
00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:31.433
We will give you 10% more shares

570
00:32:31.433 --> 00:32:33.100
because of money laundering and tax expenses

571
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.833
All included in Boss Lian’s shares

572
00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:37.033
Got it

573
00:32:37.033 --> 00:32:39.633
Second, even in front of King Yama

574
00:32:39.633 --> 00:32:41.667
I can't even tell you about our cooperative relationship.

575
00:32:42.067 --> 00:32:44.567
If this is violated

576
00:32:44.567 --> 00:32:46.133
The consequences may be disastrous

577
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.300
I swear

578
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.000
I will definitely be loyal to you

579
00:32:53.733 --> 00:32:56.000
And…

580
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.833
I have one more thing to ask you

581
00:32:57.833 --> 00:32:59.100
Please tell me

582
00:33:01.767 --> 00:33:03.000
Please walk slowly

583
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.733
Please walk slowly

584
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.467
Please walk carefully and slowly

585
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.367
Douxue

586
00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:19.300
Did I go a little too far just now?

587
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.667
It's okay, brother

588
00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.133
But why does he come to you?

589
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.033
nothing

590
00:33:27.033 --> 00:33:28.633
He just came to please me

591
00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.467
Continue to help him like you are doing now

592
00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:32.900
Really

593
00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:34.600
So boring

594
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.000
That's right

595
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.933
I would have done it even if he didn't say it

596
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.267
Hello Douxue

597
00:33:42.033 --> 00:33:43.600
Don't be angry

598
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.867
After all I am the boss

599
00:33:45.867 --> 00:33:47.533
But he was embarrassed in front of the guests

600
00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:50.067
I'm too excited

601
00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:51.767
Right

602
00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:53.667
This…

603
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.833
You take it and treat your little brothers to delicious food.

604
00:33:56.833 --> 00:33:58.200
relax

605
00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:00.567
Thank you bro

606
00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:02.933
No. Let’s get off work.

607
00:34:04.733 --> 00:34:06.367
Please walk slowly, brother

608
00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:23.333
So crowded

609
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:25.500
where

610
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.267
here

611
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.833
These funds alone are absolutely not enough

612
00:34:56.033 --> 00:34:57.833
No matter how hard I think, I can't think of a way

613
00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:23.567
drink

614
00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:31.667
Cow, you can eat it from head to tail

615
00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:36.200
Not even willing to throw away the internal organs
A nation that cooks and eats

616
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.933
It's probably just us

617
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.100
We often come here to eat the offal soup

618
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.867
Yes

619
00:35:45.867 --> 00:35:52.867
The eldest brother also said that we should be together for the rest of our lives.
Brothers who show their sincerity to each other

620
00:35:52.867 --> 00:35:54.133
Yes

621
00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:56.767
That's why I came to see you again

622
00:35:57.867 --> 00:36:00.000
Do you remember what I said?

623
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.867
The person who will inherit my country from now on

624
00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:03.267
This is not Li Douxue who became a monk halfway.

625
00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:06.067
It’s you who worked hard with me when I was young

626
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.433
you know tiger

627
00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:11.400
Will push his child off the cliff

628
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.500
Then only raise children who can crawl back.

629
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.133
you are like that

630
00:36:18.133 --> 00:36:19.867
And that guy Douxue

631
00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:22.967
It has nothing to do with eating offal soup with me.

632
00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:26.200
Come

633
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.900
Thank you for your hard work

634
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.233
We hold 70% of the shares and you hold 30%

635
00:36:46.233 --> 00:36:48.067
We will give you 10% more shares

636
00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:49.900
because of money laundering and tax expenses

637
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.533
All included in Boss Lian’s shares

638
00:36:52.533 --> 00:36:53.500
I know

639
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.633
Second, even in front of King Yama

640
00:36:55.633 --> 00:36:58.200
I can't even tell you about our cooperative relationship.

641
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.767
If this is violated

642
00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:01.533
The consequences may be disastrous

643
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.200
Because we need to know what big brother is doing

644
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.000
If there is a 30% stake in the development company

645
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
How much money can you make

646
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.267
Although only 30%

647
00:37:13.267 --> 00:37:17.300
But development projects cost several billions
Billions of dollars

648
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.600
Of course the income is at the level of a large company

649
00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:30.900
We…

650
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.200
Eat this business

651
00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:36.267
This is a chance for brother

652
00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:38.733
They will get rid of big brother
Leave the work to us?

653
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.200
That's right

654
00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:43.900
It doesn't matter to them who they do it for

655
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.467
What matters is how good that person is

656
00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:49.833
Are you saying this is the level of a big company?

657
00:37:49.833 --> 00:37:51.133
Let's just vote

658
00:37:51.133 --> 00:37:54.233
Get out of this miserable situation

659
00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:56.333
How long are we going to live like this?

660
00:37:58.433 --> 00:38:01.133
You should have guessed the other party’s identity, right?

661
00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:03.800
So what?

662
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.767
You should consider carefully

663
00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.433
Those people live in a different world than us

664
00:38:07.433 --> 00:38:09.633
They can…

665
00:38:09.633 --> 00:38:12.200
Killing us without anyone noticing

666
00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:15.433
Kill someone?

667
00:38:15.433 --> 00:38:16.900
Kill us?

668
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.267
Which organization is it?

669
00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:20.067
Haven't you seen it before?

670
00:38:20.067 --> 00:38:23.100
South Korea's CIA

671
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.667
South Korea's CIA

672
00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:28.200
I'm so scared

673
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.000
You can quit if you're scared

674
00:38:31.567 --> 00:38:33.467
Do you want to grab it?

675
00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:42.033
I heard you are selling drugs recently

676
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:46.500
what

677
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.300
how do you know

678
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.467
sorry

679
00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:53.533
Because money is tight recently
So I sold it temporarily

680
00:38:53.533 --> 00:38:55.100
I know you don't like it

681
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:55.767
I can stop doing it now...

682
00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:58.533
It doesn’t matter…

683
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.033
When money is tight
What does selling drugs have to do with it?

684
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.933
But since we have to do it
Why not make it bigger

685
00:39:05.933 --> 00:39:07.700
Brother help you

686
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.600
Now working in the underworld

687
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.900
money is power

688
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.800
If you want to make a name for yourself all over the country
Even more so

689
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.900
Selling drugs doesn't matter
Just wait until you gain some weight and then stop selling it.

690
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.500
Isn't it?

691
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.600
Brother, why did you suddenly say that?

692
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600
Yongbi

693
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.700
How long will you stay in the junior suite?

694
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.900
Even if it's not a house with ninety-nine rooms

695
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.400
At least rent a decent house

696
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.533
Let's fart comfortably in there

697
00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:38.600
That way…

698
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.967
It’s interesting for me to choose a successor.

699
00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:45.767
Big brother

700
00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:47.033
But suddenly it expanded

701
00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:48.967
It would be dangerous if rumors spread

702
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:49.733
Even my eldest brother...

703
00:39:49.733 --> 00:39:51.467
You give it a try

704
00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:56.200
Just treat it like a little tiger has to face it
The last hurdle

705
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.833
And I can't get involved in drugs.
in related cases

706
00:40:04.833 --> 00:40:06.133
You understand

707
00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:07.933
I will keep it in mind, brother

708
00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:10.933
No

709
00:40:10.933 --> 00:40:12.300
why

710
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.900
Why do you always say no?

711
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.167
If you say no, can't we do it?

712
00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:22.200
Well, I can't

713
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.933
Am I your dog...

714
00:40:24.933 --> 00:40:27.367
Because I'm the boss

715
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.367
Team Leader Wu, only we can know about this.

716
00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.700
Don’t let anyone else in the company know

717
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.967
Yes

718
00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:43.167
But how much do you know

719
00:40:43.767 --> 00:40:47.300
I only know the minister and the chief of security

720
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.367
Don't fund them with company funds

721
00:40:49.367 --> 00:40:51.800
Help them get a bank loan

722
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.667
Can't leave them with us
Transaction records

723
00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:55.533
Got it

724
00:40:55.533 --> 00:40:56.667
Also

725
00:40:56.667 --> 00:41:00.333
In addition, we retain 10% of our equity

726
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:03.767
I can't guarantee I'll still be sitting
How long have you been in this position?

727
00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:05.933
It’s time for Team Leader Wu to prepare to retire.

728
00:41:05.933 --> 00:41:07.233
Isn't it?

729
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.033
thank you

730
00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:27.267
Who told you to lie down

731
00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:29.300
Lie down for me

732
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.633
Douxue, wait a minute

733
00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:34.033
Who allows you to call the boss by his name?

734
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.967
Operation Captain

735
00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:37.800
Lie down

736
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.867
Douxue, okay, stop fighting.

737
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.000
Hello

738
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.133
If you dare to steal money again

739
00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:01.667
I will definitely beat you to death next time

740
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.100
Let's go, brother

741
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.800
are you okay

742
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.467
Let me go, brat

743
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.067
Abominable

744
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.633
1 million won

745
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:25.600
You just stole 1 million won
Was he beaten like this?

746
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.767
And that money is not what I want to use

747
00:42:27.767 --> 00:42:30.667
I'm buying suits for the new boys.

748
00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:32.433
Just took that money

749
00:42:32.433 --> 00:42:34.467
In addition to paying rent and eating

750
00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:37.033
He doesn't let us spend money at all

751
00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:39.833
Big brother learns from Li Dou

752
00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:42.333
Really stingy

753
00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:46.400
you

754
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.133
Have you really never received any pocket money?

755
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.367
Yes, brother

756
00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.300
I live with the money from my family

757
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.867
Brother, I'm still borrowing money from my friends.

758
00:42:56.867 --> 00:42:58.533
Did they keep the money for themselves?

759
00:42:58.533 --> 00:43:01.033
Otherwise, how could I...

760
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.533
How could I want to steal money?

761
00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:08.500
That guy spoke very nicely
Say we are a family

762
00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:11.967
Hey, can this be called a family?

763
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.400
He doesn't think we are family

764
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.700
Yongbi

765
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.500
You take me in

766
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.333
I will help you take revenge

767
00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:27.000
You and Dou Xue have been inseparable since we were in prison.

768
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.300
How do you want me to believe you?

769
00:43:47.767 --> 00:43:49.033
I learn from Dou

770
00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:51.167
I took all the money from the office safe

771
00:43:51.167 --> 00:43:52.333
30 million won

772
00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:54.600
I could have taken the money and run away

773
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.100
But I came to you

774
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.633
Because I want revenge

775
00:43:58.267 --> 00:44:01.133
I seem to be able to feel your sincerity

776
00:44:01.133 --> 00:44:02.800
These are just the tip of the iceberg

777
00:44:03.367 --> 00:44:05.267
In Lian Guangzhuo's vault

778
00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:07.033
There is ten times more money than this

779
00:44:08.033 --> 00:44:11.000
I run errands for him every month
So I know it very well

780
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.500
Doesn’t Lian Guangzhuo dislike going to the bank?

781
00:44:14.167 --> 00:44:15.667
indeed

782
00:44:15.667 --> 00:44:17.633
Now working in the underworld

783
00:44:19.233 --> 00:44:21.000
money is power

784
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.900
Just steal Lian Guangzhuo's treasury

785
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.967
Each of my brothers can save a few million more

786
00:44:25.633 --> 00:44:27.700
Lian Guangzhuo and Li Douxue

787
00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.033
Let's get rid of them all in one go.

788
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.233
I want that too

789
00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:41.167
But the timing doesn't seem right

790
00:44:41.533 --> 00:44:42.667
Hello

791
00:44:42.667 --> 00:44:45.900
What are you arguing about?

792
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.200
what are you going to do

793
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.233
Don't move at all

794
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.300
I am prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

795
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.667
You are Yongpil

796
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.333
nice to meet you

797
00:45:10.933 --> 00:45:12.400
Actually

798
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.733
My target is not you, it’s Lian Guangzhuo

799
00:45:19.433 --> 00:45:21.033
You know Lian Guangzhuo

800
00:45:21.033 --> 00:45:22.533
kick you out

801
00:45:22.533 --> 00:45:23.900
Take Li Douxue with you

802
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.033
Trying to find ways to strengthen his power everywhere

803
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.900
Selling alcohol in a bar and laundering money is the most basic thing

804
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.800
He also helped the company suppress the labor union.

805
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.200
even use violence
Force residents in Tugeng area to leave

806
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.767
It's really a headache

807
00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:41.067
But they don’t know what backing they have

808
00:45:41.067 --> 00:45:43.900
It runs away as fast as a loach and is hard to catch

809
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.133
now because of them

810
00:45:45.133 --> 00:45:47.167
The public opinion situation is very bad

811
00:45:47.167 --> 00:45:49.700
The government says it wants to protect citizens

812
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.567
So…

813
00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:54.900
We have to catch someone to scare the monkeys

814
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.567
to calm public opinion

815
00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:58.433
It has been decided from above

816
00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:00.567
you can take over the organization

817
00:46:00.567 --> 00:46:04.800
Then learn from Lian Guangzhuo and Li Dou
Give us the criminal evidence

818
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.300
Then we can quell the dissatisfaction of the people
practice patriotism

819
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.300
You can also take revenge
He can also take over the organization smoothly

820
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.933
Kill two birds with one stone, kill two birds with one stone
Isn’t it the best of both worlds?

821
00:46:15.933 --> 00:46:17.300
How is it

822
00:46:19.333 --> 00:46:21.267
Do you think I will believe you?

823
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.833
Yongbi

824
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.433
What are we doing catching a little fish like you?

825
00:46:27.933 --> 00:46:29.800
Our goal is to catch big fish

826
00:46:30.167 --> 00:46:32.933
Even if your name is reported to the newspaper, no one will recognize it.

827
00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:35.533
At least like Lian Guangzhuo
To be discernible

828
00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:37.533
Don't look down on people

829
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.633
No one knows what will happen in the future.

830
00:46:41.033 --> 00:46:42.500
Yes

831
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.900
So

832
00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:46.467
Yongbi

833
00:46:46.467 --> 00:46:48.267
in this world

834
00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:51.033
Day and night coexist

835
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.667
Can there be only flowers and plants in this world?

836
00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:57.100
Have rabbits that eat grass

837
00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.300
There must also be wild wolves and tigers that eat rabbits

838
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.600
The organization always needs someone to accept it

839
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.500
Just accept it

840
00:47:06.067 --> 00:47:07.700
However

841
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.633
Don't get into big trouble and cooperate with us well

842
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.967
OK

843
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.233
Hey, drive faster

844
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.133
is…

845
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.333
Did you know that during the Imjin Japanese Rebellion?

846
00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:35.133
General Yi Sun-shin refused to listen to Seonjo's words
No troops were sent

847
00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:37.300
Later I got slapped
The story of joining the army in white clothes

848
00:47:38.767 --> 00:47:41.400
People who originally disobeyed the king’s orders
It must be executed immediately

849
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:47.067
But General Yi Sun-shin because of his great achievements

850
00:47:47.067 --> 00:47:51.500
Seonjo gave him a gold medal to avoid death

851
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.333
No matter what you do wrong

852
00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:55.600
He can avoid death once

853
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.433
A token like that

854
00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:01.767
This is the death-free gold medal

855
00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:06.533
This document is really hard to get

856
00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:09.433
Don't go around showing off to others

857
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.000
OK, then I'll stamp it...

858
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.867
No, I'll finish pressing the fingerprint first

859
00:48:16.867 --> 00:48:20.267
If you press your fingerprint again, this document will be
Save your life

860
00:48:20.267 --> 00:48:21.567
Everything is done

861
00:48:21.567 --> 00:48:25.400
(Certificate from the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office)

862
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:43.767
You are here

863
00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:44.833
Sorry I'm late

864
00:48:44.833 --> 00:48:46.667
It's okay. Please sit down.

865
00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:51.433
Do you want to order a drink first?

866
00:48:51.433 --> 00:48:53.100
It's okay, no need

867
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.933
good

868
00:48:54.933 --> 00:48:57.800
Thank you for thinking of me so much

869
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.733
But I'm retired

870
00:49:01.433 --> 00:49:02.733
when

871
00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:04.333
yesterday

872
00:49:04.333 --> 00:49:06.700
So please find another actor

873
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.500
This movie will definitely be a hit

874
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.400
This role is also suitable for you

875
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.033
And we will definitely give you dividends

876
00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:13.467
If…

877
00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:16.167
An actress who fell in love with a gangster

878
00:49:16.167 --> 00:49:17.767
Doesn't it matter?

879
00:49:20.633 --> 00:49:23.533
Not in a movie, but in real life

880
00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:25.300
I'm such a madman

881
00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:31.000
Do you remember the last time you came to the filming set?
Pick up my gangster

882
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.667
Yes

883
00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:38.067
i like him very much

884
00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:39.733
I want to date him

885
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.033
am i crazy

886
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.733
Thank you for coming to your appointment today

887
00:49:50.733 --> 00:49:52.500
Then I'll leave first

888
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.167
But you are really crazy

889
00:50:14.233 --> 00:50:16.300
Be careful not to choke. Eat slowly.

890
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.800
I have to finish eating quickly

891
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.733
Go back to work on the case

892
00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:26.233
Don't you have something important to tell me?

893
00:50:30.833 --> 00:50:32.900
do you have a girlfriend

894
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.200
I heard other prosecutors

895
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.267
When I was in training school, I would be chased by girls.

896
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.567
Did you call me back out of curiosity?

897
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.367
How

898
00:50:45.367 --> 00:50:47.867
Are you worried that your son won't get a wife?

899
00:50:47.867 --> 00:50:49.467
not like that

900
00:50:49.467 --> 00:50:50.933
that's why

901
00:50:52.567 --> 00:50:55.100
If you want to get married

902
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.667
There will be one less officiant

903
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:04.100
Forget it

904
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.500
Let’s talk about it later

905
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.733
do you want coffee

906
00:51:06.733 --> 00:51:08.600
Mom, you have a boyfriend

907
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.133
No

908
00:51:15.133 --> 00:51:17.067
I was right, right?

909
00:51:18.067 --> 00:51:20.067
Actually…

910
00:51:20.067 --> 00:51:24.067
That's great. That's great.

911
00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:25.867
do you really think so

912
00:51:25.867 --> 00:51:27.500
Of course

913
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.133
My mother is so young and beautiful

914
00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:32.567
I have to stay alone in an empty house for the rest of my life
Is this true?

915
00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:35.267
I originally thought that if you didn't have a boyfriend

916
00:51:35.267 --> 00:51:37.667
I want to introduce you to someone

917
00:51:37.667 --> 00:51:39.100
so good

918
00:51:44.467 --> 00:51:45.933
Tetsuo

919
00:51:53.433 --> 00:51:58.633
Why, are you worried that I will object?

920
00:52:00.167 --> 00:52:01.733
Is it because of dad?

921
00:52:03.967 --> 00:52:05.700
Didn’t dad have…

922
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.000
Will my son help him pass on the incense of the Cui family?

923
00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:13.433
However

924
00:52:13.433 --> 00:52:15.733
what does that person do

925
00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:19.800
where did you meet
How did we know each other?

926
00:52:20.867 --> 00:52:22.867
he is a good man

927
00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:25.433
I'll arrange to meet you later

928
00:52:27.033 --> 00:52:29.133
Really exciting

929
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.067
My mother actually started falling in love

930
00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:35.767
You are much better than me

931
00:52:42.267 --> 00:52:43.767
very cold

932
00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:45.267
You go in quickly

933
00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:47.600
You go back
I'm leaving

934
00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:08.433
(Terrible outsider team)

935
00:53:08.433 --> 00:53:12.667
The cheers from the audience came from the baseball stadium

936
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:14.033
Hello Dingchen

937
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.633
If you convince Director Lee Chang-ho

938
00:53:16.633 --> 00:53:19.167
You must let me sing a movie soundtrack

939
00:53:20.533 --> 00:53:22.067
If you don't let me sing

940
00:53:22.067 --> 00:53:24.133
I'll pack my bags and go back to Lishui

941
00:53:24.133 --> 00:53:27.067
You'd better go back now

942
00:53:29.533 --> 00:53:31.100
It's so late. Who is it?

943
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.133
He came to congratulate me and said I could win the game today
It’s already amazing

944
00:53:36.133 --> 00:53:37.767
Tetsuo

945
00:53:39.167 --> 00:53:40.367
How is it

946
00:53:40.367 --> 00:53:42.233
Would you like grilled pork belly with soju?

947
00:53:43.067 --> 00:53:44.467
Hello Dingchen

948
00:53:51.633 --> 00:53:52.800
why did you come

949
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.400
You're here to celebrate your mom's boyfriend.

950
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.033
Then you should drink it with your mother
Why come here to celebrate?

951
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.367
Are you unhappy that my mother has a boyfriend?

952
00:54:12.867 --> 00:54:14.067
No

953
00:54:14.067 --> 00:54:16.233
It's not like you don't know her
Can't you help her celebrate?

954
00:54:16.233 --> 00:54:19.467
Yes, of course I can help her celebrate

955
00:54:19.467 --> 00:54:23.433
I just don't know
Is this something I can help her celebrate?

956
00:54:25.167 --> 00:54:27.800
Sincere congratulations to your mother Tetsuo

957
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.733
Tetsuo, you are so handsome

958
00:54:34.733 --> 00:54:39.967
How many men in the world would congratulate their mother on her remarriage?

959
00:54:40.967 --> 00:54:42.000
Tetsuo

960
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.300
i wrote a song

961
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.633
Do you want to listen to it?

962
00:54:46.933 --> 00:54:48.233
good

963
00:54:54.167 --> 00:54:58.967
"Things of the past"

964
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:08.133
"Even if I try hard to remember, I will turn around."

965
00:55:08.133 --> 00:55:13.833
"There will still be sad eyes"

966
00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:14.933
What a fool

967
00:55:14.933 --> 00:55:17.933
"Sader than separation"

968
00:55:17.933 --> 00:55:23.067
"The words wish me happiness"

969
00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:30.100
"Like stars shining in the night sky"

970
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:34.367
"On your pupils"

971
00:55:34.367 --> 00:55:36.000
The more I listen to this song, the more it sounds like it

972
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.700
Singing about my state of mind

973
00:55:39.267 --> 00:55:41.400
Really?

974
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:51.933
"Tears flow emptyly"

975
00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:16.233
Those stinky dogs

976
00:56:17.033 --> 00:56:18.533
What happened to them

977
00:56:24.167 --> 00:56:25.867
Brother, leave it to me to solve it

978
00:56:25.867 --> 00:56:27.200
As for fighting studies

979
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.467
It's your responsibility to stop him

980
00:57:03.033 --> 00:57:04.733
Never fail

981
00:57:04.733 --> 00:57:06.667
If Douxue comes to help big brother
Things are going to get tricky

982
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:17.867
What's wrong

983
00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.900
who are you

984
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.367
Wait

985
00:57:36.033 --> 00:57:37.300
Big brother…

986
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.500
What's wrong? What's wrong?

987
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.400
Brother, please take the secret passage and escape.

988
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.400
these bastards

989
00:58:23.067 --> 00:58:24.367
where has he gone

990
00:58:46.567 --> 00:58:47.700
Who?

991
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.633
You are here

992
00:58:48.633 --> 00:58:50.300
who are you

993
00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:59.100
It's Yongpil

994
00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:01.614
You came just in time

995
00:59:01.615 --> 00:59:03.615
Sure enough, you are the only one I can rely on

996
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.600
They were sent by Douxue, right?

997
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.700
I knew he would be like this

998
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.100
But Yongpil

999
00:59:14.767 --> 00:59:19.100
how do you know i'm here

1000
00:59:19.533 --> 00:59:25.133
That's right. How would I know?

1001
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:00.467
Yongbi

1002
01:00:14.367 --> 01:00:15.667
Although the sneak attack was successful

1003
01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:17.933
But he kept resisting

1004
01:00:17.933 --> 01:00:19.200
It's a bit laborious

1005
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.533
Thank you for your hard work

1006
01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:24.867
Big Brother, your favorite Douxue is here

1007
01:00:32.733 --> 01:00:39.400
"Can I come back to you again?"

1008
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.400
"trembling eyes"

1009
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.233
"Looks more sad"

1010
01:00:46.233 --> 01:00:52.933
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

1011
01:00:52.933 --> 01:00:56.600
"Your name is deeply etched in my heart"

1012
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.833
(Preview of next episode)

1013
01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:04.033
Prosecutor Choi might have a chance
Can you handcuff me?

1014
01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:05.267
I said

1015
01:01:05.267 --> 01:01:06.033
what was said

1016
01:01:06.033 --> 01:01:07.100
break up

1017
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.233
(Wu Wanxu)
This is an item confiscated from Lian Guangzhuo's house.

1018
01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.633
I found the mastermind

1019
01:01:12.633 --> 01:01:13.200
who is

1020
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.867
before becoming a family

1021
01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:17.900
There's something I need to let you know first

1022
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.800
Dingchen

1023
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.500
If I don’t join the underworld anymore

1024
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.433
Do you want to live with me?

1025
01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:23.500
you

1026
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.700
None of them are human

1027
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.600
Go to hell

1028
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.667
This is the hound you killed me
price that must be paid
