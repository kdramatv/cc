(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.767
Okay then…

3
00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:14.633
(Episode 12)
let's talk business

4
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.867
If you have any conditions, please feel free to ask.

5
00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.567
The government and I will try our best to help

6
00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm over seventy

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.267
Now I want to do some business in my motherland

8
00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:29.467
What's so difficult about that?

9
00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.100
There are many overseas Chinese

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.533
All have launched large-scale businesses in South Korea

11
00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.600
What kind of business do you want to do?

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
Buying and selling business

13
00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll bring some capital there

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.633
Please let me finance freely in Korea

15
00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.200
This might be a little difficult…

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.033
Of course there are prerequisites

17
00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.733
first

18
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.733
I will help you connect with the Kremlin

19
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.000
second

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.800
We will give 30% of the proceeds

21
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600
Share it with you

22
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.200
I will report it to the commander and fight for you

23
00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:17.567
Very good

24
00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:01.200
(entry)

25
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.767
Thank you for your hard work

26
00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.100
What did I do?

27
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.733
It’s the minister who’s doing the hard work

28
00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:15.667
You were the one who said I wanted to bring makgeolli.

29
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.867
It's only thanks to you that the conversation went so smoothly.

30
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.000
You don't have to do anything extraordinary

31
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.800
Just stay with me

32
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.433
I feel very at ease

33
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.367
I will work harder to be someone you can rely on

34
00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.333
If we could establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union

35
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.800
This will be a big event in history

36
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000
Of course we will also get the rewards we deserve

37
00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.867
Now that we are here

38
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:49.933
Just study hard

39
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:51.933
develop abilities

40
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.367
Yes

41
00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:59.067
The master let Xia Yan go

42
00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:01.533
Why haven't you said a word to us yet?

43
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.400
Does he want to keep you here?
call you

44
00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:09.100
Hello Qian Qiao

45
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.133
This look in your eyes now

46
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:16.200
It doesn’t seem like I’m thanking my benefactor from the sea
The look that saved your life

47
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.667
If Master doesn’t let me go back to Korea this time

48
00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.067
I will smash this place

49
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.033
Set this place on fire

50
00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:24.267
Why didn't you ask for my permission?
Just drink my wine

51
00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:28.167
Please be more generous

52
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.600
Do you plan to put the money in your coffin after you die?

53
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.100
You boy

54
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm leaving Qian Qiao

55
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.200
pour wine

56
00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:50.000
What if I don't let you go back to Korea?

57
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.167
You're going to smash this place and set it on fire.
I heard it all

58
00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.767
I meant to tell you

59
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.400
Save you who is dying from a gunshot wound

60
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.333
Do you know how much it costs to smuggle you across the border?

61
00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:09.067
Pachinko Arcade Private Casino

62
00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:12.100
Lucky Casino protects overseas Chinese businessmen

63
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.133
And fights with the underworld to give away money

64
00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.067
There is no place on my body that is not injured

65
00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:19.067
do it to this extent

66
00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.867
I should get some compensation, right?

67
00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:25.700
You are so scary. Who dares to keep you anymore?

68
00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:33.533
(Lee Hyung-guk)

69
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.233
How does it feel to be reborn?

70
00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.233
As soon as you arrive in Seoul tomorrow

71
00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:57.867
First go to Myeongdong to find the civet cat

72
00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:00.900
(Exchange)
He will give you funds to do things

73
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.133
10% of which is your remuneration

74
00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:11.067
It’s time for me to start doing business in Korea too

75
00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:18.000
You will be my agent

76
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.800
(Phoenix Money Exchange)

77
00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:30.933
The latest information about the companies that the master mentioned

78
00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:34.800
They are all trustworthy PhDs from the Institute of Economics

79
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.600
and opinions from well-known business analysts

80
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.400
What about political situation analysis?

81
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.467
behind

82
00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.467
how much did you spend

83
00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:44.667
The total cost is about 100 million won

84
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.267
Did you spend 100 million won to buy a newspaper?

85
00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:50.900
Mr. Li

86
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.967
What we want to look at is not the company’s packaging

87
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:55.933
We need to use an endoscope
Thoroughly analyze the business

88
00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.700
That kind of information…

89
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.533
where to find

90
00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:01.233
Corporate information of the Ministry of Security and Enterprise

91
00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:03.400
I can go and ask for it myself

92
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.767
In the hands of the Banking Supervision Department
Loss-making enterprise information

93
00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.567
Go get it by hook or by crook.

94
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900
Really?

95
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.033
Yes

96
00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:19.433
Cai Dongba personally and the Kremlin
The Chief Diplomatic Aide was contacted.

97
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.067
Very good

98
00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.367
very good

99
00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:25.167
But he said he had a personal request

100
00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:27.200
And it requires a huge loan

101
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.900
Then we can do the detailed coordination later.

102
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.633
We've overcome the first hurdle

103
00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:32.967
Thank you for your hard work

104
00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:38.267
You will get medals and get promoted

105
00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:39.833
A new world in the future

106
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.733
will be shown before your eyes

108
00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:05.933

And my youth music from Xianyangzi

Representative Wu

113
00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:18.333
You don’t have to look at anyone’s face anymore

114
00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:19.600
Never step back

115
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.667
Let’s move forward bravely together

116
00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.933
I never said I wanted to be with you

117
00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:28.667
Why are you doing this?

118
00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:30.467
I can be a music producer here

119
00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.500
Can also work as an accountant

120
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.467
There are also guards

121
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:33.967
Leave it all to me

122
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.333
You have to save personnel costs anyway

123
00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:38.733
Okay, I'll do it all for you...

127
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.800
how did you know

128
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.700
Me?

129
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.500
You don't know what I have
Is there any national intelligence?

130
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.933
if it is true
You are illegally spying on private companies

131
00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:51.800
My informant is here

132
00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:53.633

Let's get started

140
00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:11.033
Strange...

141
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:12.367
Don’t you have a very high position?

142
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.133
Seasoned fried chicken was also given as an opening gift.

143
00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:16.967
So simple

144
00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:18.800
This is very generous of a civil servant.

145
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.400
thank you

146
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.633
Okay, here you go

149
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.000
Hong Kong movies

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.300
From "A Better Tomorrow"

151
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.967
Hong Kong gangster movies are a hit in China

152
00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.400
These are all movies that have not yet been introduced into China.

153
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.567
There are very good box office in Hong Kong

154
00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:40.900
Your company even does this kind of thing?

155
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.367
It’s our job to understand the culture too

156
00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:44.800
I asked the Hong Kong branch

157
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.300
For representative Wu Dingchen?

158
00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:49.867
Hello

159
00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:52.067
Hong Kong movies compared to Hollywood movies
more profitable

160
00:08:52.067 --> 00:08:54.833
Give it a try. I'll be the first to help you connect.

161
00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:59.133
Thank you for giving me such good information

162
00:08:59.133 --> 00:08:59.900
but you also know

163
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.267
Our company has no funds now

164
00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.767
We should focus on movie planning

165
00:09:03.767 --> 00:09:06.667
take it back
This is very valuable information

166
00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:08.367
You can go to financial institutions for financing

168
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.700

Who will let us finance

170
00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:14.567
Don’t you have me?

171
00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:16.433
I still have this ability

172
00:09:16.433 --> 00:09:18.867
Seize the opportunity when it comes

173
00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:22.467
A plan that requires capital

174
00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:23.867
OMG…

175
00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:27.200
Tetsuo is so handsome

176
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.000
What are you procrastinating about?

177
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.667
Not ready to accept it yet

178
00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:31.533
But...

179
00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:33.567
So do you want to accept my gift or not?

180
00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:35.700
If…

181
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.700
I accept your gift

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.600
what should i do for you

183
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.833
don't push me away

184
00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.067
That's enough

185
00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:48.000
So you accept Luo

186
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.900
Come and pay homage to youth

187
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.633

You also know that you are very bad to me

194
00:10:14.633 --> 00:10:16.667

Hello

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.767
What does it have to do with you...

205
00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.233
Oh my God, there are rats...

206
00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:37.867
I lied to you

207
00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:39.767
what are you doing

208
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.900
Look at me, why don’t I teach you a lesson?

Hello, restaurant soup and rice.

227
00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:04.433

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:05.833
please wait a moment

229
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.833
Who is this guy so bold...

230

From now on this store

231
00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:15.833
Just let me protect you
I need to charge you some protection fees.

232
00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:22.833
"My love"

233
00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:26.067

240
00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:02.533

(closed)

243
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.600
God really has eyes

244
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.933
God has eyes

245
00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:20.400
you now...

246
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.367
What are you going to do?

247
00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.700
Big brother

248
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.467
Do you want revenge?

249
00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.167
Don't mind your own business

250
00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:27.933
How did Douxue survive?

251
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:30.600
Douxue, as long as you are still alive

252
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.167
Never think of revenge

253
00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.433
You also know that we are no match for them

254
00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:37.500
It's like hitting an egg against a stone

255
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.600
Or forget everything

256
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.767
Live with peace of mind

257
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.633
I also want to live peacefully

258
00:13:44.633 --> 00:13:46.800
but in this case
How can I live with peace of mind?

259
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.033
They thought I was dead

260
00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:52.433
If only you knew I was still alive

261
00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:54.433
He will definitely want to kill me again

262
00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:56.333
want to live peacefully

263
00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:58.267
We have to restore everything to its original state

264
00:13:59.133 --> 00:13:59.967
Restoration

265
00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:01.400
Let everything go back to when mom and dad are still alive

266
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.500
Zhenyu is also there

267
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.800
When Dingchen was also by my side

268
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.833
Hey, is that possible?

269
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:08.933
Uncle has passed away

270
00:14:08.933 --> 00:14:10.667
You still have to try your best

271
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:12.300
That is revenge

272
00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:15.200
We can't fight those guys

273
00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:27.267
Yes

274
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.133
I am an egg now

275
00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:35.300
Throwing eggs at stones is what fools do

276
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.667
But…

277
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:41.333
If I also become a stone
The situation will be different, right?

278
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.333
And the enemy is in the open and I am in the dark

279
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.767
you're just a little bastard

280
00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:48.967
How to turn into stone

281
00:14:50.867 --> 00:14:52.233

"I want my voice to spread higher and farther"

285
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.233
Are you responsible for the business's credit?

286
00:15:10.233 --> 00:15:11.033
Yes that's right

287
00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:13.900
I want to go back to Korea to do some business

288
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.533

Is anyone here?

297
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.600
So scary

298
00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.100
so high

299
00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:54.800
Is anyone here?

300
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.967
"Leave it all behind"

301
00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:59.767
"painful time"

302
00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:02.567

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:36.133
Who?

320
00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:38.100
Big brother

321
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.133
Jisoo brother

you two guys

324
00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:45.167
How are you doing?

325
00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.300
Is this really good?

326
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.333
Of course not good

327
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:55.133

I turned the car around

331
00:16:59.367 --> 00:17:03.300
Nothing will happen. It will be easier if you do this.

332
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.200
Is it easy?

333
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.333
Think about what they were fighting about.

334
00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:08.867
That would be easy

335
00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:16.600
good

336
00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:20.367

How are you doing during this time?

353
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:24.300
You ungrateful fellow

354
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:27.100

You unethical guy

362
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.233
I think of you...

363
00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:51.933
In the middle of the night, I would get up in anger

364
00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:53.267

365
00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:00.633

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.100
Just wait and see

376
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.400

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.833
Check three hundred million

380
00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:07.167
There are 500 million in a briefcase

381
00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:11.933
Let's not worry about past grievances.

382
00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:16.000
It's not because we hate each other

383
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.600
But if you are too greedy, you will break up.

384
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.100
Dislike is also one of the reasons

385
00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:26.433
Yongpil, everyone knows you are selling drugs.

386
00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:29.967
My eldest brother has injured his leg and has difficulty moving.

387
00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:31.633
It may be difficult to make a comeback

388
00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:34.367
How is it

389
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.833
Let's do business together

390
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500
Use this 500 million to open a casino

391
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.900
At least ten rooms can be opened

392
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.900
Income fifty-fifty

393
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.767
More casinos to be opened in the future

394
00:20:44.767 --> 00:20:46.300
I’ll let you get six

395
00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:49.033
How is it

396
00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:51.233
To do or not to do

397
00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:58.667
Forget it

398
00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:00.200
do it
do it

399
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.300
So are we business partners now?

400
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.633
Yes that's right

401
00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:17.433
This way…

402
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.433
Are you all together?

403
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.967
That's right

404
00:21:21.967 --> 00:21:23.267
Come

405
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.700
That before becoming business partners

406
00:21:36.467 --> 00:21:39.133
You bastard

407
00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:41.467
Just give me a hundred blows

408
00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:43.700
Forget it, just ten times

409
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.067
Douxue

410
00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:46.500
Please give me some advice, brother

411
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.700
He used to learn boxing

412
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.567
You can kill me in ten strokes

413
00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.300
Give me the sashimi knife

414
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.100
Brother, don't do this

415
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.667
There are nine left now

416
00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:57.000
hateful guy

417
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.867
Brat

418
00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:02.867
If this continues, we will have one less person.
Business partner

419
00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:03.700
It doesn't matter

420
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.067
Yongpil is very strong

421
00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:07.400
More than ten times

422
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.600
Fifteen…

423
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600
Dare to speak

424
00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:18.533
Douxue, please stop big brother

425
00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:20.233
I will really be beaten to death

426
00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:23.500
He really does
That’s what Yongpil said...

427
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.767
Douxue

428
00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:27.867
This is the political analysis report you asked me to do

429
00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:29.100
After the merger of the three parties

430
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.433
Factions get complicated

431
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:32.067
Because it's something I never thought about

432
00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:33.967
The citizens were also surprised

433
00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:36.067
(Three Party Merger Analysis Report)
Thank you for your hard work

434
00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:39.633
I will also use your connections at school in the future.

435
00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:40.833
Maintain a good relationship

436
00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:42.333
Don't worry about money

437
00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:43.400
Rest assured

438
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.633
Buy them a drink and give them money

439
00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:46.300
They all received it very naturally

440
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.867
The classmates all thought

441
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.967
I am very successful in doing business in the United States
call me president kim

442
00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:51.967
thank you

443
00:22:51.967 --> 00:22:54.100
Thanks to you, I can still be the president.

444
00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.633
Are you really a graduate of Seoul National University?

445
00:22:57.633 --> 00:22:59.367
Seoul National University

446
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.000
Dropped out of school halfway through

447
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.733
So I talked to people who studied at Seoul National University
Is it a friend?

448
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.133
What an honor

449
00:23:09.933 --> 00:23:12.567
Hey, we've all been to prison.
Classmates from Prison University

450
00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:14.467
That's true

451
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.933
Yes

452
00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:19.067
You have to run the casino well

453
00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:21.000
That will be the force that supports us

454
00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:24.833
Me too in this regard
Graduation level from Seoul National University

455
00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:26.567
don't worry

456
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.633
Right

457
00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:30.633
Where is Sunwoo?

458
00:23:31.267 --> 00:23:32.833
He called just now

459
00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:34.367
He said he had been lying in wait there for several days.

460
00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:35.633
Didn't see half a person

461
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.833
But…

462
00:23:38.833 --> 00:23:40.767
When are you going to find Dingchen?

463
00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:44.900
Yes, you should go to her first

464
00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:49.467
Of course I have to find her

465
00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.567
Wait until I'm ready

466
00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:54.033
drink

467
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.900
(Paris Salon)

468
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.533
Everyone else is waiting for you

469
00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:07.067
You are here

470
00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:13.933
Mom, didn't you say you had something to tell me?

471
00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:16.767
Yes, you come over first to say hello.

472
00:24:22.167 --> 00:24:24.033
You already know President Qin Yanxi

473
00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:25.600
This is her father

474
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.267
Changsheng Group, the 20th largest enterprise in the financial sector
President Qin Manzhe

475
00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.467
Nice to meet you, prosecutor.

476
00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:33.867
I've wanted to see you for a long time

477
00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:36.300
Nice to meet you President

478
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.133
Meet again

479
00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:40.633
Thanks to you I paid the bail
Subsidize the treasury

480
00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:48.267
Why are you so rigid in doing things?
People have taken the initiative to look for you.

481
00:24:48.267 --> 00:24:49.533
Apologize quickly

482
00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:50.967
Why apologize

483
00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:52.933
He just follows the rules

484
00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:54.333
Yes

485
00:24:54.333 --> 00:24:56.300
He has a lot of backbone

486
00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:58.633
Are you making fun of me?

487
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.300
Would I want to come and meet the target of sarcasm?

488
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.933
Although you don't need to apologize

489
00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:06.167
But I did suffer a lot

490
00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:08.900
So I'm here to treat you to dinner

491
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.333
You can treat me to dinner

492
00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:12.233
Please sit down

493
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.700
President Qin and I occasionally play golf together.

494
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.367
After I heard about President Geum Yeon-hee
shocked

495
00:25:21.367 --> 00:25:23.333
Then I invited them to dinner

496
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:27.100
It's an honor to meet you. Please have a meal.

497
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.133
Although there are elders here

498
00:25:29.133 --> 00:25:31.300
But I must say this

499
00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:33.933
please understand

500
00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:35.100
You say it

501
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.400
Prosecutor Choi detained me last time

502
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.667
I want to detain you this time

503
00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:47.300
Prosecutor Choi

504
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.167
Do you want to date me?

505
00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:58.667
Tetsuo must be made to think that they met by chance

506
00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:02.567
Otherwise he will definitely reject you. You have to be careful.

507
00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:04.000
Of course

508
00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.100
You girl

509
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.733
The elders are all here

510
00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:16.500
You really know how to joke

511
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.000
President Qin, you are very good at making jokes.

512
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.033
I'm not kidding

513
00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:24.133
Aren't you kidding?

514
00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:27.200
Then let me answer you

515
00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:30.800
I have a date

516
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.800
Tetsuo

517
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.067
You should find out by asking around

518
00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:38.667
my father once said

519
00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:42.400
Reading people's hearts is the first step to mastering intelligence

520
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.667
That is to say

521
00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:45.400
Don't understand people's hearts

522
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.100
You are not qualified to use information

523
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.700
Forgive me for taking my leave first.

524
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.133
Tetsuo

525
00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:06.000
Please have tea

526
00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:12.967
what are you doing

527
00:27:12.967 --> 00:27:14.333
Say hello to the president quickly

528
00:27:16.967 --> 00:27:19.700
Hello, my name is Wu Dingchen

529
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.100
yes nice to meet you

530
00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:23.733
But what do you want from me?

531
00:27:23.733 --> 00:27:26.533
President, do you like watching movies?

532
00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:29.033
Movie? Of course

533
00:27:29.033 --> 00:27:30.100
i like it very much

534
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.600
Really?

535
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.333
This is the representative of the film company that I guarantee

536
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:37.500
Can you lend her a loan?

537
00:27:39.233 --> 00:27:41.467
What's the problem?

538
00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:44.100
I will give you the best terms

539
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.967
OK thank you

540
00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:52.733
That's up to you

541
00:28:00.933 --> 00:28:03.200
Thank you very much Tetsuo

542
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.000
You can finally breathe a sigh of relief

543
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.933
How nice to laugh like this

544
00:28:07.933 --> 00:28:09.900
Just relax and live your life, Dingchen

545
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.633
Before buying a movie and making achievements
Can't relax yet

546
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.167
But a good day like today

547
00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.100
Should you invite me for a drink?

548
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.067
Of course I want a treat

549
00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:23.433
let's go to a good place

550
00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:25.800
Really?

551
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.500
It really pisses me off...

552
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.933
Come on, give me some water. Drink some water.

553
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:41.033
No, no matter how much those people love money

554
00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:42.967
It can't be like this, right?

555
00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:47.233
They want us to pay twice as much as we agreed before.
Is this true?

556
00:28:47.233 --> 00:28:49.800
I have been doing land sales all my life

557
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.300
It's the first time I've seen such a bad person

558
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.033
Do they want us to pay twice as much?

559
00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:55.233
Yes

560
00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:58.567
It seems that there are many people who want to buy land.

561
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:02.167
It's better to buy it at the price they shouted.

562
00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:03.533
If so many people want to buy it

563
00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:06.400
Does it mean that the land will soon be
Increased value three to four times

564
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.933
If…

565
00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:11.167
Buy it at the original price
It doesn't matter if you wait three or four years

566
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:13.000
If you buy it for twice the price
Wait another three or four years

567
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.133
There won't be much to earn

568
00:29:15.133 --> 00:29:17.600
And if there is a change of power during this period,

569
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.133
No one knows what will happen

570
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:24.167
Land business is greatly affected by current events

571
00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:25.900
Really

572
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:33.167
What to do now

573
00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:35.367
What else can be done

574
00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:38.467
We don't have the money to pay double the land price now.

575
00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:43.333
Just think of the land and us
It’s fine if there’s no fate

576
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.900
If I had known earlier, I would have paid the deposit immediately.

577
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.167
To save some interest

578
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:50.267
Deliberately postponed the date

579
00:29:50.267 --> 00:29:52.767
I’m so angry. I’ll close early today.

580
00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.500
Find a place to drink a cold beer

581
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.300
aunt

582
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.800
Dingchen

583
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.000
Tetsuo

584
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.833
how are you doing

585
00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.500
Why are you here?

586
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.300
I have some good things today
So I want to treat you to something delicious

587
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.500
I happen to be in a bad mood today
Plan to close early

588
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.367
You came just in time...

589
00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:14.600
Just wait for me

590
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.433
I'll go get my bag and come out

591
00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:18.467
Wait for me...

592
00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:20.667
Wait a minute

593
00:30:22.433 --> 00:30:24.300
Is this the good place you mentioned?

594
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.733
Why don't you like it here?

595
00:30:25.733 --> 00:30:27.600
You haven't seen your aunt for a long time, right?

596
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.700
Yes

597
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.400
I am very happy…

598
00:30:31.233 --> 00:30:33.333
I thought we were drinking it ourselves

599
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:44.900
Come and have one

600
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.467
It doesn't matter to me, aunt, just eat it.

601
00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:47.533
Hurry up

602
00:30:48.733 --> 00:30:50.433
My arm is about to break holding it

603
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.167
Then…

604
00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:57.433
Delicious

605
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.633
Aunt, I want one too

606
00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:03.267
No problem…

607
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.767
Come

608
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.633
Alas...

609
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.300
Super delicious

610
00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:20.167
Are they the only ones with mouths?

611
00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:24.033
Really, a grown man with good hands and feet

612
00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:26.933
Bring it for yourself

613
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.967
Do you want me to pack it myself?

614
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.567
Handsome men and beautiful women sitting together
This picture is so pleasing to the eye

615
00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:49.767
You two are of marriageable age
And so matching

616
00:31:49.767 --> 00:31:51.933
It's just perfect for the two of them to live together

617
00:31:53.567 --> 00:31:54.400
Really?

618
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.300
Alas

619
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.067
Why are you saying this when people are eating?

620
00:31:59.067 --> 00:32:00.633
are you okay

621
00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:02.800
Alas
Aunt, you really are too

622
00:32:05.267 --> 00:32:07.867
Cheers…

623
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:27.500
Already arrived

624
00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:35.567
Yes, come in quickly

625
00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:36.867
you look tired

626
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.433
What's wrong

627
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:44.767
Why are you staring at me?

628
00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:45.933
Did I get something on my face?

629
00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:48.267
No

630
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.567
I'm just thinking

631
00:32:51.567 --> 00:32:53.633
I clearly know your thoughts
Still accepting your help

632
00:32:53.633 --> 00:32:55.567
I'm such a bad woman

633
00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:01.100
If you feel sorry, date me

634
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.333
Strange to say
No matter how beautiful and rich other women are,

635
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.433
I don't even like it

636
00:33:07.433 --> 00:33:09.100
I only have you in my eyes

637
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.633
I just dreamed about my old days in Lishui

638
00:33:16.033 --> 00:33:18.433
Do you remember we had one summer after

639
00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:20.933
Did you go to the beach and play in the water?

640
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.333
Of course I remember

641
00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:33.033
Because the sea water is too ice

642
00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:34.700
As soon as we stepped into the water, we ran back

643
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.067
Still screaming

644
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.400
But you pulled me into the cold water again

645
00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:59.167
To be honest, I was
It's so cold that I get goosebumps

646
00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:03.000
But Douxue is with you and me

647
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.667
let me take courage

648
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:08.267
Can survive in the cold sea water

649
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.433
You are like that to me

650
00:34:19.967 --> 00:34:21.600
Like a precious memory

651
00:34:24.767 --> 00:34:27.000
Day after day, no matter how hard life is

652
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.267
Friends who keep me going

653
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.033
Just like today

654
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.200
Tetsuo, I don’t want to lose
Such precious memories

655
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.500
Dingchen

656
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.767
Thank you for sending me back

657
00:34:48.767 --> 00:34:49.900
I'm going in

658
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.967
Mom

659
00:35:36.967 --> 00:35:38.333
Did you just come back now?

660
00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:40.000
Now you can stop it

661
00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.267
I will return this sentence to you intact.

662
00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:45.967
Dingchen is of no help to you at all.

663
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.967
Mom, I beg you

664
00:35:48.967 --> 00:35:50.633
How did I survive before?

665
00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:53.233
As long as it's for you
I can do anything

666
00:35:53.233 --> 00:35:55.000
It was like this in the past and it will be like this in the future

667
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.233
but what about you

668
00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:59.300
Can't it be for mother?
Make a little compromise?

669
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.300
She is a woman who was engaged to Douxue

670
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.667
Don't you even care?

671
00:36:02.667 --> 00:36:04.733
What should I care about?

672
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.333
Did I kill Brother Douxue?

673
00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.600
Brother Douxue’s mother
He also said that Dingchen and I are very compatible.

674
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.067
You want us two to get married?

675
00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:19.433
Have you gone to see Aunt Zhanyan?

676
00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:23.733
Yes, Dingchen and I will go find her together.

677
00:36:23.733 --> 00:36:25.333
I came back after having dinner with them

678
00:36:26.033 --> 00:36:30.800
You clearly know that I hate you meeting her
Do you still do this?

679
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.900
Mom, you also know
How much have uncles and aunts paid for our family?

680
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.833
why do you hate them so much

681
00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:40.233
Brother Douxue even went to jail on my behalf...

682
00:36:40.233 --> 00:36:43.933
Wait a minute, Mom, please talk to me.

683
00:36:43.933 --> 00:36:45.400
Let me go...

684
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.233
I don't have a son like you

685
00:36:47.233 --> 00:36:48.500
let go
You two, stop arguing.

686
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.667
Your mother gave birth to you and raised you

687
00:36:57.667 --> 00:36:59.700
Compared with me who was late in your life

688
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.000
Her love for you is on a completely different level than mine

689
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.000
Although I said I would respect your opinion

690
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.833
But you have to be considerate of your mother

691
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.733
As long as it's your business

692
00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:16.200
She will do anything for you

693
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.267
She will continue to do that in the future

694
00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:25.633
If we both fell into the water at the same time
Only one of them can be saved

695
00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:29.733
Your mother would never hesitate

696
00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:31.400
Jump into the water to save you

697
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.067
Dad, but this has nothing to do with that, right?

698
00:37:35.433 --> 00:37:38.767
As long as you can't convince your mother

699
00:37:38.767 --> 00:37:41.967
Even if you are crazy about Dingchen
It will also be difficult for you to develop

700
00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:43.467
Dad

701
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.833
You still have a lot to do in the future

702
00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:50.567
And they are all big things

703
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.700
Don't put this off too long

704
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.367
President Qin of Changsheng Group just called

705
00:38:25.267 --> 00:38:27.533
He said there are some misunderstandings between you that need to be resolved.

706
00:38:27.533 --> 00:38:29.700
I'll come back to you later

707
00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:38.933
There is a daughter of a consortium president
Confess to Tetsuo that you want to date him

708
00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:41.700
That consortium is Changsheng Group

709
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.600
Not small and medium-sized enterprises, but prosperous large conglomerates

710
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.433
But Tetsuo was attracted to that smelly girl...

711
00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:48.233
I mean he's obsessed with Dingchen

712
00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:51.200
He also told the woman that he already has someone he likes

713
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.433
You said how hurt their self-esteem must be
Must be very angry

714
00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:59.500
#He said he would look for you tomorrow

715
00:39:00.867 --> 00:39:02.633
What does he want from me?

716
00:39:02.633 --> 00:39:04.633
I'm not sure about this

717
00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:06.667
But he doesn't seem angry

718
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:10.900
Ms. Jiang

719
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.233
I heard you're into real estate

720
00:39:13.233 --> 00:39:15.500
Are you interested in partnering with me?

721
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.533
How dare I dream of partnering with you, President?

722
00:39:20.533 --> 00:39:23.600
My investment in real estate is just a small business
Just planning for retirement

723
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.900
So I want to ask you if you are willing
Expand a small business into a big business

724
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.567
Is there anything worth investing in?

725
00:39:33.567 --> 00:39:38.267
Did you know that in the first phase of New City?
Residential development projects in Suixi area

726
00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:40.267
i know

727
00:39:40.267 --> 00:39:44.600
As far as I know, the residential area in that area
Will the government plan to provide housing for those who do not own their own homes?

728
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.633
That's right

729
00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:49.600
However, recently the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Seoul National Tax Office

730
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.733
Even in newspapers and the military

731
00:39:51.733 --> 00:39:54.800
Guys who speak with some weight
all gathered into interest groups

732
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.867
Request to let one's cronies
You can buy a house through special subscription

733
00:39:58.867 --> 00:40:00.800
Lobbying one after another

734
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:06.033
Even so, the Ministry of Construction and the Seoul Metropolitan Government
Will you agree so easily?

735
00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:08.400
Don't underestimate me, Qin Wanzhe

736
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.933
There is nothing impossible in my dictionary
That’s why I’ve been able to get where I am today

737
00:40:13.933 --> 00:40:17.133
I talked to that interest group
Already dealt with it

738
00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:21.133
If I get it in Shuixi Residential Area
About 35,000 square meters of land

739
00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:24.067
will provide them with special subscriptions

740
00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:25.600
Is this method feasible?

741
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.367
Of course it's possible

742
00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:31.833
The problem is to buy the land

743
00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:35.200
But our company cannot directly come forward

744
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.033
You have to borrow your name to buy and sell.

745
00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:40.767
can you help

746
00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:45.100
If the special subscription method is feasible

747
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.733
How much profit is expected?

748
00:40:47.733 --> 00:40:50.967
Say less...there are 100 billion won

749
00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:14.900
Ms. Jiang

750
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.967
Take a look

751
00:41:17.967 --> 00:41:19.833
right here

752
00:41:19.833 --> 00:41:23.300
Thirty-five thousand square meters of golden hens

753
00:41:27.133 --> 00:41:28.467
what

754
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.533
You want a moratorium on reclamation on the West Coast
Land purchase plan?

755
00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:35.500
Yeah I thought about it carefully

756
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.767
It should take a while over there.

757
00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:43.167
After all, the reclamation project
It can't be completed in a year or two, right?

758
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.533
It’s also a bit far from Seoul.

759
00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:48.200
Want to recover funds
It also seems to take a long time

760
00:41:49.133 --> 00:41:53.967
But I have already coordinated with several people

761
00:41:53.967 --> 00:41:56.167
Anyway, we haven’t signed a contract yet.

762
00:41:58.533 --> 00:42:00.600
You are now…

763
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.600
Are you planning to invest in other targets?

764
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.667
No, I just want to take my time.

765
00:42:05.667 --> 00:42:07.167
Team Leader Wu, I'm sorry.

766
00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:14.967
What's wrong

767
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.233
Is there any problem?

768
00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:19.600
No

769
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:22.867
I understand

770
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.567
(Paris Salon)

771
00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:35.433
I finally arranged it

772
00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:36.800
Are you kidding me?

773
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:44.067
(bringing customers ultimate joy
Jade Electronic Casino)

774
00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:09.333
Is this President Zhu from Jingsheng Hotel?

775
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:13.133
I am Wu Wanxu, who is responsible for managing the company in Nanshan.

776
00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:24.833
(Cui Cheol-woong)

777
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.667
He went to various electronic arcades
Collected tens of millions of won in bribes from them

778
00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:31.700
I personally confirmed it with the operator

779
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.867
He has collected more than one billion won in bribes so far

780
00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:43.200
Fire him immediately and conduct a custodial investigation.

781
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.967
Does it have to go to this point?

782
00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:50.300
He has been working under me for so long

783
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.667
That’s why it’s even more unforgivable

784
00:43:53.667 --> 00:43:56.600
He stained your reputation.

785
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.433
You hate Team Leader Wu very much

786
00:44:00.433 --> 00:44:04.700
That's why he was deliberately excluded
Not on my entourage list

787
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.933
He also takes good care of your mother

788
00:44:07.933 --> 00:44:09.733
Isn't this too heartless of you?

789
00:44:09.733 --> 00:44:14.400
He's good to his mother, it's just his way of survival

790
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.433
How could you not know that?

791
00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:20.267
It's because of the feud between you two in the past
Is that what you would do?

792
00:44:20.267 --> 00:44:21.533
minister

793
00:44:21.533 --> 00:44:23.667
He has already asked for your forgiveness

794
00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:26.800
I will pay more attention to him

795
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.500
For dad's sake
Just let him go this time

796
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.833
I'll take care of you

797
00:44:36.467 --> 00:44:46.467
(Security Planning Department Director’s Office)

798
00:44:55.833 --> 00:45:00.700
No matter how much you ask Tetsuo for forgiveness, Team Leader Wu,

799
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.667
He will not easily forget the trauma in his heart

800
00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.267
Just be considerate of him

801
00:45:05.867 --> 00:45:08.833
Prosecutor Choi works here

802
00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:12.200
If you two meet,
Both sides will be uncomfortable

803
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.933
You might as well take this opportunity
Go to a branch abroad and relax.

804
00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:19.367
minister

805
00:45:19.367 --> 00:45:21.267
I have no other meaning

806
00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:22.900
I'll get you back later

807
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.733
In this case…

808
00:45:28.733 --> 00:45:30.767
Let me go to other counties and cities

809
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.067
Because my father is seriously ill

810
00:45:33.067 --> 00:45:34.667
May die at any time

811
00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:39.467
Okay, think about it
Let me know after you decide on the location.

812
00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:50.767
next

813
00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:52.800
Abominable

fifty

815
00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:55.300
Fifty?

816
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.700
It's really hateful...

817
00:46:02.667 --> 00:46:04.467
wild wolf

818
00:46:04.467 --> 00:46:05.933
Brother, you are here

819
00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:07.967
You are here

820
00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:09.967
Brother, here I come

821
00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:13.300
Business is still so good on weekdays

822
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.800
Today’s revenue should reach the standard

823
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.433
Gamblers don't care whether it's day or night
Weekdays or weekends?

824
00:46:18.433 --> 00:46:20.567
Recently, everyone thinks it’s crowded on weekends

825
00:46:20.567 --> 00:46:22.333
Instead, I prefer to come on weekdays

826
00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:23.500
This is a hundred bundles, right?

827
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.900
good

828
00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:29.033
Alas, big brother, thank you for your hard work.

829
00:46:29.033 --> 00:46:30.000
Jisoo

830
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.400
How's that guy Yongpil's casino business going?

831
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.300
On par with here

832
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.233
But brother, you are still slightly better

833
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.433
That boy is good at stealing money

834
00:46:40.433 --> 00:46:41.667
You need to calculate your money clearly

835
00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:43.667
He's a super bad boy, you know?

836
00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:46.433
I have repeatedly confirmed the amount

837
00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:48.467
That's good

838
00:46:48.467 --> 00:46:49.400
Brother, I'm leaving first

839
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.367
Goodbye

840
00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:51.600
By the way Jisoo

841
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.200
Tell me about it with Douxue

842
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.500
I want to drink offal soup with soju with him

843
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.633
OK, I will convey it to you

844
00:46:56.633 --> 00:46:58.000
You go back

845
00:46:59.533 --> 00:47:00.067
Give this to me as pocket money

846
00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:02.467
Take it, you brat

847
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.500
Hello

848
00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:14.267
Big brother

849
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.133
He went in an hour ago

850
00:47:22.867 --> 00:47:23.900
Big brother

851
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.067
This is the room

852
00:47:42.833 --> 00:47:44.367
Hello Lee Yong Deuk

853
00:47:44.367 --> 00:47:45.600
Li Yongde

854
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.200
You wake up

855
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.767
This guy is high on drugs.

856
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.067
Are you awake yet?

857
00:47:56.467 --> 00:47:57.233
who are you

858
00:47:57.233 --> 00:47:59.767
Don’t you know after watching it?

859
00:47:59.767 --> 00:48:01.067
I am the messenger of hell

860
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.667
Hello

861
00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:06.267
But I didn't do anything bad

862
00:48:06.267 --> 00:48:10.400
How could a guy who didn't do anything bad do this?
Going to jail all day long

863
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.433
Didn't you kill someone four years ago?
Hit and run?

864
00:48:15.567 --> 00:48:17.467
Who told you to do this?

865
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.200
I didn't kill anyone

866
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.833
I don't know

867
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.233
Brat, why don't you hurry up and say it?

868
00:48:24.233 --> 00:48:25.333
I really don't know

869
00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:26.800
i don't know anything

870
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.267
Brat, do you deserve a beating?

871
00:48:33.467 --> 00:48:36.400
Li Yongde, listen carefully.

872
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.067
I can send you to the West right now

873
00:48:39.067 --> 00:48:40.767
Then kill me

874
00:48:41.633 --> 00:48:43.267
I don't want it

875
00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:45.100
Even if I don't kill you now
You won’t live long either

876
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.133
But as long as you recruit from reality

877
00:48:50.133 --> 00:48:51.600
I'll give you money to buy your favorite drug

878
00:49:00.267 --> 00:49:02.067
Please give it to me

879
00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:04.067
You answer the question first

880
00:49:04.067 --> 00:49:05.533
I know you won't give me money even if I tell you.

881
00:49:05.533 --> 00:49:07.500
You're crazy...

882
00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:14.800
thank you…

883
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.233
Drugs are very expensive these days

884
00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:18.033
You can't survive for a few days with that little money.

885
00:49:19.067 --> 00:49:20.433
I have another bundle here

886
00:49:22.467 --> 00:49:23.567
Say it quickly

887
00:49:25.067 --> 00:49:26.400
Who ordered you to hit someone?

888
00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:32.167
That person…

889
00:49:35.133 --> 00:49:37.700
That person is...

890
00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:50.833
Stop drinking. You've already had a lot.

891
00:49:53.367 --> 00:49:56.533
Please let me drink enough today

892
00:49:57.867 --> 00:49:59.867
I feel really guilty

893
00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:03.833
I'm so sorry for my dad

894
00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:42.867
(Boss Gao Fenghao)

895
00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:45.433
Hello, this is Rich Real Estate

896
00:50:45.433 --> 00:50:47.367
Are you the boss Gao Fenghao?

897
00:50:47.367 --> 00:50:49.633
Yes, that's me

898
00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:51.400
I found a nice object

899
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.600
How is it

900
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.167
Do you want to join forces with me to commit real estate fraud?
Make a fortune together

901
00:50:56.933 --> 00:50:59.267
What are you talking about?

902
00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:00.933
I won't do that kind of thing

903
00:51:02.167 --> 00:51:03.600
why are you like this

904
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.200
I called you because I know you are an expert.

905
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.633
Brat, who are you?

906
00:51:07.633 --> 00:51:09.733
I'm going to dig out your eyeballs

907
00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:13.667
If you have the ability, come and dig.

908
00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:15.000
where are you now

909
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.100
What? A public telephone box?

910
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.600
There is such a thing

911
00:51:20.633 --> 00:51:21.933
This bastard

912
00:51:29.833 --> 00:51:31.900
Really

913
00:51:38.767 --> 00:51:41.000
Are you the guy whose eyeballs need to be dug out?

914
00:51:41.967 --> 00:51:43.800
Wait until I finish this pot of instant noodles

915
00:51:44.533 --> 00:51:48.600
Damn boy
Are you still in the mood to eat instant noodles now?

916
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.133
I'm going to pluck out your eyeballs

917
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.767
Oh my god

918
00:51:53.767 --> 00:51:55.567
who are you

919
00:51:55.567 --> 00:51:58.500
Did I see a ghost?

920
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.733
Have you ever seen ghosts eating instant noodles?

921
00:52:00.733 --> 00:52:01.700
Douxue

922
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.300
Big brother

923
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.933
Douxue

924
00:52:03.933 --> 00:52:05.333
Look who's back

925
00:52:05.333 --> 00:52:08.233
Oh my God, Douxue, you're still alive

926
00:52:08.233 --> 00:52:09.300
Oh my god

927
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.167
Are you still healthy?

928
00:52:10.167 --> 00:52:11.467
Of course healthy

929
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:13.767
Let me see…

930
00:52:13.767 --> 00:52:15.567
You've become more handsome

931
00:52:15.567 --> 00:52:16.367
I'm serious

932
00:52:16.367 --> 00:52:18.333
See me so happy

933
00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:20.067
what

934
00:52:20.067 --> 00:52:24.700
You want me to investigate Choi Cheol-woong
All the real estate in your name?

935
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.500
Yes

936
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.067
what do you want to do

937
00:52:27.067 --> 00:52:29.533
Do you really want to commit real estate fraud?

938
00:52:29.533 --> 00:52:30.767
I won't do it

939
00:52:30.767 --> 00:52:33.100
A person should act within his ability

940
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.167
i know

941
00:52:35.167 --> 00:52:37.267
Just help me investigate first.

942
00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:41.733
Now we have to get everyone together again.

943
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.167
I know

944
00:52:44.167 --> 00:52:47.933
Let's go. We need to go see your mother quickly.

945
00:52:47.933 --> 00:52:50.400
Your mother will be shocked

946
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.033
Really

947
00:52:53.033 --> 00:52:56.033
I have some things to deal with now

948
00:52:56.033 --> 00:52:57.733
Please keep the matter of me coming back alive a secret for now.

949
00:52:58.267 --> 00:53:00.333
Anyway, you should let your mother know.

950
00:53:00.333 --> 00:53:02.933
I know brother, you can keep it a secret

951
00:53:02.933 --> 00:53:06.100
But as long as my mother knows I'm alive
He will definitely talk nonsense.

952
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.000
I have to make those people think I'm dead.

953
00:53:13.433 --> 00:53:15.900
You are really crazy

954
00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:21.767
His car is really nice

955
00:53:22.633 --> 00:53:24.100
What's going on

956
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.267
Oops, I know

957
00:53:27.267 --> 00:53:29.133
ok...bye

958
00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:32.967
Madam, what do you want here?

959
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.800
I told you that you are not allowed to meet Tetsuo, right?

960
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.900
I also paid the corresponding price for this

961
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.333
Madam, you misunderstood

962
00:53:59.333 --> 00:54:02.033
It was Tetsuo who took the initiative to come to me for a meal...

963
00:54:02.467 --> 00:54:05.400
Even if he comes to find you
You should be wise enough to avoid it, right?

964
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.167
This is the final warning

965
00:54:11.167 --> 00:54:14.333
If you meet my Tetsuo again

966
00:54:14.333 --> 00:54:17.067
Then you have to be prepared to lose everything

967
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:22.867
I'm a person who does what I say

968
00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:24.267
You should know very well

969
00:54:51.367 --> 00:54:53.200
Oh my God, are you okay?

970
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.100
You just came to work now

971
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.167
That stinky bitch is Choi Cheol-woong’s mother, right?

972
00:55:00.867 --> 00:55:04.667
He is so bad, he must have inherited it from his mother

973
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.833
He's not bad

974
00:55:06.833 --> 00:55:08.800
Our Tetsuo is not bad at all

975
00:55:09.733 --> 00:55:12.567
How is he not bad?

976
00:55:12.567 --> 00:55:14.967
Choi Cheol-woong bullies Doo-hak

977
00:55:14.967 --> 00:55:16.400
And his mother bullied you, Ms. Xu

978
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.133
They are all of the same origin.

979
00:55:18.133 --> 00:55:21.000
Douxue knows this very well, so he...

980
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.000
what did you say

981
00:55:25.833 --> 00:55:29.600
It's okay. Where is the sore patch?

982
00:55:34.433 --> 00:55:35.900
Hello, this is youth time

983
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.533
This is youth time
Yes

984
00:55:37.533 --> 00:55:38.367
Right, that’s right…

985
00:55:38.367 --> 00:55:40.533
There are four characters in total, etc.
"Gambling King"?

986
00:55:40.533 --> 00:55:43.900
That's right, it's starring Chow Yun-fat
Wait a moment. Hello. Hello.

987
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.633
Yes...this is youth time

988
00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:47.367
Yes, it's Chow Yun-fat starring.

989
00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:48.733
It is currently scheduled for next week

990
00:55:48.733 --> 00:55:50.167
OK I understand. Thank you.

991
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:51.833
Keep you waiting for a long time

992
00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:53.700
You're here just in time. Hurry up...

993
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.467
Right…

994
00:55:54.467 --> 00:55:55.967
Where to put it...

995
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.167
OK, right…

996
00:55:58.167 --> 00:55:59.933
That's right

997
00:55:59.933 --> 00:56:01.833
Yes, we will contact you after confirmation

998
00:56:01.833 --> 00:56:02.733
Answer the phone for me

999
00:56:02.733 --> 00:56:03.700
What am I going to say…

1000
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.433
Said this is youth time

1001
00:56:05.433 --> 00:56:07.667
Hello, this is youth time

1002
00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:09.633
OK thank you

1003
00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:12.833
"Through your moist eyes"

1004
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:16.000
"I understand what tears are"

1005
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.700
"You are so unique to me"

1006
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:28.733
"I want to tell you I love you"

1007
00:56:28.733 --> 00:56:38.267
"And you say goodbye that makes people sad"

1008
00:56:38.267 --> 00:56:45.133
"That's love too"

1009
00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:52.167
"I can't send you away"

1010
00:56:52.167 --> 00:56:54.933
Awesome…

1011
00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:57.600
I love Chow Yun-fat

1012
00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:04.067
"Do I have to spend the long night with tears?"

1013
00:57:04.067 --> 00:57:07.167
"Lost tears, lost years"

1014
00:57:07.167 --> 00:57:11.233
"And my lost youth"

1015
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.067
"Lost tears, lost years"

1016
00:57:15.067 --> 00:57:20.800
"And my lost youth"

1017
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.167
Where did the key go?

1018
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.833
Dingchen

1019
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.267
Dingchen

1020
00:57:37.967 --> 00:57:41.033
I probably didn't drink much today

1021
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.700
who are you

1022
00:58:07.833 --> 00:58:09.433
I ask who you are

1023
00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:16.100
it's me

1024
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.433
It seems that I miss you too much

1025
00:58:36.433 --> 00:58:38.833
This is impossible…

1026
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.933
"No matter you will be here"

1027
00:58:41.933 --> 00:58:47.033
"Forever love the only one"

1028
00:58:47.033 --> 00:58:49.700
"I wanna look at your mind"

1029
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.567
"Take me your eyes"

1030
00:58:51.567 --> 00:58:55.433
"Let me in beautiful
your life"

1031
00:58:55.433 --> 00:58:57.467
"Come over here"

1032
00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:03.267
"Back in your love
in my life"

1033
00:59:03.267 --> 00:59:11.033
"Let me go in my life"

1034
00:59:11.033 --> 00:59:18.100
"Let me go in your life"

1035
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:23.133
"Love you no more"
Impossible…

1036
00:59:23.133 --> 00:59:26.700
"I wanna be myself"
Are you really a scholar?

1037
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.533
"Let me go in my life"

1038
00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.533
Douxue

1039
00:59:33.567 --> 00:59:37.333
"I wanna hold your hand"

1040
00:59:37.333 --> 00:59:41.167
"I wanna be like a birthday"

1041
00:59:41.167 --> 00:59:43.867
"No matter you will be here"

1042
00:59:43.867 --> 00:59:48.933
"Forever love the only one"

1043
00:59:48.933 --> 00:59:51.600
"I wanna look at your mind"

1044
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.600
"Take me your eyes"

1045
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.467
"Let me in beautiful
your life"

1046
00:59:57.467 --> 00:59:59.400
"Come over here"

1047
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:04.300
"Back in your love
in my life"

1048
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:11.867
"Let me go in my life"

1049
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:18.833
"Let me go in your life"

1050
01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:24.833
"Love you no more"

1051
01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:27.433
"I wanna be myself"
(Preview of next episode)

1052
01:00:27.433 --> 01:00:28.300
I found it

1053
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.367
Are you talking about hit and run people?

1054
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:31.367
No, he was the guy who ordered him to kill someone.

1055
01:00:31.367 --> 01:00:33.467
This seems to be an anonymous report from the industry

1056
01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:34.600
Do you want to make it public?

1057
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.567
The murder case in Lishui that ruined my life...

1058
01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:40.433
Are you all involved in the revenge plan?

1059
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:41.400
Better give up

1060
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.300
Anyway, it’s impossible to restore everything to its original state.

1061
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.467
Are you worried about Tetsuo?

1062
01:00:44.467 --> 01:00:46.067
Deep in everyone's heart

1063
01:00:46.067 --> 01:00:49.033
There is a Pandora's box that cannot be opened.

1064
01:00:49.033 --> 01:00:51.533
Someone killed the most important witness

1065
01:00:51.533 --> 01:00:52.733
That's right, it's the person you think of

1066
01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:54.033
No nonsense allowed

1067
01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:55.400
Is this the end of it?

1068
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:55.933
I…

1069
01:00:55.933 --> 01:00:56.700
Why are you doing this?

1070
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.700
aunt

1071
01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.367
Why are you so scared?

1072
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:00.933
I thought you had severed ties with me

1073
01:01:00.933 --> 01:01:01.767
Wu Wanxu?

1074
01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:03.267
He has a gun on him

1075
01:01:03.267 --> 01:01:04.900
Who is this?

1076
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.033
Died by his own gun

1077
01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:08.367
How does it feel?
