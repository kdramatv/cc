(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.733
(Episode 4)

3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.133
"How can we forget our old friends"

4
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:32.400
"How can I not think about it in my heart?"

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.233
"How can we forget"

6
00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:36.967
thank you

7
00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:38.367
please have fun

8
00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.033
"Old Friends"

9
00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:47.367
"Friendship lasts forever"

10
00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:22.100
Please invite Jiang Ruzhen, a representative of the Paris Salon

11
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:35.442
thank you

12
00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:39.809
Thank you for your hard work today

13
00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:41.575
nothing

14
00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:43.216
Having said that

15
00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:44.509
You are really awesome

16
00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.575
Even the decoration is done by myself

17
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:51.509
I seem to have seen my college days again
That smart, confident and beautiful you

18
00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.642
Why do you keep praising me?

19
00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:56.242
I'm old

20
00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.675
I mean it

21
00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.242
You are more beautiful than anyone here today

22
00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:03.642
You really know how to say polite words

23
00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.009
But…

24
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.875
How should I repay you?

25
00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:13.242
What's so hard about repaying me?

26
00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:30.342
have you heard this song

27
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:33.209
Why is this record here?

28
00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.875
This is what I overheard

29
00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.442
A favorite chanson

30
00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:42.209
I never thought about it

31
00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.542
I just asked the band to recommend me.
A few chansons to create an atmosphere

32
00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:50.842
What a coincidence

33
00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:53.475
This is fate

34
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.209
Maybe it's fate

35
00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:01.075
I don't even know what the lyrics mean

36
00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:09.275
my whole life

37
00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.675
always waiting for you

38
00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:16.209
The lyrics of this song express my feelings

39
00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.375
you've always been like this

40
00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.409
I will feel very sorry for you

41
00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.042
I seem to have drunk too much. I feel dizzy.

42
00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:39.409
Are you feeling dizzy?

43
00:04:40.142 --> 00:04:42.609
It's okay. You should just take a rest.

44
00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:46.409
very late

45
00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.942
My son said he would go home today

46
00:04:48.942 --> 00:04:50.442
He should have been waiting for me for a long time

47
00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:52.875
You go back first, Brother Zhongzhong

48
00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.109
Team Leader Wu will send you back

49
00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:04.642
are you ok

50
00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:09.275
Yeah

51
00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.375
Although it is a belated greeting

52
00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.342
But congratulations on your successful store opening event

53
00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:14.909
It's all thanks to the team leader

54
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:18.409
And about records

55
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.642
thank you very much

56
00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:22.209
you're welcome

57
00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:24.509
That's a song the deputy commander often listens to

58
00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.475
Can I listen with Ms. Jiang?

59
00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:27.575
Isn't it better?

60
00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:29.942
I just want to thank you for asking me

61
00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.109
Did you two listen together?

62
00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:33.742
Yes

63
00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.209
Right

64
00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.342
Please never tell the deputy chief
I asked you about this

65
00:05:41.342 --> 00:05:42.609
What's wrong with this

66
00:05:49.575 --> 00:05:50.542
to you

67
00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.675
Although not much

68
00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.042
But this is what I want

69
00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.375
No need

70
00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.942
I will be scolded by the deputy commander

71
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:02.442
I hope you will assist the deputy chief well in the future.
Just given to you

72
00:06:02.442 --> 00:06:03.542
you can accept it

73
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.575
thank you

74
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.275
You worked hard today

75
00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:30.642
No. Thank you for helping me so much.

76
00:06:30.642 --> 00:06:32.209
Go in and have a rest.

77
00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:33.175
good

78
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.009
Mom

79
00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.175
Why did you come back so late?

80
00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:53.709
Who is that?

81
00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.275
Yeah, the person who helps mom in the store

82
00:07:00.142 --> 00:07:02.609
Son, let's go in quickly

83
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.909
Mom is in a good mood today

84
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.075
You have a drink with me

85
00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:12.442
I really want to drink with you

86
00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:13.575
but i have to go

87
00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:15.642
Because I have an exam starting tomorrow

88
00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:18.742
your first time home
Going back so soon

89
00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:21.575
I will come back often in the future, really

90
00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:23.742
son

91
00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:25.942
You know mom only has you now, right?

92
00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:30.142
If someone dares to hinder your future

93
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:34.742
Even if my mother is shattered to pieces
I will also help you get rid of that person

94
00:07:35.775 --> 00:07:37.075
So son

95
00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:40.742
you can't let me down

96
00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:42.842
You must take the exam for senior civil servants

97
00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:45.642
don't worry

98
00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:49.175
Mom, I will never let you down

99
00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:55.342
I also want to be a powerful person

100
00:07:57.756 --> 00:07:59.942
Why is my son so good?

101
00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:15.809
I sent her back

102
00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:18.942
But…

103
00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:20.375
Cui Zhexiong is also at home

104
00:08:21.842 --> 00:08:23.675
He probably didn't recognize me

105
00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:29.442
But...

106
00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:32.675
If I let Ms. Jiang know in the future

107
00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:37.109
Cui Zhexiong’s matter is related to you...

108
00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:38.242
Doesn't that matter?

109
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.775
She can never know in her life

110
00:08:44.609 --> 00:08:45.809
home run

111
00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:48.675
home run…

112
00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:50.542
boss

113
00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:52.909
walk slowly

114
00:08:55.475 --> 00:08:57.042
(All sold out)

115
00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.575
(Refuse to buy scalper tickets)

116
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:03.809
Uncle, I have a ticket here

117
00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:04.942
30,000 won per piece

118
00:09:04.942 --> 00:09:06.309
What?

119
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:08.509
It's already the second half of the second game.

120
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:10.109
Deduct the money from the first game

121
00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:11.442
25,000 won

122
00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:16.442
OK 27,000 won

123
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:19.609
good

124
00:09:19.609 --> 00:09:20.742
good

125
00:09:23.142 --> 00:09:23.875
Hyung Soo

126
00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:25.442
3 tickets worth 27,000 won

127
00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:27.809
The second round is about to end

128
00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:30.642
Okay…

129
00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:31.775
take it

130
00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:33.309
I wish you a happy watching football

131
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:34.309
Come on

132
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.342
Come on

133
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.275
Let's go watch football

134
00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:40.442
Let's go

135
00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:42.542
Give them 3 tickets

136
00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:43.675
How much does one cost?

137
00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:46.942
10,000 won

138
00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:48.009
Total 30,000 won

139
00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:49.875
You kid is really...

140
00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:50.709
Hello

141
00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.042
We have no cost

142
00:09:52.909 --> 00:09:55.609
These are the tickets we queued up for last night

143
00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:56.675
Really

144
00:09:57.609 --> 00:09:59.242
We don't want to sell it, just go away

145
00:09:59.242 --> 00:10:02.475
He has promised to sell it to me for 10,000
How can anyone be like this?

146
00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:04.142
what

147
00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:06.042
That's how I am

148
00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:08.309
Don't make me angry

149
00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.909
Just listen to the radio, you know?

150
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:17.509
Sorry

151
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:18.509
Wait

152
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.442
I'll sell you the tickets

153
00:10:26.609 --> 00:10:27.675
thank you

154
00:10:28.075 --> 00:10:29.075
Say thank you quickly

155
00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:30.775
thank you
thank you

156
00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:31.542
thank you

157
00:10:31.542 --> 00:10:32.975
I wish you a happy watching football game

158
00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:36.842
Do the kids want to watch the game?

159
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:42.242
Are all the tickets sold out?

160
00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:46.409
Only one left

161
00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:47.742
one piece

162
00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:50.375
Can you give me the remaining one for free?

163
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.575
Which brat is it again...

164
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:56.809
it's me

165
00:10:56.809 --> 00:10:58.042
Li Douxue
it's you

166
00:10:58.042 --> 00:10:59.375
You scared us, brat.

167
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:00.042
Brother

168
00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.309
Brother Xuanyu

169
00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:06.775
Li Douxue

170
00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:08.542
Why are you selling scalper tickets?

171
00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:11.275
You are much thinner

172
00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:12.609
i got fat

173
00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.942
Come…

174
00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:25.309
I heard you were released from prison when I went to visit you.

175
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.975
sorry

176
00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.475
But you came to us now, you brat?

177
00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:30.375
You are obviously very happy

178
00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:31.609
Come to Xuanyu

179
00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:34.575
By the way, have you heard about Yong Pil?

180
00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:37.909
that guy

181
00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:39.342
what are you doing now

182
00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:43.309
in our constituency
MPs who work for the country

183
00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:48.109
(2 years ago Gwangju Prison)
I feel that the state’s sentence for money order fraud is too light

184
00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.442
MPs hope they can last a lifetime

185
00:11:51.442 --> 00:11:53.209
Can't hold the spoon

186
00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:55.609
The old man you are loyal to is not a congressman.

187
00:11:55.609 --> 00:11:58.342
He is the scum of the world and an unscrupulous boss

188
00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:03.242
I…

189
00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:06.242
don't know that person

190
00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:09.075
Of course you don't know him

191
00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:12.575
That building in Cheonan that you used to defraud

192
00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:14.142
It's his sister-in-law's building

193
00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:16.303
I don't know

194
00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:17.736
I really don't know

195
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.003
i was wrong

196
00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:21.336
Let's get started

197
00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:22.603
Don't do this

198
00:12:23.636 --> 00:12:24.903
Take it quickly

199
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.103
i can't do it

200
00:12:28.936 --> 00:12:30.670
I can't do it either

201
00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:36.570
Hey brat

202
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.803
There's going to be a night patrol soon.

203
00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:45.270
what are you doing here

204
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.036
who is this guy

205
00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:48.203
People who share the same room with them

206
00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.003
children

207
00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.770
are you calling me

208
00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:17.603
What are you doing here?

209
00:13:26.036 --> 00:13:27.236
Oh my god

210
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.536
Don't move at all

211
00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:41.436
boy

212
00:13:41.436 --> 00:13:43.270
You don't know who I am?

213
00:13:44.203 --> 00:13:46.036
I think you don’t want to live anymore

214
00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:49.336
You don’t know who I am either, right?

215
00:13:49.336 --> 00:13:51.703
I had no intention of living in the first place

216
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.803
If you don't let me go

217
00:13:54.803 --> 00:13:56.870
I don't know what I'll do to you

218
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.703
Really?

219
00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:00.436
Whatever you want

220
00:14:00.436 --> 00:14:02.036
Looks like we want to live together

221
00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:03.636
Still have to die together

222
00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:05.236
what are you doing

223
00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:06.370
what are you doing

224
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.736
What are you doing?

225
00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:09.136
Don't move

226
00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:11.570
Don't move

227
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.370
Be careful I'll kill you...

228
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.070
Hello me...

229
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.370
I'll cut you into pieces

230
00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:19.070
Xuanyu

231
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.836
do you really want to die

232
00:14:20.836 --> 00:14:24.303
When have you ever seen me holding a knife?

233
00:14:24.303 --> 00:14:24.936
No?

234
00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:25.903
Of course not

235
00:14:25.903 --> 00:14:27.303
You tell him

236
00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:29.870
Please act more handsomely
Yes

237
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.136
More handsome?

238
00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:32.170
You act again

239
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.303
Be careful I'll kill you...

240
00:14:33.303 --> 00:14:35.336
Just say I don’t hold a knife anymore

241
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.070
Douxue, you suffered a lot because of Yongbi.

242
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.670
The average person goes into the solitary room once
He will become good immediately

243
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.770
But you were imprisoned four times

244
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.103
You are probably the first person in the history of the Ministry of Justice, right?

245
00:14:54.403 --> 00:14:55.503
Yes

246
00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:04.603
I'm in solitary confinement

247
00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:06.936
I finally understand why prison is a school

248
00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:10.070
The world is so dangerous

249
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.236
You can never learn by studying

250
00:15:13.236 --> 00:15:14.603
That's right

251
00:15:14.603 --> 00:15:16.170
You're a rookie

252
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.070
When did you start training?

253
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.436
I am now a five-star general

254
00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:21.303
right

255
00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:22.703
Yes that's right

256
00:15:22.703 --> 00:15:23.470
right

257
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.736
Come and raise a glass

258
00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:28.070
To the five-star general

259
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.603
Cheers

260
00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:34.703
I've been waiting for a long time

261
00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.570
I'm afraid auntie will change her mind

262
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.170
Got the luggage right away

263
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.436
Hey, you can't put away unwashed clothes
Bring it too

264
00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:47.603
You wash and wear it here

265
00:15:47.603 --> 00:15:48.736
what

266
00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:56.170
"Things that are past"

267
00:15:57.703 --> 00:16:03.503
"Even if you try hard to save it"

268
00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:12.003
"tears of sadness flow"

269
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.736
what are you doing

270
00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:17.103
You…

271
00:16:17.103 --> 00:16:18.470
Aren't you afraid of me?

272
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.036
Afraid but...

273
00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:23.936
you are beautiful

274
00:16:23.936 --> 00:16:30.770
"Dark eyes like starlight"

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:33.503
(Sun Film Company Land Registration Certificate)

276
00:16:33.503 --> 00:16:35.170
Have you heard of Sun Films?

277
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.170
Their office is right here

278
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.336
drive carefully

279
00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:47.436
good

280
00:16:50.103 --> 00:16:51.836
Walk slowly, brother

281
00:16:57.436 --> 00:16:59.336
The owner seems to believe you

282
00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:01.403
Of course I believe it

283
00:17:01.836 --> 00:17:03.136
So tired…

284
00:17:07.136 --> 00:17:08.470
What's wrong with you, brat?

285
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.703
If Busan accounts for 20% of the distribution market
What about Seoul and Gyeonggi-do?

286
00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:14.670
Including the small copyright market
Seoul accounts for 33%

287
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.070
Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province
The total should account for 15%

288
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.703
But if you want to enter the Jingjiang area

289
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.036
You have to target the Central Publishing Company

290
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.003
You might have to risk your life

291
00:17:31.003 --> 00:17:32.370
Central Distribution Company?

292
00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:44.803
(College Music Festival award-winning singer Shin Bo-yeon)

293
00:17:55.236 --> 00:17:56.170
let's drink

294
00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:58.470
Now?

295
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.203
My boss wants me to only sing during the daytime

296
00:18:00.203 --> 00:18:02.036
He said the guests tonight didn't like it

297
00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:22.603
Dad

298
00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:25.336
Am I useless?

299
00:18:26.703 --> 00:18:29.403
Can't even hold on to a small theater

300
00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:33.836
But you don't have to worry

301
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.803
I will definitely buy back our theater

302
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.970
I miss you so much dad

303
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.436
And mom

(Sender: Wu Dingchen)
(Recipient: Li Douxue, letter returned)

305
00:18:59.303 --> 00:19:00.636
Hello Li Douxue

306
00:19:04.236 --> 00:19:06.170
How are you doing, kid?

307
00:19:09.836 --> 00:19:11.336
are you out of jail

308
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:15.436
You should be out of jail

309
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.403
Also

310
00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:22.270
Instead of seeing the other person living a useless life

311
00:19:23.403 --> 00:19:25.236
It's better to break up

312
00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:28.436
we are well divided

313
00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:48.370
please let go

314
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.503
Still free

315
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.470
what

316
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:02.236
I thought as time passed
She will slowly forget you

317
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.103
I think you guys should break up

318
00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:12.903
This is my last wish

319
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.303
please help me

320
00:20:31.736 --> 00:20:32.770
Douxue

321
00:20:33.203 --> 00:20:34.670
Really
Douxue

322
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.870
Where have you been and only now are you back?

323
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.836
Brother Feng Hao was taken away

324
00:20:39.836 --> 00:20:40.803
what

325
00:20:40.803 --> 00:20:41.803
Which police station is he at?

326
00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:42.770
If it's the police

327
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.670
You can also buy it with money

328
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.270
He was captured by Guangzhuo

329
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.603
That kid because of what happened before
Always holding a grudge

330
00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:53.036
I'm not telling you to stay with Brother Feng Hao

331
00:20:53.036 --> 00:20:53.870
sorry

332
00:20:54.803 --> 00:20:55.703
Douxue

333
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.736
They want you to go there alone

334
00:20:58.736 --> 00:20:59.703
what to do

335
00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.203
Absolutely not

336
00:21:08.203 --> 00:21:10.036
If you go, you will die, Dou Xue

337
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.503
They just haven't expanded their sphere of influence yet.

338
00:21:13.503 --> 00:21:15.736
You didn’t know that Kwang Tak Gang is in Seoul
Is it one of the top five gangs?

339
00:21:17.336 --> 00:21:19.036
I know you are very loyal

340
00:21:19.036 --> 00:21:21.270
But if you go like this, you are asking for death.

341
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.203
Hello Xuanyu

342
00:21:23.203 --> 00:21:24.270
what do you think

343
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.403
I don't care

344
00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:27.903
As long as you are here

345
00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:30.436
Hey, there are so many of them

346
00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:31.903
And not with bare hands

347
00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:33.770
Will bring guys with me

348
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.670
Whether it's a surprise attack or a head-on battle

349
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.370
Even that...

350
00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:43.203
By the way, even Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan
It’s also hard to come back alive

351
00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:44.336
It doesn't matter

352
00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:47.070
I just need to defeat Guangzhuo

353
00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:53.136
Hey, is it time to clean now?

354
00:21:59.103 --> 00:22:00.236
Douxue

355
00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.536
Are you writing the Three Kingdoms?

356
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:04.636
Is it enough for the leader to compete in a one-on-one battle?

357
00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:08.103
Do you think those people are in the underworld?
So elegant and noble

358
00:22:08.103 --> 00:22:09.936
What else should I do?

359
00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:12.436
I can't leave Brother Feng Hao alone.

360
00:22:13.436 --> 00:22:14.403
Surrender

361
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.503
what

362
00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:18.703
I heard that Lian Guangzhuo is a very loyal person

363
00:22:18.703 --> 00:22:21.203
You went alone to save Brother Feng Hao

364
00:22:21.203 --> 00:22:22.703
He might accept your surrender

365
00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:26.403
Surrender?

366
00:22:26.403 --> 00:22:28.203
You have to fight to save the prison at the same time

367
00:22:28.203 --> 00:22:30.370
Are you going to be Lian Guangzhuo's younger brother?

368
00:22:31.236 --> 00:22:33.836
If he wants to be successful, he can definitely become famous.

369
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:36.503
Just don't be a little brother

370
00:22:39.436 --> 00:22:40.636
What else can I do if I am not my younger brother?

371
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.403
he's coming

372
00:22:54.403 --> 00:22:56.503
The one who can fight very well...

373
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.536
Look who's here. Long time no see.

374
00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:07.103
Liu Yongbi

375
00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:09.503
Do you remember that I was in jail?
What did I say to you?

376
00:23:09.503 --> 00:23:10.936
I won't let you live

377
00:23:18.803 --> 00:23:20.370
You can still laugh

378
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.070
It was your elder brother who came to see me today

379
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.570
Stop making trouble

380
00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:42.636
people brought

381
00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:46.370
Douxue

382
00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:49.036
My name is Li Douxue

383
00:23:49.503 --> 00:23:52.736
You stand out

384
00:23:52.736 --> 00:23:56.670
Became the boss of the Land King at the age of 25

385
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.203
What boss...

386
00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:04.036
Aren't you our boss?

387
00:24:04.036 --> 00:24:06.970
What? Aren’t you the boss?

388
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.470
I should...

389
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.036
That's right, hmm...

390
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:16.470
Brother Feng Hao is following me

391
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.403
We grew up together like brothers in an orphanage.

392
00:24:20.403 --> 00:24:22.936
Originally, I would even share a bean.

393
00:24:22.936 --> 00:24:26.203
Will make money now
He treats me like a stranger

394
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.736
what do you think

395
00:24:28.736 --> 00:24:30.436
You are the boss. Tell me.

396
00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:32.703
A bean can be eaten separately

397
00:24:32.703 --> 00:24:35.003
But it's absolutely impossible to divide a bag of beans

398
00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:36.603
this is human nature

399
00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.570
Really?

400
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.103
So inhumane

401
00:24:45.103 --> 00:24:48.303
Then you are the boss, you should be responsible, right?

402
00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:53.870
However

403
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.270
I don't want to live so mean

404
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.103
that bag of beans

405
00:24:59.103 --> 00:25:00.470
Let's share it together

406
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.770
From now on we will be a family

407
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.736
What a family

408
00:25:12.503 --> 00:25:13.703
Big brother

409
00:25:15.136 --> 00:25:16.236
Xuanyu

410
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.103
Brat, you took the wrong medicine

411
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.236
How is it

412
00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:45.803
Do you want to treat us as a family?

413
00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:51.436
That was the four of us yesterday
Half the money you make selling ticket scalpers at the ballpark.

414
00:25:51.436 --> 00:25:53.903
Recently, because of the strict control

415
00:25:53.903 --> 00:25:55.703
So business is not very good

416
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.770
You are so courageous. You are very talented...

417
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.703
come have a drink

418
00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:25.836
But I heard that you will never bow to others

419
00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:28.936
I heard that you never bowed your head to Yong Pil in prison.

420
00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:32.370
But why did you suddenly bow your head in front of me?

421
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.003
Do you want me to guess?

422
00:26:34.003 --> 00:26:37.103
This sentence is very popular among young people recently

423
00:26:37.103 --> 00:26:39.936
Keep friends by your side

424
00:26:39.936 --> 00:26:43.503
The enemy must be inseparable

425
00:26:43.503 --> 00:26:49.003
It is easiest to betray those around you

426
00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:51.670
This is called a coup

427
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.770
Have you heard of the coup?

428
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.203
Are you trying to destroy my gang?

429
00:27:02.136 --> 00:27:03.770
Say it

430
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.070
Right?

431
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.303
was discovered

432
00:27:15.703 --> 00:27:17.370
You are so observant

433
00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:19.970
Yongbi

434
00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:22.903
You kid...

435
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.070
What are you still doing?

436
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.303
Come here quickly

437
00:27:38.703 --> 00:27:40.903
Just in case…

438
00:27:40.903 --> 00:27:42.470
They won't let me surrender

439
00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:45.770
This is the last time students

440
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.936
During a protest near a baseball stadium
The tear gas I picked up

441
00:27:47.936 --> 00:27:49.403
You should be able to run away with this

442
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.536
Are there towels?

443
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.736
Get away, brat

444
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.236
Did you think you were going to kill me?
It'll be fine

445
00:29:16.336 --> 00:29:19.936
My boys will chase you
To the ends of the earth

446
00:29:19.936 --> 00:29:21.836
we won't do anything to you

447
00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.970
Even if you let me go now, you won't be able to survive.

448
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.103
So you'd better kill me now

449
00:29:28.703 --> 00:29:31.336
I say it again

450
00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.303
I won't die and we won't kill you

451
00:29:35.203 --> 00:29:37.170
What do you want?

452
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.903
It’s already overflowing and it’s hard to recover

453
00:29:38.903 --> 00:29:40.836
Even if the water spills out

454
00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:41.936
As long as the cup is not broken

455
00:29:41.936 --> 00:29:43.636
Just put it back in

456
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.036
Big brother

457
00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:03.803
Kneel down quickly

458
00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.236
Really

459
00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.336
Brother, the cup is not broken yet

460
00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:16.136
We are willing to be your water

461
00:30:16.136 --> 00:30:18.636
Stop playing tricks, you brat.

462
00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:20.003
I mean it

463
00:30:20.503 --> 00:30:22.903
As long as you are willing to accept us

464
00:30:22.903 --> 00:30:25.036
We can hand over the land king
Half of the income is given to you

465
00:30:27.336 --> 00:30:29.636
what do you want to do

466
00:30:29.636 --> 00:30:31.403
I know you are very ambitious

467
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.703
You won’t be content with staying in Muqiaodong, right?

468
00:30:34.703 --> 00:30:37.403
To dominate Myeongdong and Seoul

469
00:30:37.403 --> 00:30:39.770
You need men like me

470
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.003
I need...

471
00:30:41.003 --> 00:30:43.870
Bosses and organizations like you

472
00:30:47.503 --> 00:30:50.303
What do you mean...I am Liu Bei

473
00:30:50.303 --> 00:30:53.470
Are you...Zhao Zilong?

474
00:30:55.003 --> 00:30:56.770
You can think whatever you want

475
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.803
Very good

476
00:30:57.803 --> 00:30:59.636
But…

477
00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:02.670
How can I trust that you won't betray me?

478
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.703
I always need some guarantee, right?

479
00:31:06.703 --> 00:31:11.603
If you need guarantee
That's the deal. We're no longer a family.

480
00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.336
Because no matter what guarantee I put out

481
00:31:13.336 --> 00:31:14.770
You will doubt me

482
00:31:22.436 --> 00:31:23.970
ok

483
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.103
Then we...

484
00:31:29.103 --> 00:31:31.136
Just find someone else

485
00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:32.670
Please walk carefully and slowly

486
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.303
Then come to Taoyuan to have a romantic relationship.

487
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.703
Let's just be a family, brat

488
00:31:55.903 --> 00:31:57.070
give me a cigarette

489
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.336
How is it

490
00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:20.370
Have you done your homework well during this time?

491
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.803
boss

492
00:32:22.803 --> 00:32:25.003
Do you want to make more money?

493
00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:29.639
But Gwangju market only accounts for 10% of the entire market

494
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.970
Movie companies can only make so much money

495
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.003
Just stop showing off.

496
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.936
We…

497
00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:38.536
Let’s attack the Gyeonggi-do market

498
00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:41.036
what

499
00:32:41.036 --> 00:32:46.203
Two or three years ago, Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province
Only accounts for 15% of the total market

500
00:32:46.203 --> 00:32:48.703
But as satellite cities in the metropolitan area
rapid increase

501
00:32:48.703 --> 00:32:50.870
The market has become bigger

502
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.370
Very potential to make money

503
00:32:53.103 --> 00:32:55.770
what are you talking about

504
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.903
You can't do things like this in this circle

505
00:32:57.903 --> 00:33:00.403
Taking someone's territory will get you into trouble

506
00:33:00.403 --> 00:33:02.136
You might be hacked with a knife

507
00:33:02.136 --> 00:33:03.736
Markets in Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do

508
00:33:03.736 --> 00:33:06.570
has been divided among three film companies

509
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.170
How do we get in?

510
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.770
Break the triangle structure

511
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:10.936
squeeze out a company

512
00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:13.036
replaced by us

513
00:33:15.803 --> 00:33:16.503
What can you do

514
00:33:16.503 --> 00:33:18.103
Think of a way from now on

515
00:33:18.603 --> 00:33:22.103
But if I can really do it

516
00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:23.870
can you give me shares

517
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.136
Look at you vixen

518
00:33:29.103 --> 00:33:30.403
OK, give it a try

519
00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:32.870
If it can be successful, let alone shares

520
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.403
You want me to marry you

521
00:33:35.403 --> 00:33:36.803
Really?

522
00:33:36.803 --> 00:33:39.236
You must abide by the agreement

523
00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:44.703
You girl have already thought about it, right?

524
00:33:45.336 --> 00:33:46.670
good

525
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.503
You give it a try

526
00:33:48.503 --> 00:33:50.370
old…boss

527
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.970
How many shares does Brother Guang Zhuo hold?

528
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.436
He didn't invest at all

529
00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:58.603
I got 30% just for helping with management.

530
00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:01.836
30% What a robber

531
00:34:01.836 --> 00:34:05.836
If you spend your own money eating, drinking and having sex
What kind of gangster is he?

532
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:09.203
But I remember their account books were in a mess

533
00:34:09.203 --> 00:34:10.703
Not to mention turnover

534
00:34:11.503 --> 00:34:16.503
Yong Pil and the liquor wholesaler he manages
I made two sets of accounts and smuggled my drinking money.

535
00:34:24.403 --> 00:34:27.703
Why on earth did Big Brother want to absorb that kid?

536
00:34:27.703 --> 00:34:29.370
I really can't understand

537
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.636
If you want him to come in to enhance your fighting power,

538
00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:36.670
Then why should he be equal to Yongbi brother?

539
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.136
Brother, am I wrong?

540
00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:39.203
You guys are really

541
00:34:39.203 --> 00:34:40.436
It makes me lose my appetite

542
00:34:42.003 --> 00:34:42.936
sorry

543
00:34:42.936 --> 00:34:44.136
Brother, I'm sorry

544
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.770
Is this some kind of soup restaurant?

545
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:58.903
Alas, in a high-end hotel
It tastes like rice soup and pickled radish

546
00:34:58.903 --> 00:35:00.470
Of course guests won't come to your door

547
00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:10.336
I know that big brother has left you in charge of this place.

548
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.503
But I must have lunch here
have another cup of coffee

549
00:35:13.503 --> 00:35:14.636
You won’t have indigestion

550
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.703
If you have indigestion
I will buy you gastrointestinal medicine

551
00:35:17.703 --> 00:35:21.170
From now on, only order what is on the menu

552
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.236
Don't forget to pay

553
00:35:22.936 --> 00:35:24.536
You brat...

554
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.803
Let's go after drinking coffee

555
00:35:27.803 --> 00:35:30.103
I'll treat you to this meal today

556
00:35:30.103 --> 00:35:31.370
After all, we are a family

557
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.670
Still a family...

558
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.803
I don't think we are a family

559
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.670
Be careful

560
00:35:50.136 --> 00:35:52.936
We coexist peacefully

561
00:35:52.936 --> 00:35:54.370
I'll be nice to you

562
00:35:57.903 --> 00:35:59.036
Let's go

563
00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.670
The food here must be delicious

564
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.136
Hello, Boss Yin

565
00:36:04.136 --> 00:36:05.936
Me? I'm working

566
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.803
why

567
00:36:08.803 --> 00:36:10.236
what did you say

568
00:36:11.603 --> 00:36:15.803
Why are you so embarrassed?
You always ask me to send my little brother over for that kind of thing

569
00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:17.803
what did you say

570
00:36:17.803 --> 00:36:19.103
Got it

571
00:36:20.636 --> 00:36:23.703
Then you should also take care of our little brother.

572
00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.970
And…

573
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.436
After you finish filming, bring an actress here

574
00:36:29.436 --> 00:36:31.070
That's right

575
00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:37.803
Just follow the flow and arrange the banquet.

576
00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:40.036
Lunzi and Wild Wolf

577
00:36:41.303 --> 00:36:43.070
This is a gift from big brother to you

578
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.070
If you need anything, you can tell me anytime.

579
00:36:49.303 --> 00:36:50.670
Thank you bro
Thank you bro

580
00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:53.170
I'll keep it short.

581
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.536
From now on, don't worry about each other anymore

582
00:36:57.536 --> 00:37:03.036
The whole family just wants to eat and drink together
Fighting side by side, do you understand?

583
00:37:03.036 --> 00:37:04.370
Yes eldest brother
Yes eldest brother

584
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.603
Everyone raises a toast

585
00:37:07.003 --> 00:37:07.970
Cheers

586
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.336
Cheers
Cheers

587
00:37:13.103 --> 00:37:16.836
I get it. Okay...

588
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.603
Really

589
00:37:25.903 --> 00:37:28.470
Hey, where is Douxue now?

590
00:37:31.903 --> 00:37:33.436
(Sun Pictures)

591
00:37:34.636 --> 00:37:35.903
Really…

592
00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:39.370
(Planning Office)

593
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.536
I know

594
00:37:41.603 --> 00:37:44.803
minister
I heard that the filming schedule has been delayed a lot

595
00:37:44.803 --> 00:37:46.670
Will the movie be released in time?

596
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.536
These guys are waiting to die.

597
00:37:49.536 --> 00:37:50.503
I'll take care of this matter

598
00:37:50.503 --> 00:37:52.470
Don't interfere, got it?

599
00:37:53.736 --> 00:37:56.970
Minister, where are you going?

600
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.170
Open the sinner's mouth and feed him poison

601
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.103
Yes

602
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.436
Empress…

603
00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:12.603
drink it

604
00:38:12.603 --> 00:38:14.203
Empress…

605
00:38:14.203 --> 00:38:17.436
Is what she is drinking really poison?

606
00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:18.736
That's Shuanghetang

607
00:38:18.736 --> 00:38:21.536
It turns out to be Shuanghetang. It’s really dangerous.

608
00:38:21.536 --> 00:38:26.503
Empress…

609
00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:30.436
But in the hands of Shang Gong
Looks like he's wearing a watch

610
00:38:32.003 --> 00:38:33.070
That's so funny

611
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.836
card

612
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.470
Damn...

613
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.803
Hello

614
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.103
What's wrong

615
00:38:40.103 --> 00:38:41.636
What is this
Wait a moment...

616
00:38:42.603 --> 00:38:44.003
who are you

617
00:38:44.003 --> 00:38:45.336
director

618
00:38:45.336 --> 00:38:47.136
Wait, help me hold up my headgear.

619
00:38:48.603 --> 00:38:50.003
What's wrong? Is it NG?

620
00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:52.303
So brilliant

621
00:38:53.703 --> 00:38:54.670
Miss Song Yanzhu

622
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.370
Hottest male directors of the 21st century

623
00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.770
He has been waiting for you for a long time

624
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.836
Come out quickly

625
00:39:03.803 --> 00:39:07.303
They are actress Song Yeon-joo
Someone sent from another movie crew

626
00:39:07.303 --> 00:39:09.870
Hey, tell the director to keep waiting.

627
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.303
We must today
Just finish filming this scene

628
00:39:13.303 --> 00:39:15.236
Clear the place quickly

629
00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:17.270
If I count to three and you still don’t get out of the way...

630
00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:19.736
Just don't blame me for taking action

631
00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:21.670
You... just do it

632
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.570
One...two...

633
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:26.603
Come on

634
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.870
what do you want to do

635
00:39:30.603 --> 00:39:32.203
come with me

636
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.403
Wait a minute...

637
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.236
I was shocked. You asked for a beating.

638
00:39:43.236 --> 00:39:45.270
Really
sit down

639
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.770
sit down for me

640
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.170
Alas...

641
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.303
You little bastard, let go now

642
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.970
Really

643
00:39:58.036 --> 00:40:00.136
This woman is really...

644
00:40:00.136 --> 00:40:03.570
Hey, show some respect to others

645
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:04.436
OK

646
00:40:04.436 --> 00:40:05.670
sorry

647
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.003
Did you say sorry to me?

648
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.836
sorry

649
00:40:16.203 --> 00:40:18.703
Okay, let's go

650
00:40:18.703 --> 00:40:20.036
OK

651
00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:22.036
please follow us

652
00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:24.770
Which guy is it?
How dare you come to the sacred set to cause trouble...

653
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.703
No, you can't take her away

654
00:40:27.703 --> 00:40:28.703
uncle

655
00:40:28.703 --> 00:40:29.903
No…

656
00:40:29.903 --> 00:40:31.803
Dingchen…

657
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.236
Li Douxue

658
00:40:58.303 --> 00:40:59.403
long time no see

659
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.436
why are you here

660
00:41:04.103 --> 00:41:05.136
Dingchen, what are you doing?

661
00:41:05.136 --> 00:41:06.070
leave quickly

662
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.170
Get out of here

663
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.903
Brother, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

664
00:41:10.903 --> 00:41:12.403
We need to take Song Yanzhu away as soon as possible

665
00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:15.136
The crew gave countless instructions and warnings
I must finish filming the daytime scene today

666
00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:17.936
Are you a gangster?

667
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:20.603
What hooligan

668
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:23.236
This lady, you are so nice to talk to.

669
00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:24.370
Xuanyu

670
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.503
You go back first

671
00:41:30.703 --> 00:41:32.203
I asked you if you are a gangster

672
00:41:33.536 --> 00:41:34.803
Yes

673
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.103
You avoided me when I visited the prison
Then come out and become a gangster after being released from prison?

674
00:41:51.103 --> 00:41:53.170
I didn't hide from you

675
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.370
But I'm in jail because of you

676
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.603
If it were you, would you want to see me?

677
00:41:57.736 --> 00:41:59.670
Do you really feel...

678
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.403
Did I put you in jail?

679
00:42:01.403 --> 00:42:04.903
Also, I also live my life very seriously.

680
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.736
A thief who steals and robs all day long
Are you also living a serious life?

681
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.070
in this society
The little thief who steals a wallet will be looked down upon

682
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.703
But the thief who stole the entire country
But it will make people afraid of three points

683
00:42:17.703 --> 00:42:19.803
you are absolutely crazy

684
00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.670
Wrong

685
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.536
The me you knew before was the crazy one

686
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.703
I thought I just needed to study hard
Be filial to your parents and loyal to your country

687
00:42:28.703 --> 00:42:30.436
can live a good life

688
00:42:30.436 --> 00:42:32.603
It's really ridiculous to think like this

689
00:42:34.103 --> 00:42:36.703
in this ugly world

690
00:42:36.703 --> 00:42:38.436
Living a domineering life is the truth

691
00:42:40.836 --> 00:42:44.336
Li Douxue, are you really...

692
00:42:44.336 --> 00:42:46.203
Became a scumbag

693
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:52.170
Scumbag?

694
00:42:56.336 --> 00:42:58.070
Yes

695
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.936
Hope the self-proclaimed theater daughter

696
00:43:00.936 --> 00:43:03.670
You will never see a scum like me again in the future.

697
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.903
Hey, everyone retreat

698
00:43:08.903 --> 00:43:10.503
Okay big brother

699
00:43:20.003 --> 00:43:21.336
You drink slowly

700
00:43:22.336 --> 00:43:24.136
I didn't expect you to come to me

701
00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:26.670
Have you adapted to life in Seoul?

702
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.303
What happened?

703
00:43:40.536 --> 00:43:44.036
Let me ask you, are you in contact with Douxue?

704
00:43:48.136 --> 00:43:51.703
Well, we are good brothers

705
00:43:51.703 --> 00:43:53.470
As a good brother

706
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.770
How could you let him go and become a gangster?

707
00:44:02.336 --> 00:44:03.403
have you seen him

708
00:44:04.303 --> 00:44:05.470
That's right

709
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:10.570
He stormed into our set
He met me when he wanted to kidnap the actor.

710
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.136
I really envy you for having a rogue brother

711
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.470
He is not a child anymore

712
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.670
How could you possibly listen to me?

713
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:29.603
I think...that's probably his life.

714
00:44:30.303 --> 00:44:34.536
His life...

715
00:44:34.536 --> 00:44:38.036
Children of your working parents
Are you born to be a gangster?

716
00:44:38.036 --> 00:44:41.203
Do people with criminal records have to become gangsters?

717
00:44:41.203 --> 00:44:44.903
Even if others point fingers at him
At least you...

718
00:44:44.903 --> 00:44:47.603
You shouldn't have done that to him, bad guy.

719
00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:52.603
No one's fate is destined by birth

720
00:44:57.736 --> 00:44:59.070
Really…

721
00:45:10.236 --> 00:45:11.670
Li Douxue, are you really...

722
00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:15.670
Became a scumbag

723
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.903
are you okay

724
00:45:23.903 --> 00:45:26.470
So why did you drink so much?

725
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.570
Tetsuo

726
00:45:28.603 --> 00:45:31.236
I have something to ask you

727
00:45:31.236 --> 00:45:32.870
Please...

728
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.670
Let Douxue get out of there

729
00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:40.903
Don't let him continue to be a gangster

730
00:45:41.903 --> 00:45:44.236
Only you can help him now

731
00:45:45.403 --> 00:45:48.303
If he was allowed to live like that...

732
00:45:48.303 --> 00:45:51.636
He is too pitiful

733
00:45:51.636 --> 00:45:55.403
Douxue is really pitiful

734
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.870
Dingchen

735
00:46:06.736 --> 00:46:11.103
Now that things have happened, can't you forget him?

736
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:21.603
Tetsuo, I have something to ask you

737
00:46:22.136 --> 00:46:23.536
Tell me honestly

738
00:46:25.303 --> 00:46:26.436
You ask

739
00:46:26.836 --> 00:46:28.870
Back then…

740
00:46:29.503 --> 00:46:31.536
Did Douxue really kill someone?

741
00:46:34.303 --> 00:46:37.070
no matter what i think
I don't even think he would do that kind of thing

742
00:46:42.103 --> 00:46:45.003
That's right, Brother Douxue did it.

743
00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:49.203
He went to take revenge on the guy who hit me

744
00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.536
Then he got into trouble

745
00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:56.803
His life is really rough

746
00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.503
God, is this going too far?

747
00:47:02.536 --> 00:47:06.236
Why are you so cruel to poor people?

748
00:47:23.836 --> 00:47:25.636
So painful

749
00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:30.303
Oh my God, how much did you drink?

750
00:47:30.303 --> 00:47:32.570
I still smell of alcohol all over my body.

751
00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.970
What is this? Is it hangover soup?

752
00:47:34.403 --> 00:47:36.503
You are truly my good friend

753
00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:37.870
Ouch, my stomach feels so uncomfortable

754
00:47:39.236 --> 00:47:41.803
Stinky girl, you really make me jealous

755
00:47:42.836 --> 00:47:46.836
And a black knight
I'll carry you home drunk

756
00:47:47.203 --> 00:47:48.170
Who?

757
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:51.070
Don't you remember?

758
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.870
It was Tetsuo who sent you back

759
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.170
Tetsuo?

760
00:47:55.736 --> 00:48:00.036
Did you really drink until you lost your memory?
Still pretending to be stupid

761
00:48:00.036 --> 00:48:01.370
How could he carry me back?

762
00:48:02.203 --> 00:48:04.070
This was the first time I saw him after graduating from high school

763
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.036
He has become so handsome

764
00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:11.336
When did you resume contact?

765
00:48:14.936 --> 00:48:16.436
That's not the point now...

766
00:48:16.436 --> 00:48:17.570
Where is my watch?

767
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:18.836
What time is it now?

768
00:48:19.903 --> 00:48:21.836
I'm late...

769
00:48:21.836 --> 00:48:22.936
what to do

770
00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:25.103
Hey, I've already cooked for you

771
00:48:25.103 --> 00:48:26.203
Let’s go out after eating

772
00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:27.703
No, I don't have time

773

(Waterfall Nightclub)

774
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.536
Big brother…
Really

775
00:48:32.536 --> 00:48:33.403
You little crew cut

776
00:48:33.403 --> 00:48:35.703
My hair just won't grow long
What else can I do

777
00:48:39.103 --> 00:48:40.370
he is my guest

778
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.570
So…

779
00:48:55.003 --> 00:48:57.170
Are you here to persuade me not to join the underworld?

780
00:48:58.903 --> 00:49:02.403
No, how am I qualified to advise you?

781
00:49:02.403 --> 00:49:03.536
I'm a scumbag too

782
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.536
Just Dingchen she...

783
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:09.470
I still can't seem to forget you

784
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.403
she cried a lot

785
00:49:20.303 --> 00:49:21.736
It seems she thinks I'm very pitiful

786
00:49:23.536 --> 00:49:25.403
That's not necessarily the reason, right?

787
00:49:25.936 --> 00:49:27.370
While you're in jail

788
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.070
She will write to you regularly

789
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.970
I often visit you too

790
00:49:32.003 --> 00:49:33.203
But how could you break up?

791
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:39.870
Because I feel like a loser

792
00:49:41.003 --> 00:49:42.270
Just take the initiative to break up

793
00:49:43.936 --> 00:49:46.203
Stop talking about this

794
00:49:46.203 --> 00:49:49.203
Memories of childhood love are too childish

795
00:50:02.703 --> 00:50:04.003
Brother

796
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.436
Do I have to be a prosecutor?

797
00:50:09.336 --> 00:50:11.703
Right. You want to be a prosecutor before you graduate.

798
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:19.503
So be it, I will fulfill your wish

799
00:50:19.503 --> 00:50:21.170
You can also fulfill my wish

800
00:50:27.203 --> 00:50:28.570
I now...

801
00:50:29.836 --> 00:50:31.303
You should be able to date Dingchen.

802
00:50:41.003 --> 00:50:42.136
Tetsuo

803
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.803
Dingchen has nothing to do with me anymore

804
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.170
Really?

805
00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.703
Do you really mean what you said?

806
00:50:52.203 --> 00:50:56.303
But...even so, don't date her

807
00:51:03.136 --> 00:51:05.336
Didn't you say you have nothing to do with her?

808
00:51:05.336 --> 00:51:06.403
Then why not

809
00:51:06.403 --> 00:51:08.703
You just said it yourself

810
00:51:08.703 --> 00:51:10.203
You are also a scumbag

811
00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:14.503
Even if I miss my old love

812
00:51:14.503 --> 00:51:18.670
Dingchen shouldn’t associate with scum like us.

813
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:19.770
Isn't it?

814
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.403
You are the one who made me become a scumbag

815
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:24.570
what did you say

816
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.370
Don't think you are the only victim

817
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:32.003
From that incident to now
I don’t live a day of ease either.

818
00:51:32.003 --> 00:51:36.403
So just give up on Dingchen

819
00:51:36.403 --> 00:51:40.170
Do you want to tell her the truth?

820
00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:41.936
In fact, I killed the person

821
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.036
if you don't want to do this
What's the problem?

822
00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:48.003
Why can't I date her?

823
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:54.636
Just think of Dingchen being by your side

824
00:51:54.636 --> 00:51:57.270
with contemptuous eyes
Look at me becoming a gangster

825
00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:01.270
Just imagining it makes me feel disgusted.

826
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.336
Do you think you gave me everything?

827
00:52:06.336 --> 00:52:07.936
Don't get me wrong

828
00:52:07.936 --> 00:52:13.670
You never considered me a real brother

829
00:52:16.503 --> 00:52:19.436
Because you can't get Dingchen's heart

830
00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:22.170
Do you want me not to date her?

831
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.103
What nonsense is this?

832
00:52:25.336 --> 00:52:28.336
Since we're both bastards

833
00:52:28.336 --> 00:52:30.903
There's no reason among the bastards to begin with.

834
00:52:30.903 --> 00:52:32.903
What else do you expect?

835
00:52:55.870 --> 00:53:01.936

00:53:08.836 --> 00:53:11.070
Are you interested in China Film Distribution Company?

838
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.436
That boss Luo is a famous gambler.

839
00:53:14.436 --> 00:53:17.003
I don't know if he is
Being entangled by those crooks in the gambling world

840
00:53:17.003 --> 00:53:18.770
I heard that he has been in a difficult situation recently

Are you working under boss Che Jinyu?

843
00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.070
Yes

844
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:30.670
Of course I know the character Boss Che.

845
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:32.803
What's the matter with her sending you to me?

846
00:53:32.803 --> 00:53:35.636

She wants to partner with me
Do you do film distribution in the Jeolla-do area?

No, she hopes to partner with you

People say she is a strong woman

852
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:51.836
I didn't expect she was so brave

853
00:53:51.836 --> 00:53:53.536
Boss Luo, please continue to run the company

854
00:53:53.536 --> 00:53:57.070
Our boss wants to take 30% of the shares

855
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.503
Listen carefully

856
00:53:58.503 --> 00:54:01.403
This circle is more exclusive than the underworld.

857
00:54:01.403 --> 00:54:03.403
If you invade other people's territory casually,

858
00:54:03.403 --> 00:54:05.170
If you are not careful, you will die miserably.

859
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.703
Go back and tell your boss

860
00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.636
If you want to enjoy your old age

861
00:54:09.636 --> 00:54:11.736

863
00:54:24.036 --> 00:54:25.170
Right

864
00:54:26.436 --> 00:54:29.170
It seems that your gambling money is almost spent.

865
00:54:30.036 --> 00:54:34.070
Our boss doesn't know you are gambling

866
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.470
I originally wanted to object to her seeking a partnership with you.

867
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:39.070
But tell her about your gambling
I'm afraid of ruining the relationship between the two of you

868
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.736
That’s why I came to visit you

869
00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:43.503
Thank you very much for your rejection

870
00:54:48.136 --> 00:54:49.303
Wait

871
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.003
30% of the shares?

872
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.770
How much do you want to subscribe for?

873
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.003
so

874
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:03.103
The other party offered 100 million won

875
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.236
A bit expensive

876
00:55:08.236 --> 00:55:11.070
But compared with the development of subsequent market expansion,
This little money is nothing, right?

877
00:55:11.936 --> 00:55:15.303
Didn’t you say that Boss Luo has conditions?

878
00:55:18.303 --> 00:55:21.503
First, he asked for a partnership
Absolutely keep it secret

879
00:55:21.503 --> 00:55:22.736
Of course

880
00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:26.070
If the news gets out
It is difficult to gain a foothold in the Jingjiang area

881
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:27.236
There's more

882
00:55:28.136 --> 00:55:29.903
He said that as long as he had money, he would buy back the shares

883
00:55:29.903 --> 00:55:31.736
We have to sell to him anytime

884
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.336
how is this

885
00:55:34.336 --> 00:55:36.870
Wouldn't it be a waste of time for us to do this?

886
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:39.936
If he returns the principal to us
We can't even get dividends

887
00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:43.070
Boss, this is definitely a loss-making business.

888
00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.136
so

889
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:46.003
I will agree to his conditions

890
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.936
are you crazy

891
00:55:48.936 --> 00:55:50.370
you idiot

892
00:55:51.336 --> 00:55:53.203
you did a great job

893
00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:54.203
Boss…

894
00:55:54.203 --> 00:55:58.103
Do you want to catch up with Dingchen’s taillights?
It will take hundreds of years

895
00:55:58.103 --> 00:56:00.703
Have you ever heard of a gambler paying back his money?

896
00:56:01.603 --> 00:56:04.070
Have you ever heard of a gambler borrowing money?

897
00:56:05.503 --> 00:56:07.936
That's the truth...

898
00:56:17.203 --> 00:56:20.170
(passbook)
There are fully 300 million people here

899
00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:23.036
Try to get the middle part

900
00:56:23.036 --> 00:56:24.403
Oh my god

901
00:56:26.936 --> 00:56:28.903
You said you would give me company shares?

902
00:56:28.903 --> 00:56:30.170
How much do you plan to give me?

903
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.170
don't you trust me

904
00:56:41.003 --> 00:56:42.436
Boss, do you trust me?

905
00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:50.270
Okay, tell me how much you want

906
00:56:51.836 --> 00:56:53.270
If I get the middle part

907
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.836
Market share of film distribution in Jingjiang region
If it reaches 50%

908
00:56:55.836 --> 00:56:57.403
Please give me 30% of the shares

909
00:56:57.403 --> 00:56:59.836
Oh my God, is this girl crazy?

910
00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:02.403
Is your brain abnormal?

911
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.903
What if it fails?

912
00:57:06.903 --> 00:57:09.836
Then I am willing to work under the boss for the rest of my life.

913
00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.370
let me think about it

914
00:57:27.636 --> 00:57:28.736
Insider?

915
00:57:28.736 --> 00:57:30.870
We are all called intelligence agents

916
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:33.370
But most people say he is a mole

917
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.003
Is Tetsuo really doing something so dangerous?

918
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.103
Who on earth asked him to do such a thing?

919
00:57:41.336 --> 00:57:43.270
This is it

920
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.536
Based on the results of the written report
It was Tetsuo who volunteered to take charge after he was discharged from the army early.

921
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:49.670
Times have changed recently

922
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.270
Government agencies will not force
You can't force people to do this kind of thing

923
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.903
How did this come to light?

924
00:57:54.903 --> 00:57:58.370
Students in the student movement circle noticed that his whereabouts were suspicious

925
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:00.136
I took him to school to force him to confess.

926
00:58:01.503 --> 00:58:03.570
However

927
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.770
Tetsuo has made a good friend

928
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.403
Is it called Li Douxue?

929
00:58:09.903 --> 00:58:13.503
He faced a large group of students alone
Rescued Tetsuo

930
00:58:14.736 --> 00:58:17.303
After Tetsuo
I should no longer be able to participate in student movements.

931
00:58:18.403 --> 00:58:20.570
He just needs to prepare well for the judicial examination

932
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.503
there won't be any problem

933
00:58:23.703 --> 00:58:25.170
Just be low-key

934
00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:29.236
(1 year later)

935
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.170
Douxue, thank you for your hard work

936
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.770
Sales volume has been maintained at a certain level.

937
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:38.470
The point is, no one will come to make trouble if nothing happens.
Really good

938
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:39.670
Thanks for the compliment, brother

939
00:58:45.003 --> 00:58:47.270
Shareholders are not happy

940
00:58:47.903 --> 00:58:50.836
Yongpil, you have to work harder

941
00:58:50.836 --> 00:58:51.936
Sorry, bro

942
00:58:51.936 --> 00:58:53.436
Also

943
00:58:54.603 --> 00:58:58.303
You are still in the hotel cafe
Would you like some soup and rice?

944
00:58:59.136 --> 00:58:59.970
what

945
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:03.603
You might as well open a soup restaurant.

946
00:59:04.536 --> 00:59:06.936
Yongpil, please use your head.

947
00:59:07.603 --> 00:59:09.370
Big brother

948
00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:14.236
Why don't you let me run it?
What do you think of his nightclubs and restaurants?

949
00:59:14.236 --> 00:59:15.670
You bastard

950
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.436
Do you want to die in my hands?

951
00:59:17.436 --> 00:59:19.370
Yongpil, I mean...

952
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.236
Shut up or I'll tear your mouth apart

953
00:59:22.236 --> 00:59:24.270
You rude brat

954
00:59:25.836 --> 00:59:27.136
Get out of here

955
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.236
go out

956
00:59:35.236 --> 00:59:37.136
Really

957
00:59:38.136 --> 00:59:40.003
Same for you

958
00:59:40.003 --> 00:59:41.670
How could you say that?

959
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:44.803
If you take charge of Yongpil's territory
Does he want the people under him to drink the northwest wind?

960
00:59:44.803 --> 00:59:47.636
Brother, it's not like that

961
00:59:48.303 --> 00:59:51.136
I want him to manage it
My nightclub and restaurant

962
00:59:51.136 --> 00:59:52.236
what did you say

963
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:56.836
I'm on my turf
Established a complete management system

964
00:59:56.836 --> 00:59:59.703
It would be easy if Yong Pil takes over

965
00:59:59.703 --> 01:00:01.770
I want to improve the area that Yong-pil is responsible for.

966
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.103
Let both sides stabilize

967
01:00:04.103 --> 01:00:05.803
So

968
01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.536
Do you mean you want to switch territories with him?

969
01:00:08.536 --> 01:00:09.570
yes

970
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.603
I really can't stand that guy
I didn’t even finish listening to what I said…

971
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.303
Brother, we are a family

972
01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:21.603
(Judicial trainee appointment ceremony)

973
01:00:21.603 --> 01:00:22.770
Tetsuo

974
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.770
Dingchen

975
01:00:27.636 --> 01:00:29.103
Prospective prosecutor, congratulations.

976
01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:33.336
thank you

977
01:00:33.336 --> 01:00:34.703
Thank you for your hard work

978
01:00:34.703 --> 01:00:35.936
Tetsuo

979
01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:37.803
Mom

980
01:00:43.403 --> 01:00:47.036
Mom can die without regrets now

981
01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:50.436
Don't cry. Today is a great day.

982
01:00:50.436 --> 01:00:53.770
Well...I shouldn't cry

983
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:58.403
If only your dad could see you like this
How nice it would be

984
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:03.203
I will go to my father’s grave again later

985
01:01:03.203 --> 01:01:05.003
I haven't seen him for a long time

986
01:01:05.003 --> 01:01:08.570
Yes, you should go and see it too

987
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.770
You have to thank uncle

988
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:13.436
He often helps organize your father's grave.

989
01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:18.036
Uncle, thank you very much

990
01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:20.936
Don't say that. This is what I should do.

991
01:01:23.003 --> 01:01:27.136
You are truly amazing…

992
01:01:27.136 --> 01:01:31.436
You gave the Cui family a comeback

993
01:01:32.503 --> 01:01:35.670
This is all thanks to your help

994
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.803
What did I do...

995
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.536
Aunt, why are you crying?

996
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:53.170
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

997
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:57.836
You two can sleep at my house for one night and then go back.

998
01:01:57.836 --> 01:02:00.003
Let me buy you two a drink

999
01:02:02.703 --> 01:02:04.070
No need…

1000
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.970
We have to go back quickly

1001
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.470
Things in the fields are piling up like a mountain

1002
01:02:08.236 --> 01:02:09.536
I'm too lazy to talk about him

1003
01:02:09.536 --> 01:02:11.236
Before this guy came up to Seoul

1004
01:02:11.236 --> 01:02:14.236
Still insisting on growing vegetables on a small field

1005
01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:19.103
But it’s okay if I sleep one night and then leave.

1006
01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.003
This old woman...

1007
01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.936
You have a lot to do

1008
01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:27.003
Uncle hasn't changed at all

1009
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:30.336
Tetsuo, you don’t have to worry about us

1010
01:02:30.336 --> 01:02:31.603
Mom is going back first

1011
01:02:31.603 --> 01:02:33.003
OK

1012
01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:33.870
Let's go

1013
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:38.003
Then I'll find you later

1014
01:02:38.003 --> 01:02:39.570
good

1015
01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:42.103
you are amazing

1016
01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:43.670
Be careful on the road

1017
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.303
What's going on? Will anyone else come?

1018
01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.203
what

1019
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:58.103
No more

1020
01:03:13.103 --> 01:03:13.936
congratulations

1021
01:03:13.936 --> 01:03:16.203
Tetsuo passed the exam in no time

1022
01:03:16.203 --> 01:03:17.870
Who did he inherit his intelligence from?

1023
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.603
Is it mom or dad?

1024
01:03:19.603 --> 01:03:21.903
It must be mom

1025
01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:23.136
I think so

1026
01:03:23.636 --> 01:03:27.936
Brother Zhongzhong, I have something to ask you.

1027
01:03:27.936 --> 01:03:30.203
Just tell me what it is

1028
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:34.303
Tetsuo wants to be a prosecutor

1029
01:03:34.303 --> 01:03:35.470
Please give him a helping hand

1030
01:03:36.503 --> 01:03:39.270
His judicial examination results
Isn't it among the best?

1031
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:44.036
But I heard from our store
The wife of the Minister of Justice said

1032
01:03:44.036 --> 01:03:47.503
If you have participated in the student movement
It is impossible to become a judge or prosecutor...

1033
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:51.770
Yes, then Tetsuo can only become a lawyer.

1034
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.303
There's nothing I can do about it

1035
01:03:53.903 --> 01:03:55.270
And honestly

1036
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:59.036
If it were revealed that he had been an intelligence agent
It's even more troublesome

1037
01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:02.970
Then he should be made a prosecutor.

1038
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:05.203
He has been working quietly for the country...

1039
01:04:06.236 --> 01:04:07.736
This thing is difficult

1040
01:04:07.736 --> 01:04:09.470
You'll know just by looking at the records

1041
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.536
He didn't provide it at all
Information about student activists

1042
01:04:12.536 --> 01:04:15.103
It means that he is just following the trend to please both sides.

1043
01:04:15.103 --> 01:04:17.236
That's a gray area where there's nothing black or white

1044
01:04:20.936 --> 01:04:22.736
he wants to be a prosecutor

1045
01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:25.503
This is also my wish

1046
01:04:27.403 --> 01:04:28.970
If he had cooperated with intelligence agencies at that time

1047
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:31.870
I can still push him
Make him an elite prosecutor

1048
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:33.503
I don’t even know what the current situation is.

1049
01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:35.703
His mind is as smart as his mother's

1050
01:04:35.703 --> 01:04:39.470
But just like his father
Hold on to a worthless conscience

1051
01:04:51.536 --> 01:04:52.770
Yes

1052
01:04:54.936 --> 01:04:56.670
He looks a lot like his dad

1053
01:04:59.936 --> 01:05:06.170
Tetsuo and his biological father
Just like they were carved from the same mold

1054
01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.336
He is very ambitious

1055
01:05:09.836 --> 01:05:11.736
he wants power

1056
01:05:20.803 --> 01:05:22.936
Now that we are here
You should at least meet me before leaving.

1057
01:05:22.936 --> 01:05:24.670
Why did you just leave immediately?

1058
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.436
Thank you for your hard work

1059
01:05:26.436 --> 01:05:27.770
Take this to catch up with friends

1060
01:05:30.536 --> 01:05:31.736
what is this

1061
01:05:35.403 --> 01:05:37.770
Oh my god

1062
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:41.170
Li Douxue becomes the second person in Guangzhuo Gang
Be very generous when you take action

1063
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:42.836
So handsome

1064
01:05:44.203 --> 01:05:49.036
I have fulfilled your order now, right?

1065
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.203
Don't be too arrogant

1066
01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:57.070
Now you are just qualified to repay your kindness
The main event starts now

1067
01:05:57.903 --> 01:06:00.303
Yeah, this is just the beginning, right?

1068
01:06:01.536 --> 01:06:05.770
But there's one more thing
I also plan to take action

1069
01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:10.870
Dingchen…

1070
01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:13.603
I will make her my woman

1071
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:23.036
I never expected that my son would be right in front of me

1072
01:06:23.036 --> 01:06:27.670
The dull father couldn't recognize him

1073
01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:34.370
Please help Tetsuo
Let him be the prosecutor

1074
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.170
You are his father

1075
01:06:44.536 --> 01:06:46.070
Stop pretending you're a bad person

1076
01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.236
I know you still can't forget her

1077
01:06:50.436 --> 01:06:52.036
if you want

1078
01:06:52.036 --> 01:06:54.203
Let's compete again like we did in high school.

1079
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.003
fair and just

1080
01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:59.503
ok

1081
01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:02.170
You brat...

1082
01:07:31.036 --> 01:07:34.036
(Oasis)

1083
01:07:34.036 --> 01:07:35.636
Is there no other reason?

1084
01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:38.103
Why can Brother Douxue do it but I can’t?

1085
01:07:38.103 --> 01:07:39.536
(fight)
I'm not afraid at all

1086
01:07:39.536 --> 01:07:40.336
why

1087
01:07:40.336 --> 01:07:42.370
Because I do all this to fight for human rights.

1088
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:45.070
Just hit me like you always do

1089
01:07:46.536 --> 01:07:47.970
car boss

1090
01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:49.203
Boss, you are the best

1091
01:07:49.203 --> 01:07:51.170
I'm no longer the puppet I used to be

1092
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.536
I am Choi Cheol-woong, a prosecutor of the Republic of Korea.

1093
01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:57.136
I don't understand why he is so nice to him

1094
01:07:57.136 --> 01:08:00.603
Dingchen...she was kidnapped

1095
01:08:00.603 --> 01:08:03.836
if you want to help
You should be able to find a way
