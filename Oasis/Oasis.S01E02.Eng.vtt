00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:09.767
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.600
The prosecution presented defendant Cui Zhexiong with

3
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.467
common assault

4
00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.133
Seeking a fine of NT$100,000

5
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.300
And learn from the defendant Li Dou...

6
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.033
(Episode 2)

7
00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:58.733
sorry

8
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.367
Did I say I was going to watch a movie today?

9
00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.067
I forgot

10
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
You seem to be too undisciplined lately

11
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.067
Do you want me to cheer you up with my nunchucks?

12
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.233
One just came now
Not one has come yet

13
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.433
You two are so...

14
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.400
He should come. Just wait.

15
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.367
scared me

16
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.267
scared me

17
00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:27.000
Really

18
00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.400
I can meet you first

19
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.267
Then who are you going to choose?

20
00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.233
Well, I need to think about this again.

21
00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.000
After all, you need to get along with each other a lot to understand each other.

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.733
How long do you need to think about it?

23
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.267
Probably…

24
00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:48.900
about a year

25
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.100
Until then, we can just be friends, okay?

26
00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:57.300
That guy is really brave

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.567
How dare you let my Wu Dingchen pigeon go?

28
00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.067
Could he have forgotten?

29
00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.800
Forgot

30
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.667
Why do you all have the same virtues?

31
00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:08.567
are you brothers

32
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.667
Let's go in by ourselves

33
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.433
Don't do this

34
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.767
Wait a little longer

35
00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.167
I'm dating you
It’s not like I’m dating Tetsuo

36
00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.767
Tetsuo doesn’t know yet

37
00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:21.200
I will tell him today

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.533
The time is almost up. Go in first.

39
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.200
This doesn't seem good

40
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.433
Let's go find Tetsuo

41
00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:35.800
You wait for me here

42
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.567
I'll go look around and come back.

43
00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:40.600
Hello

44
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.033
Hello Tetsuo

45
00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:49.100
Brat

46
00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.633
Where did you hide the money?

47
00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.400
money

48
00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.833
My home is a bank

49
00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.167
If you have the guts, just go to my house and get it, bastard

50
00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:01.667
No matter how big or small the guy is

51
00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.100
It's so rude to speak to my elder brother

52
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.800
I think you haven't been beaten enough...

53
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.200
Tetsuo

54
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.033
What are you doing?
are you okay

55
00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:13.100
you go

56
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.100
You go quickly

57
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.700
You go quickly

58
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.333
Hello Tetsuo

59
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.600
This is your horse

60
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.433
She's really scary. Much more powerful than you.

61
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:23.400
Are you gangsters?

62
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100
Don't make me call the police. You go away quickly.

63
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.433
So scary…

64
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.267
Tetsuo, let's go

65
00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:30.300
Let's go

66
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.267
Tetsuo, let's go

67
00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:34.533
Hello

68
00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.033
let me go

69
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.100
You idle bastards

70
00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:40.933
bitch

71
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.800
Bastard

72
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.800
No, Tetsuo

73
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.500
No

74
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.233
Just call the police. You can't do this.

75
00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:52.733
Brat

76
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.367
Help

77
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.666
Help

78
00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.133
I thought people who had studied
Can't use hands or feet

79
00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:10.767
Don't move

80
00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:11.967
because of you in the future

81
00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:14.400
When I go out, I need to put an iron plate on my stomach first.

82
00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.100
You dare to point a knife at me next time

83
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100
I will definitely give you a good look

84
00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:29.700
Let's go

85
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.967
Gone

86
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.067
are you okay

87
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.333
Are you okay?

88
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:39.733
what to do

89
00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:42.200
You…

90
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.567
That bastard

91
00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:46.033
I want to kill him with my own hands

92
00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.633
No, Tetsuo, I'm fine

93
00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.167
Don't argue with that kind of person. Let's go call the police.

94
00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.467
No, I will give him back double the amount.

95
00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:54.633
No, Tetsuo

96
00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:56.133
Douxue is coming soon

97
00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:58.100
let's go back

98
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:04.867
Why? Are you going to complain to me?

99
00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:07.000
We are all friends. Why are you doing this?

100
00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:09.567
friends

101
00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:12.500
friends

102
00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm back

103
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.367
after you school

104
00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:29.800
Didn't you go to Tetsuo's school?

105
00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:33.367
I've been there a few times but he said there's no need to go.

106
00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:46.667
Tetsuo

107
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.000
Tetsuo

108
00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.000
Otherwise, let's go to the drugstore to buy some medicine for rubbing.

109
00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:55.900
We…

110
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.333
Didn’t you agree to be friends for a year?

111
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.300
Isn’t that what you said?

112
00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:07.333
You need to get along more to understand each other

113
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.633
My heart...made its own decision

114
00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:19.133
ok

115
00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:21.000
You go

116
00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.767
Tetsuo Douxue is now...

117
00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:26.467
My heart says it today…

118
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.333
don't want to see you

119
00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:31.267
Tetsuo

120
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.267
Tetsuo, it's me

121
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.233
I heard you were injured. You had a fight with someone.

122
00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:52.033
Who can beat me like this?

123
00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:54.133
I was injured by my own fall

124
00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:56.200
Is the injury serious?

125
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.400
let me see

126
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.967
I'm fine

127
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.233
You go back

128
00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:02.933
How can it be

129
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.133
Hello

130
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.933
let me see

131
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:10.700
Just say I'm fine

132
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.433
who is

133
00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:13.700
Who did it to you?

134
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.400
Who dares to lay hands on me

135
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.267
I fell on my own

136
00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.167
Go back quickly

137
00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.200
Mom

138
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.567
why are you here

139
00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.067
I'm a little worried about him

140
00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.200
Who is he fighting with?

141
00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:50.800
He said he fell

142
00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.467
do you believe him

143
00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.367
Zhexiong has such a strong self-esteem

144
00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:59.333
Even if I get beaten, I will never admit it.

145
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.933
Didn't I tell you to go back?

146
00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:11.733
Tetsuo

147
00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:13.367
it's me

148
00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:20.000
Brother...just went back

149
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.067
I'm not here to find him

150
00:09:22.067 --> 00:09:24.833
I heard you were injured

151
00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:28.767
This is what I bought at the market last time

152
00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:30.100
It's American

153
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.533
Great for treating bruises and sprains

154
00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:34.200
I wiped it once

155
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.967
It won't hurt when I wake up from sleep

156
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.933
what are you doing here

157
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.200
Madam, don’t get me wrong.

158
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.833
I heard Tetsuo was injured

159
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.400
I have a good ointment at home…

160
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.433
We also have ointments at home.

161
00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:50.900
And…

162
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.200
Although we are very familiar neighbors

163
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.833
But it’s so late and you still go in and out of other people’s houses casually

164
00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.567
Isn't that too rude?

165
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.667
really sorry

166
00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:03.900
Douxue, you too

167
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.867
Don't come to our house so late

168
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.733
Yes

169
00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:11.200
Let's go

170
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.633
Let go, I will go on my own

171
00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:20.333
It hurts my feelings...

172
00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.633
younger than me
She looks like the wife of a high-ranking official

173
00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:29.800
Speaking of which, who was Tetsuo beaten by?

174
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.633
When you went to school together
This has never happened

175
00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.033
Your father wants to send you to Agricultural High School

176
00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:39.533
I should have stopped him

177
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.333
Mom

178
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.167
You are now sad because I went to Nonggao

179
00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:47.033
Still sad because Tetsuo was beaten?

180
00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.433
All sad

181
00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:54.400
All sad

182
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.167
Really

183
00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:06.933
I didn't tell you not to come.

184
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.833
I'm not here to go home with you

185
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:13.200
Dingchen said she must see you tonight

186
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.433
She has something to tell you

187
00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:17.500
Meet at the grilled oyster restaurant where we ate

188
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.200
What about you?

189
00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.100
I will go there later

190
00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:38.700
I don’t have the face to see you, Brother Zhongzhong

191
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.167
He's really amazing

192
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.733
He rejected our nomination

193
00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:45.633
Do you want to run as a nonpartisan?

194
00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:49.367
I know it may not be useful though

195
00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:51.867
But I will try to persuade him

196
00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:53.567
The family has no money

197
00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:55.100
I still want to run for office as an independent party member.

198
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.667
He can make a cooked duck fly
Can you persuade him?

199
00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:03.100
Marry someone who is noble and honorable
Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Jiang

200
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.267
Okay, you go back

201
00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:10.467
Take this back too

202
00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:12.433
No. How can I be embarrassed?

203
00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:13.667
Take it back

204
00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:15.733
These…

205
00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:18.967
You saved it with great difficulty
Private money

206
00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:20.667
Of course, use it at home

207
00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:22.033
It's okay I...

208
00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:28.067
Sorry Brother Zhongzhong

209
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.133
What are the chances of Choi Young-sik being elected?

210
00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:03.267
I discussed it with people from the CIA

211
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
what do they say

212
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.767
He may get more than 30% of the votes

213
00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:10.400
(Changing Yeosu starts with people No. 3 Choi Young-sik)
It cannot be ruled out that he may be elected first

214
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.567
Choi Young-sik…
Really?

215
00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:16.367
He is quite famous locally
And have a close relationship with the residents

216
00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:19.100
In addition, his father is an independence activist

217
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.567
Have you found his weakness?

218
00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:25.467
He doesn't have any corruption or women problems

219
00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:32.433
If the captain hadn't struck first,

220
00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:34.267
It will be very nerve-wracking later

221
00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:44.767
My name is Qi Yingzhuo

222
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.833
You don't want to be expelled from school
Go to jail

223
00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.033
i was wrong

224
00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:57.933
I won't bully them anymore

225
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.200
Really I swear

226
00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:13.133
What I want you to do is another thing

227
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.933
You know him?

228
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.833
know

229
00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:26.533
He was talking to a guy he called "Brother"
often together

230
00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:28.600
Cui Zhexiong

231
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:30.667
Yes

232
00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:34.533
You just need to let him hit you a few times.

233
00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:37.433
It would be better if it sheds some blood

234
00:14:38.067 --> 00:14:39.200
what

235
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.000
Really

236
00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:52.400
Don’t you know me very well? Really?

237
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.833
drink so much

238
00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:57.467
Drinking capacity is so bad

239
00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:07.633
Damn it

240
00:15:27.567 --> 00:15:28.433
what are you doing

241
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.367
Dingchen will not come

242
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.167
And…

243
00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:34.100
I know he's the one who hit you

244
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.767
Did someone ask you to help me?

245
00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:44.167
Even if you don't help
I have no intention of letting this guy go either.

246
00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:46.867
What? Do you think I will lose?

247
00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.067
Do you think I will lose to this kind of person?

248
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.300
Please apologize and say you won't bully anyone again.

249
00:15:56.733 --> 00:15:58.233
What a joke

250
00:15:59.567 --> 00:16:01.133
No man can win

251
00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:04.400
Just find someone else to help, coward.

252
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.800
Hello Qi Yingzhuo

253
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.067
You guy...

254
00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.833
OK

255
00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:10.167
Brother, don't interfere

256
00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:13.300
Tetsuo

257
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.600
OK

258
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.300
I've already taught him a lesson for you

259
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.667
I told you not to interfere

260
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.167
What do you want

261
00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:25.867
I'll forget it if I get beaten

262
00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.200
This guy…

263
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.367
This guy hit Dingchen

264
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.500
I can't even forgive him

265
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.700
Of course you can't forgive him

266
00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.767
You are not...

267
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.467
Have you decided to date?

268
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.500
Did he really hit Dingchen?

269
00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.933
Hello Qi Yingzhuo

270
00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:56.700
It's a good thing you didn't bring anyone with you

271
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.200
Let's challenge each other

272
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.933
I'll give you money if you win, but...

273
00:17:03.933 --> 00:17:06.567
If you lose, you will die here today

274
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.700
Do you know

275
00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:11.433
Stop talking nonsense

276
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.600
Brat
let me go

277
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.733
You can't beat me at all

278
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.267
Come on
Get up, brat

279
00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:33.700
Get up quickly

280
00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:46.667
Don't come here

281
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.533
If you dare to come here

282
00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:49.933
Let's break off the relationship

283
00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:12.333
The most embarrassing guy in the world

284
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:15.600
The guy who pretends to be powerful

285
00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:22.467
Don't act cool in front of that girl again.

286
00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:32.033
Is this enough?

287
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.867
I can go now

288
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.300
Tetsuo

289
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.500
Get up and fight me again

290
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.267
I'll wake you up

291
00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:02.533
Qi Yingzhuo, wake up

292
00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:03.667
Qi Yingzhuo

293
00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:11.167
What...what's wrong

294
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.367
Is he... is he dead?

295
00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:33.367
(New Inner Harbor Hospital)

296
00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:39.333
Hello Qi Yingzhuo

297
00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:40.833
Qi Yingzhuo

298
00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:46.900
The hospital contacted Lishui Police Department

299
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.667
It was said that two students took the injured Qi Yingzhuo
Carry to the hospital

300
00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:52.333
Qi Yingzhuo is currently unconscious

301
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.433
He won't die

302
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.467
Brother, people don’t die that easily, right?

303
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.567
he won't die

304
00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:10.467
He will definitely survive

305
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.700
Tetsuo

306
00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:16.433
Let's turn ourselves in

307
00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:19.067
Anyway, even if he is alive
We also have to pay the price

308
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.300
Brother, I did nothing wrong

309
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.833
I was in self-defense

310
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:29.533
So

311
00:20:29.533 --> 00:20:31.267
We told the police everything

312
00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:33.733
No

313
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.167
I won't go

314
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.000
Also

315
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.933
is this my fault

316
00:20:40.933 --> 00:20:43.400
Did I ask you to bring Qi Yingzhuo to me?

317
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.667
It was you who lied to me

318
00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:47.800
Said Dingchen wanted to see me

319
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.133
You know I won't let him go
And brought him to see me

320
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.667
So it's all your fault

321
00:20:57.133 --> 00:20:58.600
Did I say something wrong?

322
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.500
Did I say something wrong?

323
00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.633
That's right

324
00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:10.567
it's all my fault

325
00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:12.900
it's all my fault

326
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.200
Wrong

327
00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:27.367
I'm crazy

328
00:21:27.367 --> 00:21:29.800
I was the one who stoned him

329
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.433
You just...

330
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.067
Just want to help me

331
00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:36.933
right

332
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.000
Brother

333
00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.033
I'm so scared

334
00:21:45.467 --> 00:21:47.200
if that guy dies

335
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.300
I'd be thrown in jail for murder

336
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.767
My dad doesn’t have to elect a member of parliament anymore.
Our family will be ruined

337
00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:58.300
The mother who pinned all her hopes on me
Will definitely fall ill

338
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.700
Brother, what should I do now?

339
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.333
what should i do

340
00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:09.967
Brother

341
00:22:12.233 --> 00:22:14.867
Brother, can you save me once?

342
00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:20.700
could you tell the police
It was you who hit Qi Yingzhuo with a stone

343
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.333
Tetsuo

344
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.900
Brother

345
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.733
Brother…

346
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.267
save me

347
00:22:34.433 --> 00:22:36.433
If you help me this time

348
00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:38.467
I will be responsible for the rest of your life

349
00:22:38.467 --> 00:22:39.733
Wrong

350
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.867
I will work hard to get ahead

351
00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:43.667
Live for you all my life

352
00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:48.767
I know you always let me go

353
00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:51.267
I promise that I will

354
00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:53.633
I will definitely live for you

355
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:55.567
Brother

356
00:22:55.567 --> 00:22:58.033
Just save me once

357
00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:04.400
Brother

358
00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:10.033
why should i help you

359
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.400
It was obviously you who did it

360
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.233
Why should I take the blame for you?

361
00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.200
My dad too

362
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.700
me too

363
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.567
Live like a slave to your family all my life

364
00:23:25.567 --> 00:23:27.067
why did this happen

365
00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:29.900
I want to help you take the blame

366
00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:33.533
your life matters

367
00:23:33.533 --> 00:23:35.500
Isn't my life important?

368
00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:38.433
your life is human life

369
00:23:38.433 --> 00:23:40.800
Is my life worse than that of a pig or a dog?

370
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.033
Douxue

371
00:23:51.033 --> 00:23:53.700
What are you doing there if you don't go to sleep?

372
00:24:11.433 --> 00:24:13.167
uncle

373
00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:14.400
If something happens to Tetsuo

374
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.033
Not just him, his father and me

375
00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:17.867
Something happens to our whole family.

376
00:24:17.867 --> 00:24:20.333
Please save him

377
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:21.900
It's just your son now

378
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.500
You can save our family

379
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.933
madam

380
00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:30.200
I never refused any of your requests

381
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.900
But this time…

382
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.600
I can't promise you

383
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.767
How could you sacrifice Douxue to save Tetsuo?

384
00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:40.033
uncle

385
00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:42.033
As long as his father is elected

386
00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:43.833
I'll get him out of jail as soon as possible

387
00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:45.467
I will definitely do that

388
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.000
I will hire the best lawyer for him

389
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.433
uncle

390
00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:56.100
If his father loses the election, our family will be doomed.

391
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.300
He has to be elected before we can be saved

392
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.400
Please save my son, uncle

393
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.533
Save my son, uncle.

394
00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:05.633
save him
This…

395
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.033
uncle

396
00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:12.967
Don't go

397
00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:13.833
Don't go, uncle

398
00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:15.533
Please save my son

399
00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:20.533
uncle…

400
00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:22.933
let me go
uncle…

401
00:25:22.933 --> 00:25:25.533
No…

402
00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:28.300
uncle…

403
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.900
uncle…
uncle…

404
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.100
i was wrong

405
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.700
Please save me once

406
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.767
Please save me once

407
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:42.233
Please save me once
uncle

408
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.800
you kid

409
00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:57.167
Why do you do that?

410
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.267
why would you do that

411
00:26:01.267 --> 00:26:02.467
uncle

412
00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:04.133
Please...

413
00:26:04.133 --> 00:26:07.600
Please save me once
uncle

414
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.800
Douxue

415
00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:41.133
what are you doing

416
00:26:44.433 --> 00:26:46.400
You must have done something wrong

417
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.800
My son is definitely not that kind of person

418
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.833
You go and investigate and come back.

419
00:26:52.833 --> 00:26:54.833
We need to take him back to the bureau to investigate first.

420
00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:55.733
Please wait patiently

421
00:26:55.733 --> 00:26:57.800
Why are you investigating him?

422
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.167
Otherwise, you can ask the people in the village.

423
00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:03.600
Who is better at reading than Douxue?
A better child?

424
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.367
If you keep making trouble again, we'll charge you with obstructing official business.
Take you back to the bureau

425
00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:08.300
OK

426
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.533
you take me away

427
00:27:09.533 --> 00:27:10.500
Take me away

428
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.667
I don't allow you to take away my child

429
00:27:12.667 --> 00:27:13.833
I'm not allowed

430
00:27:13.833 --> 00:27:16.267
Douxue, please tell me it wasn’t you.

431
00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:18.467
Tell me you are innocent

432
00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:23.567
I'm really going crazy

433
00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:24.500
Hello, Patrolman Kim, Patrolman Park

434
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.633
What are you doing?

435
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.433
So annoying

436
00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:49.000
Douxue

437
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.033
what's going on

438
00:27:51.567 --> 00:27:53.933
Who is this lady?

439
00:27:54.633 --> 00:27:55.933
Not you

440
00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:57.733
you are not that kind of person

441
00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:01.533
Li Douxue

442
00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:02.967
Look into my eyes and tell me

443
00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:04.367
you are not that kind of person

444
00:28:04.367 --> 00:28:06.100
right

445
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.900
It's obviously not you

446
00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:10.433
Okay, let me borrow it

447
00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:11.733
Wait

448
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:13.833
Li Douxue…

449
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.067
Douxue…

450
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:20.467
Tetsuo

451
00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:21.667
Tetsuo, you also know

452
00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:23.733
Douxue is not that kind of person

453
00:28:23.733 --> 00:28:25.933
Cui Zhexiong Li Douxue

454
00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:28.133
answer me quickly

455
00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:29.467
Need to drive

456
00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:30.533
Wait

457
00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:32.433
You two, wait.

458
00:28:32.433 --> 00:28:34.200
Douxue
Douxue

459
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.167
Douxue…

460
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.200
Dou Xue

461
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.000
You…

462
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.533
don't forgive dad

463
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.867
Douxue

464
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:04.500
You can't take my child away

465
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.533
You can't take my child away

466
00:29:06.533 --> 00:29:08.767
What did he do wrong?

467
00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:10.033
What did he do wrong?

468
00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:10.900
Mom

469
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.467
Douxue…
Mom…

470
00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:17.533
Mom…

471
00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:19.667
Douxue

472
00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:21.700
You're not that kind of person

473
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.033
take me away

474
00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:25.167
You are not allowed to take away my child

475
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.200
What? His friend turned himself in?

476
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.067
Yes, a young man named Li Douxue

477
00:29:35.067 --> 00:29:36.400
He said it was because he saw Cui Cheol-woong

478
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.800
Always beaten by Qi Yingzhuo

479
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.667
That’s why I stoned Qi Yingzhuo

480
00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:43.133
No

481
00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:45.500
It’s useless for Lee Doo-hak to be sentenced

482
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.167
before the election ends
delay the trial as much as possible

483
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:51.800
And said Choi Young-sik’s son was an accomplice

484
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.133
I know

485
00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:58.033
-Choi Young-sik…
-Golden King Root…

486
00:29:58.033 --> 00:30:00.667
-Please vote for number two
-Golden King Root…

487
00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:04.933
-Please vote for number three
-Golden King Root…

488
00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:06.433
Everyone

489
00:30:06.433 --> 00:30:11.767
We must overthrow the dictatorship this time

490
00:30:11.767 --> 00:30:16.200
into the arms of democracy and freedom
Everyone, do you think it’s right?

491
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.067
Yes

492
00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:22.667
thank you all

493
00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:24.433
Yes thank you all

494
00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:29.933
Choi Young-sik, the father of the murderer, should withdraw from the election

495
00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:32.933
Choi Young-sik, the father of the murderer, should withdraw from the election

496
00:30:32.933 --> 00:30:36.433
Choi Young-sik, who raised a murderer, should withdraw from the election.

497
00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:41.033
Everyone, I deeply regret that this happened.
Choi Young-sik, who raised a murderer, should withdraw from the election.

498
00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.567
But my son definitely doesn’t…

499
00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:44.000
Withdraw

500
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.033
Withdraw…

501
00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:51.367
Okay…

502
00:31:03.933 --> 00:31:06.333
(No. 3 Choi Young-sik)

503
00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:09.800
(Choi Young-sik)

504
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.700
Didn't you say that Tetsuo was an eyewitness?

505
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.800
Didn't you say he didn't fight with anyone?

506
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.200
why lie to me

507
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.367
He did get into fights

508
00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:23.567
But Tetsuo was the one who was beaten

509
00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:25.933
Douxue, on the other hand, saw Tetsuo being cheered up and couldn't help but

510
00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:27.900
That's why I hit that person on the head with a stone.

511
00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:31.533
Wrong…

512
00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:33.833
The Douxue I know is not that kind of person

513
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.500
Could it be...

514
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.567
Is Tetsuo the one who caused the trouble?

515
00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:45.633
Husband

516
00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:50.400
Wife, are you hiding something from me?

517
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.867
Please explain it clearly to me

518
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.700
young master

519
00:32:04.233 --> 00:32:09.933
Douxue told me everything about that day.

520
00:32:13.067 --> 00:32:14.500
He said he did it

521
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.800
Really?

522
00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:22.867
Yes

523
00:32:22.867 --> 00:32:25.333
I will never lie to you

524
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800
Who is that...

525
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.700
Who did you provoke first?

526
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.433
This...this...

527
00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:39.500
Brother please tell me

528
00:32:43.467 --> 00:32:47.400
It was indeed Tetsuo who provoked others first.

529
00:33:05.833 --> 00:33:10.667
My child is indeed involved in the case

530
00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:14.967
Let everyone run for me during this time

531
00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:20.667
Thank you all for your hard work

532
00:33:21.267 --> 00:33:23.367
I don’t have the face to see you all

533
00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:26.533
I'm really sorry

534
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.400
No

535
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.000
You cannot withdraw

536
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.100
It was Doxue who beat people to death, not Tetsuo

537
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.233
and

538
00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.633
Even if you can't be elected in first place

539
00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:44.400
Can also be elected in second place

540
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.933
everything is over

541
00:33:46.933 --> 00:33:50.133
A liar like me
How can you be loyal to your country?

542
00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:53.067
It's not over yet. You can't give up just yet.

543
00:33:53.067 --> 00:33:53.867
Wife

544
00:33:53.867 --> 00:33:57.467
Do you know how much we spent campaigning?

545
00:33:57.467 --> 00:33:59.200
If you withdraw now

546
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.567
lumber mill and all the fields
Everything will come to naught

547
00:34:03.067 --> 00:34:05.567
You…

548
00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:07.667
Have you even mortgaged your land?

549
00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:13.567
That's right, I did it to get you elected
Betting on my life

550
00:34:13.567 --> 00:34:15.533
If you withdraw now

551
00:34:15.533 --> 00:34:17.767
Our family will be completely destroyed

552
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.233
Why is he a public defender?

553
00:34:47.233 --> 00:34:50.267
Didn't Tetsuo's father say
Will you help Douxue find a good lawyer?

554
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.900
Douxue's father refused

555
00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:04.200
The prosecution presented defendant Cui Zhexiong with

556
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.133
common assault

557
00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:07.733
Seeking a fine of NT$100,000

558
00:35:07.733 --> 00:35:08.900
and learned from the defendant Li Dou

559
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.800
According to the crime of injury causing death

560
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.333
Seeking a prison sentence of three to five years

561
00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:23.767
How could this happen...

562
00:35:25.733 --> 00:35:27.967
Defender, please make your final argument.

563
00:35:31.033 --> 00:35:33.633
Defendant, have you reflected deeply?

564
00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:37.567
Yes

565
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.467
Dear presiding judge

566
00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:41.933
The defendant said he had deeply reflected on

567
00:35:48.967 --> 00:35:56.267
What to do…

568
00:36:04.767 --> 00:36:06.167
Sentencing now

569
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.700
What kind of father are you?

570
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.933
Can you still be called a father like this?

571
00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:16.867
Why not let him get a good lawyer?

572
00:36:16.867 --> 00:36:18.400
Why do you

573
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.333
You also know very well the current situation of the young master’s family.

574
00:36:23.067 --> 00:36:26.900
Besides, if you commit a crime, you should be punished.

575
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.967
How heartbroken the parents of their child must be

576
00:36:31.967 --> 00:36:35.400
How could I shamelessly
Are you asking for a commutation of his sentence?

578
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.233
I didn't kill the person

579
00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:15.367
Hello…

580
00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:20.367
Hey... wake up

581
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.333
This man is dying

582
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:25.000
Call an ambulance quickly

583
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.833
Hurry up

589
00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:18.967
have you seen this movie

590
00:39:19.533 --> 00:39:20.767
Not yet

591
00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:22.700
(Flower of the Equator)
What about this one?

592
00:39:22.933 --> 00:39:26.000
I haven’t watched that one yet.

593
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.000
Hey, don't you have a girlfriend?

594
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.767
Why is it a movie that everyone has seen?
Just you haven't seen it

595
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.367
That is to say

596
00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:33.667
Come to my theater

597
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:37.267
Sister, I let you
Free admission from the screening room to the cinema

598
00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.900
Free movies are great

599
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.467
However

600
00:39:49.867 --> 00:39:51.500
Why didn't you tell me

601
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.000
Is it about my dad’s death?

602
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.167
What makes you special when you come back from Seoul
How sorry

603
00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:02.800
It must have been very hard for you at that time

604
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.900
sorry

605
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.033
As a friend, I should be by your side

606
00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.067
I'm fine

607
00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:14.333
My relatives also helped me a lot

608
00:40:14.833 --> 00:40:16.467
By the way, today is not a holiday

609
00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:17.933
how come you come back

610
00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:21.100
I came back to pay homage to my father

611
00:40:21.533 --> 00:40:24.100
Yeah, it’s about this time, right?

612
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.500
The experiences of both of us are similar.

613
00:40:29.967 --> 00:40:32.833
No, you are a college student

614
00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:34.767
And I'm a theater owner who's on leave from school

615
00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:36.900
You want to be the boss
It may take 20 years

616
00:40:40.433 --> 00:40:41.533
Where's Brother Douxue?

617
00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:47.467
I haven't heard this name for a long time.

618
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.133
Should I say that he disappeared like a gust of wind?

619
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.400
What about you? You should have contacted him, right?

620
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.367
I didn't meet him either

621
00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:00.733
How could it be

622
00:41:00.733 --> 00:41:02.567
Aren't you two like brothers?

623
00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:07.400
He always refused me visits in prison

624
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.700
Besides, my current situation
It's not suitable to meet him either

625
00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:12.400
What's going on with you?

626
00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:24.867
It's better to catch the spy that way.

627
00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:28.533
Let’s watch the Dingchen movie next time

628
00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:30.333
You must pretend you don’t know me

629
00:41:31.367 --> 00:41:32.733
what

630
00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:34.667
catch that guy

631
00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:37.400
Hey, catch that guy

632
00:41:49.167 --> 00:41:50.833
You got promoted

633
00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:52.700
Are you going to Seoul after that?

634
00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:56.600
Yeah, I'll be on reserve duty soon.

635
00:41:58.033 --> 00:42:00.367
How could it be?

636
00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:03.933
I heard that the commander is very caring about you.

637
00:42:04.867 --> 00:42:07.233
I'm tired of wandering around all my life

638
00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:09.900
The current situation is not as good as it used to be

639
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.367
The commander always gives me other tasks.

640
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.067
what task

641
00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.033
I'll tell you later

642
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.067
Wait until I go to Seoul
I won’t be able to see you often

643
00:42:35.567 --> 00:42:36.767
You need to cheer up

644
00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:38.533
If you have any difficulties, just tell me

645
00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.300
OK

646

(God is also crazy)

650
00:43:04.033 --> 00:43:06.633
Boss, you are back from Seoul

651
00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:08.900
Are there many guests coming to watch the movie?

652
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.300
As you can see, every movie ticket is sold out

653
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.767
The audience came in endless streams

654
00:43:13.767 --> 00:43:15.733
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" box-office success

655
00:43:15.733 --> 00:43:17.967
As long as it's a Hollywood movie

656
00:43:17.967 --> 00:43:20.833
All were a hit

657
00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:23.267
Brat, that's an African movie, right?

658
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.967
But the film is too damaged

659
00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:55.700
It takes about 10 minutes to cut it off

660
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.700
When shown like this
How much length will be left in the movie?

661
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.000
109 minutes movie
If you cut off 20 minutes

662
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.067
About 90 minutes left

663
00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:09.000
Will the audience still understand the plot this way?

664
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.500
Don't cut too much

665
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.067
Cut as much as you can

666
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:13.567
I know

Oh my god

668
00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:19.833
You're here again

669
00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:22.400
I must get the film today

670
00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:24.433
What's going on with this girl?

671
00:44:25.467 --> 00:44:26.867
Who is this aunt?

672
00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:29.167
If you don't want to get hurt, just get out of the way first

673
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.600
This girl is really

674
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.733
get out of my way

675
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.667
Sorry let's go

676
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.533
Okay, now you don’t have to spend money on ads.

677
00:44:41.533 --> 00:44:43.367
The theater will be in the news tomorrow

678
00:44:44.067 --> 00:44:45.400
what are you doing

679
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.400
Is your nose blocked? Don’t you smell the pungent smell?

680
00:44:49.867 --> 00:44:51.100
are you crazy

681
00:44:52.433 --> 00:44:54.867
Yeah, I'm just crazy

682
00:44:54.867 --> 00:44:56.900
I'm talking to you properly, but you can't listen.

683
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.367
You'd have to go crazy, wouldn't you?

684
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.800
Oh my god, why don't you take that match away?

685
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.067
Do you want to give me the film or not?

686
00:45:06.067 --> 00:45:10.000
Oops, it looks like the match is wet.

687
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.967
You use this

688
00:45:12.967 --> 00:45:15.100
This lighter should light easily

689
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.567
It's made in the United States

690
00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:20.300
you crazy woman

691
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Do you want to give me the film?

(Boss Che Jinyu)

693
00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:28.867
It turns out you are Nanhai Theater
Boss Wu’s daughter

694
00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:32.433
I heard your father passed away

695
00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:34.933
I was in Seoul at the time

696
00:45:34.933 --> 00:45:37.700
I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there to express my condolences.

697
00:45:38.267 --> 00:45:39.900
Gao Standing Committee
yes

698
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.467
Have you gone to express condolences?

699
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.100
Well... I was busy working at that time...

700
00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:51.733
That's it

701
00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:56.067
After all, Executive Director Gao is a very busy man.

702
00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.500
what you want to say is

703
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.400
The buyout price of "God is Crazy"
Your theater only paid 50%

704
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.800
Originally, the balance had to be paid before today.

705
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.300
But your money is a little tight
So I have to wait until the movie is released in Lishui to pay it off

706
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.633
Is that what you mean?

707
00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:10.900
Yes

708
00:46:12.133 --> 00:46:14.367
Gao Standing Committee
Yes

709
00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:16.967
at our publisher here
Has this ever happened?

710
00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:20.033
This is something that has never happened before or since.

711
00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:22.000
Don't be pretentious to me

712
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.967
Got it

713
00:46:22.967 --> 00:46:25.733
Miss, what should we do?

714
00:46:25.733 --> 00:46:27.433
It seems a little difficult

715
00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:33.933
Can you lend me that lighter just now?

716
00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:35.600
Oh my God, this guy...

718
00:46:40.033 --> 00:46:40.933
yes

719
00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:43.200
After this movie is over

720
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.667
Just give her the "God Is Crazy" film

721
00:46:45.167 --> 00:46:46.533
what

722
00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:49.467
I asked you to give it to her

723
00:46:49.467 --> 00:46:50.567
ok boss

724
00:46:50.567 --> 00:46:54.367
Boss, thank you very much...

725
00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:56.400
I will never forget this kindness

726
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.767
You go

727
00:46:57.767 --> 00:47:00.000
OK thank you

728
00:47:03.833 --> 00:47:07.533
Boss, why did you do such an abnormal thing?

729
00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:13.200
Brat

730
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.267
Anyway, that broken film
If you sell it to someone, you’ll get a 20% discount.

731
00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:18.133
Plus we didn’t go to the bereaved family to express our condolences.
Not living up to the principles of being a human being

732
00:47:18.133 --> 00:47:19.367
So I have to discount another 30%

733
00:47:19.367 --> 00:47:21.467
It's okay if we don't pay the final payment.

734
00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:23.867
Are you still a human being?

735
00:47:23.867 --> 00:47:26.233
Really
Oh my god...it hurts

736
00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:29.933
And I was clearly on the books two years ago

737
00:47:29.933 --> 00:47:34.433
I saw 50,000 yuan as a memorial gift from Boss Wu.

738
00:47:34.433 --> 00:47:37.300
You swallowed that money, right?

739

740
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.200
You brat

741
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.933
It hurts...

742
00:47:48.133 --> 00:47:50.467
(Lishui Nanhai Theater)

743
00:48:07.133 --> 00:48:08.433
boss

744
00:48:08.433 --> 00:48:09.867
You are finally here

745
00:48:15.867 --> 00:48:17.967
Why is uncle sitting here?

746
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.067
(Boss Wu Dingchen)

747
00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:23.433
Because the chair is very comfortable

748
00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:26.000
I'll just sit back and watch for a while

749
00:48:27.933 --> 00:48:30.000
Only capable people can be bosses

750
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.100
Just sitting in the boss's seat
Can I be the boss?

751
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.900
why do you say that

752
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.667
How hard Dingchen worked to save the theater

753
00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:41.300
So is there any rescue?

754
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.600
(Boss Wu Dingchen)
I got the "God Is Crazy" film

755
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.600
Then you can repay part of the debt

756
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.567
Please leave

757
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:50.033
Partial debt? How much is that?

758
00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:53.267
Have you looked at the account books carefully?

759
00:48:53.267 --> 00:48:56.100
Just the money your dad took away
That’s 50 million won

760
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.867
Whether it’s 5,000 won or 100 million won
I will repay it

761
00:48:58.867 --> 00:49:00.400
please leave

762
00:49:01.067 --> 00:49:04.533
Who are you yelling at?

763
00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:09.500
Even if I say now that this theater is mine
You have nothing to do with me either

764
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Wife, she said she would pay off the debt

765
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.700
We are not loan sharks

766
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.633
How can this happen between family members?

767
00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:21.933
You don't know where that money came from

768
00:49:21.933 --> 00:49:25.900
My dad gave all his property to my brother

769
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.800
That money means I won’t eat or drink
Work hard

770
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.367
Money earned through hard work

771
00:49:31.367 --> 00:49:34.900
That’s why you work so hard
Ask me for interest

772
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.833
what did you say

773
00:49:35.833 --> 00:49:40.333
The money I gave you before
It’s already more than the principal

774
00:49:40.333 --> 00:49:42.000
Anyway, this theater has been mortgaged

775
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.833
If I don’t pay for it in the future,

776
00:49:43.833 --> 00:49:45.567
Just take the theater away

777
00:49:45.567 --> 00:49:47.933
But now please get out of here

778
00:49:52.033 --> 00:49:54.833
You are really rude

779
00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:56.767
good

780
00:49:56.767 --> 00:49:59.400
If you can't pay it back this year

781
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.600
This theater will become mine

782
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.267
Okay, let's go back

783
00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:05.767
Those who are in debt dare to speak loudly

784
00:50:05.767 --> 00:50:07.633
What’s wrong with today’s society?

785
00:50:07.633 --> 00:50:10.667
Scammers and debtors are so arrogant

786
00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:12.167
Dingchen, let’s go first.

787
00:50:32.033 --> 00:50:34.133
So delicious

788
00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.167
Where is Tetsuo?

789
00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:41.133
I waited for a long time at the bus stop

790
00:50:41.133 --> 00:50:42.933
But I didn't see him

791
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:47.267
What's going on

792
00:50:47.267 --> 00:50:49.000
He clearly said he was coming back

793
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.367
He'll be fine

794
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.867
The last bus will arrive in an hour

795
00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:57.467
I'll go to the bus stop and wait for him

796
00:50:58.167 --> 00:50:59.567
The weather is very cold at night

797
00:50:59.567 --> 00:51:02.200
Come into the house quickly

798
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.400
I'm leaving

799
00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:39.233
听说你父亲过世了

800
00:51:39.967 --> 00:51:42.000
你大学也只念到一半就休学了

801
00:51:44.033 --> 00:51:45.633
贞玉全都跟我说了

802
00:51:46.933 --> 00:51:48.500
原来是这样

803
00:51:49.067 --> 00:51:52.800
我爸本来就久病在身了

804
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.500
所以我一直都有心理准备

805
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.367
我没事 我真的没事

806
00:52:02.233 --> 00:52:06.033
定辰 你以后别再来了

807
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.067
发生什么事了吗

808
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.267
我…没有信心

809
00:52:13.867 --> 00:52:15.167
我们到此为止吧

810
00:52:15.167 --> 00:52:16.900
这是什么意思

811
00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.900
你一定可以重新再站起来

812
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.167
而且资格考你也合格了

813
00:52:20.167 --> 00:52:22.167
之后就能去念大学啦

814
00:52:22.533 --> 00:52:28.567
我仔细想了很久…

815
00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:30.500
发现这些全都是你造成的

816
00:52:31.967 --> 00:52:33.633
这话是什么意思

817
00:52:34.433 --> 00:52:35.867
如果你没有出现

818
00:52:35.867 --> 00:52:38.033
我也不需要跟哲雄竞争

819
00:52:39.333 --> 00:52:42.900
老实说 比起哲雄挨揍

820
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.367
听到你被英卓打的那瞬间

821
00:52:45.367 --> 00:52:48.367
我就想把他给杀了

822
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.767
那并不是意外伤害致死

823
00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:54.700
我是真的想杀了他

824
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.233
李斗学

825
00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:01.733
你自以为在拍什么
悲剧爱情电影吗

826
00:53:01.733 --> 00:53:03.867
我爸过世了 加上我又休学

827
00:53:03.867 --> 00:53:05.267
你觉得很抱歉吗

828
00:53:05.267 --> 00:53:07.333
as a murderer
You're afraid you'll hinder my future

829
00:53:07.333 --> 00:53:08.367
So although you are heartbroken

830
00:53:08.367 --> 00:53:10.533
But for my own good
Decided to disappear from my life

831
00:53:10.533 --> 00:53:12.267
Is that so?

832
00:53:12.267 --> 00:53:14.400
Did I say I wanted to marry you?

833
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.767
If you sympathize with me
will make me more miserable

834
00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:24.700
you really are...

835
00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:29.767
No matter what you say, it doesn't matter to me

836
00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:31.667
But one thing I'm sure of

837
00:53:32.367 --> 00:53:35.567
You are a scarier prison than this one

838
00:53:41.567 --> 00:53:43.333
Let me go now

839
00:53:44.067 --> 00:53:45.767
I'm serious

840
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:50.900
Li Douxue…

841
00:54:05.533 --> 00:54:09.100
(Seoul Jongno)

842
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.000
(Celebrating the successful bid for the 1988 Olympic Games)

843
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:19.967
Down with dictatorship and fight for democracy...

844
00:54:19.967 --> 00:54:35.267
Down with dictatorship and fight for democracy...
Down with dictatorship and fight for democracy...

845
00:55:20.933 --> 00:55:22.233
Abominable

846
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.767
Leave it to me

847
00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:03.433
Brat...

848
00:56:05.133 --> 00:56:06.500
catch them

849
00:56:18.067 --> 00:56:19.267
who are you

850
00:56:21.433 --> 00:56:23.000
What are you playing?

851
00:56:24.133 --> 00:56:25.967
Take off the gas mask

852
00:56:36.867 --> 00:56:38.533
Abominable

853
00:57:00.433 --> 00:57:03.433
Although I don't know who you are

854
00:57:03.433 --> 00:57:05.467
But thanks anyway

855
00:57:18.033 --> 00:57:19.400
Brother

856
00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:22.333
Brother Dou Xue

857
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.100
how are you

858
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.733
Do you really want to be caught and imprisoned?

859
00:57:30.633 --> 00:57:33.600
You said you would be responsible for my life, right?

860
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.400
You said you would make it up to me when you succeed

861
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.167
You brat

862
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.033
"We wake up while people are still sleeping"

863
00:57:48.033 --> 00:57:50.933
"The rural children of the Korean nation..."

864
00:57:50.933 --> 00:57:53.800
We visited the prison several times before

865
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.167
That's because you are so sentimental

866
00:57:56.167 --> 00:57:58.367
I didn't promise to meet you.

867
00:57:58.367 --> 00:58:01.233
You have changed a lot

868
00:58:01.233 --> 00:58:04.067
Where has the simple Li Douxue gone?

869
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.567
You don't know the two of us
Have positions been reversed?

870
00:58:08.567 --> 00:58:11.500
It was my father who owed your family favors.

871
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.933
Now you owe me a favor, right?

872
00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:17.767
Yes

873
00:58:17.767 --> 00:58:22.300
So you start from now on
Be my little brother

874
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.133
You have to work hard for me

875
00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.567
That's of course

876
00:58:26.567 --> 00:58:28.700
Master, just give me your orders

877
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.933
Brat, I'm not kidding you.

878
00:58:33.133 --> 00:58:35.567
Hello

879
00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:39.367
You're not allowed to go to any more demonstrations

880
00:58:39.367 --> 00:58:41.333
Preparing for the Bar Exam

881
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:44.400
As long as you make up your mind
You can pass the judicial examination, right?

882
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.733
Become a prosecutor

883
00:58:46.533 --> 00:58:48.200
Prosecutor?

884
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.300
I didn't know until I was in prison

885
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.767
Those guys who can kill without even an inch of weapons
is the strongest

886
00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:59.767
Brother, have you gone back home to have a look?

887
00:58:59.767 --> 00:59:02.433
How are your uncle and aunt doing?

888
00:59:02.433 --> 00:59:04.400
Zhenyu must have grown up a lot, right?

889
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.733
where do you live now

890
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.000
I didn't go home

891
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.967
My parents are not doing well

892
00:59:09.967 --> 00:59:11.100
Zhenyu has indeed grown up a lot

893
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.067
I live in Seoul now, okay?

894
00:59:15.833 --> 00:59:17.467
This is my address and phone number

895
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.200
Uncle and aunt must miss you very much

896
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.967
By the way, I saw Dingchen

897
00:59:28.967 --> 00:59:31.233
She looks like she's had a hard time

898
00:59:31.233 --> 00:59:32.867
University is also on leave

899
00:59:33.367 --> 00:59:35.667
There are rumors that

900
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:38.900
Her aunt in Seoul wants to take the theater away

901
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.100
Don't try to avoid me

902
00:59:58.633 --> 01:00:01.533
Why am I hiding from you?

903
01:00:01.533 --> 01:00:03.233
I'm very happy to see you

904
01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.933
Pass the judicial examination for me before graduation

905
01:00:05.933 --> 01:00:07.300
This is the command

906
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.533
What about you?

907
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.200
What are you going to do during this time?

908
01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:16.200
Monitor you

909
01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:43.767
(Seoul Busan)
And let me ask you

910
01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:45.600
Your brother...what's his name?

911
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.100
Shunwan…
That's right

912
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.433
It's Soon Wan

913
01:00:48.433 --> 01:00:50.633
Five sisters and brothers…
We are five sisters

914
01:00:50.633 --> 01:00:53.433
(Boss Gao Fenghao)
That's right, I found someone...

915
01:00:53.433 --> 01:00:54.667
Among the five sisters, there is also a younger sister

916
01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:55.567
what's her name

917
01:00:55.567 --> 01:00:58.967
what
What's my sister's name?

918
01:00:58.967 --> 01:01:03.233
But do these guys want to come?

919
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.100
(Fudefang)

920
01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:28.800
I have my eye on an object

921
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.367
Let’s make a fortune this time through real estate fraud.

922
01:01:31.367 --> 01:01:32.733
Is there any way to get the stuff?

923
01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:35.900
Everyone seems to be here

924
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.567
Just explain it carefully.

925
01:01:37.567 --> 01:01:41.000
Wait, there's one more person who hasn't arrived yet.

926
01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.667
The note is coming

927
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.400
Come on in

928
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.433
Come, everyone, gather

929
01:01:52.433 --> 01:01:56.533
Let me introduce the last member of our team

930
01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:01.700
Is it this kid?

931
01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:07.667
(Gao Fenghao, nicknamed Land King)
(Head of a real estate fraud group with three previous convictions)

932
01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:12.400
(Chengjin Construction)

933
01:02:21.267 --> 01:02:25.067
So beautiful. So beautiful.

934
01:02:25.067 --> 01:02:27.533
(Zhang Changde is nicknamed Changgan)
(The responder has four previous convictions)

935
01:02:41.733 --> 01:02:42.733
If you want to poop, go home and poop.

936
01:02:42.733 --> 01:02:44.033
Have you brought anything?

937
01:02:48.067 --> 01:02:49.167
Gotta get it back within three days

938
01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:50.433
Got it

939
01:02:54.033 --> 01:02:55.733
(House ownership certificate)

940
01:02:55.733 --> 01:02:57.267
(personal data)

941
01:02:57.267 --> 01:02:58.867
(gift contract)

942
01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:04.767
(House ownership certificate)

943
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.967
(House ownership certificate Li Mingshu)

944
01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.700
Hello

945
01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.400
What's wrong

946
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.133
Can you run errands?

947
01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:23.433
It was you who asked me to buy apples

948
01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.733
Eat and see for yourself. Eat and see.

949
01:03:25.733 --> 01:03:28.433
I told you to buy Fuji apples

950
01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:30.033
But this is a ruby apple

951
01:03:30.033 --> 01:03:32.500
Isn't this... all the same?

952
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.400
Abominable

953
01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:39.400
Still the elder sister is reliable

954
01:03:41.267 --> 01:03:42.433
It's obviously the same

955
01:03:42.433 --> 01:03:43.700
You stinky guy

956
01:03:46.433 --> 01:03:48.700
(House ownership certificate)

957
01:04:03.933 --> 01:04:06.133
It's so perfect

958
01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:09.000
(Son Soo-gong, Nickname Expert)
(Responsible for three previous convictions for document forgery)

959
01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:16.433
Not bad

960
01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:19.267
(Ma Qingzi nicknamed pants)
(The fake owner has two previous convictions)

961
01:04:19.267 --> 01:04:22.700

962
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.300

(Doing all the chores, a previous conviction)

963
01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:29.667
(Nanhai Theater House Ownership Certificate)

964
01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:31.300
Is that okay?

965
01:04:33.667 --> 01:04:38.567
If only I had done this earlier
We don’t have to use bad words either.

966
01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.033
Let's stamp it here too

967
01:04:43.033 --> 01:04:44.867
(cut book)

968
01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:51.867
Why do we need to sign a divorce agreement?

969
01:04:51.867 --> 01:04:55.233
As long as you pay off the debt
I'll give the theater back to you right away

970
01:04:55.233 --> 01:04:59.300
That is to say
Aunt and niece should trust each other

971
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.167
Maybe other families are like that

972
01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:06.400
But the relationship between our families is extra special

973
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.700
Isn't it?

974
01:05:28.233 --> 01:05:29.600
aunt uncle

975
01:05:30.267 --> 01:05:32.233
You must abide by your agreement with me

976
01:05:32.233 --> 01:05:34.167
Got it...don't worry

977
01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:37.600
By the way, our office has moved.

978
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.100
Jeongjin, if you come to Seoul, please stop by.

979
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.633
I will treat you to the Chinese food you like

980
01:05:43.633 --> 01:05:45.467
I really can't stand you

981
01:05:48.933 --> 01:05:50.033
There are rumors that

982
01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.400
Her aunt in Seoul wants to take the theater away

983
01:06:01.867 --> 01:06:03.233
(Representative of Shinil Industries, Zheng Guoyong)

984
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.600
(Preview of next episode)

985
01:07:06.967 --> 01:07:09.867
Do you have an aunt who runs a theater in Gwangju?

986
01:07:09.867 --> 01:07:10.767
She's my mom's cousin

987
01:07:10.767 --> 01:07:11.533
Get out

988
01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:13.100
Don’t meet Douxue again in the future

989
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.600
Nothing good will happen if you get involved with him

990
01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.567
Well, I think he seems to have changed

991
01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.333
You should hand that to the other party before leaving.

992
01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:21.867
(Nanhai Theater House Ownership Certificate)
There must be someone else who owns the house

993
01:07:21.867 --> 01:07:23.233
We should at least have a clear conscience.

994
01:07:23.233 --> 01:07:24.767
Of course, you have to have a clear conscience

995
01:07:24.767 --> 01:07:26.233
Even in the worst circumstances

996
01:07:26.233 --> 01:07:27.733
I also try hard to make myself feel clear

997
01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:29.533
what is this place

998
01:07:29.533 --> 01:07:31.333
Can't you see?

999
01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.367
Brother, do you want to go to Lishui?

1000
01:07:33.367 --> 01:07:34.800
You also want to meet Dingchen, right?

1001
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.267
Brat, you have to go there by yourself
