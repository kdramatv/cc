(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.833
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.033
Big brother

4
00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:22.867
Go quickly...

5
00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:27.733
safe code

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.667
Damn it

7
00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.100
Yongbi

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.667
Let me go first before talking

9
00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.333
why are you doing this to me

10
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.233
Then why did brother do this to me?

11
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.300
What's wrong with me

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.767
He didn't even mention anything about his career to me.

13
00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.900
You want me to sell drugs to provide you with funds?

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.667
But he threw me off the cliff again

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.933
Brother, we can do this
Is it related to liver and gallbladder photography?

16
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.467
Who told you that?

17
00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:57.633
Something about Togen's career
I plan to tell you later

18
00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.167
what's your reason

19
00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.100
Only tell your successor later

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.867
Because... it's really...

21
00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.933
The correct answer is…

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.633
Because you want to monopolize

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
What is the password

24
00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:18.900
There are only three chances

25
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.567
What is the password

26
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.200
Password…

27
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.733
It's your death anniversary, asshole

28
00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:28.400
Are you satisfied?

29
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.367
Damn it

30
00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.767
catch him

31
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.867
let me go...

32
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.000
I only ask once

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.333
What is the password

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.000
7777

35
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.467
7777 brat

36
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.733
What a lucky set of numbers

37
00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:01.567
Also thinking about old friendship

38
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100
I'll spare your life

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.567
Big brother…

40
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.300
money

41
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:18.867
where is my money

42
00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:21.067
where is the money

43
00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.067
Silly boy

44
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.500
Who puts cash in a safe these days?

45
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.633
It's all in the bank, you brat.

46
00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.533
Brother, I know you don’t like banks

47
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.000
where is the cash

48
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.767
I mean seriously, it's in the bank.

49
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.033
Let's change my wrist this time

50
00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:00.000
Yongbi

51
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.567
Although the sneak attack was successful

52
00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.933
But he kept resisting

53
00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:19.167
It's a bit laborious

54
00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.167
Thank you for your hard work

55
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.767
Big brother, your love has learned from Jiang Dou

56
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.000
I'll ask you one last time

57
00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.400
where is the cash

58
00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.900
Brother has no cash on him, brat

59
00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:46.133
Because I asked him to deposit it in the bank, which is safer

60
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.400
You guy...

61
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.567
where is the cash

62
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.000
Hey you guy

63
00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:31.667
Big brother

64
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.167
Am I your dog...

65
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.367
Because I'm the boss

66
00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.733
Not yet

67
00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:28.333
Have to wait a while longer

68
00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.100
what

69
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.333
What are you doing?

70
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.733
sit down

71
00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.433
Come

72
00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:38.900
If you want me to sit down, do I have to sit down?

73
00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.200
If I act one more time, I will be beaten.

74
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.533
How about my acting skills?

75
00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:52.167
What is going on? What is going on?

76
00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:54.133
Dou Xue said no

77
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:56.367
It means it's not possible yet

78
00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:58.433
Thoughts about fighting...

79
00:05:58.433 --> 00:05:59.933
same as you

80
00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.867
Let's seize it and plan a career.

81
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.967
Really, then why are you rejecting me?

82
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.200
If Dou Xue takes action in person

83
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.500
It will be difficult to gain recognition on the road

84
00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:14.833
From now on, my little brother will rebel
Douxue has nothing to say

85
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.167
Of course, they all plan their careers more
It won't fall into his hands

86
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:18.800
So

87
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.100
What I mean is…

88
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.267
To borrow someone else's knife

89
00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:26.867
Yeah, it's a tactic of killing someone with a borrowed knife.

90
00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.800
Killing with a Borrowed Knife

91
00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:31.933
what does that mean

92
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.333
We need to find a substitute to kill for us.

93
00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:35.333
like a stuntman

94
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:35.967
Yeah

95
00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:37.267
By the way, there’s also…

96
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.433
I want to ask you something

97
00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.900
That’s right…

98
00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.100
what what happened

99
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.133
You don't need to know

100
00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:48.000
It's okay. Come and have a drink.

101
00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:51.233
What? What do you want to ask me for?

102
00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:52.500
I'll tell you later

103
00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:02.033
Damn it

104
00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:31.467
Yongbi

105
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:16.233
It hurts, brat.

106
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.967
Come here, you all, come here

107
00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:23.600
Wait...

108
00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:57.733
Hello Yongbi

109
00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:00.267
you are really over

110
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.100
The soup rice you like so much
What should I do if I can’t eat anymore?

111
00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:07.700
Bastard

112
00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:55.167
Okay, don't move at all.

113
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.200
Why don't you come sooner and you're here now?

114
00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:16.100
The timing is just right

115
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.533
What's wrong

116
00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:21.700
Brother

117
00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:33.533
Brother, are you okay?

118
00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:35.233
Big brother…

119
00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.433
Douxue…

120
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.633
Brother, are you okay?

121
00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:57.167
Brother, are you having a brain problem?

122
00:10:58.167 --> 00:10:59.600
Aren't you crazy?

123
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.433
Yeah

124
00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:05.867
A gangster is not a fool

125
00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:07.100
I'm a prosecutor

126
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.867
Will the gangster believe my words?

127
00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:10.833
Find a way to make him believe it

128
00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.133
So…

129
00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:16.167
You want me to help instigate Liu Yongbi
Let him kill Lian Guangzhuo

130
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:21.000
You can take the opportunity to rise to the top and become the real boss.

131
00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:24.100
You will also catch big fish

132
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.600
Become a star prosecutor

133
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.733
Oh my God, you want me to do this
Do you want me to be a prosecutor?

134
00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:33.000
Otherwise it's because I like you
Do you want to see you succeed?

135
00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:39.633
good

136
00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.900
How could Li Douxue be someone else's younger brother?

137
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.767
Okay, you just become a national gangster

138
00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:52.233
The boss who gets scared when he hears his name

139
00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.200
Being a bad guy

140
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.467
The worst kind of bad guy

141
00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.067
But…

142
00:12:00.067 --> 00:12:02.933
I'll help you this time...

143
00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:05.000
I don’t need to owe you any more favors.

144
00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.833
I helped you get rid of the murder charge and go to jail.

145
00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:20.700
Life is ruined
It would be too easy to just write it off like this.

146
00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:25.500
Help you become the boss of the country

147
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.167
Is this compensation enough?

148
00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:36.300
Okay. If the result is good, then so be it.

149
00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:43.033
That's not possessiveness

150
00:12:43.967 --> 00:12:46.067
My heart towards Dingchen

151
00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.067
Not possessive

152
00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:52.167
If I were really that possessive

153
00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:57.233
Don't care about any favors
I would have arrested you and locked you up a long time ago

154
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.000
Really?

155
00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:02.133
It seems I have to be careful

156
00:13:02.967 --> 00:13:07.767
Otherwise, Prosecutor Choi might handcuff me.

157
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.800
But…

158
00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:12.033
Let's do this first thing

159
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.167
You boy

160
00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:16.767
play again

161
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.133
And…

162
00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.000
I have one more thing to ask you

163
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.300
Big brother

164
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.933
The recording is not over yet

165
00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:27.833
Because during the demolition process

166
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.533
Too many people were injured

167
00:13:30.533 --> 00:13:31.700
Attracted media attention

168
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.033
We need a scapegoat

169
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.900
The higher ups hope so too

170
00:13:40.767 --> 00:13:42.100
Li Douxue

171
00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:46.300
Let him take the responsibility for violent demolition

172
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.600
Send him to jail

173
00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:50.833
Do you want to learn?

174
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.267
Why, he is your right-hand man
So no?

175
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.967
No

176
00:13:55.967 --> 00:13:57.733
I will do as you ask

177
00:13:57.733 --> 00:13:58.700
Anyway, I plan to...

178
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.600
Find an opportunity to deal with him

179
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.633
boss

180
00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:04.767
We really get along

181
00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:06.767
thank you

182
00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.533
It seems like we have to keep waiting.

183
00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:14.033
It will be us who suffer

184
00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.067
(Rong Guang Offal Soup)

185
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:22.467
Brother, why have you never brought me here?

186
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.367
Your eyes are going to shoot out lasers

187
00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:32.733
I'm here to protect my brother

188
00:14:32.733 --> 00:14:34.033
I just sent a few people to follow him

189
00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:36.900
Wasn't it to kill him?

190
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.833
I'm definitely considering it

191
00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.633
Bastard

192
00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:44.867
He actually accepted someone like you into a gang
Brother is so pitiful

193
00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:46.367
you bastard

194
00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:48.467
Are you just as pitiful?

195
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.333
So funny

196
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.967
You will one day...

197
00:14:53.967 --> 00:14:56.267
Will die in my hands

198
00:14:56.767 --> 00:14:58.300
Hello Yongbi

199
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.733
Don’t just be responsible for driving away the demolition households

200
00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:03.467
How about participating directly in the program?

201
00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:05.800
What? Directly involved?

202
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.900
We hold 70% of the shares and you hold 30%

203
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.867
We will give you 10% more shares

204
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.600
because of money laundering and tax expenses

205
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.300
All included in Boss Lian’s shares

206
00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:18.800
Benefits brought by comprehensive urban renewal in the metropolitan area
I heard it’s an astronomical figure

207
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.767
Brother, didn't he tell you this?

208
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.267
And…

209
00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:27.633
I heard you plan to travel from Incheon
Import large quantities of drugs

210
00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:28.933
That was paid for by my eldest brother, right?

211
00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:33.667
obvious

212
00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:37.100
He is raising funds to develop the company
I want you to sell drugs

213
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.267
Then secretly leak the information to the police
get rid of you

214
00:15:39.267 --> 00:15:41.333
From the elder brother's point of view

215
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:42.967
He eats both sides

216
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.633
How about you? You are pitiful too, right?

217
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:52.633
So what do you want, brat?

218
00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:55.967
You have been with him your whole life

219
00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:57.933
He wants to get rid of you

220
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.567
People like me who are halfway to becoming a monk
What will happen

221
00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:02.533
He must...

222
00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:04.600
will drive me away

223
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.433
Go back to you

224
00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:09.300
Isn't it?

225
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.733
Yongbi

226
00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:14.000
Let's pull down the eldest brother together

227
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.533
Then grab Du Geng's career.

228
00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:34.500
I'll go back right away

229
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.633
what's going on

230
00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:42.800
what happened

231
00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:47.100
Brother Douxue successfully rebelled

232
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.233
He finally became a nationally renowned gangster.

233
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.700
This is a place to witness history

234
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.567
Douxue?

235
00:16:55.567 --> 00:16:57.000
Where is Douxue?

236
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.533
he is injured

237
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.033
are you okay

238
00:17:19.133 --> 00:17:20.500
I'm going to be scolded again

239
00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.433
What is this?

240
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.200
Okay, it's okay

241
00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.233
Don't do this

242
00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:53.133
blood will get on you

243
00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.600
I'm fine

244
00:17:58.133 --> 00:18:02.367
Being a gangster means you will get hurt occasionally.

245
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.433
You hateful gangster

246
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.667
let's break up

247
00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.600
You're hurt like this and bleeding

248
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.333
Beat someone

249
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.100
I can't seem to help it...

250
00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:53.733
See you like this again

251
00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:58.533
I won't forget...

252
00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:00.333
The heart you gave me

253
00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:02.833
Don't get hurt

254
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.067
Take good care of yourself

255
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.833
"Can I come back to you again?"

256
00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:22.967
"trembling eyes"

257
00:19:22.967 --> 00:19:27.000
"Looks more sad"

258
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.433
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"
Looking at you, the days we spent in love

259
00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:37.433
"your name"

260
00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:42.400
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

261
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.967
Hey, what's wrong with you?

262
00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:47.867
"Where did it all go wrong?"

263
00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:51.233
Hey Wu Dingchen, what's wrong with you?

264
00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:53.333
I still said it

265
00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:55.433
what

266
00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:57.500
I broke up with him...

267
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.467
I told Douxue not to meet each other again.

268
00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:04.567
what

269
00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:09.233
"It's all in the past"

270
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.633
"Cannot hide"

271
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:21.667
"Missing you"

272
00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:25.333
"It broke out"

273
00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:32.567
"Can I come back to you again?"

274
00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:35.767
"trembling eyes"

275
00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:39.667
"Looks more sad"

276
00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:40.600
Brother, I'm here to get you some clothes.

277
00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.667
are you okay

278
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.400
I don't know what to do either

279
00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:02.100
Okay, don't make any noise

280
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.500
Hello Liu Yongbi

281
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.467
You really got into big trouble this time

282
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.333
I see you are in black and white now
in prison or outside

283
00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:12.133
You all have to ask for happiness.

284
00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:15.167
You're still smiling

285
00:21:15.533 --> 00:21:17.333
Call the prosecutor in charge.

286
00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:18.900
Not a lawyer?

287
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.567
To Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

288
00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:22.733
call him

289
00:21:22.733 --> 00:21:24.633
Don't worry you'll see him soon

290
00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:27.700
You can't treat me like this

291
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.700
Call him right away

292
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.600
are you crazy
Who allowed you to yell and scream here?

293
00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:36.833
what are you doing

294
00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:42.733
what is that

295
00:21:47.233 --> 00:21:48.833
Prosecutor's Office

296
00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:53.467
Holder of this document
Assisted prosecutors in their investigation

297
00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:55.433
Death free gold medal

298
00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:57.733
General Yi Sun-shin received

299
00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.167
what are you talking about

300
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.967
This time I...

301
00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:06.733
I did that to help the prosecutor catch Lian Guangzhuo.

302
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.267
This is the death certificate the prosecutor gave me

303
00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:11.767
Look underneath yourself

304
00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:14.100
There is the fingerprint of Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong underneath.

305
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.567
and the seal of the Director of the Prosecutor's Office

306
00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:18.667
That's right

307
00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:21.167
It has the official seal of the Director of the Prosecutor's Office

308
00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:24.267
But I only know the Attorney General

309
00:22:24.267 --> 00:22:26.600
Who is the prosecutor general?

310
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.100
Ignorant guy

311
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.067
You don’t even know the boss in the prosecutor’s office?

312
00:22:33.067 --> 00:22:34.967
Don’t know…

313
00:22:34.967 --> 00:22:36.067
Hey look at your friend

314
00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:36.967
look at him

315
00:22:36.967 --> 00:22:38.467
Don’t know…

316
00:22:38.467 --> 00:22:40.100
Really

317
00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:43.400
I'm telling you, you messed with the wrong person.

318
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.800
do you know who i am

319
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.967
I don’t know, brat

320
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.167
These are items confiscated from Lian Guangzhuo's home

321
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.567
(Wu Wanxu)

322
00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:20.767
Why is this here?

323
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.967
Brother, you are here

324
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.367
is he in there

325
00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:28.567
He's in there, bro

326
00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:37.367
Are you here for this matter?

327
00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:40.667
Otherwise, what will happen if I come?

328
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.800
you should know that person
Related to our company

329
00:23:44.367 --> 00:23:45.700
I don't know

330
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.567
If only I knew

331
00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:50.967
The minister won't agree either

332
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:59.167
To be honest, we need Lian Guangzhuo very much

333
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.533
End the case quickly and don’t let the media hype it up

334
00:24:01.533 --> 00:24:04.900
Let’s just say that the whole incident was caused by Yoo Young-pil’s desire for revenge.

335
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:09.333
As requested by the master

336
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:13.900
I have already agreed to let Li Dou learn from it.
Take the responsibility for the demolition violence

337
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.333
what

338
00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:19.800
what does that mean

339
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800
I didn’t expect that Master…

340
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.000
But suddenly he was involved in the underworld struggle

341
00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:29.567
I didn't know there was such a thing

342
00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:32.333
What is your relationship with Li Douxue?

343
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.300
What is the relationship?

344
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.567
He will ask you to ask someone to follow him

345
00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:40.500
Also helped him rise to power
Make him a gang boss

346
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.000
Are you...

347
00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:49.267
Do you owe him anything?

348
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.967
There is no such thing

349
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:56.233
I've said it before

350
00:24:57.767 --> 00:24:59.467
Master can have today

351
00:24:59.467 --> 00:25:02.467
All credit must go to Mr.

352
00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:05.733
But now he...

353
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:08.233
may be disappointed

354
00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.233
I heard that you don’t like eating sour food

355
00:25:14.633 --> 00:25:16.633
I only picked the sweet ones

356
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.933
Please eat, brother

357
00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:27.933
That guy Yongpil

358
00:25:27.933 --> 00:25:30.700
Not so bold

359
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.833
It's impossible to plan such a thing alone

360
00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:38.333
There must be someone behind it
You must find that person, Douxue

361
00:25:38.333 --> 00:25:40.867
Brother, is the apple taste okay?

362
00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:42.767
Is Apple important now?

363
00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:45.600
You must find out the mastermind behind it

364
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.767
The police are already investigating

365
00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:52.067
The truth will soon come to light

366
00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:53.267
Hey brat

367
00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:55.067
When did we start trusting the police?

368
00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:57.833
Go find it, you brat

369
00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:10.333
what are you doing

370
00:26:12.267 --> 00:26:13.867
What a pity it would be to throw this away

371
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.200
Come, take them all and eat them

372
00:26:21.733 --> 00:26:23.167
Big brother

373
00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:26.500
Actually I have found...

374
00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:28.300
The mastermind behind this

375
00:26:29.667 --> 00:26:31.633
Really?

376
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:33.667
Who is he? What kind of guy is he?

377
00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:39.000
it's me

378
00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:42.633
Brother, I actually set the trap

379
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.500
You…

380
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.833
you bastard

381
00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:57.500
You'd better just call it a day

382
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.333
Don't let my hard-working brother
Contemporary sinners go to jail

383
00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:05.033
Li Douxue

384
00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:08.400
Let him take the responsibility for violent demolition

385
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.367
Send him to jail

386
00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:11.967
I will do as you ask

387
00:27:11.967 --> 00:27:15.400
Anyway, I plan to find an opportunity to deal with him.

388
00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:19.500
Got it

389
00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:22.133
You go out

390
00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.200
I want to be alone for a while

391
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.200
Brother, are you here to visit the doctor?

392
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.767
how is he

393
00:27:50.767 --> 00:27:52.633
You don't have to go in

394
00:27:53.467 --> 00:27:55.133
what does it mean

395
00:27:56.333 --> 00:27:58.100
Although the operation was successful

396
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.900
But he decided to close the mountain

397
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.100
He can't help it...

398
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.900
I'll be your hunting dog again.

399
00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:09.167
Really?

400
00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:11.733
What a pity

401
00:28:12.833 --> 00:28:14.233
No

402
00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:17.467
You have a smarter hound

403
00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:23.667
In fact, this is all my plan

404
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.567
Please arrange it

405
00:28:26.567 --> 00:28:29.333
I want to show my loyalty to my master

406
00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:48.933
First meeting Hello

407
00:28:48.933 --> 00:28:50.500
My name is Li Douxue

408
00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:55.633
Do you want to die?

409
00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.567
I want to live

410
00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:01.933
Then you still dare to hinder my business?

411
00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:05.433
I don't understand your business

412
00:29:05.433 --> 00:29:09.200
Just act first to survive

413
00:29:11.067 --> 00:29:12.767
You don't understand my business

414
00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:15.067
All I know is that you want us to drive away the bad guys.

415
00:29:15.067 --> 00:29:17.767
I don't know anything else

416
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.667
you are not a hound

417
00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:26.467
If it was a hunting dog, the owner would tell him to die.
he will die

418
00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:27.933
you are a mad dog

419
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.367
Will bite his master back

420
00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:33.200
Brother Guangzhuo

421
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.833
Not my master, we are brothers

422
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.967
I...will never bite my master

423
00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:44.867
If you are willing to be my master

424
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:48.000
When the time comes, if you want me to die, I will die too

425
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.767
Really?

426
00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:53.567
OK I promise you

427
00:29:55.867 --> 00:29:57.867
Go to hell

428
00:29:57.867 --> 00:30:00.033
This is the hound you killed me
the price that must be paid

429
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.033
Isn’t this what you said yourself just now?

430
00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:06.333
It's very simple to say, right?

431
00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:09.233
How about it? Can't do it?

432
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.100
Then stop looking for death and continue being a mad dog.

433
00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.300
You kid is really a mad dog

434
00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:53.500
drink

435
00:30:58.067 --> 00:30:59.767
How do you know there are no bullets in the gun?

436
00:31:00.933 --> 00:31:05.600
If you really want to kill me
You can just find someone to do something to me.

437
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.767
No need to do it yourself

438
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.567
For a gangster, you have a very quick mind.

439
00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:15.133
What is your relationship with Cui Cheol-woong?

440
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.133
We have been brothers since childhood...

441
00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:23.767
Does Cui Cheol-woong owe you anything?

442
00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:28.433
Even if you have known each other as brothers since childhood

443
00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:31.267
The prosecutor shouldn't have stepped in to help either.
Gangsters seize power in gangs, right?

444
00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:34.700
between you two
What happened

445
00:31:37.167 --> 00:31:39.800
Is it possible that you have been in jail on his behalf?

446
00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:43.133
You recruit from the real situation

447
00:31:44.733 --> 00:31:46.633
I saved his life

448
00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:53.667
When Choi Cheol-woong was a mole in the student movement group
I helped him a lot

449
00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:56.333
Is that really all there is to it?

450
00:31:56.733 --> 00:31:58.400
Yes

451
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.367
I want him to repay the favor he owed me at that time

452
00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:02.800
really sorry

453
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.567
Li Douxue

454
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.133
yes

455
00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:16.500
You are my hound from today on

456
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.200
And you've never seen the master's face

457
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.567
We haven't met today either

458
00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:23.967
If I want you to bite, you have to bite.
If I want you to die, you have to die.

459
00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:26.600
I will keep it in mind

460
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.433
Team leader Wu will explain to you what happens next.

461
00:32:45.167 --> 00:32:46.400
Big brother

462
00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:49.733
Big brother

463
00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:52.133
Your wound won't open again, will it?

464
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.900
I really almost died

465
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.533
Really…

466
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.967
Not only is he smart, he is also calm and capable.

467
00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:03.267
He knows exactly what we're going to do

468
00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:05.267
and got rid of their boss

469
00:33:06.033 --> 00:33:08.667
That's why he said he wanted to see me

470
00:33:10.033 --> 00:33:11.700
If you are worried

471
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.067
I'll get rid of him

472
00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:16.467
No time to find someone again

473
00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:17.933
Let's observe him for a while first

474
00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:21.033
I know

475
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.800
Big brother

476
00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:36.600
You should go to the hospital first

477
00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:42.433
The wound needs to be re-sutured, right?

478
00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:04.067
Did you fight again?

479
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.333
Do you want me to see you like this?
Did you just ask me to come?

480
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500
I've seen it, okay?

481
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.667
I'm leaving

482
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.167
Dingchen

483
00:34:25.267 --> 00:34:27.367
If I don't join the underworld...

484
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.233
Do you want to live with me?

485
00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:38.400
I asked you to come because I planned to leave the underworld.

486
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.500
I thought about it carefully

487
00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:49.200
in my hardest time

488
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.300
It was you who grabbed my hand

489
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.233
When I went to agricultural high school

490
00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:58.000
When I went to jail there was...

491
00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:01.467
The last time you came to my house to see me

492
00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:12.000
Every time something bad happens...
I feel like this is my fate

493
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.867
That's why I left you on purpose

494
00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:15.333
But

495
00:35:16.467 --> 00:35:18.100
I don't want to do that anymore

496
00:35:24.267 --> 00:35:26.600
Dingchen, please don’t give up on me

497
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.167
I will leave the underworld

498
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.833
Have a proper job and live a life

499
00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:41.533
I can't live without you

500
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.800
I love you Dingchen

501
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.733
Have you ever considered my mood

502
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.667
I've already made up my mind to leave you

503
00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:54.167
Have you ever considered my mood

504
00:35:54.167 --> 00:35:56.900
you idiot

505
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.833
"I wanna hold your hand"

506
00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:11.767
"I wanna be like a birthday"
What to do…

507
00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:14.433
"No matter you will be here"

508
00:36:14.433 --> 00:36:19.500
"Forever love the only one"

509
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.100
"I wanna look at your mind"

510
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.000
"Take me your eyes"

511
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.967
"Let me in beautiful
your life"

512
00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:29.867
"Come over here"

513
00:36:29.867 --> 00:36:34.667
"Back in your love
in my life"

514
00:36:35.633 --> 00:36:42.267
"Let me go in my life"

515
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:49.900
"Let me go in your life"

516
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.567
"Love you no more"

517
00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:59.000
"I wanna be myself"

518
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.267
"Let me go in my life"

519
00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:09.833
"I wanna hold your hand"

520
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:12.033
"I wanna be like a birthday"

521
00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:13.233
Yes brother

522
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:14.833
You guys are leaving

523
00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:16.233
Get out of the way...

524
00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:18.400
You didn't ask us to come, you drove us away.

525
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.767
Big brother wants us to leave

526
00:37:24.933 --> 00:37:26.367
Won't it be cold?

527
00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:28.767
very warm

528
00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:31.800
"Come over here"

529
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.333
"Back in your love
in my life"

530
00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:44.300
"Let me go in my life"

531
00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:51.667
"Let me go in your life"
(Seoul Hospital)

532
00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:57.467
"Love you no more"

533
00:37:57.467 --> 00:38:00.900
"I wanna be myself"

534
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:06.633
"Let me go in my life"

535
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:15.200
"Let me go in my life"

536
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:22.400
"Let me go in your life"

537
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.467
"Love you no more"

538
00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:31.900
"I wanna be myself"

539
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:38.233
"Let me go in my life"

540
00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:49.300
There are Mundong and Sinhwadong

541
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:54.033
The whole area is a slum.
It will flood whenever it rains

542
00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:56.467
A total of 14,000 square meters of land
All included in the update plan

543
00:38:57.967 --> 00:39:00.667
Mingtangdong is completely incomparable to this place.

544
00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:04.233
The original intention was to build houses for the common people.

545
00:39:04.233 --> 00:39:06.500
But it doesn't make much money

546
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.067
Coupled with the rush to raise funds for the Olympic Games

547
00:39:09.067 --> 00:39:11.600
It was changed to building high-end apartments.

548
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.167
There will probably be serious protests from the residents.

549
00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:17.167
It's useless even if they protest

550
00:39:17.167 --> 00:39:19.233
It doesn't matter what the superior has to sacrifice.

551
00:39:19.233 --> 00:39:20.833
This plan is imperative

552
00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:24.700
Our commander's mobility is amazing.

553
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.700
Is there a lot of land available to buy over there?

554
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.667
There are many more

555
00:39:32.633 --> 00:39:35.700
How much is the profit after development?

556
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.933
Just what the government can earn
At least one trillion won

557
00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:45.000
Land will make money

558
00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:48.167
But I need to update the place
It's not just here

559
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.700
are you okay

560
00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:16.233
OMG... they are so sweet.

561
00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:21.100
According to the map, just after we came out
This is Mundong

562
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.233
Next to it is Xinhuadong

563
00:40:25.067 --> 00:40:26.733
There are a lot of slums here

564
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.167
Over here

565
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.667
Ouch

566
00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:38.933
Why are you eating instant noodles again?

567
00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:40.833
There should be rice in the rice pot, right?

568
00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:42.833
Why are you coming home later and later?

569
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.567
Really, am I an office worker?

570
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.200
Is there any fixed time to get off work?

571
00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:49.667
I don’t want to think about who asked me to help her...

572
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.533
Where is Tetsuo?

573
00:40:56.533 --> 00:40:57.833
Did he come home to see him?

574
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.633
He is too busy at work

575
00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:02.967
Rented a room near his office

576
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.033
Having said that, I think Tetsuo's mother
It seems like she will remarry

577
00:41:13.267 --> 00:41:15.600
Don't talk nonsense

578
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.033
Maybe that person is just a relative

579
00:41:17.033 --> 00:41:20.433
Stop lying

580
00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:22.333
She said that person was her cousin

581
00:41:22.333 --> 00:41:25.600
How can any cousins hold hands lovingly?

582
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.900
Madam is the daughter-in-law of a famous family
Besides, Tetsuo is still here

583
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.967
She won't remarry easily

584
00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:34.633
It's so depressing

585
00:41:36.167 --> 00:41:40.200
Scarecrow in the field
They are more observant than you

586
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.233
Help her prepare a place to stay

587
00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:44.333
What kind of salon should I open for her?

588
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:47.467
Now I'm still looking at the land with her.

589
00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:48.567
Not siblings

590
00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:51.267
How could it be possible to be so nice to her and hurt like this?

591
00:41:51.267 --> 00:41:53.167
And that man is so handsome

592
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.167
Stop talking and clear the table.

593
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.433
I'm a woman who goes out to work and make money.

594
00:42:03.267 --> 00:42:04.733
You collect it yourself

595
00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:08.200
Dou Xue’s mother…

596
00:42:11.167 --> 00:42:13.167
Did that woman take the wrong medicine?

597
00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:16.067
Be careful...

598
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.867
Where did you go and drink so much?

599
00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:39.433
what

600
00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:43.400
Do you really want to quit the gang?

601
00:42:43.667 --> 00:42:45.000
Yes

602
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.400
I don't want to be a third-rate gangster anymore.

603
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.733
If Kwang Tak or Yong Pil comes to seek revenge on you again

604
00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:53.233
What will you do then

605
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.933
They would never dare to do such a thing

606
00:42:55.933 --> 00:42:57.067
Don't worry

607
00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:58.900
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

608
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.200
Is it too much?

609
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.533
Since we joined together

610
00:43:01.533 --> 00:43:03.267
We should go to the end together

611
00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:06.233
Can a person who is the boss leave at will?

612
00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:07.533
That's right

613
00:43:07.533 --> 00:43:10.000
Boss, you really let us down.

614
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.133
Should I discuss it with you?

615
00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:11.933
Will you let me go?

616
00:43:11.933 --> 00:43:14.500
Boy, what are we going to do?

617
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.367
Are you going to part ways with us?

618
00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:17.000
Really?

619
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.167
I...I knew it would be like this

620
00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:22.533
Unfaithful guy

621
00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.300
Now you get huge benefits for yourself

622
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.633
Just don’t want to divide us

623
00:43:25.633 --> 00:43:27.467
So you guys...

624
00:43:27.467 --> 00:43:29.233
Let these gentlemen disband.

625
00:43:29.233 --> 00:43:31.533
Brother, let’s go too

626
00:43:31.867 --> 00:43:32.700
this traitor

627
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.900
Let's go, brother, get out...

628
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.533
Let's go
Everyone, please wait a moment

629
00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:39.733
In order to carry out legal contracting works

630
00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:42.200
So he has to leave the illegal gang

631
00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:44.100
Am I right?

632
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:49.700
If you are undertaking a contracting project
I should really need your help, Brother Feng Hao.

633
00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:52.900
Stop committing illegal real estate fraud today

634
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.467
Let’s invest in real estate development legally

635
00:43:56.733 --> 00:44:00.700
I knew that was the case

636
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.100
family
Yes, we are a family

637
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.067
He is indeed our boss

638
00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:07.767
you are the best

639
00:44:09.133 --> 00:44:12.433
Brother, you have to be by my side too

640
00:44:12.433 --> 00:44:13.900
Of course

641
00:44:15.767 --> 00:44:17.900
As for Jisoo hyung and Sunwoo...

642
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.400
Choose yourselves

643
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.533
To join our contracting project

644
00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:22.033
Still have to leave the gang

645
00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:23.333
No matter which path you choose

646
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.600
I'll give you all the contractor shares

647
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.133
Really…

648
00:44:28.133 --> 00:44:30.467
I don’t want to fight or kill

649
00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:33.733
Want to wear a suit and tie all day

650
00:44:33.733 --> 00:44:36.233
It must be super cool to commute to work like this

651
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.533
But I haven’t read the book

652
00:44:38.533 --> 00:44:40.267
Jisoo hyung, isn’t it?

653
00:44:40.267 --> 00:44:41.500
Xuanyu

654
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.267
Large companies also have security departments

655
00:44:44.267 --> 00:44:45.633
You don't have to worry about finding a job

656
00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:47.267
The most important thing is

657
00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:50.567
You need to eliminate the gangster nature in your body

658
00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:51.433
Do you know

659
00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:52.567
Is it the nature of a gangster?

660
00:44:52.567 --> 00:44:54.267
How to eliminate this

661
00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:57.067
Could it be that when I was still in my mother’s arms?
Is he just a gangster?

662
00:44:57.067 --> 00:44:58.000
Really?

663
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.233
If my family situation is okay

664
00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:03.600
Neither will I...

665
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.300
Okay, then let's do the contracting project together.

666
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.133
good

667
00:45:06.133 --> 00:45:07.233
I don't want

668
00:45:07.233 --> 00:45:07.933
what

669
00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:10.867
If everyone went into contracting projects

670
00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:12.467
Who will be responsible for the demolition work?

671
00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:15.633
And is it a contracting project?
Can you avoid dirty things at all?

672
00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:18.267
Demolition is simply demolishing a house

673
00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:20.000
Just leave it to others to do

674
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.400
Xuanyu and I can't give up
The nature of being a gangster

675
00:45:25.133 --> 00:45:27.200
We should stay in the gang

676
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:28.767
Wait...

677
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:30.600
Come on, you brat

678
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.533
Goodbye

679
00:45:31.533 --> 00:45:34.167
It seems I can give up my gangster nature.

680
00:45:34.567 --> 00:45:36.667
Then see you later, Luo

681
00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.033
OK

682
00:45:38.033 --> 00:45:39.533
Xuanyu…

683
00:45:39.533 --> 00:45:41.267
That kid really loves to be cool

684
00:45:42.467 --> 00:45:44.067
Really

685
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.367
Brother, we really can’t give up
Is it the nature of a gangster?

686
00:45:49.933 --> 00:45:51.667
Xuanyu

687
00:45:52.633 --> 00:45:54.833
Usually when cleaning the house

688
00:45:54.833 --> 00:45:56.433
Not only do we have to clean the kitchen

689
00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:58.200
The floor also needs to be mopped, right?

690
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.067
Yes

691
00:45:59.067 --> 00:46:00.300
So what should I use to wipe it?

692
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.733
Wipe the kitchen with a clean rag

693
00:46:02.733 --> 00:46:04.233
The floor is wiped with a dirty rag

694
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.600
Right

695
00:46:06.533 --> 00:46:10.133
Doo Hak and Hyung Soo will be the clean rags

696
00:46:10.133 --> 00:46:13.400
The two of us are going to be dirty rags

697
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.700
Do you say we are dirty rags?

698
00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.700
Brat, there's nothing wrong with that.

699
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.867
I don't want to be a dirty rag

700
00:46:20.567 --> 00:46:23.400
It's just that the roles are different

701
00:46:25.067 --> 00:46:29.033
Anyway, both kinds of rags can clean the house
Polish it until it shines

702
00:46:29.733 --> 00:46:33.100
But why don’t you ask me first every time?
Just without permission...

703
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.333
Because I don't want to be separated from you

704
00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:42.733
Let's just do what we're good at

705
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.200
We're going to be the boss now, brat.

706
00:46:47.533 --> 00:46:51.000
Are you in charge of a hotel or a nightclub?

707
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.700
Brother, you choose first

708
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.000
You kid...

709
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.267
Brother, you choose first.

710
00:46:58.067 --> 00:46:59.033
Really?

711
00:46:59.033 --> 00:46:59.933
Really

712
00:46:59.933 --> 00:47:01.667
Then I want to choose a hotel

713
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:03.233
I want to choose a hotel...

714
00:47:03.233 --> 00:47:04.933
Then why are you asking me?

715
00:47:04.933 --> 00:47:06.400
Hello…

716
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.233
Can't you put me in charge of the hotel?

717
00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:10.400
Come here

718
00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:14.367
Does Tetsuo like Douxue's girlfriend?

719
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.033
why didn't you tell me

720
00:47:18.033 --> 00:47:20.400
I was going to report to you

721
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.133
But…

722
00:47:23.533 --> 00:47:28.300
Between Lee Doo Hak and Prosecutor Choi
It’s not just a women’s problem

723
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.333
The deputy chief is also related to the two of them.

724
00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:37.400
You seem too hasty

725
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.867
Is it for Dingchen?

726
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.567
I can't get married as a gangster.

727
00:47:43.367 --> 00:47:45.100
you are right

728
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.200
When are you planning to get married?

729
00:47:46.667 --> 00:47:49.367
Well... let's wait until the contracting project is on track.

730
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:50.200
(Manager Li Douxue)

731
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.400
That's no wonder you're so anxious

732
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.367
But you should know

733
00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:56.200
The more times this happens, the more cautious you should be.

734
00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:02.633
Li Dou learns to be a contractor?

735
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:07.067
He's just a little hooligan
Are you sure you can hand over the contracting work to him?

736
00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:10.667
After several twists and turns, some accidents happened

737
00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:12.733
The deputy commander had no choice

738
00:48:20.867 --> 00:48:26.033
I will introduce Tetsuo to the deputy minister soon

739
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:27.300
Then we will soon...

740
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.633
We will become a family, right?

741
00:48:36.767 --> 00:48:39.300
between family members

742
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.000
No secrets

743
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.733
Got it

744
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.333
before becoming a family

745
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.933
There's one more thing you need to know

746
00:49:10.267 --> 00:49:11.333
Please come in

747
00:49:11.333 --> 00:49:13.233
I came too late, right?

748
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.600
Tetsuo

749
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.300
This is the gentleman I told you about

750
00:49:19.467 --> 00:49:21.500
Prosecutor Choi, nice to meet you.

751
00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:28.700
Young people who contribute to the country

752
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.567
Don't be discouraged

753
00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:32.667
See you next time

754
00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:47.033
After ending our military school life, we separated.

755
00:49:47.033 --> 00:49:49.700
It took a long time before we met again

756
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.900
Am I doing an interview?

757
00:49:55.933 --> 00:49:59.567
because of my mother
Will you always take care of me secretly?

758
00:50:02.367 --> 00:50:04.800
After I was captured and sent to the army

759
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.900
met someone
A guy who is no different from a devil

760
00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:17.267
He said someone would help me become a prosecutor

761
00:50:17.267 --> 00:50:19.167
It turns out that person is the deputy chief

762
00:50:25.767 --> 00:50:27.800
You and mediator Wu Wanxu...

763
00:50:28.867 --> 00:50:31.633
Have we worked together for a long time?

764
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.100
I worked with him when I was a squadron captain.
This should be considered a long time

765
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.000
So…

766
00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:42.300
When he was at the Security Command

767
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.100
You also work together

768
00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:48.100
It's almost time for him to arrive

769
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.200
Prosecutor Choi

770
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.967
every time i see you
Everybody feels very heavy

771
00:51:13.033 --> 00:51:16.367
I know it's too late to say this now

772
00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:22.200
but i'm really sorry
Those things I did to you

773
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.200
Forcing Prosecutor Choi to enlist in the army

774
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.467
And forcing you to be a mole?
It has nothing to do with the deputy chief

775
00:51:28.733 --> 00:51:31.733
I also did it after you passed the judicial examination

776
00:51:31.733 --> 00:51:34.200
I just found out that you are my wife’s son

777
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.633
The things I did to you were not my intentions

778
00:51:41.733 --> 00:51:43.467
please forgive me

779
00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:57.700
The deputy minister was completely unaware of those things.

780
00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.233
Everything was instigated by me

781
00:52:01.767 --> 00:52:04.233
sorry please forgive me

782
00:52:05.467 --> 00:52:10.000
I will spend my whole life atonement and compensation to you two

783
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.767
And loyal to both of them

784
00:52:15.167 --> 00:52:16.633
stand up

785
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.467
I'll just wait and see

786
00:52:24.467 --> 00:52:28.100
How will you atone and pledge your allegiance?

787
00:52:31.167 --> 00:52:32.767
I really wanted to die at that time

788
00:52:34.233 --> 00:52:36.600
I even wrote a suicide note

789
00:52:37.167 --> 00:52:42.633
But I believe I can take revenge one day

790
00:52:42.633 --> 00:52:44.633
I relied on this belief to survive.

791
00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:50.500
Tetsuo thank you

792
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.667
thank you for surviving

793
00:52:53.167 --> 00:52:56.667
Mom couldn't survive without you

794
00:52:56.667 --> 00:52:58.233
Prosecutor Choi, I’m sorry.

795
00:52:58.767 --> 00:53:00.300
Although I also feel very sad

796
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.833
But when doing things for the country

797
00:53:01.833 --> 00:53:05.133
Occasionally, some people will be sacrificed by accident.

798
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.700
I apologize to you on behalf of the country

799
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.200
really sorry

800
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.767
A sacrifice made by accident?

801
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.567
Mom, I can't accept your marriage.

802
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.667
Tetsuo

803
00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:32.333
These people are not human at all

804
00:53:34.867 --> 00:53:36.600
They are not human beings…

805
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.367
It's a bunch of monsters

806
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.467
Do you want to choose the monster or me?

807
00:53:48.533 --> 00:53:50.900
you decide

808
00:54:05.333 --> 00:54:07.633
So cold

809
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.133
(Terrible outsider team)
what

810
00:54:26.133 --> 00:54:27.867
Do you want us to change the title?

811
00:54:27.867 --> 00:54:30.033
Yes, please change the title of the film

812
00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:33.533
"Terrible outsider team"
What's wrong with this title?

813
00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:36.033
Most people have read the original comic

814
00:54:36.033 --> 00:54:39.667
Our Performance Ethics Committee believes that
The word "terrible"

815
00:54:39.667 --> 00:54:41.667
May contribute to an atmosphere of social panic

816
00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:44.233
Please remove the word "terrible"

817
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.367
Section Chief, as you say

818
00:54:48.367 --> 00:54:50.333
"The daughter rescued from the mire" is also possible
Throwing society into a quagmire

819
00:54:50.333 --> 00:54:53.033
"Killing battlefield" will bring social
Turned into a killing scene

820
00:54:53.033 --> 00:54:55.300
When these movies were released
The Performance Ethics Committee has not been established yet.

821
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.433
Instead of doing this, you might as well be like before
Big Thorns conducts movie content censorship

822
00:54:58.433 --> 00:55:01.333
what review we are review

823
00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:04.833
It is up to us to judge the standards of social ethics

824
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:07.367
If you don’t change the title of the film

825
00:55:07.367 --> 00:55:09.133
Don't even think about showing it

826
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.667
Wait...

827
00:55:13.067 --> 00:55:17.033
(Principal Wu Dingchen)

828
00:55:17.033 --> 00:55:20.033
They are really humorous

829
00:55:20.033 --> 00:55:23.367
If you remove the word "terrible"
There are only four words left: "outsider team"

830
00:55:23.367 --> 00:55:24.867
It would be super weird

831
00:55:24.867 --> 00:55:26.467
(Principal Wu Dingchen)
That is to say

832
00:55:26.467 --> 00:55:29.333
You have to find other words to replace it.

833
00:55:30.233 --> 00:55:32.067
"Terrible outsider team"

834
00:55:32.067 --> 00:55:34.067
"The unrivaled outsider team"

835
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.500
Or "a brave and capable outsider team"

836
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.067
This isn't some Navy baseball team.

837
00:55:44.067 --> 00:55:45.933
Since it is a work directed by Lee Chang-ho

838
00:55:45.933 --> 00:55:47.867
How about just replacing it with the director’s name?

839
00:55:47.867 --> 00:55:49.800
Very good

840
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.267
"Lee Jang-ho's outsider team"?

841
00:55:52.267 --> 00:55:53.733
Yes

842
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.167
Let’s ask Director Li for his opinion.

843
00:55:57.167 --> 00:55:58.467
OK

844
00:55:59.933 --> 00:56:04.867
But I feel like the movie business is so boring lately

845
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.067
Because of the amendment to the film law

846
00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:09.567
Now anyone can make and import movies

847
00:56:09.567 --> 00:56:12.300
plus the popularity of television and videotapes

848
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.933
The glory days of cinema are over

849
00:56:14.933 --> 00:56:18.000
And the production costs are still rising.

850
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.400
But as long as we make great movies

851
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.133
Those second-rate film companies
It will close itself

852
00:56:22.867 --> 00:56:26.667
than excellent works
I should make something that can sell well.

853
00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:34.100
Don't forget that your mother is a businesswoman

854
00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:40.867
You are here

855
00:56:40.867 --> 00:56:42.533
(Nandao Film Company)

856
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.033
who is he

857
00:56:45.033 --> 00:56:46.633
he is my boyfriend

858
00:56:49.267 --> 00:56:51.567
You have a boyfriend

859
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.033
OMG…

860
00:56:56.033 --> 00:56:58.767
He's tall and handsome.

861
00:56:59.467 --> 00:57:01.000
what's your name

862
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.300
My name is Li Douxue

863
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.567
nice to meet you

864
00:57:05.033 --> 00:57:07.467
What happened to you? You got a boyfriend...

865
00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:10.767
I didn’t even tell my mother that I had a boyfriend.

866
00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:12.967
Don’t you know it now?

867
00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:15.933
I am Dingchen’s mother. I am her mother.

868
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:17.767
My name is Che Jinyu

869
00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.967
so happy to meet you

870
00:57:19.967 --> 00:57:22.600
Yes, I'm happy to meet you too.

871
00:57:23.367 --> 00:57:25.133
You came just in time

872
00:57:25.133 --> 00:57:27.167
let's eat together

873
00:57:27.167 --> 00:57:28.900
I know a good restaurant

874
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.667
Mom, we have an appointment

875
00:57:32.667 --> 00:57:35.800
Ouch, who did you make an appointment with?

876
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.267
Are you going to eat with anyone else?

877
00:57:38.267 --> 00:57:41.300
Is there anyone more important than me as a mother?

878
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.933
It’s so sad…

879
00:57:43.933 --> 00:57:45.100
Who is it?

880
00:57:46.167 --> 00:57:47.967
Who is it?

881
00:57:48.833 --> 00:57:50.767
It's my mother in the nursing home.

882
00:57:55.233 --> 00:57:57.467
Then go to the appointment

883

Yes

Let's have a bowl of cold noodles and then go back.

885
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.867
OK

886
00:58:00.867 --> 00:58:03.067
Then let’s see Luo next time

887
00:58:03.067 --> 00:58:04.700
Please walk slowly

888
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.433
nice to meet you

889
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.067
She is your mother

891
00:58:25.767 --> 00:58:27.367
"You fool"

892
00:58:27.367 --> 00:58:31.400
"If you can't catch him, express your feelings."

893
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.267
Aunt…

894
00:58:32.267 --> 00:58:36.800
"You're just a fool"

895
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800
mouth open

896
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.033
OK

897
00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:42.433
"If you can't catch him, tell him you love you"
Is it delicious?

898
00:58:42.433 --> 00:58:45.167
Dingchen, you can eat too

899
00:58:45.167 --> 00:58:48.133
"He is leaving you"

900
00:58:48.133 --> 00:58:49.400
Does it taste okay?

901
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.733
Super delicious

902
00:58:50.733 --> 00:58:51.933
"Speak quickly"
My hands are black

903
00:58:51.933 --> 00:58:53.567
I'll wipe it for you

904
00:58:54.267 --> 00:58:55.367
I should be allowed to bake it

905
00:58:55.367 --> 00:59:01.800
"On the unmarked streets and alleys"

906
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:07.367
"Only those who cannot speak"

907
00:59:07.367 --> 00:59:09.500
Thank you for your hard work today

908
00:59:11.367 --> 00:59:12.933
I'm really sorry

909
00:59:12.933 --> 00:59:14.467
I went to see my aunt too late

910
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:17.900
Don't say that. Thank you for accompanying me to see her.

911
00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.700
Go back quickly and have a good rest

912
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.533
good

913
00:59:26.633 --> 00:59:28.267
Dingchen

914
00:59:41.867 --> 00:59:43.367
Since these days

915
00:59:44.833 --> 00:59:47.167
You all live a life where you are forced to grow up

916
00:59:47.867 --> 00:59:49.633
It must be very hard

917
00:59:51.567 --> 00:59:53.833
"The moment my eyes met yours"
But I...

918
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.933
But so ignorant

919
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.800
"It's like the air is condensed"
sorry

920
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.700
"I move slowly, don't want to miss it"

921
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.900
"My eyes are full of you"
from now on

922
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.500
