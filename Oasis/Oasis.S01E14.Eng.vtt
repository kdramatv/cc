﻿1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.667
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.200
you guy

3
00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.233
Still alive

4
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.233
Wu Wanxu, you have committed too many crimes

5
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.133
The law alone is not enough to make you pay the price

6
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.267
(three days ago)

7
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:37.167
academic father

8
00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:40.300
Killed by Li Yongde, a drug addict
And disguised as a traffic accident

9
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.700
The person who instructs him on the stage

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.667
It's Wu Wanxu

11
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:44.667
But Wu Wanxu

12
00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:45.933
(Episode 14)
No grudge against Douxue’s father

13
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.767
No reason to kill him

14
00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.167
That is, the one who instigated him to kill someone.
It's the person above him

15
00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.933
That could be a person

16
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.633
It may also be a family decision

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.333
Can't you just call the police?

18
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.800
Hey, how many more years have you lived?

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.167
Can my brain grow as well?

20
00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.700
Do the police dare to set up a security and enterprise department?

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.733
And who would believe a drug addict?

22
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.933
who will believe

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.330
Yes, the police really don’t dare to do it.

24
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.496
But just like the result of Yongpil’s secret investigation

25
00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:20.930
In order to enrich his own pockets, Wu Wanxu

26
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.796
Collection of protection fees from various pachinko arcades

27
00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.896
And although he is a confidant of Huang Zhongcheng’s family,

28
00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.530
There is some grudge between him and Cui Zhexiong

29
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.996
So it’s very likely that it’s Choi Cheol-woong

30
00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:31.230
Did he get demoted and go to Busan?

31
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.163
That's right

32
00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:34.763
But wasn't he transferred back?

33
00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:38.496
Huang Zhongcheng should have transferred him back.

34
00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.463
After all, he is the confidant who has been following him for the longest time.

35
00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.496
Choi Cheol-woong probably can’t do anything about it either.

36
00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:44.430
What's more important

37
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.996
He knows best what dirty things that family has done

38
00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:49.996
Huang Zhongcheng probably wanted to fight against him

39
00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:54.963
It's better to keep him by your side to comfort him
It's better to keep an eye on him

40
00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:56.130
Originally a traitor

41
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.930
He is the closest to the boss
or the person most familiar with

42
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.530
Really?

43
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.996
No wonder…

44
00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:05.263
You kid deserves a beating

45
00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:11.296
Anyway, we can't provoke them when they are united.

46
00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.796
power

47
00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:14.163
(Jiang Ruzhen)
money

48
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:16.030
(Cui Cheol-woong)
Prosecutor with investigative powers

49
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.796
And kill people without batting an eyelid

50
00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:19.963
(Wu Wanxu)
cruel hound

51
00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.230
must break their unity

52
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.096
That's right

53
00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:24.963
Then...how to break

54
00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:27.463
Sow seeds of doubt

55
00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:28.463
To whom

56
00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:29.763
Choi Cheol-woong?

57
00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.196
No

58
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.463
among those people

59
00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:37.563
The weakest

60
00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:39.530
the most greedy person

61
00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:46.463
(Wu Wanxu)

62
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.763
hound

63
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.263
hound

64
00:02:56.963 --> 00:02:58.863
(Wu Wanxu)

65
00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:00.330
(two days ago)

66
00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:03.363
what does that mean

67
00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.463
Do you mean I'm covering up Team Leader Wu?

68
00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:08.163
Yes

69
00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.463
it looks like that

70
00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:13.130
Does Mom have any weaknesses in Team Leader Wu's hands?

71
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.130
what on earth are you talking about

72
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.763
what weakness

73
00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:19.196
Tetsuo

74
00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:22.363
I know you hate Team Leader Wu

75
00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:24.196
But he sincerely apologized

76
00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.730
And he's the one our family needs.

77
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.763
people in need

78
00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.630
Just forgive him

79
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:35.196
Yes, Mom really needs him.

80
00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.430
After all, he is helping you accumulate assets.
The biggest contributor, right?

81
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.763
Tetsuo, Mom is doing this for your future...

82
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.263
No…

83
00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:47.030
Mom, it’s not for my future

84
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.363
you could ruin my future

85
00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.930
The property you purchased

86
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.863
All after learning the development information in advance
I just bought it

87
00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:58.530
I'm not the only one like this

88
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.363
Everyone is like this

89
00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:02.196
You should also know very well, right?

90
00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:03.963
Is everyone like this?

91
00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:05.496
ordinary people

92
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:07.930
No power, no information

93
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.130
Wu Wanxu is definitely not out of loyalty
I just gave you that information

94
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.196
Mom is not someone who doesn’t know how to repay her kindness.

95
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.430
Those will become evidence later

96
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.763
Of course

97
00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:19.363
If you want the horse to run, can you just use the whip?

98
00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:21.496
You have to give the carrot at the same time before it will run.

99
00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:23.330
This method…

100
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Only effective on tameable animals like horses

101
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.730
Wu Wanxu is not a beast that will be tamed by you

102
00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:31.896
Tetsuo

103
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.896
We have your father's backing

104
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.030
Team Leader Wu

105
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.563
Never dare to do anything to us
or betray us

106
00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:42.296
Wu Wanxu…

107
00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:45.363
The more you know about us

108
00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:49.163
may become
deadly weapons against us

109
00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:52.430
Tetsuo, why are you like this?

110
00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:57.563
Didn't we just say yes to dad?
Have to forgive him

111
00:04:58.496 --> 00:04:59.830
Don't say any more

112
00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:04.696
Wu Wanxu threatened me

113
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.863
here

114
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.763
what

115
00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:10.263
i killed someone

116
00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:12.763
There is also the matter of Brother Douxue taking the blame for me.

117
00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:15.130
He knew everything, so he threatened me with that

118
00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:21.530
And…

119
00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.530
Are there any others?

120
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.830
And the guy who killed the key witness.

121
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.163
Is the person closest to you

122
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.330
Mom, I just want to make sure

123
00:05:39.263 --> 00:05:40.763
The death of Uncle Zhong Hao...

124
00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:43.196
Is it related to mom?

125
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.596
what are you talking about

126
00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:51.330
Do you think I sent someone?
Are you going to kill your Uncle Zhong Hao?

127
00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:55.730
It was a traffic accident

128
00:05:57.263 --> 00:05:58.830
If not...

129
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.263
Just tell me no

130
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.463
Don't look at me like that

131
00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:06.696
not me

132
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.296
I didn't do that

133
00:06:09.296 --> 00:06:10.696
So…

134
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:12.563
Is it dad?

135
00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:14.463
Tetsuo

136
00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:16.396
Please be honest, Mom

137
00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:20.630
you know

138
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.530
What did he tell me?

139
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.630
He said…

140
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.230
The murderer is the person closest to me

141
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.630
So…

142
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.463
Please tell the truth, Mom

143
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.563
It was Lee Jong-ho who threatened your mother first

144
00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:35.563
Husband

145
00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:38.430
what

146
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.196
When Team Leader Wu was protecting your mother

147
00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:43.163
Found out that Lee Jongho was threatening your mother

148
00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.163
I only found out later when I received the report.

149
00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:47.730
He said he solved it on his own

150
00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:52.430
Is this true?

151
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.096
How could Team Leader Wu do that on his own...

152
00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:54.963
Because of work characteristics

153
00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:57.296
in certain emergency situations
He will kill first and tell later

154
00:06:57.296 --> 00:06:58.230
Don't you also know

155
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.530
But this kind of thing is inevitable...

156
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.630
Don't pursue it any further

157
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.996
There is no need to pursue it, and it cannot be pursued.

158
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.796
Do you want me to tell you what the truth is?

159
00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:10.996
The so-called truth…

160
00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:15.230
Not all truths are true
They are all worthy of being discovered.

161
00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:17.596
Some unpleasant truths

162
00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:20.896
It will cause social chaos and lead to the destruction of the country.

163
00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:23.063
Sometimes I pretend not to know or cover up

164
00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:25.130
is a more correct and valuable approach

165
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.363
But if you must know the truth

166
00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:29.830
Just go and give it a try

167
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.696
But…

168
00:07:31.696 --> 00:07:33.630
You have to let go of everything first

169
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.130
Including your ambition and love...

170
00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:06.163
I was also shocked

171
00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:10.530
I didn’t expect Team Leader Wu to do that.

172
00:08:13.863 --> 00:08:18.763
Did uncle really ask you for money, Mom?

173
00:08:20.196 --> 00:08:21.530
Yes

174
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:24.596
Then did you give it to him?

175
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.763
Real estate company run by Douxue's mother

176
00:08:31.263 --> 00:08:33.630
It was opened with the money I gave you.

177
00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.030
is true

178
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.196
to be honest

179
00:08:53.996 --> 00:08:55.296
I can't believe it

180
00:08:57.896 --> 00:08:59.296
He's not that kind of person

181
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.230
me too

182
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.263
Probably it’s too hard to start from scratch.

183
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.796
he to me

184
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.096
just like dad

185
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:15.996
i know

186
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.330
That’s why I can’t bear to tell you even more

187
00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:57.930
Tetsuo

188
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.963
You look so much like your grandpa

189
00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:09.230
You can definitely be like your grandpa
excellent people

190
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.063
It would be great if I could be half as powerful as my grandpa.

191
00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:17.130
Look how humble you are

192
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.930
Just like a little adult

193
00:10:20.463 --> 00:10:21.830
Tetsuo

194
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.796
Let uncle hug you

195
00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:53.363
(one day ago)

196
00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:56.663
Hello

197
00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:57.896
it's me

198
00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.896
If you still don't believe me

199
00:10:59.896 --> 00:11:01.630
You can ask Tetsuo directly

200
00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:05.130
If I ask, will Tetsuo admit it?

201
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.963
How could he admit it without evidence?
He is a murderer

202
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.763
Douxue, please...

203
00:11:10.763 --> 00:11:14.563
You can think that I am out for revenge
Talking nonsense

204
00:11:14.563 --> 00:11:17.663
Do you remember when I was shot and jumped into the sea?

205
00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:19.163
It's what I told you

206
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.396
You have to listen carefully to what I say

207
00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:26.763
I have a copy that I want to give to the Ministry of Security and Enterprise
secret money ledger

208
00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:28.996
If that account book is made public...

209
00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:31.130
That thing…

210
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.796
You can keep it

211
00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:34.330
I remember

212
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.530
But what happened

213
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.330
Didn’t you ask me not to open it and look at it?
Don't show it to anyone either

214
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.096
Because that thing is too dangerous
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

215
00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:42.930
I'm not here

216
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.163
no one can protect you

217
00:11:46.663 --> 00:11:49.763
In that secret fund ledger

218
00:11:49.763 --> 00:11:51.030
Holding a notebook

219
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.930
(now)

220
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.130
Yes

221
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.396
I can speak

222
00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:58.063
I can say "no" to his face

223
00:11:58.063 --> 00:12:01.063
Even if I have to go to the underworld to see them two

224
00:12:01.063 --> 00:12:03.063
I can also say "no" in front of them

225
00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:12.463
If it's really like what you said
There is something so outrageous

226
00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:14.696
How come Brother Dou Xue hasn’t mentioned it once until now?

227
00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:18.096
If it weren't for a madman

228
00:12:18.096 --> 00:12:21.030
who will replace others
Go to jail for so long Dingchen

229
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.030
Isn't it?

230
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.963
Yes, Li Douxue is indeed a madman

231
00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:28.763
Cui Zhexiong

232
00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:31.830
You are my grateful friend

233
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.296
I sympathize with you too

234
00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:37.563
I really hope it's not you

235
00:13:38.363 --> 00:13:40.896
(August 31)

236
00:13:43.896 --> 00:13:45.830
That day…

237
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.763
It's pouring rain

238
00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:50.396
wet all over

239
00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.463
Dad who came back from Tetsuo's house

240
00:13:52.463 --> 00:13:55.063
Dou Xue

241
00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:58.296
Looking down at me sitting under the eaves

242
00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:03.096
with pity eyes

243
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.763
And…

244
00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:09.096
helpless look

245
00:14:11.263 --> 00:14:15.630
The look that wants me to go to jail instead of Tetsuo

246
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.363
I must never forgive his look in his eyes

247
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.796
Dingchen couldn’t believe it

248
00:14:25.796 --> 00:14:27.663
keep staring at me

249
00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:29.596
And…

250
00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:31.330
facing me

251
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.996
kept asking

252
00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:35.330
I…

253
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.296
No answer

254
00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:41.463
On the way to the police station

255
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.630
Tetsuo told me he was sorry

256
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.596
I asked him

257
00:14:46.596 --> 00:14:48.763
What are you sorry for me about?

258
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.930
You are a human being and I am a servant’s child.

259
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.896
No different than a dog or a pig. Why do you have to apologize?

260
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.663
That's it

261
00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.163
I've come this far

262
00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:01.630
servant's son

263
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.563
Having a dream self-righteously

264
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.896
Dreams of becoming a Chinese teacher

265
00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:11.830
After work, Dingchen will wear beautiful braids.
greet me

266
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.330
Then we will have dinner together

267
00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:17.196
It turns out…

268
00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:19.563
I'm too greedy

269
00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:23.463
I am the servant's son Li Douxue

270
00:15:23.463 --> 00:15:24.963
Li Douxue, who is worse than a pig or a dog

271
00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:26.763
"Come over here"

272
00:15:26.763 --> 00:15:32.563
"Back in your love
in my life"

273
00:15:32.563 --> 00:15:39.163
"Let me go in my life"

274
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:46.896
"Let me go in your life"

275
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:52.430
"Love you no more"

276
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.863
"I wanna be myself"

277
00:15:55.863 --> 00:16:01.663
"Let me go in my life"

278
00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:15.030
Sorry Dingchen

279
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.296
sorry

280
00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:21.196
Why are you saying sorry to me?

281
00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:23.996
What do you have to be sorry for?

282
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.130
All...all are sorry

283
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.630
why do you do that

284
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.730
Why do you do that to that poor kid?
do that kind of thing

285
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.496
Why did you do that, Tetsuo?

286
00:16:46.963 --> 00:16:48.830
You've seen it too, right?

287
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.996
He said his dream is to be a Chinese teacher

288
00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:54.096
And live with me

289
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.730
But he said he was too greedy
Said it was a self-righteous dream

290
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.830
A dream that others can realize

291
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.196
What's so great about that

292
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:02.830
What a dream that is

293
00:17:04.363 --> 00:17:05.963
He said he was the servant's son

294
00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:08.530
Not qualified to have those dreams

295
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.396
I'm scared...

296
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:13.930
Life ends like that

297
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.430
The most fearful thing is...

298
00:17:18.396 --> 00:17:21.130
I'll never see you again

299
00:17:23.196 --> 00:17:24.963
Sorry Dingchen

300
00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:27.296
I really want to be in front of you
Be a good man

301
00:17:34.563 --> 00:17:36.096
What about Douxue?

302
00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:39.463
Can Douxue's life end like that?

303
00:17:39.463 --> 00:17:41.496
Is that why you killed Douxue’s father?

304
00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:44.163
No, I really didn't do that, Dingchen

305
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.863
uncle is like my dad to me

306
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.630
How could I do that to someone like that?

307
00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.396
It was really just a traffic accident

308
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.596
I've tried my best to find out

309
00:17:56.596 --> 00:17:58.630
Now I can't believe anything you say

310
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.596
Dingchen, I’m in pain too

311
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.430
Although I have always lived like this

312
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.030
Later…

313
00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:10.396
I will also live with a heart of atonement

314
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.096
You go back

315
00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:19.163
I will kill that guy in Yeosu

316
00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:21.863
it's because of you

317
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.863
that guy

318
00:18:24.863 --> 00:18:27.796
Steal my money, beat me, I can bear it

319
00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:31.396
But when he hit you, I really...

320
00:18:31.396 --> 00:18:33.263
I really want to kill him

321
00:18:35.263 --> 00:18:37.063
Dingchen

322
00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:39.930
everything is my fault

323
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.596
But it's irreversible

324
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.163
I…

325
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.396
I will behave well

326
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.096
I will treat you and my aunt

327
00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:55.330
For Brother Liandou’s sake, I’ll treat you well together.

328
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.730
Cui Zhexiong

329
00:19:02.196 --> 00:19:04.763
I can't see you again

330
00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:08.163
Don't contact me again

331
00:19:26.263 --> 00:19:33.230
"Can I come back to you again?"

332
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.263
"trembling eyes"

333
00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:40.130
"Looks more sad"

334
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:47.396
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

335
00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:50.430
"your name"

336
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.030
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

337
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.363
Tetsuo

338
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.430
when did you come back

339
00:20:12.396 --> 00:20:13.963
You must be very tired
Go wash up and go to bed early...

340
00:20:22.863 --> 00:20:24.196
what happened to your hand

341
00:20:24.196 --> 00:20:25.530
How could it hurt like this?

342
00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:32.296
The skin on the whole hand is broken

343
00:20:35.863 --> 00:20:36.763
You wait

344
00:20:36.763 --> 00:20:38.363
Mom goes to get medicine

345
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.063
Mom

346
00:20:40.963 --> 00:20:42.063
What's wrong

347
00:20:46.796 --> 00:20:48.630
Why do you want to teach me like this?

348
00:20:50.296 --> 00:20:51.530
what does that mean

349
00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:00.096
what happened

350
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.696
if i do something wrong

351
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.230
You should scold me and hit me with a cane

352
00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:12.030
Punish me and make me reflect

353
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.796
Tetsuo

354
00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.130
What's wrong with you

355
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.730
I've killed everyone

356
00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:23.263
how could you do that

357
00:21:25.496 --> 00:21:27.730
Even if I beg you to save me

358
00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:31.063
You should also want me to be a good person

359
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.330
live with integrity

360
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.063
cheer up

361
00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:38.230
to pay for my mistakes

362
00:21:41.463 --> 00:21:43.163
Douxue brother because of me

363
00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:45.496
His whole life is ruined and he's still dead

364
00:21:47.663 --> 00:21:49.230
Uncle is dead too

365
00:21:50.096 --> 00:21:51.863
Mom after that

366
00:21:51.863 --> 00:21:54.096
I never sleep well for a day

367
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.696
If mom...

368
00:21:57.896 --> 00:22:01.330
They didn't protect me at that time and let me go to jail.

369
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.963
Will things be different now?

370
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.196
Tetsuo, don't be like this

371
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.230
You are everything to my mother

372
00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:13.763
If you were asked to go to jail at that time

373
00:22:14.263 --> 00:22:16.030
Mom is probably dead

374
00:22:17.663 --> 00:22:19.563
for you

375
00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:22.263
Mom can do anything

376
00:22:22.863 --> 00:22:25.063
As long as I can save you

377
00:22:25.063 --> 00:22:26.996
I can give you my heart too

378
00:22:26.996 --> 00:22:28.930
You…

379
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.096
is my life

380
00:22:37.096 --> 00:22:38.730
Yes mom

381
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.030
I…

382
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.630
is your life

383
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.996
Yes

384
00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:45.463
So…

385
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.630
Mom…

386
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.730
is living for oneself

387
00:22:52.063 --> 00:22:53.630
not for me

388
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.530
Tetsuo

389
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.496
What happened to you

390
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.463
What happened? Why are you like this?

391
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.630
Dingchen she...

392
00:23:12.063 --> 00:23:14.030
Got it, Mom

393
00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:19.563
She knows I'm a murderer

394
00:23:20.596 --> 00:23:22.096
How could it be

395
00:23:23.396 --> 00:23:24.663
how could she know

396
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.230
I told her mom

397
00:23:32.263 --> 00:23:33.663
Tetsuo

398
00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:36.930
what on earth did you do

399
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.463
Mom, I can't bear it anymore

400
00:23:41.696 --> 00:23:44.630
I really can't bear it anymore

401
00:23:47.363 --> 00:23:50.496
Pretend like nothing happened

402
00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:52.796
Pretend it doesn't matter, I'm tired, Mom

403
00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:58.863
Brother Douxue’s life was ruined by me

404
00:23:58.863 --> 00:24:01.396
What's the difference between me killing him?

405
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.530
And…

406
00:24:11.096 --> 00:24:13.996
Dingchen is also leaving me

407
00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.063
what should i do mom

408
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.996
Don't worry Tetsuo

409
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.063
Mom…

410
00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:35.463
I will go to Dingchen, but she must not say anything to her.

411
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.596
that child

412
00:24:37.596 --> 00:24:39.363
I probably won't report you

413
00:24:39.363 --> 00:24:42.930
No, even if she reports you

414
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.630
Douxue has served his sentence and is already dead.

415
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.230
what could happen to you

416
00:24:55.796 --> 00:24:57.296
It'll be okay

417
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.163
It'll be okay...

418
00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:25.463
How did you hold on?

419
00:25:25.463 --> 00:25:26.930
How did you…

420
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.463
you fool

421
00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:33.463
Because you are here

422
00:25:33.463 --> 00:25:35.030
because of you

423
00:25:43.963 --> 00:25:45.896
He said it was not him who did what happened to his uncle.

424
00:25:47.196 --> 00:25:49.363
Of course he would say that

425
00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:52.296
Because that's him in front of you
The only way to say something that seems a bit human

426
00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:54.596
No, I think he means it.

427
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.330
Do you hope he is sincere?

428
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.063
Douxue

429
00:26:00.063 --> 00:26:02.396
Can we really not let it go?

430
00:26:02.396 --> 00:26:05.363
Anyway, everything is irreversible

431
00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.530
Let's go find aunt

432
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.130
Find Zhenyu

433
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.163
Let's all leave together
Go and live in the United States or Japan

434
00:26:11.896 --> 00:26:14.396
Just live the rest of your life well

435
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.196
i know

436
00:26:19.196 --> 00:26:20.530
Of course I have to leave

437
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.596
Really?

438
00:26:22.596 --> 00:26:25.963
I'm not interested in revenge or pursuing justice.

439
00:26:26.663 --> 00:26:29.296
I desperately want to come back

440
00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:31.030
It’s to meet you again

441
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.596
I thought as long as I could be with you
live happily

442
00:26:36.063 --> 00:26:38.563
It doesn't matter even if you forget everything

443
00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:42.863
but every night

444
00:26:42.863 --> 00:26:45.496
But there will be anger rushing into my heart

445
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.030
burn my body

446
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.063
that feeling

447
00:26:52.063 --> 00:26:54.030
I can't describe

448
00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:59.130
Dingchen

449
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.796
I have to calm down those rages

450
00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:04.930
Otherwise even leave here
Anger will consume me too

451
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.096
I'm afraid sparks will hit you

452
00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:10.263
I'm so scared

453
00:27:10.263 --> 00:27:12.363
I'm scared like crazy

454
00:27:30.563 --> 00:27:31.763
ok

455
00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:34.530
Let's calm your anger together

456
00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:42.263
But you have to promise me

457
00:27:43.363 --> 00:27:45.196
Don't let anger dominate your heart

458
00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:48.663
Dingchen

459
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.096
Let’s do it together, Douxue

460
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.030
I'll accompany you

461
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.896
Did you sleep well?

462
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.863
Thank you for surviving Douxue

463
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.163
It's really too long

464
00:29:37.796 --> 00:29:39.996
Compared to when I broke up with you

465
00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:42.163
when we meet again

466
00:29:42.163 --> 00:29:45.296
my heart hurts more

467
00:29:46.896 --> 00:29:48.463
Because I'm worried that everything is a dream

468
00:29:51.963 --> 00:29:53.230
I'm afraid of waking up from a dream

469
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.563
If it is a dream

470
00:29:56.563 --> 00:29:58.296
Never wake up

471
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.763
Aunt, you are here

472
00:30:28.163 --> 00:30:30.430
Oh my god, why is it so rich?

473
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.496
Today is the first time that my aunt comes to my house.

474
00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:37.063
It's not a housewarming party
Not a birthday party either

475
00:30:38.863 --> 00:30:40.496
Is today a good day?

476
00:30:40.996 --> 00:30:42.096
Right

477
00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:45.230
Be sure to have a housewarming or birthday party
Is this a good day?

478
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.063
days that can be spent peacefully
Isn’t it also a good day?

479
00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:52.496
Oh, you said this
Just like an experienced grandmother

480
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.530
Anyway, it's nice to see you

481
00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.263
me too

482
00:30:59.263 --> 00:31:00.530
Come now, close your eyes and make a wish

483
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.963
Then blow out the candles

484
00:31:01.963 --> 00:31:03.230
OK

485
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.663
Dingchen

486
00:32:04.163 --> 00:32:05.630
I saw a phantom

487
00:32:07.063 --> 00:32:08.830
I actually saw Douxue

488
00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:14.896
It seems that my end is really approaching

489
00:32:19.596 --> 00:32:20.996
Mom

490
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.196
Oh my god

491
00:32:23.596 --> 00:32:26.630
This phantom actually called me

492
00:32:27.263 --> 00:32:28.896
It’s true that he is a scholar

493
00:32:30.096 --> 00:32:32.363
Douxue, he is back alive

494
00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:39.563
Why are you making fun of me like this?

495
00:32:43.963 --> 00:32:45.730
Mom, I am Douxue

496
00:32:46.496 --> 00:32:48.163
I am your son

497
00:32:54.363 --> 00:32:55.863
Mom I'm really sorry

498
00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:41.596
Are you a scholar?

499
00:33:42.763 --> 00:33:44.430
my son…

500
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.996
Are you my son Douxue?

501
00:33:49.896 --> 00:33:51.830
Mom, I'm sorry

502
00:34:05.663 --> 00:34:07.563
Mom, I'm really sorry

503
00:34:10.363 --> 00:34:15.063
It’s really a battle of learning…

504
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.763
my son

505
00:34:26.496 --> 00:34:28.263
Lying with you like this

506
00:34:28.263 --> 00:34:31.763
It reminds me of the memories of sleeping in the same room before

507
00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:37.530
Mom

508
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.863
Do you want to go to any country?

509
00:34:42.063 --> 00:34:43.230
Of course there is

510
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.230
I've never even been on a plane

511
00:34:46.563 --> 00:34:47.530
What's wrong

512
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.096
Do you want to send me abroad to play?

513
00:34:49.096 --> 00:34:52.163
How could I just want to take you abroad to play?

514
00:34:52.163 --> 00:34:54.196
Whether it is the United States or the United Kingdom

515
00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:56.063
Just fly and live abroad

516
00:35:00.696 --> 00:35:03.996
It’s because it’s not convenient for you to stay in Korea

517
00:35:03.996 --> 00:35:05.796
Have you just proposed living abroad?

518
00:35:08.663 --> 00:35:10.196
This is also one of the reasons

519
00:35:14.963 --> 00:35:16.463
Douxue

520
00:35:16.463 --> 00:35:18.830
It doesn't matter where I live

521
00:35:20.163 --> 00:35:21.996
I'm getting older

522
00:35:21.996 --> 00:35:25.196
As long as I can live with my children

523
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.030
That place is my hometown

524
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.763
Mom, I know

525
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.363
But…

526
00:35:40.363 --> 00:35:41.863
I have something to ask you

527
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.496
Stop being so unfilial

528
00:35:49.763 --> 00:35:52.763
You can never let a person with white hair give me a person with black hair.

529
00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:55.896
Don't cheat your death either

530
00:35:58.196 --> 00:35:59.363
Do you know

531
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:03.930
ok mom

532
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.063
thank you my son

533
00:36:10.463 --> 00:36:12.863
Today is really your birthday

534
00:36:14.896 --> 00:36:17.896
It makes you happier than the day I gave birth to you

535
00:36:27.163 --> 00:36:28.363
Please prepare now

536
00:36:28.363 --> 00:36:29.696
ok we got it

537
00:36:34.063 --> 00:36:35.530
Hello madam

538
00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:39.463
Is there anything going on early in the morning?

539
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.396
I made a special trip to bring you important information

540
00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:47.163
If you're not interested, I'll leave first

541
00:36:49.996 --> 00:36:53.296
Are you going to open your mouth to my lion again?

542
00:36:53.796 --> 00:36:55.030
you think too much

543
00:36:55.696 --> 00:36:57.563
Otherwise

544
00:36:57.563 --> 00:36:58.796
What information is it?

545
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.596
Financial condition of Changsheng Group
Worse than imagined

546
00:37:03.063 --> 00:37:07.463
Even the government authorities are worried
They will most likely go out of business

547
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.096
I originally thought it was because of this
They just fell in love with Cui Zhexiong

548
00:37:13.096 --> 00:37:14.430
But that doesn't seem to be the case

549
00:37:14.963 --> 00:37:16.530
We were fooled

550
00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:21.363
They also know very well that Cui Zhexiong likes Wu Dingchen

551
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.730
Then why are they still doing that drama?

552
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.796
Everything is for the Shuixi Development Project

553
00:37:30.363 --> 00:37:32.796
How huge was the profit from that case?

554
00:37:34.763 --> 00:37:38.630
You can earn hundreds of billions of won by talking less.

555
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.730
To be honest, it’s at least 500 billion won

556
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.896
When they talk to their investment partners
Deliberately underreport profits

557
00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:47.063
Plans to keep the remaining profits

558
00:37:47.063 --> 00:37:51.696
And if you want to carry out this investment project
Madam, you will need the minister's help very much.

559
00:37:53.763 --> 00:37:55.363
how do you know

560
00:37:55.363 --> 00:37:59.396
Because our unit
Also responsible for monitoring major companies

561
00:37:59.996 --> 00:38:01.830
If you have anything else you want to confirm

562
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.963
You can ask the minister...
No need

563
00:38:03.963 --> 00:38:05.963
He doesn't know that I'm in partnership with President Qin

564
00:38:12.196 --> 00:38:14.763
This isn't necessarily a bad thing anyway.

565
00:38:15.196 --> 00:38:17.830
Although President Qin’s behavior of cheating on his wife was very bad

566
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.263
But as far as the results are concerned

567
00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:22.730
Madam’s income will also increase

568
00:38:23.596 --> 00:38:24.996
Me too

569
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.596
It's time for me to meet President Qin

570
00:38:30.596 --> 00:38:32.996
No, even if you go to him now

571
00:38:32.996 --> 00:38:36.496
He will also produce estimated financial statements
And refuse to admit it

572
00:38:36.996 --> 00:38:38.963
We have to wait until the case goes smoothly

573
00:38:38.963 --> 00:38:40.896
Then force him to confess

574
00:38:40.896 --> 00:38:42.230
And during this period

575
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.996
we have to prepare first
Evidence that makes it impossible for him to default on his debt

576
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.296
This way you can get your profits

577
00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:53.130
Do you understand?

578
00:39:04.796 --> 00:39:07.496
(Paris Salon)

579
00:39:20.096 --> 00:39:21.296
No bullets yet

580
00:39:22.396 --> 00:39:25.230
Don't be kidding. Kill me quickly.

581
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.630
I don't like to make fun of people's lives either.

582
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.630
There's something I'm really curious about

583
00:39:32.096 --> 00:39:35.130
There's someone else who wants your life besides me.

584
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.063
What are you talking about?

585
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.263
What do you want me to kill?

586
00:39:46.263 --> 00:39:48.296
Who commissioned it?

587
00:39:48.296 --> 00:39:49.496
I don't know this

588
00:39:49.496 --> 00:39:52.663
There's someone in the mailbox
I left the entrustment document and left.

589
00:39:52.663 --> 00:39:54.596
But why do you want me to do this?

590
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.696
Brother, didn’t you mean that after being released from prison?
Do I look for you whenever I have extra money?

591
00:40:02.696 --> 00:40:04.596
Brat, no matter what you say, it's too outrageous.

592
00:40:04.596 --> 00:40:06.763
Am I a butcher who specializes in killing people?

593
00:40:06.763 --> 00:40:08.830
Brother, your sword skills are very neat.

594
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:12.463
Brat, that was the moment of life and death.
I would only do that on the battlefield

595
00:40:12.463 --> 00:40:15.130
How can I treat a guy who has no grievances and no grudges...

596
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.996
I really can't stand you

597
00:40:16.996 --> 00:40:18.563
Don't mention this again

598
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.263
I understand

599
00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:22.930
Then I'll find other people to help

600
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:23.730
Let's go

601
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.896
How much does the other party have to pay?

602
00:40:24.896 --> 00:40:26.330
The deposit is 100 million won

603
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.830
After it's done, I'll give you another 200 million won.

604
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.730
What? So the total is 300 million won?

605
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:30.963
Yes

606
00:40:30.963 --> 00:40:33.296
Who is the target? What's the name?

607
00:40:33.296 --> 00:40:35.930
Wu Wanxu is from the Security and Enterprise Department

608
00:40:40.263 --> 00:40:42.163
It's ridiculous

609
00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:46.296
The person who received the commission is very familiar with us.

610
00:40:46.296 --> 00:40:48.430
Why don't you ask me what to do?

611
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:50.996
Interesting

612
00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:55.496
Do you think I will be deceived by this little trick?

613
00:40:56.296 --> 00:40:57.596
End it quickly

614
00:40:57.596 --> 00:40:59.230
This is no small trick

615
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:01.696
you are my enemy

616
00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:02.896
I also want to kill you quickly

617
00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:04.663
But…

618
00:41:04.663 --> 00:41:06.530
I'm really curious

619
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.796
Can't you guess who it is?

620
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.296
Brat, I don't know

621
00:41:13.063 --> 00:41:15.330
Stop holding on like this
Just use your brain and think about it.

622
00:41:16.196 --> 00:41:17.563
Don't try to sow discord

623
00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:22.530
Since you say I'm sowing discord

624
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.363
It seems that the other party is someone who is very familiar with you.

625
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.696
Wu Wanxu

626
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.863
If someone knew all your dirty deeds

627
00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:36.696
Can you still sleep peacefully?

628
00:41:37.796 --> 00:41:40.730
if you help us

629
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.196
The person you suspect now

630
00:41:42.196 --> 00:41:44.030
I will give all his property to you

631
00:41:45.696 --> 00:41:49.263
I can take revenge on the guy who tried to kill you

632
00:41:49.263 --> 00:41:50.696
And you can become a rich man

633
00:41:50.696 --> 00:41:52.763
This should be in your life
A unique opportunity

634
00:41:53.396 --> 00:41:54.763
Think about it carefully

635
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.963
Jiang Ruzhen

636
00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:08.963
Cui Zhexiong

637
00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:10.696
Is it really you?

638
00:42:15.763 --> 00:42:20.330
(Chungmu City was divided into administrative regions in 1995
After the merger, it was renamed Tongyeong City)

639
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.296
You are Park Doo-sik’s high school classmate.

640
00:42:22.296 --> 00:42:23.663
Yes, senior

641
00:42:23.663 --> 00:42:26.363
Park Doo-sik, that guy is very lucky, right?

642
00:42:26.363 --> 00:42:27.163
(Prosecutor of the Criminal Department of Chungmu City Government
gold holy leaf)

643
00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:30.530
Resigned as prosecutor early
Opened a law firm

644
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.330
Make money and marry a good wife

645
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.863
So enviable

646
00:42:35.863 --> 00:42:37.430
Very envious

647
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.930
Senior, please feel free to talk to me.

648
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.263
OK

649
00:42:44.096 --> 00:42:45.896
What do you want to see me for here?

650
00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.296
Shouldn't you...

651
00:42:47.296 --> 00:42:49.996
You have something to ask me for, right?

652
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.896
Although I am a prosecutor

653
00:42:52.896 --> 00:42:55.296
But the knife in my hand is just like a rag

654
00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:57.330
tattered

655
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.896
In one sentence

656
00:42:58.896 --> 00:42:59.930
It’s just that I don’t have much influence.

657
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.396
It's probably because you are too upright.

658
00:43:05.563 --> 00:43:07.496
come and say hello

659
00:43:07.496 --> 00:43:10.330
This is the reporter you asked me to find

660
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.696
Previously, Chun Doo-hwan made comments about the abolition of unification.

661
00:43:13.696 --> 00:43:15.363
The reporter was laid off

662
00:43:15.363 --> 00:43:17.396
Later he helped the Ministry of Culture

663
00:43:17.396 --> 00:43:19.463
He is a drinking buddy who is very familiar with Standing Gao.

664
00:43:20.496 --> 00:43:23.996
Hello, I am film producer Wu Dingchen

665
00:43:25.696 --> 00:43:27.196
I'm running a small magazine

666
00:43:27.196 --> 00:43:28.330
My name is Shen Zhi

667
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.263
(Current Affairs Press Representative Shin Sik)

668
00:43:29.263 --> 00:43:30.830
(Note: "Shenzhi" in Korean is pronounced the same as "新style")
Although his name is Shen Zhi

669
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.963
But the lifestyle is super outdated and stereotyped

670
00:43:34.963 --> 00:43:37.430
I asked him to go to work at the newspaper office

671
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.096
But he insisted on talking to other fired journalists
Found a magazine

672
00:43:41.096 --> 00:43:43.430
Talk about realizing the true spirit of freedom of speech
and what new age spirit

673
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.263
As a result, I'm almost starving to death now.

674
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.296
So what's the matter with you?

675
00:43:49.296 --> 00:43:53.596
Actually I want to open a resort near here

676
00:43:53.596 --> 00:43:56.230
But when doing business, it is inevitable that people will complain.

677
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.030
Or some troublemakers will cause trouble

678
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.563
Of course

679
00:43:59.563 --> 00:44:01.996
So I will go south first
Come say hello

680
00:44:01.996 --> 00:44:04.096
Are you very polite?

681
00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:06.196
Okay, what are you going to do?

682
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:10.030
First, I will give you 10 million won every month

683
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.130
If you have other expenses
It's all on me

684
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.130
Also, I heard where you live in Seoul
It is a fully rented house of 19 square meters

685
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.163
The lady and children live there
Is the space a little too small?

686
00:44:20.163 --> 00:44:21.930
If you, senior, come back to Seoul

687
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:25.463
I will help you prepare
Gangnam’s 30-pyeong building apartment

688
00:44:25.463 --> 00:44:28.763
This dear man, you have a lot of gold.

689
00:44:28.763 --> 00:44:31.330
It seems that I will have good fortune this year

690
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.296
There is such an amazing financial backer coming to our door

691
00:44:34.996 --> 00:44:38.563
Come, our sponsor junior fellow student

692
00:44:38.563 --> 00:44:39.563
Let's have a drink

693
00:44:39.563 --> 00:44:40.663
Okay, senior

694
00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:47.130
Really good

695
00:44:49.096 --> 00:44:50.596
Senior, let’s have some snacks.

696
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.463
No need

697
00:44:53.463 --> 00:44:55.196
Compared to sashimi

698
00:44:55.196 --> 00:44:56.496
I prefer other snacks

699
00:44:56.496 --> 00:44:57.863
What is it?

700
00:44:57.863 --> 00:44:58.930
Just order the food

701
00:45:02.663 --> 00:45:04.830
I like this flavor very much

702
00:45:05.663 --> 00:45:08.463
This hot feeling

703
00:45:09.763 --> 00:45:11.696
It’s really been a long time since I felt it

704
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:13.930
Big brother

705
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.830
we have to go hungry

706
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:18.596
People will not go hungry

707
00:45:19.096 --> 00:45:21.096
If our bellies were full of fat

708
00:45:21.096 --> 00:45:24.030
People will be hungry

709
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.096
If your brain cannot accept the truth

710
00:45:26.096 --> 00:45:27.830
You will really starve to death. Do you understand?

711
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.696
But why do you
Want me to introduce him to you?

712
00:45:31.696 --> 00:45:33.063
What he does is not a movie magazine

713
00:45:33.963 --> 00:45:37.063
Can you let me buy your magazine?

714
00:45:37.063 --> 00:45:38.263
Let's hire more reporters

715
00:45:38.263 --> 00:45:40.163
Try to increase magazine circulation

716
00:45:40.163 --> 00:45:42.730
The applicant will continue to serve as the representative.

717
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.630
why

718
00:45:45.363 --> 00:45:48.663
Why do you want to acquire
A small magazine like ours

719
00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:50.763
The magazine will gradually grow in the future

720
00:45:51.263 --> 00:45:53.963
Senior, I did something wrong

721
00:45:53.963 --> 00:45:55.430
what did you do wrong

722
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.330
I shouldn't have bribed you

723
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.530
That's right, stinky guy

724
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.463
You've got the wrong person

725
00:46:02.963 --> 00:46:04.263
stand up

726
00:46:08.396 --> 00:46:09.696
sit down

727
00:46:15.963 --> 00:46:20.196
No matter how shabby the knife in my hand is

728
00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:22.330
More than enough to deal with a character like you

729
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:24.363
And this knife is not sharp

730
00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:26.530
If you were stabbed with a dull, rusty knife

731
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.363
How painful will it be for you?

732
00:46:29.363 --> 00:46:31.296
The pain should be several times greater

733
00:46:31.296 --> 00:46:32.196
That's right

734
00:46:32.196 --> 00:46:34.196
So, brat

735
00:46:34.196 --> 00:46:36.730
If you want to do a wealth investigation, you should do it well.

736
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.396
You said I have a fully rented house
But it’s too small to live with family

737
00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:42.096
You really deserve a beating

738
00:46:42.096 --> 00:46:44.863
I even gave that house to my wife

739
00:46:44.863 --> 00:46:46.630
I just divorced my wife last week

740
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.130
Now he's a pauper prosecutor, you know?

741
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.330
I'm arrogant now

742
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.896
Not afraid of anything

743
00:46:53.896 --> 00:46:57.430
Facing my wounded pride

744
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:59.863
You actually poured salt on the wound

745
00:46:59.863 --> 00:47:02.930
Do you think you were wrong?

746
00:47:03.663 --> 00:47:05.496
I was wrong

747
00:47:05.496 --> 00:47:07.530
(Prosecutor of the Criminal Department of Chungmu City Government
Prosecutor Kim Sung-yeop)

748
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.696
Thank you for your hard work

749
00:47:08.696 --> 00:47:10.496
His hands are super strong

750
00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:12.330
My molars are still crumbling

751
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.596
Anyway, it’s been confirmed.

752
00:47:14.596 --> 00:47:15.963
He was originally in the special investigation team, right?

753
00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:18.263
Yes

754
00:47:18.263 --> 00:47:19.830
Do you want to send the documents?

755
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.396
Send a copy first

756
00:47:21.396 --> 00:47:22.796
We have to let him return to Seoul

757
00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:25.963
Got it. I'll ask the deputy chief about this.

758
00:47:25.963 --> 00:47:28.963
Don’t you also need to find a reporter you can trust?

759
00:47:28.963 --> 00:47:30.296
I'm asking about it

760
00:47:31.063 --> 00:47:32.430
Prosecutor has your package

761
00:47:33.963 --> 00:47:35.230
Prosecutor

Prosecutor

763
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:38.930
What's wrong...

764
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.230
Have your package

765
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.896
thank you
No

770
00:47:54.596 --> 00:47:57.330
Come on, please help me confirm this address.

771
00:47:59.596 --> 00:48:00.596
OK

This is the address of Seoul Station

Seoul Station?

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:11.930
Yes

776
00:48:15.063 --> 00:48:16.196
hello

(Prosecutor Kim Seong-yeop)

780
00:48:24.996 --> 00:48:27.430
Are you a homeless person at Seoul Station?

781
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.530
Is this a prank?

782
00:48:29.896 --> 00:48:31.463
this is not a prank

783
00:48:31.463 --> 00:48:33.596
We'll see each other later

784
00:48:33.596 --> 00:48:35.330
I will give you the original copy then

785
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.063
Please take good care of me again

786
00:48:37.063 --> 00:48:38.863
What the hell are you doing...

787
00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:41.363
Hello…

788
00:48:41.363 --> 00:48:42.963
What is this guy like?

789
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.763
What kind of guy are you?

790
00:48:53.663 --> 00:48:57.096
Master, if you have something to say, please tell me...

791
00:48:57.096 --> 00:49:00.596
I asked you to return to Korea to help me

792
00:49:00.596 --> 00:49:02.963
I'm not asking you to start your own business

793
00:49:02.963 --> 00:49:05.296
Why did you suddenly say such things?

794
00:49:05.296 --> 00:49:07.730
I've never fooled you

795
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.563
Mr. Li, what is going on with Changsheng Construction?

796
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:12.630
What's wrong?

797
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:14.163
do you really not know

798
00:49:14.163 --> 00:49:15.830
If you say you don’t know
It will only make me feel more chilled

799
00:49:16.463 --> 00:49:18.763
Didn’t you say that Changsheng Construction would collapse?

800
00:49:18.763 --> 00:49:22.863
But they are now in Shuixi
Build large apartment complexes

801
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:26.830
So prosperous construction
Have you finished building the apartment?

802
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.596
The news is already flying all over the sky

803
00:49:28.596 --> 00:49:30.363
The news should be officially released soon.

804
00:49:30.363 --> 00:49:32.163
The stock price has now risen by 30%

805
00:49:32.163 --> 00:49:33.796
It should rise even more fiercely in the future

806
00:49:33.796 --> 00:49:35.596
How could that company collapse?

807
00:49:35.596 --> 00:49:38.130
I'm waiting to eat prosperous construction

808
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.896
But I gave up several good companies in vain

809
00:49:42.663 --> 00:49:45.530
Are you getting angry just because of this little thing?

810
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.330
what did you say

811
00:49:57.896 --> 00:49:59.596
This is good

812
00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:02.430
The news spread and the stock price rose.

813
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.496
What does this mean? Please speak clearly.

814
00:50:04.996 --> 00:50:08.196
If it attracts national attention
but finally collapsed

815
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.696
It is easier to buy Changsheng than to buy scrap metal

816
00:50:11.696 --> 00:50:13.663
I know this too

817
00:50:13.663 --> 00:50:16.496
But how could Changsheng Construction collapse?

818
00:50:17.263 --> 00:50:19.530
Because I'll bring them down

819
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.763
What method do you have

820
00:50:20.763 --> 00:50:22.830
I'm sorry I can't tell you

821
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:24.130
Aren't we a family?

822
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.996
Throw an ashtray at me before you even see the result.

823
00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:28.230
I've never seen this kind of family before.

824
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.230
Hello Douxue

825
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.663
can you take responsibility

826
00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.730
If this thing goes wrong
I'm going to report you to the prosecutor.

827
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.363
We are indeed not a family

828
00:50:40.896 --> 00:50:43.230
Please wait a moment

829
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.363
I will bring the news of victory

830
00:50:47.296 --> 00:50:48.496
I'm leaving first

831
00:50:49.396 --> 00:50:51.830
What does that kid want?

832
00:50:56.563 --> 00:50:58.930
How about it? Does it taste to your liking?

833
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.096
Yes the meal is delicious

834
00:51:00.763 --> 00:51:01.963
what

835
00:51:01.963 --> 00:51:04.563
Do you want to sell a building in Apgujeong?

836
00:51:04.563 --> 00:51:07.596
That's a 15-story building in a prime location.

837
00:51:08.563 --> 00:51:11.663
Yes. Please help me sell it as soon as possible.

838
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.296
The market value of that building exceeds 15 billion won

839
00:51:15.296 --> 00:51:17.796
in a while
It should rise to more than 20 billion won

840
00:51:17.796 --> 00:51:19.430
Wouldn't it be a pity to sell now?

841
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.463
Of course I feel it's a pity

842
00:51:21.463 --> 00:51:22.996
But what can I do

843
00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:25.763
My only son drove the company almost to bankruptcy

844
00:51:25.763 --> 00:51:27.896
I can't just watch him go to jail.

845
00:51:28.263 --> 00:51:31.730
Since it's an urgent sale, how much do you plan to sell it for?

846
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.863
I want to sell it for 12 billion won

847
00:51:33.863 --> 00:51:35.196
what

848
00:51:35.196 --> 00:51:38.730
Madam, this is really exaggerated.

849
00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:41.330
If there is no way, within a month
Save the company from bankruptcy

850
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.363
My son's life is in danger

851
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.830
Is the steak to your liking?

852
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.663
Yes, very tender and delicious

853
00:51:49.663 --> 00:51:52.063
I'm so upset when I eat steak

854
00:51:52.063 --> 00:51:53.330
I don’t even know that I ate it through my mouth.

855
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.363
Or eat it through the nose?

856
00:51:55.363 --> 00:51:56.363
If it were sold at this price

857
00:51:56.363 --> 00:51:59.196
Everyone will rush to buy it

858
00:51:59.996 --> 00:52:01.930
Sorry, I was too noisy just now

859
00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:03.663
Don't say that

860
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:07.330
By the way, if we have new wine in our store,

861
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.630
A tasting party will be held to entertain VIP guests.

862
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.596
If you give me your business card

863
00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:13.130
I will contact you later

864
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.063
I like red wine very much

865
00:52:15.063 --> 00:52:16.363
please wait a moment

866
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:18.830
This is my business card

867
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.430
(Representative of Apgujeong Accounting Corporation Yang Xingjin)

868
00:52:23.163 --> 00:52:24.796
It turns out you are an accountant

869
00:52:24.796 --> 00:52:26.130
yes

870
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.930
Okay, I'll contact you again

871
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:29.330
Please use it slowly

872
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.763
What a pity

873
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:47.430
This way?

874
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:52.263
Hurry up...

875
00:52:52.263 --> 00:52:54.630
Let's go quickly...

876
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.963
How about as if nothing happened
Let the wind out?

877
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.430
Ouch

878
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.596
I was so nervous that I almost died

879
00:53:03.596 --> 00:53:06.930
Me too
I was so nervous that my eyeballs almost popped out.

880
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.063
You have to work hard to observe your words and emotions
My hands are shaking

881
00:53:09.063 --> 00:53:10.696
I almost accidentally spoke in dialect.

882
00:53:10.696 --> 00:53:12.563
What a near miss

883
00:53:12.563 --> 00:53:13.796
Hey, why don't you start the engine?

884
00:53:13.796 --> 00:53:14.896
Let's go now

885
00:53:14.896 --> 00:53:17.430
This old car won't start. What can I do?

886
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.463
It’s a shame that I still did it before, brother
Zhao Shiheng and the Living Poor Party talk about it

887
00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:22.696
I think there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it, brother.
Become a thief

888
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.763
Brat

889
00:53:24.763 --> 00:53:28.063
We are trying to defraud the wife of the security minister.

890
00:53:28.063 --> 00:53:29.330
Not only the righteous thief Zhao Shiheng

891
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.263
(Note: North Korea’s famous thief)
Even Hong Gildong and Lin Naozheng are afraid, okay?

892
00:53:32.263 --> 00:53:33.563
I got it

893
00:53:33.563 --> 00:53:36.430
Having said that, they have to take the bait.

894
00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:39.763
She pretended not to listen
But my ears stood up

895
00:53:39.763 --> 00:53:42.096
I think 100% she will contact me

896
00:53:42.863 --> 00:53:45.096
Everyone should be careful

897
00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:47.896
if something goes wrong
It's not as simple as being arrested and imprisoned.

898
00:53:47.896 --> 00:53:49.830
We will all be tortured to death

899
00:53:51.963 --> 00:53:52.530
started...

900
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.796
Hurry up...

901
00:53:53.796 --> 00:53:55.630
set off

902
00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:01.596
Come here quickly

903
00:54:10.563 --> 00:54:13.530
Your mom hired a new chef
So you invited us over for lunch

904
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:14.996
Let’s review it by the way

905
00:54:15.796 --> 00:54:16.963
OK

906
00:54:17.496 --> 00:54:20.596
You've been suffering a lot recently because of Wu Dingchen, right?

907
00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:23.830
I told your dad

908
00:54:24.796 --> 00:54:26.430
Don't worry about her anymore

909
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:29.163
Why not go to the US or European branch and stay for a year?
How about taking a break?

910
00:54:30.663 --> 00:54:32.630
No need

911
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.130
I don't want to escape for this reason

912
00:54:36.063 --> 00:54:37.730
Dad, I want to stay here

913
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.196
good

914
00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:42.296
If you can overcome your emotions head on
Of course it's the best

915
00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:53.863
A bread cup of clam chowder for you all

916
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.830
Guest, long time no see

917
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.896
She's today's special chef

918
00:55:00.896 --> 00:55:04.763
She said she wanted to help our family
Cook some dishes you learned in the United States

919
00:55:04.763 --> 00:55:05.896
That's right

920
00:55:05.896 --> 00:55:08.130
Please give me your opinion after enjoying it

921
00:55:12.963 --> 00:55:14.796
Very fragrant and delicious

922
00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.096
what do you think

923
00:55:17.896 --> 00:55:20.930
Want to make this soup
Designated as our store’s signature dish

924
00:55:23.596 --> 00:55:24.863
Let this guest try it too

925
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:26.363
Do you like me that much?

926
00:55:28.863 --> 00:55:30.430
You are really direct

927
00:55:31.663 --> 00:55:33.896
Yes I like you very much

928
00:55:33.896 --> 00:55:36.663
I like it so much that I can spend two hours cooking for you.

929
00:55:36.663 --> 00:55:38.296
thank you

930
00:55:38.296 --> 00:55:39.630
I'm going to start

931
00:55:41.696 --> 00:55:43.363
But…

932
00:55:43.363 --> 00:55:45.430
I'm in a woman
It took ten years

933
00:55:45.963 --> 00:55:49.663
But I was deeply hurt by her not long ago
Very heartbroken now

934
00:55:49.663 --> 00:55:53.130
So I don't want to hurt you either

935
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.663
I will enjoy your cooking today

936
00:55:57.296 --> 00:55:58.463
thank you

937
00:56:14.996 --> 00:56:19.996
What's up? There were many countries in history.
Exchange hostages with neighboring countries

938
00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:23.296
Countries will also
Strategic marriage, isn't it?

939
00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:25.330
Marry the princess to another country

940
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:28.196
Ordinary women will also be sent to other countries

941
00:56:28.996 --> 00:56:33.363
Actually I'm close to you
for the same reason

942
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.496
Our company and my dad

943
00:56:36.496 --> 00:56:39.296
To get close to the minister and his wife

944
00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:40.596
will send me out

945
00:56:42.396 --> 00:56:45.396
As for the fact that I have a crush on you

946
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:49.263
I can’t say there isn’t one.

947
00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:50.830
But it's just a joke

948
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.663
But not long ago my dad told me

949
00:56:53.663 --> 00:56:55.730
He and his wife are already online

950
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:57.563
The two decided to form a partnership

951
00:56:57.563 --> 00:57:00.830
So now I don't have to put on a show anymore

952
00:57:02.696 --> 00:57:06.663
Sorry for playing this show in front of you
Not my intention

953
00:57:08.096 --> 00:57:08.963
It doesn't matter

954
00:57:08.963 --> 00:57:12.230
After all, I am not a spectator who is interested in dramas.

955
00:57:15.963 --> 00:57:19.030
Representative of the film company Wu Dingchen

956
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.863
She is your sweetheart

957
00:57:22.863 --> 00:57:24.363
I knew this from the beginning

958
00:57:25.663 --> 00:57:31.930
Because our company also has
Department responsible for gathering intelligence

959
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.396
Although a little sorry

960
00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:37.630
But we also secretly monitored Representative Wu Dingchen

961
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.263
The person who was responsible for monitoring Representative Wu Dingchen not long ago

962
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.163
told me something strange

963
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.563
He said she seemed to have a beloved man

964
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.296
He said that late one night

965
00:57:55.296 --> 00:57:58.330
A man appeared near Representative Wu’s home

966
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:03.763
Representative Wu and the man

967
00:58:03.763 --> 00:58:06.730
Like lovers who haven’t seen each other for many years

968
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.830
extremely happy to see each other

969
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.863
Hugging each other tightly and crying excitedly

970
00:58:13.896 --> 00:58:16.330
I was hesitant whether I should tell you or not.

971
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:18.863
But your expression just now looked so sad

972
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.096
I'll take my leave first

973
00:58:30.696 --> 00:58:32.163
everything is ready

974
00:58:32.163 --> 00:58:33.130
from this month

975
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:34.830
I will be the publisher of that magazine

976
00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:36.030
Let's meet and talk

977
00:58:36.363 --> 00:58:38.263
Thank you for your hard work

978
00:58:38.263 --> 00:58:40.696
I also happen to have something to tell you.

979
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.263
I'll treat you to dinner today

980
00:58:43.263 --> 00:58:44.663
You want to treat me to some high-end food?

981
00:58:46.396 --> 00:58:47.796
(Special Assistant Choi Cheol-woong)

982
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:55.663
"Can you listen to me?"

983
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:04.396
"You linger in my ears"

984
01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:11.263
"Close your eyes again and take a breath."

985
01:00:11.263 --> 01:00:14.296
"The moment my eyes met yours"

986
01:00:14.296 --> 01:00:18.463
"comes to mind"

987
01:00:18.463 --> 01:00:23.596
"Your figure emerges like the waves"

988
01:00:25.196 --> 01:00:30.130
"The sea breeze fills my heart"

989
01:00:32.163 --> 01:00:35.696
"On the dusty road"

990
01:00:35.696 --> 01:00:39.030
"You are the only breeze"

991
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:44.096
"Can you blow to me?"

992
01:00:44.096 --> 01:00:47.030
(Preview of next episode)

993
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:48.796
Please be my Princess Ping Gang

994
01:00:48.796 --> 01:00:49.930
I will spend my whole life repaying it

995
01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:52.430
I can't help but watch you become unhappy

996
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:53.296
Hello Cui Zhexiong

997
01:00:53.296 --> 01:00:54.796
you can't do this to me

998
01:00:54.796 --> 01:00:55.596
Tetsuo

999
01:00:55.596 --> 01:00:56.996
I can't let Dingchen go

1000
01:00:56.996 --> 01:00:58.696
Tetsuo

1001
01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.196
if things break out

1002
01:01:00.196 --> 01:01:01.896
Tetsuo may never be able to turn over again

1003
01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:03.930
Didn't you say that?

1004
01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:04.963
While in Lishui…

1005
01:01:04.963 --> 01:01:05.663
What's wrong

1006
01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.963
Do you feel sorry that I'm not dead?

1007
01:01:07.963 --> 01:01:08.763
That's right, you loser

1008
01:01:08.763 --> 01:01:10.363
Do you want me to tell you something interesting?

1009
01:01:10.363 --> 01:01:11.930
Choi Cheol-woong’s biological father…

1010
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.663
I know too

1011
01:01:13.663 --> 01:01:16.730
Ruzhen must be in pain because of Team Leader Wu

1012
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:17.530
minister

1013
01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:19.530
I will send someone else to monitor Li Douxue

1014
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.030
No, I need to get to know him personally.

1015
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.063
I want you to let go

1016
01:01:22.063 --> 01:01:24.696
Everyone doesn’t know Li Douxue’s true face

1017
01:01:24.696 --> 01:01:25.896
Are you confident you can beat me?

1018
01:01:25.896 --> 01:01:27.363
I don't plan to lose to you
