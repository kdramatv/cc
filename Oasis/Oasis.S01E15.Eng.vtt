00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:10.333
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.067
Dingchen

3
00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:17.433
scared me

4
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.233
I made a little preparation

5
00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.533
A little care

6
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.300
Why do you bother so much?

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.100
where are people

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
there

9
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.867
I'm curious about something now

10
00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.567
What did you say?

11
00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.633
(Episode 15)
When I was in Lishui

12
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.600
why did you choose me

13
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.233
Tetsuo has a good family background and is good at studying.

14
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.867
Why do you like me like this
poor rural high school student

15
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.800
Really, are you still curious?

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.900
Yes

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.533
so if you were me
I would choose Tetsuo-ra

18
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.000
That's of course

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.367
After all, Li Douxue’s future is gloomy.

20
00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:22.233
This is the difference between us

21
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.133
We look at people differently

22
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.100
What's the difference

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.633
I'm also good at reading people.

24
00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:31.333
Tetsuo's family is indeed very rich

25
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.600
Or a family of independence activists?

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.833
Wealth and fame are both dazzling

27
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:41.567
Tetsuo is just
Just on that dazzling ship

28
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.600
Put it this way
I'm on a boat in the dark

29
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.233
That's not the case

30
00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:52.000
Although your family is very poor

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But your eyes are always like the stars in the morning
sparkling

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.800
The darker the place, the brighter it shines

33
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.200
Most people grow up in this environment
Everybody will lose hope

34
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.467
Do I have that?

35
00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:04.967
Yes

36
00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.633
But there is a more important reason

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.633
(Note: The youngest daughter of the King of Goguryeo Plains)
Because I want to be Princess Ping Gang

38
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.567
Princess Ping Gang?

39
00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.400
(Note: Husband of Princess Pinggang)
So am I a fool, Wenda?

40
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.167
That's right

41
00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:21.700
I'm probably a born filmmaker.

42
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.167
I want to turn a fool into the strongest general

43
00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.267
Show dramatic plot twists

44
00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:27.667
Don't you think it's great?

45
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.200
so what you mean is

46
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.900
in the movie of your life

47
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.467
I am the actor chosen by you

48
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:35.367
That's right

49
00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:38.267
Sounds really sad

50
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.367
Douxue, these are not important

51
00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.267
You grew up in such a difficult environment
But he can still be a kind person

52
00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:48.133
makes me feel grateful

53
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.033
When you feel torment because of Tetsuo

54
00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.667
I also felt sympathy for you

55
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:55.333
The clear eyes you look at me with

56
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.733
Always so sincere and touching

57
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.267
Probably all of this combined

58
00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:01.833
Only then can I fall in love with you

59
00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.433
This is the case until now

60
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.533
Dingchen

61
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.100
What's wrong

62
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.933
Are you touched?

63
00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:16.167
"I know very well that we love each other"

64
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:21.633
"We all know it"

65
00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:29.400
"We will keep each other in our hearts
Love so deeply"

66
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.033
Be my princess Ping Gang

67
00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.767
I will repay what I owe you throughout my life

68
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.467
"The aroma burned by the hot sun"

69
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:41.133
Li Douxue, what are you doing?

70
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:42.733
i'm very disappointed in you

71
00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:45.333
Diamonds are so small

72
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.400
Really?

73
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.700
I thought you liked plain styles

74
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.833
That’s why I found small diamonds

75
00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.667
Got it. I'll buy something as big as this.

76
00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:53.933
Put it on for me

77
00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.733
Put it on for me, silly Wenda

78
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.333
"I want to find you but I can't leave"

79
00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.167
"I want to see you but I can't see you"

80
00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:11.433
"can only remain in eternity"

81
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.233
"I want to find you but I can't leave"

82
00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:20.067
"I want to see you but I can't see you"

83
00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:22.033
"can only remain in eternity"

84
00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:24.000
Douxue thank you

85
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.133
And I don't need any diamonds

86
00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.467
you are my diamond

87
00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.800
If you take my diamond away
He's dead

88
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.700
So we should never be separated for the rest of our lives

89
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.633
Dingchen thank you

90
00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:42.467
i love you too

91
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:50.067
"Even the moments that must be forgotten"

92
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:54.767
"I still love you"

93
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.833
Li Douxue’s whereabouts are unknown
Registered as deceased

94
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.567
No one has entered the country using the name Li Douxue.

95
00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.500
The results of photo surveillance are displayed

96
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500
That man
The name of Lee Hyung-guk, an overseas Chinese in Japan

97
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.467
Departing from Tokyo and arriving at Gimpo Airport

98
00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.333
(Special Assistant Cui Zhexiong)
Monitor all his actions

99
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.233
Report to me one-five-ten. Do you understand?

100
00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:15.167
Why are you still standing there?

101
00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:16.667
OK
get out

102
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.633
Puff puff
Why are you still preparing this?

103
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.467
The cake is so beautiful
welcome

104
00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.533
Congratulations on boarding our ship

105
00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.067
Congratulations

106
00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.867
hope to be safe
Overcome the wind and waves and land smoothly

107
00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:38.867
Definitely will

108
00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:39.667
Of course

109
00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.300
After all, our captain is great

110
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.700
He came from the sea of death
Where are the people who came back alive?

111
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.000
Come, our eldest brother and sister-in-law

112
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.167
Please make a wish to never be separated from each other again

113
00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:55.667
Come on, blow out the candles and eat the cake.

114
00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:56.500
OK

115
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.367
Dingchen, come on

116
00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:58.767
one two

117
00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:07.400
Come and pay homage to our bride-to-be.

118
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.000
Cheers
Cheers

119
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.033
(Restaurant rice soup)

120
00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:18.233
(Restaurant rice soup)

121
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.133
wait for me

122
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.633
Hello, this is the hotel soup rice

123
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.133
Someone is following you

124
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.867
Who sent it?

125
00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:52.300
Cui Zhexiong

126
00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.933
I provided an important piece of information

127
00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:58.267
Li Douxue must also give me equivalent information.

128
00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:01.033
Who wants to kill me?

129
00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:02.733
Ask him to come with evidence

130
00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:10.933
Dingchen seems to have become more beautiful

131
00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:12.367
She was very beautiful...

132
00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:13.867
Someone is following us

133
00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:16.300
what

134
00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.333
It seems your identity has been exposed

135
00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:21.567
That guy Wu Wanxu...

136
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.800
not him

137
00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:24.900
It’s Choi Cheol-woong

138
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.233
what did you say

139
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:28.000
Leave quietly through the back door of the kitchen

140
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.967
This place will be temporarily closed for a while.

141
00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:34.400
Brother, our plan needs to be stepped up.

142
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.600
Got it

143
00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:40.233
Douxue, let’s go see Tetsuo

144
00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:41.500
don't escape

145
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.700
I'll go with you too

146
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.667
He can't do anything to you anyway

147
00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.100
I'll meet him

148
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.367
After all, you have to give him a chance

149
00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:51.533
Although he may have changed

150
00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.967
But I can go alone

151
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.500
I'll go too

152
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.833
It's not convenient for us to talk if you come.

153
00:07:57.833 --> 00:08:00.000
And you know it too

154
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.567
There are some issues that need to be discussed separately between the two of us.

155
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.367
Since Tetsuo has already called General

156
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.400
We must also respond

157
00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:25.667
That guy was the one who was entrusted

158
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.367
As for the client…

159
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.000
he's coming

160
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.800
Li Douxue is back alive

161
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.600
i know

162
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.767
How could you...

163
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.867
Then you know his cash cow?
Where did it come from?

164
00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:03.000
Money tree?

165
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.300
If I tell everything truthfully

166
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.167
Please put that guy Li Douxue in jail

167
00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.267
and guarantee that I can continue to maintain
businessman status

168
00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:10.900
You guy...

169
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.367
You say it

170
00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:17.567
Li Douxue is with me
Operating an illegal underground casino

171
00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:19.467
What to run

172
00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:20.733
Illegal underground casino?

173
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:22.133
Yes

174
00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:23.333
He and I jointly hold shares

175
00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:27.500
There are currently about 15 casinos across the country

176
00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:33.300
Where and what did Li Douxue do in the future?

177
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.233
Let me be your prosecutor's spy

178
00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:38.067
You can contact me anytime

179
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.500
Can you believe it now?

180
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.767
Even if I don't kill you, you will still die.

181
00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:59.633
If that kid drags his feet

182
00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.233
Cui Zhexiong may entrust others to do it

183
00:10:02.233 --> 00:10:05.433
If you are afraid
Just hide away from the limelight

184
00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:11.367
But then I will lose everything

185
00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:17.100
money you earned in the past
It should allow you to have enough food and clothing for the rest of your life, right?

186
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.300
Compared to the money I earned helping that family
That little money is nothing at all

187
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.733
Besides, even my money

188
00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:23.833
They all have ways to take it all for themselves

189
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.667
I have to take the initiative first and then retreat unscathed.

Reveal Huang Zhongcheng’s secret funds

191
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.433
That's impossible

192
00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:37.833
Change the target to Jiang Ruzhen’s money...

193
00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:40.933
There's a chance

(Liang Xingjin)

196
00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:04.333
You…

197
00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:05.833
May I ask who you are?

198
00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.933
Hello, thank you for your hard work

199
00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:13.533
Please drink this drink

200
00:11:13.533 --> 00:11:15.133
Thank you for your hard work

202
00:11:46.533 --> 00:11:47.733
you are so beautiful

204

Alas

205
00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:51.800
how are you doing

206
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.367
Of course I've always had a good time

207
00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:55.667
if you don't mind

208
00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:59.567
Can I trouble you to sign your name for me?

209
00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:02.400
Let's get the business done first.

210
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.700
ok of course

211
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.733
Please sit down

212
00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:10.233
This is the building owner of Apgujeong

213
00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:13.867
This guy needs no introduction.
You know it very well, right?

214
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.033
hello

215
00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:17.400
nice to meet you

216
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.300
The building manager has already taken me to visit

217
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.600
No water leakage problem

218
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.867
In very good condition

219
00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:27.033
Of course
That's a new building that was built just a few years ago.

220
00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:28.533
Of course the condition is good

221
00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:31.100
Because of personal reasons, our wife

222
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.800
Will be sold at an unprecedented price

223
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.833
How about it? Have you decided?

224
00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:38.933
Please help me negotiate the price

225
00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:39.900
what

226
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.167
This building is too big

227
00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:43.400
It's not easy for me to raise funds

228
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.233
Help me cut... 500 million won

229
00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.767
This makes me a little embarrassed

230
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.567
I've sold it very cheaply

231
00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:50.633
I insist on a signing bonus of 10 billion won

232
00:12:50.633 --> 00:12:51.933
The final payment is 2 billion won

233
00:12:51.933 --> 00:12:53.400
Otherwise I won’t sell it

234
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.300
Our wife really did it because of personal reasons

235
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.500
Why would they sell it urgently at such an unprecedented price?

236
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.967
Otherwise…

237
00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:02.433
Help me cut 300 million won

238
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.033
This gives me a headache

239
00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:09.333
Madam, what do you think?

240
00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:11.467
Don’t you also know about my son?

241
00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:16.100
Otherwise, both of you should think about it for another day.

242
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.567
If there are other buyers who want to buy during the period

243
00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:20.867
There's nothing we can do about it

244
00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.200
Just do it

245
00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:26.567
Sorry
I just asked for your signature...

246
00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:30.633
Just wait until the contract is signed and I will sign it for you together.

247
00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:31.733
OK

248
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.033
How embarrassing

249
00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:40.200
Let's wait a little longer

250
00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:43.300

251
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.133
Do you want to have a cup of tea with me

252
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.367
Okay, thank you for your hard work

253
00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.000
Let's finish well

254
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.033
Thanks

255
00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:08.000
We haven't seen each other for so long

256
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.200
You came to me for this kind of thing

257
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.867
sorry

258
00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:14.800
If you feel sorry, don't ask me

259
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.600
You asked me to break up with you because you were in jail.

260
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.167
Now, please ask me to act this kind of fraud

261
00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:23.467
This matter will not involve you

262
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.167
I also want to ask you something

263
00:14:29.167 --> 00:14:32.600
With you at the speed of a super express train
Married and divorced

264
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.100
Although it was because of this that I was able to quickly return to the film industry

265
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.633
But I forgot your speed

266
00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:38.133
as slow as a tram

267
00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:43.100
Come back to me again

268
00:14:45.133 --> 00:14:46.433
Are you planning to retire again?

269
00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:49.200
I might go to jail again

270
00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:55.100
You still show loyalty
It’s more important than love

271
00:14:58.033 --> 00:15:00.767
No, my fate is terrible

272
00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:02.267
You will only become unhappy if you are with me

273
00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:06.567
sorry thank you

274
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.433
I won't contact you again

275
00:15:12.733 --> 00:15:14.200
You have to live a good life

276
00:15:17.967 --> 00:15:19.733
good

277
00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:22.300

279
00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:38.367
"But please remember"

280
00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:44.167
"I didn't understand until after we broke up"

281

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900
she is inside

285
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.567
Are you sure?

286
00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:03.967
Yes we are sure

287
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.267
Douxue, Zhenyu will be frightened

288
00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.133
I'll go find her first

289

293
00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:32.167
Your brother is here too

294
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.267
Brother Douxue?

295
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.233
You are still the same now
Will you run away from home when I'm not around?

Mom, I'm sorry

302
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.967
It’s okay…

303
00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:15.400
my baby thank you

304
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.100
thank you

305
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200
Very good. Just come back.

306
00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:28.433
Don't come here again

307
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:31.100
And don't send any more pocket money.

308

Brother Dongxiu

309
00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:35.433
I will be pardoned and released soon

310
00:17:35.433 --> 00:17:36.800
Really?

311
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.733
Great. I will tell my comrades

312
00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:41.200
Don't

313
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.833
Don't tell them

314
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.133
what

315
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.267
After going out...

316
00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:54.167
I might not be able to see you again

317
00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.833
what does this mean

318
00:17:58.667 --> 00:18:01.067
You can scold me if you want

319
00:18:01.067 --> 00:18:05.467
I will take a different path from you in the future

320
00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:07.967
Thank you very much these days

321
00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:10.500
Why did you suddenly say that?

322
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.467
Brother Dongxiu…

323
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.967
Is it possible to make that much money?

324
00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:27.600
Too outrageous

325
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.733
(Seoul City Government Estimated Income Report

326
00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:34.367
This is when Shuixi Residential Area opens for special subscription
Estimated revenue from the Ministry of Construction and the Seoul Metropolitan Government

327
00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:40.067
President, the amount you told your wife
There is a big difference between this and this.

328
00:18:40.067 --> 00:18:43.433
That's because civil servants don't know very well

329
00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:46.467
Costs not listed on the estimate
There are so many

330
00:18:47.633 --> 00:18:49.700
Team leader, you know it very well, right?

331
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.300
Anyway, Madam, she is very disappointed now

332
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.667
So Madam, do you want to get more money?

333
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.400
This is absolutely impossible

334
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.700
Then take away the madam's money.

335
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.500
what

336
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.800
How can we now talk about withdrawing funds...

337
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.767
If the minister finds out about this matter

338
00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:13.833
Madam will be in trouble

339
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.567
These are the capitation accounts for our organization

340
00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:27.100
Just divide the money into ten equal parts and remit it.

341
00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.133
We decided to increase your profit share

342
00:19:30.133 --> 00:19:31.967
But there is no way to increase it too much

343
00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:33.900
You also know about this case

344
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.233
There are many expenses that are not recorded on the financial statements

345
00:19:37.233 --> 00:19:39.267
Yes

346
00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:42.100
This also includes when the investment case fails.

347
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.400
You have to make some profits, right?

348
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.100
Will you propose a partnership investment to me?
The biggest purpose is also for this

349
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.567
I will give you another 5% profit share

350
00:19:57.567 --> 00:19:58.967
no more

351
00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:01.200
Just pretend it didn't happen

352
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.033
madam

353
00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:08.367
You didn't tell me honestly at first
I'm very disappointed

354
00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:11.767
Mutual trust is the basic condition for doing business, right?

355
00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:13.400
I understand

356
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.300
If you want more

357
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.167
Please give me some time to think about it

358
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.733
But madam

359
00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.533
Please don't give me this kind of thing again

360
00:20:28.767 --> 00:20:29.700
what is this

361
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.367
You are not asking us to remit money in installments
into these head accounts?

362
00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:39.533
What are you doing?

363
00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:41.100
Can’t you even grasp the whereabouts of Li Douxue?

364
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.233
Sorry, he seems to know we're following him
Just sneaked away

365
00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:49.100
Don't quibble

366
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.200
Go out and find someone quickly

367
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.667
OK

368
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.200
Looks like something isn't going well

369
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.800
If you need my help please just ask

370
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.567
I'm always at your service

371
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.900
do you want to help me

372
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.300
Maybe he wants to threaten me?

373
00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:16.467
You are a person who wants to do great things

374
00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:18.667
Why are you so vindictive?

375
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:22.733
Really? I also want to do big things

376
00:21:22.733 --> 00:21:25.767
But there are strong shackles on my feet

377
00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:29.367
Don't think of me as a shackle

378
00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:32.033
We are like the crocodile and the toothpick bird
symbiotic relationship

379
00:21:32.033 --> 00:21:34.900
If you think about it this way, you'll feel better.

380
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.133
Are you definitely symbiotic?

381
00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:39.100
Isn't it parasitic?

382
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.267
Either symbiotic or parasitic

383
00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:43.533
Anyway, we have to live together.

384
00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:47.367
If it is a parasite
Annihilation is good for the body, right?

385
00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:53.067
if lion and tiger
Fighting in an empty field

386
00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:54.633
Do you know who will win?

387
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.800
The answer is...no winner

388
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.633
Lions and tigers know each other well

389
00:22:04.633 --> 00:22:07.233
Even if you kill the opponent, you will win

390
00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:11.567
He will also die from serious injuries

391
00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:16.033
So lions and tigers avoid each other

392
00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.233
They will never fight

393
00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:20.100
so

394
00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:25.067
What Team Leader Wu means is
are you a lion or a tiger

395
00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:27.600
Even if I want to die, I won’t die by myself

396
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.700
Is that so?

397
00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:33.400
I think you're just a leech

398
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.933
It will only cause trouble to others and suck their blood.

399
00:22:35.933 --> 00:22:38.767
There are hundreds of harms and no benefits

400
00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:48.667
But are you really not going to join hands with me?

401
00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.900
Whatever you want to do with my help

402
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.833
the person you want
There’s still someone I want to win with

403
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:57.267
I can help you achieve it all

404
00:22:57.267 --> 00:22:59.800
Didn't you hear what I just said?

405
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.133
Get out of my way right now

406
00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:05.733
In this case…

407
00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:09.900
I'd rather be respectful than obey your orders.

408
00:23:23.633 --> 00:23:26.100
Aunt, what can you do?

409
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:33.500
I...I want to discuss something with you

410
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.600
What's going on?

411
00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:42.000
Douxue and Zhenyu are both back

412
00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:46.833
There's only one thing left for me to do now

413
00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:50.200
But that thing...

414
00:23:52.367 --> 00:23:55.100
If others knew
they might be scared

415
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:58.867
I really don't know what to do

416
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.200
Aunt, what's going on?

417
00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:12.533
Having said that
What is Douxue doing now?

418
00:24:13.433 --> 00:24:15.967
Actually, I also have something to tell you.

419
00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:25.267
My name is Choi Cheol-woong

420
00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:27.567
it's me

421
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.500
Brother

422
00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:32.300
you are still alive

423
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.333
What a fuss

424
00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:38.367
Didn’t you already know that?

425
00:24:43.067 --> 00:24:44.567
Yes

426
00:24:45.633 --> 00:24:47.800
But when you come back
Why are you contacting me now?

427
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.967
Is what you said true?

428
00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:58.933
Aunt, I'm really sorry

429
00:24:58.933 --> 00:25:01.700
I should have told you earlier

430
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.300
Douxue did not commit murder but was blamed for it

431
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.800
It's really pitiful

432
00:25:08.467 --> 00:25:09.833
Oh my god

433
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.233
What should I do?

434
00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:17.100
Oh my God, what should we do when we fight?

435
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.533
OMG…

436
00:25:19.533 --> 00:25:22.600
What should we do when we fight?

437
00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:28.300
So...that's when Douxue's dad would...

438
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.100
Things are unpredictable

439
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.133
And this isn't some theft or robbery.

440
00:25:33.133 --> 00:25:35.367
Tetsuo should know it by now, right?

441
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:40.267
This incident will make Douxue and Tetsuo
The relationship between the two becomes more complicated

442
00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:46.533
That uncle really has a wooden head
You didn't even tell me

443
00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:48.200
This can't go on like this

444
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.267
It's really time for me to show up now

445
00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:54.200
OMG…

446
00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:01.133
"Can I come back to you again?"

447
00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:04.200
"trembling eyes"

448
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.133
"Looks more sad"

449
00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:15.333
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

450
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:18.333
"your name"

451
00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:23.533
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

452
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.600
What's that look in your eyes?

453
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.200
You're happy to see me

454
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.200
Are you still disappointed to see me?

455
00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:40.267
Nothing, I just find it unbelievable

456
00:26:42.633 --> 00:26:43.933
Take a seat

457
00:26:47.567 --> 00:26:51.133
I thought you would at least pretend
Very happy to see me

458
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.500
i'm happy to meet you

459
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.400
Dingchen originally wanted to come together

460
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.800
I was the one who stopped her

461
00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:09.933
This is an issue between the two of us.

462
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.767
if you are still alive
You should at least contact me.

463
00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:19.233
Do you know how much I blame myself and suffer?

464
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.333
Those who kill people are in so much pain

465
00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:27.567
The guy who fell into the cold sea after being shot...

466
00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:30.100
How much pain and suffering must it be?

467
00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:32.867
Was it me who fired the gun?

468
00:27:33.933 --> 00:27:36.667
I sincerely hope you can escape overseas smoothly

469
00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:39.900
Be a fugitive?

470
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.600
If you live, you must wander around

471
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.067
What's the difference between death and death?

472
00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:47.500
so

473
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.933
Are you here for revenge? Do you want me to apologize?

474
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.133
Tetsuo, the so-called apology

475
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.000
You don't do it when the person who got beaten wants you to apologize.

476
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.533
The person who did it should have apologized.

477
00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:06.767
Brother, do you know my current position?

478
00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:11.333
If I have to deal with a small character like you

479
00:28:11.333 --> 00:28:12.533
It's so easy

480
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.633
of course i know

481
00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:19.533
I'm just a little hooligan

482
00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:21.267
It's hard to deal with prosecutors

483
00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:24.300
You are a senior official in Nanshan
How dare I mess with you

484
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.200
I'm not that stupid

485
00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:30.533
So what exactly do you want?

486
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.900
I want to use my original identity before I die

487
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.733
Live life quietly

488
00:28:41.733 --> 00:28:42.933
That's enough

489
00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:45.000
Is that it?

490
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.600
wait until the time is right

491
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.533
I will take my family to live abroad

492
00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:55.000
What about Dingchen?

493
00:28:56.433 --> 00:28:58.133
Of course she wants to go with me

494
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.200
She is my fiancée

495
00:29:09.067 --> 00:29:10.433
What if I don't agree?

496
00:29:12.633 --> 00:29:13.933
Tetsuo

497
00:29:15.033 --> 00:29:18.533
I know how much you like Dingchen

498
00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:23.233
But she is not an object

499
00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:26.533
It's not something you can get if you want it

500
00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:32.433
Regardless of the ends of the earth
Dingchen will go with me

501
00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:36.867
So just let us go

502
00:29:37.533 --> 00:29:38.833
I beg you

503
00:29:51.067 --> 00:29:52.300
i will let go

504
00:29:53.767 --> 00:29:54.733
Only you can leave

505
00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:55.500
Tetsuo

506
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.367
I can't let Dingchen go

507
00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:01.500
Anyway, it’s impossible for Dingchen to be with you.

508
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.333
She also knows that I went to jail on your behalf

509
00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:08.833
I'm not trying to hold on to her

510
00:30:08.833 --> 00:30:11.100
in a lifetime
All have to live a life of escape

511
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.767
There's a guy who could go to jail at any time.

512
00:30:14.767 --> 00:30:16.700
I can't let her do that

513
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.467
It doesn't matter even if the person beside her isn't me

514
00:30:20.467 --> 00:30:23.033
But I can't just watch her become unhappy

515
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.800
You really... haven't changed at all

516
00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:33.400
You are the one

517
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.633
you only think of yourself

518
00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.433
This really hasn't changed at all

519
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.367
If you are willing to let us go

520
00:30:55.133 --> 00:30:58.667
I originally planned to sincerely forgive you.

521
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:01.500
The life I lost because of you

522
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.433
And…

523
00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:04.133
My father's death was in vain

524
00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:09.600
I just want to forget everything

525
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.900
Live life quietly

526
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.400
Is this such a difficult request?

527
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.867
Just such a dream

528
00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:28.733
people like me

529
00:31:28.733 --> 00:31:32.000
Are you not qualified to have it, you brat?

530
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.667
No…

531
00:31:40.167 --> 00:31:44.833
You can live the happy life of your dreams

532
00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:49.400
I do owe you something

533
00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:52.067
So…

534
00:31:52.067 --> 00:31:54.167
I just said I would let you go

535
00:31:57.233 --> 00:32:00.900
You will return to Japan within a week

536
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.800
Living as an overseas Chinese named Lee Hyung-guk

537
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.467
That way you'll be fine

538
00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:11.700
Do you know

539
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.167
Tetsuo

540
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.200
Really not possible?

541
00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:31.667
Does it have to go to this point?

542
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.433
Douxue

543
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.533
How is it

544
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.767
Didn't he apologize to you?

545
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.567
Does that kid have any conscience?

546
00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:26.033
How could I ruin your life like that?
I still haven’t apologized to you…

547
00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:29.367
I thought about it on the way back

548
00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:32.433
Tetsuo may not be wrong

549
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.733
what

550
00:33:33.733 --> 00:33:38.733
People change depending on where they are
But people don't change

551
00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:43.167
Choi Cheol-woong in high school and Choi Cheol-woong now

552
00:33:43.167 --> 00:33:45.300
Hasn't it changed at all? It's always the same?

553
00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:49.267
In the eyes of Cui Cheol-woong

554
00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:54.067
I have always been the son of their working parents.

555
00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:57.333
No wonder some people say

556
00:33:57.333 --> 00:34:02.967
People only change before they die

557
00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:04.300
Because it is impossible for people to change

558
00:34:05.533 --> 00:34:07.733
That bad guy…

559
00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:09.033
He wants me to keep you within a week

560
00:34:09.033 --> 00:34:11.133
leave korea

561
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:13.233
That way nothing will happen to me

562
00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:14.533
you don't have to worry

563
00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:17.900
As long as I'm here, that guy can't hurt you.

564
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.067
I will help you block all attacks

565
00:34:21.067 --> 00:34:23.133
Our opponent is not just Choi Cheol-woong

566
00:34:23.133 --> 00:34:25.533
And Huang Zhongcheng and Jiang Ruzhen

567
00:34:25.533 --> 00:34:26.767
This is going to be a tough battle

568
00:34:26.767 --> 00:34:28.533
Douxue, why are you like this?

569
00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.300
I am the publisher of a current affairs magazine

570
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.833
Media people who monitor power

571
00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:33.100
Dingchen

572
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.933
Although Tetsuo is bad

573
00:34:34.933 --> 00:34:39.367
But he has always been sincere to you
Don’t you know that too?

574
00:34:39.367 --> 00:34:41.933
If the matter is revealed

575
00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:45.033
he might lose everything
Doesn't that matter?

576
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:48.100
Break the news

577
00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:52.833
Let’s break the news

578
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:55.667
Choi Cheol-woong is really bad

579
00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:58.600
I feel uncomfortable treating him like that.
But…

580
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.433
you endured so much pain

581
00:35:00.433 --> 00:35:03.067
I have to continue living in pain
That's hell for me

582
00:35:04.033 --> 00:35:05.800
So…

583
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.400
Strike first before he hurts you.

584
00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.900
(Tiandi Entertainment New Era Food)

585
00:35:24.267 --> 00:35:27.100
I have never heard of these companies

586
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.233
Are these accounts associated with your company?

587
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:34.533
That's right

588
00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:36.300
But how did you get this

589
00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:40.300
I'm using another account
why did he give them these accounts

590
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.100
This is usually done

591
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.867
If you have a large sum of money that you don’t want to be traced

592
00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.567
This is how you launder money

593
00:35:46.567 --> 00:35:49.633
The more you share, the less suspicious you will be.

594
00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:51.167
But…

595
00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:53.167
Mom, where did you invest a lot of money?

596
00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:55.800
Did dad tell you about these accounts?

597
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.400
No, your dad doesn't know

598
00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:02.533
I have a problem with President Qin

599
00:36:02.533 --> 00:36:04.600
Team leader Oh went to see Chairman Geum Man-chul

600
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.433
I want him to invest my money
Remit the refund to these accounts in batches

601
00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:12.933
Originally…

602
00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:16.500
If you want to launder money, you should report it to your superiors first.

603
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.133
But I haven't heard about it, Mom.

604
00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:19.800
And these accounts

605
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.300
Not for private use

606
00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:25.833
What does Team Leader Wu want to do?

607
00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:27.500
Forget it

608
00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:30.867
He probably just wants to get his money back safely

609
00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:32.933
And you and your father don’t know about this.

610
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:35.600
You go in and have a rest.

611
00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.567

I'll tell you later

00:37:21.867 --> 00:37:24.167
Hello

620
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.767
You come from the seaside

621
00:37:26.767 --> 00:37:28.233
The air quality here is pretty bad, right?

622
00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:29.833
You are here

623
00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:32.533
I'm afraid that heroes will be useless
I just came here looking for you

624
00:37:32.533 --> 00:37:34.300
You've won the prize

625
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.333
People like you are obsessed with eating three bowls of rice

626
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:38.133
See you later

627
00:37:38.133 --> 00:37:39.167

Please walk slowly

630
00:37:41.367 --> 00:37:43.033
Want to treat me to something delicious?

634
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.767
Was it because of you that I was transferred here?

635
00:37:54.767 --> 00:37:58.100
How can a homeless man like me have that kind of ability?

636
00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.267
In short

637
00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:01.800
Please sharpen the knife first

638
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.733
when can i see you

639
00:38:03.733 --> 00:38:05.967
Do you want me to go to Seoul Station to find you?

640

641
00:38:09.067 --> 00:38:11.233
i will find you

you are so lucky

655
00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:46.967
come to congratulate you

656
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.467
Then…

657
00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:55.500
Right

658
00:38:58.033 --> 00:39:01.200
The balance of 2 billion will be given to you in one month

He brought people here just like you said

673
00:39:58.033 --> 00:39:59.000
As expected of Prosecutor Choi

674
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.400
Really don't keep the promise

675
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.733
He wants to cut off my source of money

676
00:40:04.733 --> 00:40:07.467
But how can I make him happy?

677
00:40:07.467 --> 00:40:08.700
You have to abide by the agreement

678
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.433
Give me all your shares

00:40:11.233 --> 00:40:12.333
I will

Master, why are you doing this to me?

681
00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:22.233
Didn't I give you all the information?

682
00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:26.200
Hey, how can I believe what a gangster says?

683
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.733

How is it

687
00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:55.567
The song is very nice

688
00:40:55.567 --> 00:40:57.133
Really?

689
00:40:58.133 --> 00:41:00.633
It's not in vain that you went to live in the countryside

690
00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:01.967
Very worth it

691
00:41:01.967 --> 00:41:05.333
Will your new movie use my songs?

692
00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:07.567
ok

693
00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:09.533

695
00:41:12.433 --> 00:41:13.667

696
00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:15.700
Really?

698
00:41:20.533 --> 00:41:21.667
what are you doing

699
00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:24.233
I said we don't have to meet again, right?

700
00:41:25.033 --> 00:41:27.467
I came to see you today for official business

701
00:41:28.633 --> 00:41:30.767
I'll go home first

702
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.767

I'll give him some time

706

Please help me persuade him
Tell him to stop being stubborn and leave the country quickly.

707
00:41:46.367 --> 00:41:48.467

708
00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:51.867
Apologize…

710
00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:55.333
you really are...

711
00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:58.733
Didn’t you also lie to me?

712

Knowing that Brother Douxue is still alive

713
00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:02.367

you can't do that to me

you can't do that to me

717
00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:10.267
why not

718
00:42:10.267 --> 00:42:13.633
Douxue takes the blame for you
How many years have you kept it from me?

719
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:16.467
why don't you apologize to me
Don't apologize to Douxue either

720
00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:19.133
Why don't you let him go?

721
00:42:19.133 --> 00:42:21.667
His friend sacrificed himself for you

722
00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:24.067
You can't do that to him, right?

723
00:42:24.067 --> 00:42:27.633
I'm worried that you will become unlucky

724
00:42:27.633 --> 00:42:31.067
I don't want to see you become unhappy

00:42:31.067 --> 00:42:34.800
Do you want to run away with Brother Dou for the rest of your life?

726
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.867
Even if I have to run away for the rest of my life, it doesn't matter

727
00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:41.767
I will protect Douxue

00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:37.600
What's wrong?

737
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.800
Why didn't you say anything, President?

738
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.933
Li Douxue works under you

739
00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:45.667
Li Douxue

740
00:43:46.267 --> 00:43:47.200
Who is Li Douxue?

741
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.633
Lee Hyung-guk…

742
00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:50.533
Lee Hyung-guk

743
00:43:50.533 --> 00:43:52.767
Yes, he works for me.

744
00:43:52.767 --> 00:43:57.733
But I need to introduce my subordinates
Do you know me?

745
00:43:57.733 --> 00:43:59.633
Li Douxue No...

746
00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:01.733
Li Hengguo

747
00:44:01.733 --> 00:44:04.967
He is a prisoner who committed a crime in Korea and fled abroad.

748
00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:06.767
Please let him return to Japan immediately

749
00:44:06.767 --> 00:44:09.167
Otherwise…

750
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:10.833
You want to do business in Korea

751
00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:13.000
You will encounter a lot of problems, President

752
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.033
I don’t know what crime Li Douxue committed

753
00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:17.600
I don't know that person

754
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.933
The person I know is named Li Hengguo

755
00:44:21.933 --> 00:44:24.500
He has not committed any crime

756
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.500
Is one of my men
young man who works hard

757
00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:32.400
I can't do it just because of a word from the prosecutor

758
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.033
Let the people I need go back to Japan

759
00:44:34.033 --> 00:44:37.833
Chairman, words to protect the prisoner

760
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.800
You will also be punished

761
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.400
are you threatening us

762
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.233
not a threat

763
00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:44.967
I'm worried about the president

764
00:44:44.967 --> 00:44:46.700
Haicheng

765
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.900
Please come back

766
00:44:58.167 --> 00:45:00.167
Why didn't the conversation go smoothly?

767
00:45:11.067 --> 00:45:12.333
Yes

768
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:15.500
people don't know yet
What kind of person is Li Douxue?

769
00:45:17.033 --> 00:45:20.067
Brother, I gave you a chance

770
00:45:20.067 --> 00:45:22.400
I also gave you a chance

771
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.467
But…

772
00:45:24.467 --> 00:45:26.367
Do you think you can beat me?

773
00:45:26.367 --> 00:45:28.633
Brother, do you think you can beat me?

774
00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:30.667
Who said I want to compete with you?

775
00:45:30.667 --> 00:45:33.867
I really don't care. It's up to you.

776
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.033
You are so smart, how could you not understand?

777
00:45:40.033 --> 00:45:43.267
Once in high school
I stole your first place

778
00:45:43.267 --> 00:45:44.533
you asked me then

779
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.467
congratulations

780
00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:49.000
No, I guessed a few questions

781
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.700
I'm lucky

782
00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:55.667
You worked so hard for Dingchen
Are you preparing for the exam?

783
00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:58.133
That's right, it's for Dingchen

784
00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:00.200
But…

785
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.267
Do you know what is harder?

786
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.500
It was a thrilling success in staying in second place.

787
00:46:07.567 --> 00:46:10.567
The really hard thing is losing to you on purpose

788
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.733
Later…

789
00:46:13.733 --> 00:46:15.100
I won't let you again

790
00:46:20.567 --> 00:46:22.067
good

791
00:46:23.233 --> 00:46:24.733
Then let’s compare

792
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.100
You are here

793
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.467
how are you

794
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.033
How are you doing?

795
00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:43.767
Yeah, of course

796
00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:47.267
But why did you come to me suddenly?

797
00:46:57.733 --> 00:46:59.200
Actually…

798
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.300
I'm a little busy now

799
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.433
If it's nothing urgent

800
00:47:04.433 --> 00:47:06.433
I'll come back to you later

801
00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:11.833
I heard you did that

802
00:47:14.167 --> 00:47:15.500
what

803
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.133
I heard that in Lishui that year

804
00:47:18.133 --> 00:47:19.867
You did that

805
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.067
Right…

806
00:47:31.033 --> 00:47:32.633
Your days

807
00:47:32.633 --> 00:47:35.667
It must be very painful.

808
00:47:41.967 --> 00:47:44.467
What's wrong

809
00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.233
Did Brother Douxue say that?

810
00:47:47.267 --> 00:47:49.967
You asked him to go to the media to break the news.

811
00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:51.567
He said he killed someone at that time

812
00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:53.500
It's not Lee Doo Hak, it's Choi Cheol Woong

813
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.867
You asked him to go to the media to break the news.

814
00:47:55.867 --> 00:48:00.067
What's wrong with you, Tetsuo?

815
00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:04.367
Yeah, I'm a little weird today

816
00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:05.900
Then I'll leave first

817
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.400
Tetsuo…

818
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.567
Tetsuo, listen to me...

819
00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:14.967
Tetsuo

820
00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:18.167
Tetsuo... listen to me

821
00:48:18.167 --> 00:48:19.500
Go in and have a rest.

822
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.667
Listen to me

823
00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:25.567
Tetsuo…

824
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:30.033
Tetsuo

825
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.167
Listen to me

826
00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:40.800
This is specially made in Japan

827
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.867
You don't want to eavesdrop on how we scold you, do you?

828
00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:47.733
thank you

829
00:48:47.733 --> 00:48:50.900
There is no such thing as a free lunch
I want to return the favor from now on

830
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.500
Just give me the recording

831
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.667
Then just take the money and go abroad.

832
00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:04.900
so i

833
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.400
Can there be a happy ending?

834
00:49:06.933 --> 00:49:10.067
Although I don't want you to do that

835
00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:11.833
But you go

836
00:49:11.833 --> 00:49:14.033
Leave this country

837
00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:17.033
Only in this way can this country become cleaner.

838
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.800
However

839
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.367
If you can't get the evidence

840
00:49:21.367 --> 00:49:23.967
Just waiting to be thrown into the Nanji Island garbage dump

841
00:49:41.733 --> 00:49:43.500
Now that we're on the same boat

842
00:49:44.933 --> 00:49:46.833
Let me tell you something interesting as a gift

843
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:51.867
Although I don’t know what you want to do

844
00:49:51.867 --> 00:49:54.167
But nothing can scare me anymore
There's nothing else I want to know

845
00:49:56.733 --> 00:49:58.700
Choi Cheol-woong’s biological father…

846
00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:02.800
You thought it was Minister Huang Zhongcheng?

847
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.100
Actually not

848
00:50:21.867 --> 00:50:24.267
President Cai Dongba called me

849
00:50:24.267 --> 00:50:26.133
I heard you went to see him

850
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:27.900
Yes

851
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.467
You should have discussed this with me before you went.

852
00:50:30.467 --> 00:50:31.767
sorry

853
00:50:31.767 --> 00:50:34.233
I see you are busy with the election

854
00:50:34.233 --> 00:50:36.300
Don't want to cause any trouble to you

855
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.133
That’s why I want to solve it myself

856
00:50:38.133 --> 00:50:40.000
Let's wait first

857
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.967
Chairman Cai Dongba said he is very capable

858
00:50:42.967 --> 00:50:46.667
If you send him back to Japan
Chairman Cai cannot cooperate with us

859
00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:48.933
The amount of money invested in this election is astronomical

860
00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:50.700
All bullets must be cherished

861
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.533
We can't do it for a gangster
Give up the entire ammunition depot

862
00:50:53.533 --> 00:50:54.900
minister

863
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.867
Li Douxue

864
00:50:56.867 --> 00:50:58.967
Not an ordinary gangster

865
00:50:58.967 --> 00:51:00.867
Is it because of Dingchen?

866
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.833
It’s all reached this point
I think you are not destined

867
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.167
You'd better forget her

868
00:51:07.167 --> 00:51:09.233
I sent others to monitor Li Douxue

869
00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:11.333
No, let me finish it.

870
00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:13.100
You give me enough is enough

871
00:51:15.133 --> 00:51:16.633
go out

872
00:51:23.467 --> 00:51:26.867
National security is about to collapse

873
00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:30.033
Why are you sighing so loudly?

874
00:51:30.033 --> 00:51:32.700
Why? What's on your mind?

875
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.933
How

876
00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:36.233
Do parasites still want to share my worries?

877
00:51:36.233 --> 00:51:39.033
Share everything with the host

878
00:51:39.033 --> 00:51:40.800
Is it the fate of parasites?

879
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.233
I say you

880
00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:48.433
What is it between my mother and President Geum Man-chul?
What the hell?

881
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.133
Why should we give the company’s account to Qin Wanzhe?

882
00:51:52.833 --> 00:51:55.600
Do you want Madam's funds to be traced?

883
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.900
Then you...

884
00:52:00.667 --> 00:52:05.400
At least report it to me or the minister first.
Brat

885
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.133
Report…

886
00:52:09.433 --> 00:52:11.433
Can this be reported?

887
00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:16.033
The minister didn’t know that his wife invested in Qin Manzhe

888
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.167
I did it for the sake of peace in your family.

889
00:52:20.167 --> 00:52:23.567
Your reaction is really unpleasant.

890
00:52:23.567 --> 00:52:27.600
I said we should respect each other

891
00:52:28.967 --> 00:52:30.900
you parasite

892
00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.167
How

893
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.067
I'm not dead

894
00:52:40.233 --> 00:52:41.867
Does it make you depressed?

895
00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:43.467
Yes, brat

896
00:52:43.467 --> 00:52:45.033
I'm very depressed

897
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.800
Do you think the minister will be your backer?
until when

898
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.667
Do you think he will be your supporter?

899
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:53.533
I don’t know whose child it is

900
00:53:00.433 --> 00:53:01.967
what

901
00:53:09.933 --> 00:53:12.300
Even a gangster can't be dealt with well

902
00:53:14.067 --> 00:53:16.100
Useless trash

903
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.100
Cui Zhexiong knew that I had transferred the company's account
Gave it to Qin Wanzhe

904
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:34.600
So even if Qin Manzhe transfers money,
I can't get the money either

905
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.400
what

906
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.733
I won't get half a dime this way.

907
00:53:38.733 --> 00:53:41.767
I have no money and I have no energy to work.

908
00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:45.900
I'll give it to you

909
00:53:46.967 --> 00:53:47.867
How to give

910
00:53:47.867 --> 00:53:50.533
I will first transfer 1 billion won to your account

911
00:53:50.533 --> 00:53:53.167
The rest is waiting for you to get the evidence.

912
00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:54.700
Pay the money in one hand and deliver the goods in one hand

913
00:53:55.067 --> 00:53:56.900
Then you remit the money immediately

914
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.467
I will take action immediately after confirmation

915
00:54:06.533 --> 00:54:08.733
(Remittance of 1 billion won by Lee Hyung-guk)

916
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.167
Are you all ready?

917
00:54:18.167 --> 00:54:19.200
Yeah

918
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.200
Get Huang Zhongcheng and find someone to kill him
After Douxue’s father’s evidence

919
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.000
Dingchen will break the news in a current affairs magazine

920
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.500
Prosecutor Kim Sung Ye will start taking action

921
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.333
Jiang Ruzhen abused her privileges

922
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:29.833
Huang Zhongcheng abetted murder

923
00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:32.433
Coupled with the investigation of illegal funds by the Ministry of Security and Enterprise

924
00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:34.600
It will continue wave after wave

925
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.533
Then let you help him push it down
What about Choi Cheol-woong, who was convicted of murder?

926
00:54:38.533 --> 00:54:40.533
At the same time as his parents' downfall.

927
00:54:40.533 --> 00:54:42.133
He will also hit rock bottom at the same time

928
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.500
Everyone listen up

929
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.767
no second chance
Can't make any mistakes

930
00:54:48.767 --> 00:54:49.900
good

931
00:54:50.567 --> 00:54:52.733
Let's go catch the bad guys together

932
00:54:52.733 --> 00:54:53.500
Let's go

933
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.733
Let's go

934
00:55:28.067 --> 00:55:29.300
Take a seat

935
00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.967
Thank you very much for taking the time to come here.

936
00:55:33.933 --> 00:55:36.133
Okay, tell me what the emergency is.

937
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.400
Just say it quickly

938
00:55:41.733 --> 00:55:44.933
I'm sorry to say this to you

939
00:55:44.933 --> 00:55:47.433
But I might have to leave you

940
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.567
what does this mean

941
00:55:50.567 --> 00:55:52.533
Didn't we promise that we would go to the end together?

942
00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:55.633
my ability is insufficient
I can only accompany you here

943
00:55:55.633 --> 00:55:58.167
The recent troubles have caused you
I'm sorry

944
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.800
Why are you doing this? It's all in the past.

945
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.267
Everyone has shortcomings

946
00:56:03.267 --> 00:56:05.600
There will be a presidential election in the future
The battle for the parliamentary election is about to be fought

947
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.100
I can rest assured that you are not here
Who to leave the matter to?

948
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.500
beside the minister

949
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.033
There are many younger than me
more capable person

950
00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:15.300
Especially Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

951
00:56:15.867 --> 00:56:18.233
You are because I kept Tetsuo by my side

952
00:56:18.233 --> 00:56:21.200
Are you disappointed in me by keeping your distance?

953
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.967
No

954
00:56:22.967 --> 00:56:25.367
The minister takes care of me more than anyone else

955
00:56:25.367 --> 00:56:27.567
You will always be my captain

956
00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:30.533
I was definitely not disappointed

957
00:56:30.533 --> 00:56:31.600
But…

958
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.733
I guess this is all I can do

959
00:56:34.733 --> 00:56:37.900
He often gets into arguments with Prosecutor Choi

960
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.033
I'm tired too

961
00:56:40.033 --> 00:56:43.500
Please accept my request

962
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.433
you really

963
00:56:45.433 --> 00:56:47.233
Please, Minister.

964
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.700
so sad

965
00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.900
Got it, that's it

966
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.133
I have something to tell you before I leave

967
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:03.200
Do you remember Lee Yong-deok?

968
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.367
who

969
00:57:07.367 --> 00:57:09.033
Lee Yongde…

970
00:57:09.033 --> 00:57:12.533
The one who killed Lee Doo-hak's father Lee Jong-ho
truck driver

971
00:57:14.867 --> 00:57:17.000
I heard that after Lee Doo-hak returned to Korea,

972
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.500
I've been looking for Lee Yongdeok

973
00:57:19.933 --> 00:57:20.900
what

974
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:24.600
He seemed to suspect that someone was instigating him to kill someone.

975
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.400
If he finds Li Yongde
I suspect it was the Minister who ordered you

976
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.133
Things are going to get tricky

977
00:57:31.133 --> 00:57:32.633
Team Leader Wu

978
00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:34.233
Be careful what you say

979
00:57:36.133 --> 00:57:37.700
Sorry

980
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.433
You should figure it out on your own before you leave.

981
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.533
Yes I will handle it properly

982
00:57:44.533 --> 00:57:46.200
And…

983
00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:52.800
I have one more thing to tell you

984
00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:54.567
I would say this

985
00:57:54.567 --> 00:57:57.133
Totally out of loyalty to you

986
00:57:59.067 --> 00:58:01.000
Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

987
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.833
Not your biological son

988
00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.900
Sorry, Minister

989
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.900
But I really can't stand it

990
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.067
You've been kept in the dark

991
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.667
Who else knows about this besides you?

992
00:58:59.733 --> 00:59:01.700
I'm just telling you

993
00:59:02.967 --> 00:59:06.500
Tetsuo is not my child

994
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.367
I already knew it

995
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.333
But why do you…

996
00:59:15.733 --> 00:59:17.233
I just...

997
00:59:18.367 --> 00:59:21.567
I don’t want the person I’ve been waiting for all my life

998
00:59:21.567 --> 00:59:23.967
Just leave me again

999
00:59:24.767 --> 00:59:26.000
Choi Cheol-woong is also excellent

1000
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.633
Enough to be my child

1001
00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:31.867
now i understand

1002
00:59:31.867 --> 00:59:34.267
Why is my wife so protective of you?

1003
00:59:34.967 --> 00:59:36.867
Tetsuo too

1004
00:59:36.867 --> 00:59:40.100
Ruzhen, it must be very hard for you, right?

1005
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.833
No

1006
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.400
you misunderstood

1007
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.200
minister

1008
01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.933
for our family

1009
01:00:15.767 --> 01:00:17.967
Please be loyal until the end

1010
01:00:45.133 --> 01:00:48.700
(The final episode will be broadcast tomorrow night)

1011
01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.267
(Preview of next episode)

1012
01:01:13.267 --> 01:01:14.300
what spy

1013
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.700
It doesn't seem safe here either

1014
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.233
If you resist, you can shoot him

1015
01:01:17.233 --> 01:01:17.833
shoot to kill

1016
01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.733
Please post the news tomorrow

1017
01:01:19.733 --> 01:01:22.200
I'll go to the prosecutor myself

1018
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.067
Tetsuo…

1019
01:01:23.067 --> 01:01:24.300
Is it really our child?

1020
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.000
This is related to the lives of the minister and Tetsuo

1021
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.233
It's also about your life

1022
01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:28.933
Please save Tetsuo

1023
01:01:28.933 --> 01:01:29.833
Surrender

1024
01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:32.267
It's not enough to help you with one murder.

1025
01:01:32.267 --> 01:01:34.867
Now you want me to help you carry it
Are you guilty of killing my father?

1026
01:01:34.867 --> 01:01:36.467
You can't attack each other like this

1027
01:01:36.467 --> 01:01:38.467
You are brothers

1028
01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:40.167
aunt

1029
01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:41.700
If you don't shoot now, you won't be my son.

1030
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.767
No

1031
01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:43.933
No, Tetsuo

1032
01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.767
please don't do that
