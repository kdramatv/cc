(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.167
(Dark blue night)

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.633
The theater was previously in the hands of my aunt

4
00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.400
It’s been a while since I got it back now

5
00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:27.500
Thank you for inviting us to watch the movie

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.000
What nonsense are you talking about?
How could she invite us to watch a movie?

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.233
Watch free movies at our theater
What's the difference between giving me a treat?

8
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.200
You are not allowed to appear around here again.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Do you know?

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.400
I'll give you this sentence
That's your dad's theater, not yours

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.900
what did you say

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.433
you two guys
They look like freshly dug potatoes

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.867
I still look like it now
Freshly dug potatoes?

14
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.600
unlike

15
00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.700
You are a ripe potato now

16
00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.700
The theater is temporarily under the management of Master Zheng

17
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.967
This used to be a popcorn stall.

18
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.267
Yeah we used to
I am often frightened by this sound

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.033
A guy arrived
There's another guy who didn't come

20
00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.267
You really deserve a beating

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.100
He will come. Just wait a little longer.

22
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.100
scared me

23
00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.133
Damn, it scared me

24
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.200
I knew you would tease me

25
00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.233
By the way, do you want to go through the back door?
Sneak into the theater to watch a movie

26
00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.800
If caught by the dean of students
You will be suspended from school

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000
When did you care about this kind of thing?

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.533
what do you mean

29
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:54.267
After all, I was considered a model student when I was a student.

30
00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:55.633
That's right too

31
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.933
You're the one with bad grades, right?

32
00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.700
My class ranking improved by eight places

33
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.367
Oh my God, where did you get on the exam?

34
00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:05.767
Ranked seventeenth in the class, ranked one hundred and ninety in the school

35
00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:07.800
The first time I took the exam, I ranked among the top 200 in school.

36
00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.100
It’s not that I have bad grades, I just don’t like studying

37
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.700
I've said it several times

38
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.633
Got it, you just don’t like studying

39
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.533
I'm really wronged

40
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.667
this is delicious

Douxue

42
00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:22.167
I've seen so many movies

43
00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.567
I don’t think life should be like the plot in a movie

44
00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:29.033
Don’t live like a movie protagonist
is true happiness

45
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.800
I hope to live an ordinary life

46
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800
Just be ordinary

47
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.467
Even if it’s not like in the movie
It doesn’t hurt to have a great plot, too.

48
00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:41.367
We just live a slow and steady life
Ordinary life

49
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.767
OK let's do this

50
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.933
Live a slow and ordinary life

51
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.933
"The quiet breeze blows me..."

52
00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.700
(Episode 9)
All the rights to occupy the wooden cave have been bought.

53
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.333
Even if you are willing to pay more, you can’t buy it.

54
00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.767
I heard about it too

55
00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:17.133
I heard the remaining occupancy rights
bought all by someone

56
00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:21.133
Probably persuaded by sweet words
President of Du Geng Association

57
00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.600
So they were all eaten by that person

58
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.100
Really awesome

59
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.233
Why didn't I think of this trick?

60
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.233
By the way, Ms. Jiang

61
00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:33.667
Someone said there is a housing agency nearby
see you

62
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.567
How is it possible

63
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:38.333
The other party must have seen it wrong

64
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:41.367
I'm not interested in investing in this area

65
00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:44.467
Besides, my son is a civil servant

66
00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.067
I can't do anything to hinder his future

67
00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:48.767
Aren't we in the same situation as you?

68
00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:51.000
Everyone is buying and selling by borrowing heads.

69
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.100
Thank you for your hard work

70
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.367
Driving is not hard at all

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.100
The contract is here

72
00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:07.667
These contracts have my name on them

73
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.867
I always have the illusion of becoming a rich man.

74
00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.733
This is not your illusion

75
00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:15.000
You will really become a rich man later

76
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.133
what

77
00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.900
Do you think I'm kidding?

78
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.367
I said I would definitely pay you for running errands

79
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:24.800
I’ll give you 3%

80
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
are you serious

81
00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:34.367
But if it’s 3%…

82
00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.533
If I make 10 billion won

83
00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:38.667
I will give you 300 million won.

84
00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.733
But…

85
00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:47.733
You must swear to keep this matter secret.

86
00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.200
Of course...

87
00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.600
good night madam

88
00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.500
Don't be so polite

89
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.133
Go back and rest quickly

90
00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:16.367
Douxue About Funding for Contracting Projects

91
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:18.500
The money you prepared with Brother Feng Hao

92
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.433
Plus shares in restaurants and nightclubs

93
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:23.133
You should also know that these add up
Less than 20% of the funding requirements

94
00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:26.233
Didn’t the other party promise?
Do you want to help us connect with the bank?

95
00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.100
This is just a temporary fix for us

96
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.167
It may suddenly turn into poison in the future

97
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.600
If the bank's capital pipeline is blocked

98
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.433
We will die immediately

99
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.200
Douxue people from Nanshan
What do they want you to do to them?

100
00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.167
You are my hound from today on

101
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.700
hound

102
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.267
Do they treat Brother Douxue as a hunting dog?

103
00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.500
Let's not be a hunting dog

104
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.333
How about being a wild wolf instead?

105
00:05:55.433 --> 00:06:02.233
Don’t think that the owner can tie the dog leash for you at will
The hound that beats and decides life and death

106
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.267
Instead of a hound, should I become a wolf?

107
00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:07.833
If there is a way, of course you should do it

108
00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.833
But the current funds for contracting projects...

109
00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.667
Big brother

110
00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.333
You know the most senior boss in the underworld?
Chairman Gu Bangsik

111
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.367
of course i know

112
00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.967
He laments all day long that the underworld has become
A place where little gangsters run amok

113
00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:22.567
It's my honor to meet Chairman Koo in person

114
00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:26.400
Yes, he's the only one
Respected figures from various gangs

115
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800
I think he can unite gangs across the country

116
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.967
Create a corporation or alliance

117
00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:32.500
(Contracting enterprise shareholding contract)
So we need to recruit gangs from all over the country

118
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.033
Let them hold shares in the contracting business

119
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.400
Using gang funds to run contracting businesses

120
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.433
(Construction contracting enterprise shareholding contract)
President, this is the social fee provided to you.

121
00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.200
This way you can transform from a hound into a wild wolf.

122
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.467
(30 million won)
10 million won will be deposited into the account every month

123
00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.333
This document is a business shareholding agreement

124
00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.033
You just need to stamp it and you'll be fine

125
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:51.067
Transformed from a hound into a wild wolf

126
00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.533
What about us?

127
00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:54.700
Will we become a gang of wild wolves?

128
00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.967
But will Chairman Goo accept it?

129
00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:09.067
You two are very smart.

130
00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:10.233
Very good

131
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:11.733
very good

132
00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:14.200
For the revival of the gang

133
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.133
Let's do it seriously

134
00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:17.533
Cheers

135
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:18.800

Masan 40 million won

142
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.700
This is 50 million won from Mokpo

143

145
00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:20.000
swear an oath

00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:32.000
More than just running a contracting company

151
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.600
At the same time, we also need to buy land around Dugeng District.

152
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.400
With funds from the Loyalty Association
more than enough to do this

153
00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:41.833
Profit from operating a contracting company
If it is one billion won

154
00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.267
The profits that can be obtained from the increase in surrounding land prices...

155
00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:47.567
It will probably exceed 10 billion won

156
00:08:47.567 --> 00:08:49.433
Bingo

157
00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:51.900

Twelve thousand households will move in

160
00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:13.233
(Loyalty Association)
There were approximately three to four thousand residents participating in the sit-in.

161
00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:15.867
Brother and Xuanyu communicate with them
Just compensate for the problem

162

Never participate in demolition operations

163
00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.900
Don't know about other gang guys
Will they come to cause trouble during the demolition?

164
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.733
Control the situation
Just don't cause a conflict that will make the news at the meeting

165
00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:26.800
Small conflicts will be handled by other brothers.

166

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.600
Why don't you contact me?

175

Why should I contact you

Didn’t I say I’d give you money for the drinks from the roadside stall?

180
00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:18.867
No need. It’s not much money.

181
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.300
Hey brat

182
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.333
Are you a wooden head?

183
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:29.700
Hey wooden head

184
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.133
come out with me

185
00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:34.633
I will treat you to delicious food that is ten times more expensive than the wine.

186
00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.700
Not out yet

187
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.000
Why are you standing still? Why don't you hurry up and follow me?

188
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.767
But we are still in a meeting...

189
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:43.833
The meeting is over

190
00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.567
Go quickly...

191
00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:48.433
The meeting is over

192
00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:53.900
Wooden head is leaving soon

193
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.500
Come back later

194
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.100
I just said I was willing to offer it higher than the market price.

195
00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.800
All this money is for you

196
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.100
It's really good

197
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.467
Bro, wait a minute

198
00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:03.800
Wait a minute...

199
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.967
I just went to the Dong Office

200
00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:06.733
People over there say this house
Has no value after rebuilding

201
00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.300
This one?

202
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.533
Yeah, they said this one is worthless.

203
00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:10.367
Let's sign a contract with the one across the street.

204
00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:13.300
Oh my god, it was so bad.

205
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.833
wait a moment

206
00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:16.033
I agree

207
00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:17.700
What did you promise? Didn’t you say no?

208
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.967
Give it to me...
wait a moment

209
00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:22.567
Then deduct 100,000 won

210
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:23.700
I'm kidding

211
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.533
Sign it quickly. Really?

212
00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:27.233
Let's go

213
00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:28.133
I know

214
00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:29.633
Oh my god

215
00:11:29.633 --> 00:11:32.267
This is the triangle area
where to go now

216
00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:34.067
At times like this

217
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.933
sorry

218
00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:38.733
The saliva is all on my face
go there

219
00:11:47.533 --> 00:11:49.100
Well signed

220
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.533
Come, have a drink first

221
00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:53.233
relax

222
00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:55.467
OK thank you

223
00:11:56.833 --> 00:12:00.167
Come and sign here

224
00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:01.967
You will definitely make money

225
00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:03.967
Will make a lot of money

226
00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:06.800
This boss is very busy. Let's help you.

227
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.267
I'm good at chopping firewood

228
00:12:09.267 --> 00:12:11.267
Are you optimistic...

229
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.633
(Consent form)

230
00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:21.733
thank you

231
00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:26.500
welcome

232
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.567
(Mingdo 2 holes)
Look who's coming

233
00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:29.633
hello

234
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:30.867
(Mingtang 3 holes)
This area looks pretty good

235
00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:32.100
There is still land to buy here

236
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.200
Really?
Yes

237
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.833
welcome

238
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:39.900
hello

239
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.300
(Mingtang 3 holes)
here

240
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.567
No need to buy anymore

241
00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:43.800
Is it completely gone?

242
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.433
you should have come earlier

243
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.933
(Jiangshan Real Estate Consultant)

244
00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:59.300
where to go now

245
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.167
(real estate consultant)

246
00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:07.767
Surrounding large residential areas
This is the real prime location

247
00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:10.400
But I heard they were all bought by Douxue

248
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.333
He bought it at a very low price
Now only a few bits of land remain

249
00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:16.500
You know when everything is done
How valuable is that land?

250
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.333
I didn't expect he had so much money

251
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.367
This is a state-run business

252
00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:23.433
But you help others marry

253
00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:25.367
Let the stinky gangster...

254
00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:27.933
Let those gangsters enjoy their gains
Do you think this sounds reasonable?

255
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:28.967
Of course it's outrageous

256
00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:32.167
So what are you going to do

257
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:38.867
I originally didn't answer my calls because Tetsuo
I'm almost bored to death...

258
00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:44.033
Li Douxue did a good job

259
00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:46.167
Demolition work is very fast

260
00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:49.833
And compared with other demolition areas
Not much conflict

261
00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.700
But…

262
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.267
He is buying more reservations
surrounding land

263
00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.200
Really?

264
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.100
Anyway, that's not within the range we specified.

265
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.233
It shouldn't be bad, right?

266
00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:04.033
But he bought more than 90% of the land

267
00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:06.633
That land was bought with money from the mafia alliance.

268
00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:09.767
We don’t even have 1% of the shares

269
00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.267
Leave him alone

270
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.700
The more the price of their land holdings rises, the better

271
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.633
what

272
00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:18.567
It didn’t cost us any money anyway.

273
00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:20.533
And in a way

274
00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:22.900
Is this the income earned by criminal groups?

275
00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:28.000
There are always traps in freedom

276
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.300
And…

277
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.133
I came from near Gongchang Cave
I heard from a housing agency

278
00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:37.267
Li Douxue leaks rumors everywhere
Said that our unit is the mastermind behind the scenes

279
00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:40.867
What really?

280
00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:44.267
Can I buy an apartment with this money?

281
00:14:46.733 --> 00:14:49.067
If you dare to steal money, you'll be doomed
You know

282
00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:50.200
We won't steal money

283
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.700
Big brother

284
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.033
What's wrong

285
00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.833
Absolutely nothing like that

286
00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.833
How could I possibly do that suicidal act?

287
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:09.100
And you should also know

288
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.233
This business is operated with funds from the Loyalty Association

289
00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:12.567
if something goes wrong

290
00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:15.167
I will become the target of public criticism across the country.

291
00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:17.767
How could I do something so stupid

292
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:21.600
Who said that?

293
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.567
I will confirm it myself and tell the other party to shut up.

294
00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:28.867
No, I understand.

295
00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:31.733
Be careful
Don't let me hear such rumors again

296
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:34.467
If this happens again

297
00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:37.767
Whether it is more contracting or other cooperation projects
No need to talk about it

298
00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:45.667
Li Douxue

299
00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:50.233
You refuse us to help you borrow money from the bank

300
00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.967
But he took money from various gangs

301
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:55.800
what do you want to do

302
00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:01.267
This is my own business

303
00:16:27.933 --> 00:16:29.233
Is your career going well?

304
00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:30.967
is it you

305
00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:32.000
what

306
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.967
Investigate behind my back the guy who keeps talking too much

307
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.733
Did you tell me about your organization of the Loyalty Association?

308
00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:42.233
I know you are mighty
held a founding ceremony

309
00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:46.933
Prosecutor of the Republic of Korea
People who don't know about this are spies, right?

310
00:16:46.933 --> 00:16:48.767
There are also people among the seniors who want to investigate you.

311
00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:52.467
But I heard that I was stopped by my superiors.

312
00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:57.433
The superior said that gangs should stop fighting and killing each other.
live in harmony

313
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.933
Isn't this a good thing?

314
00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:02.433
But I don't believe it

315
00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:04.333
Do you live in harmony?

316
00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:07.867
gang dictionary
Is there such a beautiful word?

317
00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:09.900
Saying it will make people laugh out loud.

318
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:14.633
Anyway, you are really amazing

319
00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:16.767
Even organized a national alliance

320
00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:19.800
Is it because there is a backer behind you?

321
00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.467
I'm leaving

322
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.333
What? This reaction is so boring.

323
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:37.500
be careful

324
00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:43.133
The biggest gangster in Korea

325
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.200
Maybe I will arrest you and put you in jail

326
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.000
What's wrong
You and I don’t owe each other anything now

327
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.733
i know

328
00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:55.300
But I quit the world

329
00:17:57.433 --> 00:18:00.533
By the way, you will
Don't come to me suddenly again

330
00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:02.967
Maybe in the future we will
Prosecutor and suspect's identity reunited

331
00:18:02.967 --> 00:18:04.700
It’s hard to get things done when we meet too often

332
00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:10.367
My mother might remarry

333
00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:12.067
Don't come then either

334
00:18:12.067 --> 00:18:15.267
Although I won't invite you at all...

335
00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:22.333
Even so, you have to come

336
00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:24.400
I will send you a wedding invitation

337
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.533
Dingchen and I are getting married

338
00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:00.133
Go to a place with me

339
00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.467
Please change your clothes

340
00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:08.233
Please go to a place with me

341
00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:27.900
Oh my God, so hot

342
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.833
so delicious

343
00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:37.067
Keiko, if Tetsuo’s mother remarries
what are you going to do

344
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.933
How do I have the right to decide?

345
00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:41.933
She told me to go to work and I went to work.

346
00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:43.433
If you want me to leave...

347
00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:45.633
I have to leave

348
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.833
Yes, both of our lives are about the same.

349
00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:53.033
We have never been the protagonists of our own lives

350
00:19:53.933 --> 00:19:57.367
Neither money nor knowledge

351
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.333
By the way...

352
00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:05.200
How can those who have read the books do that?

353
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.600
Which kind

354
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.133
Kissing and hugging each other at the gate

355
00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:14.467
God, I feel ashamed when I see it

356
00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:18.033
how could you see

357
00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:21.767
Last time I went to Lishui to help my dad hold a 60th anniversary banquet

358
00:20:21.767 --> 00:20:23.700
The night I came back

359
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.667
I saw them hugging each other at the gate

360
00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:30.333
how they did it

361
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.000
Is it like this...

362
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.367
Ouch, why are you doing this?

363
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.600
How is it? Hurry up and learn.

364
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.233
Very disgusting

365
00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:39.567
How do they do it? Is it like this?

366
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.700
But I heard something strange

367
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.567
Mom

368
00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:49.833
Ouch, Douxue is here

369
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.600
Right

370
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.800
Oops, your dad is here too

371
00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:07.500
But what's the matter?

372
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.567
Why do you look so awkward?

373
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.967
Mom, where is Zhenyu?

374
00:21:16.267 --> 00:21:19.733
She occasionally calls home
Tell us that you are safe

375
00:21:19.733 --> 00:21:23.800
I asked her which company she worked for
Don't tell me where I live

376
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.867
Maybe I'm afraid of being taken away like last time.

377
00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:28.867
OK

378
00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:31.300
She must be doing pretty well
That’s why I don’t want to go home

379
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.100
She's not a spoiled child

380
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.900
Why worry so much

381
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.700
Your dad is here again

382
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.600
He was obviously worried about Zhenyu...

383
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.500
How can I have

384
00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:47.033
If Zhenyu calls home again
Tell her

385
00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:48.833
Tell her to come to my wedding

386
00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:53.933
Are you having a wedding?

387
00:21:53.933 --> 00:21:57.167
Really? Who is the bride?

388
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.433
Dingchen

389
00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:01.733
Dingchen?

390
00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:04.700
Is she the daughter of Lishui Nanhai Theater?

391
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.167
When is the wedding going to be held?

392
00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:07.633
We will hold it as soon as possible

393
00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:11.300
If the date is decided
I'll bring her to say hello

394
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:16.067
Ouch, you are so confusing

395
00:22:16.067 --> 00:22:19.367
How can you scare everyone in this way?

396
00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:25.367
And...the underworld thing

397
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.200
I've given up on washing my hands

398
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:35.567
Really? Are you serious?

399
00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:38.200
Yes I am currently working in the construction industry

400
00:22:39.533 --> 00:22:41.133
My son is amazing

401
00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:43.400
You are really amazing

402
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.800
every time i think of you

403
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.700
like indigestion
My stomach feels uncomfortable

404
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.300
You did a great job…

405
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.200
Mom, eat quickly. Eat more.

406
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.200
You can now sit back and relax too

407
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.867
Can you say something too?

408
00:23:08.967 --> 00:23:13.000
Thank you and sorry

409
00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:16.867
I know how to wash my hands in a golden basin not because of dad

410
00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:23.800
i know

411
00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:29.567
I'm leaving first

412
00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:31.067
You can go back after you finish eating.

413
00:23:31.567 --> 00:23:35.300
Wait a minute. If you want to leave, let's go together.

414
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.200
Mom…

415
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.567
I still have something to say

416
00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:41.867
Uncle left the cigarettes here

417
00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:43.900
I'll take it to him

418
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.700
Ouch

419
00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:52.600
uncle

420
00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:56.567
Why did you come out? Why don't you eat more?

421
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.867
Did you just look for this?

422
00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:02.967
You left your cigarette on your seat

423
00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:04.700
thank you

424
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.900
Go back and eat more

425
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.933
Come and sit at our house occasionally

426
00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:12.300
OK

427
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.300
But uncle

428
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800
What's wrong

429
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:24.933
Tetsuo is not the deceased young master
Biological son?

430
00:24:25.733 --> 00:24:29.167
what do you mean

431
00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.833
Of course he is the young master's son

432
00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:33.767
So that's it

433
00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:36.800
So be careful on the road

434
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.967
Tell me who said what to you

435
00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:43.100
Did Douxue fucking say that?

436
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.667
Ouch, that's not the case...

437
00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:47.733
Better not

438
00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:50.033
That damn old woman

439
00:24:50.033 --> 00:24:53.200
I'll tell you no

440
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.800
It's the lady who said that. It's the lady.

441
00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:02.867
Madam?

442
00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:04.667
Yes

443
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:10.633
I didn't expect my child
I have suffered so much

444
00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:15.500
That's not your fault

445
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.467
No, if I had gone to find you earlier

446
00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:25.167
I should have known earlier that Tetsuo is my bloodline

447
00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:27.867
It won't cause as much damage

448
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.367
it's all my fault

449
00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:35.067
If this continues
The distance between our father and son will only grow farther and farther

450
00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:37.800
Stop hiding it
Just tell Tetsuo directly, okay?

451
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.500
Tell him I'm his biological father

452
00:25:40.933 --> 00:25:44.867
He will know sooner or later anyway
Please give me a little more time

453
00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:46.300
Ruzhen

454
00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:55.467
Sorry, I shouldn't talk too much

455
00:25:56.567 --> 00:25:58.100
Keiko

456
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.333
What's wrong

457
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.967
This thing is not true

458
00:26:01.967 --> 00:26:04.367
you can't tell anyone

459
00:26:04.367 --> 00:26:09.767
Ouch, how could I know?
Is this true or false?

460
00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:13.933
Whether it's true or false, you absolutely can't say it

461
00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:15.633
Got it?

462
00:26:17.133 --> 00:26:19.933
I know

463
00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.533
I swear I won't tell anyone

464
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.033
Mom, take a look

465
00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:27.933
I bought an apartment in your name

466
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.833
Even if three people live together, they won’t feel crowded.

467
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.933
(House ownership certificate)

468
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.467
Douxue

469
00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:42.967
What did you talk about? Why did you talk for so long?

470
00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:44.167
Come sit down and dine

471
00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:45.367
OK…

472
00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:46.733
Keiko

473
00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:49.800
Now we can finally live with dignity

474
00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:52.500
Douxue

475
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.200
A great day like today
How could you let your dad leave the table like that?

476
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.233
Go and invite him back

477
00:26:59.233 --> 00:27:00.633
Do you know

478
00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:01.633
Tetsuo

479
00:28:04.033 --> 00:28:05.300
uncle

480
00:28:07.233 --> 00:28:08.267
It's uncle, right?

481
00:28:08.267 --> 00:28:13.133
Yes, I came to see Douxue

482
00:28:13.133 --> 00:28:15.300
Come and see you by the way

483
00:28:25.533 --> 00:28:29.133
This is Doggang Apartment in Gongjangdong
70% of the subscription signing fee

484
00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:31.367
Thank you for your hard work

485
00:28:31.367 --> 00:28:33.067
thank you

486
00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:36.200
I have something to ask you

487
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.233
please say

488
00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:43.533
I hope it's near Gongchang Cave
The land bought by your company

489
00:28:43.533 --> 00:28:46.067
Can you give me half

490
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:47.867
what

491
00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:50.000
I’ll buy it with you at a 50% increase in price.

492
00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:53.500
Over there is a land that has nothing to do with Tokyo.

493
00:28:57.467 --> 00:28:59.333
Just promise me this time

494
00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:01.400
This is not my personal request

495
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.400
But I have a lot of loyal brothers to support

496
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.533
I'm really sorry. I hope you can understand.

497
00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:12.400
I will make it up to you later

498
00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:16.067
Really?

499
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.333
really sorry

500
00:29:27.233 --> 00:29:29.633
Drink slowly

501
00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:35.800
Tetsuo

502
00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:39.067
yes

503
00:29:39.067 --> 00:29:41.767
Your Cui family is really outstanding

504
00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:44.600
Your grandfather was an independence activist

505
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.500
And even if your father has a smooth career,

506
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.367
He still chooses to take the right path

507
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:55.267
No matter what the world says

508
00:29:55.267 --> 00:29:59.800
You should all be proud of the Cui family

509
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.667
Never forget your grandfather and your father

510
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.433
Of course, I have always been proud of the Cui family.

511
00:30:13.433 --> 00:30:15.067
you don't have to worry

512
00:30:15.067 --> 00:30:17.267
Even if your mother remarries

513
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.567
You are still from the Cui family

514
00:30:22.567 --> 00:30:23.867
Have you heard about it?

515
00:30:23.867 --> 00:30:26.200
You are from the Cui family, do you understand?

516
00:30:27.767 --> 00:30:28.833
OK

517
00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:30.500
louder

518
00:30:31.933 --> 00:30:34.133
ok i got it

519
00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:35.667
Very good

520
00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:52.067
Have you heard that Brother Douxue is getting married?

521
00:30:56.933 --> 00:30:58.167
I heard

522
00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:05.300
Uncle, can you think of a way to postpone the wedding?

523
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.300
what is the reason

524
00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:17.633
The prosecutor is still observing Brother Douxue
Is it true that the golden basin has washed its hands?

525
00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:23.600
If he's just pretending to be a businessman

526
00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:25.633
Then the bride...

527
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.300
She will be hurt

528
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.133
Tetsuo

529
00:31:37.767 --> 00:31:40.100
Although I am his father

530
00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:45.633
But how dare I ask him not to get married?

531
00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:49.300
That child begged me

532
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.567
But I sent him to jail

533
00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:57.067
Although…

534
00:31:57.067 --> 00:31:59.133
The decision was made by me

535
00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:03.467
But you should also let him go

536
00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:05.300
that poor child

537
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.100
He just wants to be with the girl he likes
live together

538
00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:11.800
No matter what...

539
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.167
He's your brother too, isn't he?

540
00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:26.167
My brother?

541
00:32:28.933 --> 00:32:30.900
He was indeed my brother

542
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.867
Uncle, will you bend your arms inwards?
Of course

543
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.600
After all, Brother Douxue is your son

544
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.033
are you leaving

545
00:32:57.433 --> 00:32:59.067
Yeah, it's time for me to go

546
00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:02.600
Tetsuo

547
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.267
Let uncle hug you

548
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.900
uncle…

549
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.467
Really proud of you

550
00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:24.867
It doesn't matter if I'm not your father

551
00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:31.633
I really…

552
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.700
I really won't regret it

553
00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:42.900
uncle…

554
00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.867
Hello

555
00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:02.967
It just so happens that my wife is answering the phone.

556
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.633
I am Douxue’s father

557
00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:07.400
Yes

558
00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:10.400
Why did you call so late?

559
00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:13.267
Is Douxue’s mother not home yet?

560
00:34:13.833 --> 00:34:16.033
She's still in Seoul

561
00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:18.533
Has she come to Seoul?

562
00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:20.067
Yes

563
00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:24.233
I just broke up with Tetsuo

564
00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:28.600
Have you met Tetsuo?

565
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.000
What's the matter...

566
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.833
I saw him and told him

567
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:36.433
Even if you deny my existence, madam

568
00:34:36.433 --> 00:34:41.267
He can't forget that he is from the Cui family.

569
00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:45.500
What are you talking about?

570
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.433
madam

571
00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:54.067
I have never thought of Tetsuo
as my own child

572
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:57.100
I have always regarded Tetsuo

573
00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.367
As the child of Master Choi Young-sik

574
00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:02.267
He has known this all his life

575
00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:05.867
How dare I say that I am his biological father?

576
00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:07.167
uncle

577
00:35:07.167 --> 00:35:09.500
Academic father

578
00:35:10.133 --> 00:35:11.233
I…

579
00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:15.033
I don't understand what you are saying at all

580
00:35:15.033 --> 00:35:16.967
madam

581
00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:19.400
You can't do this

582
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.733
You really can't do this

583
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.300
If you…

584
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.933
The person you want to remarry
Becoming Tetsuo's father

585
00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:34.800
Aren’t the young master and Tetsuo so pitiful?

586
00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:40.867
you really can't do this

587
00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:42.033
uncle

588
00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:45.267
I don't know where you heard what.
That's what I said

589
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.100
Even if I really want to remarry

590
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.967
That's my and my family's problem too.

591
00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:54.933
my son

592
00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:58.567
Should I call him Choi Cheol-woong or Kim Cheol-woong?

593
00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:00.867
It has nothing to do with you

594
00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:04.000
Do you understand?

595
00:36:04.767 --> 00:36:06.700
madam

596
00:36:07.767 --> 00:36:11.167
Madam, if you insist on this

597
00:36:11.167 --> 00:36:13.000
I will...

598
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.567
Go get my son back

599
00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.567
Do you think this sounds reasonable?

600
00:36:21.567 --> 00:36:23.133
If it doesn't work again

601
00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:25.933
I will find your remarriage partner

602
00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:27.500
Tell him Tetsuo is my child

603
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.667
Tell him exactly what happened

604
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.800
uncle

605
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.267
Academic father

606
00:36:34.267 --> 00:36:36.933
Let's meet and talk

607
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.900
After you think about it clearly

608
00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:44.867
Let's talk again

609
00:36:46.733 --> 00:36:48.367
Hello

610
00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:49.700
uncle…

611
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.800
Hello…

612
00:37:00.767 --> 00:37:02.267
what to do

613
00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.367
I'll drink from this cup this time

614
00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:18.033
good

615
00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:19.033
I really need to drink from this cup

616
00:37:19.033 --> 00:37:20.967
Who wants to transfer...

617
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.700
please…
Have to turn harder

618
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.633
No, you're turning too hard

619
00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:51.767
tell me

620
00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:53.700
I listen to everything you say

621
00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:56.133
Is this the punishment God gave me?

622
00:37:56.133 --> 00:37:58.533
You didn't do anything wrong, why should you be punished?

623
00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:01.233
Actually

624
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.200
i from a long time ago

625
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.767
I've been being threatened

626
00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:09.233
by whom

627
00:38:09.233 --> 00:38:11.267
But I no longer...

628
00:38:11.267 --> 00:38:13.100
Can't stand it anymore

629
00:38:15.933 --> 00:38:17.500
What does the other party threaten you with?

630
00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:24.033
He wants me to give him half of my property

631
00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:25.667
What if you don’t give it?

632
00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:28.067
He will destroy Tetsuo

633
00:38:29.967 --> 00:38:31.567
Does he have any leverage against Tetsuo?

634
00:38:33.633 --> 00:38:34.967
you tell me

635
00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:36.867
I'll solve it for him

636
00:38:36.867 --> 00:38:38.833
he killed someone

637
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.967
When I was in high school in Lishui

638
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.467
Then what?

639
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:47.633
Tetsuo's friend

640
00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:48.800
that man's son

641
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.400
Went to jail instead of him

642
00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:55.500
I agreed and was at home at that time
The person who works as a long-term worker

643
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.500
Will give him half of his property

644
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.433
Ask him for help

645
00:39:01.733 --> 00:39:04.267
Is that man’s son Li Douxue?

646
00:39:16.033 --> 00:39:20.633
I've always been curious about Tetsuo
Why should I be led by Li Douxue?

647
00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:22.167
now i understand

648
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.500
His son is taking advantage of Tetsuo

649
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.900
his dad

650
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.600
Threatening you

651
00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:29.800
I…

652
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.533
As long as Tetsuo is fine, you don't need anything.

653
00:39:33.533 --> 00:39:36.200
But that person...

654
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.667
Even if I die, I will continue to bully Tetsuo

655
00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:40.633
what should i do

656
00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:43.867
Brother Loyalty, what should I do?

657
00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:53.567
one two three

658
00:39:54.633 --> 00:39:56.667
Congratulations

659

Coming

669
00:40:50.067 --> 00:40:51.033

670
00:40:51.033 --> 00:40:53.267

(Loyalty Association Identity Information)

672
00:40:56.533 --> 00:40:59.567
This is the underworld boss representing each district.

673
00:40:59.567 --> 00:41:02.100
Some of them have numerous criminal records.

674
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.267
Are the funds managed by Li Douxue's company?

675
00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:07.100
Yes

676
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.833
The president on the table is Gu Bangsik

677
00:41:09.833 --> 00:41:12.767
But the people who actually manage the Loyalty Association
It's Li Douxue

678
00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:14.800
They all know it too

679
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.133
Fortunately, they haven't had any fights recently.

681
00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:23.500
I should be able to catch it.

682
00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:27.733
Don't you two know each other?

683
00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:29.733
Yes

684
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.333
We just need to catch him after we know him.

685
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:38.833
If he becomes bad, his sins will only become more serious.

686
00:42:11.167 --> 00:42:13.167
like i said before

687
00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:14.767
Tetsuo

688
00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:16.900
not my child
not anyone's child

689
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.933
He is a child of the Cui family

690
00:42:18.933 --> 00:42:21.500
He is the son of Master Choi Young-sik

691
00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:24.200
Of course

692
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.033
Who is talking nonsense?

693
00:42:27.033 --> 00:42:29.233
What's important about that?

694
00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:32.733
The problem is your mind

695
00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:34.167
Isn't it?

696
00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:37.433
why did you do that

697
00:42:37.433 --> 00:42:39.933
Why do you want Tetsuo to be that man's son?

698
00:42:44.433 --> 00:42:47.433
I'm doing it for Zhexiong's own good

699
00:42:47.433 --> 00:42:51.033
Tetsuo must be that person's son
to achieve something

700
00:42:53.767 --> 00:42:56.633
Is that person that great?

701
00:42:56.633 --> 00:42:59.667
Tetsuo can become a prosecutor

702
00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:01.833
I also got help from that person

703
00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:03.100
Also in the future

704
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.733
Tetsuo wants to have a place in the judiciary...

705
00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:10.367
I didn't know Tetsuo wanted to be
What an amazing person

706
00:43:10.367 --> 00:43:13.700
No, even if he wants to be president

707
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.500
His bloodline will not change

708
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.500
And it can't be changed

709
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.633

What great things can be done

Please pretend you don’t know for once

714
00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:32.767
If something happens to Tetsuo

715
00:43:32.767 --> 00:43:35.333
I don't want to live anymore

716
00:43:38.667 --> 00:43:41.000
I will fully compensate you

717
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.933
No, I will thank you profusely

You really can't do this

721
00:43:56.967 --> 00:44:01.267
Don’t you think the deceased young master is pitiful?

722
00:44:27.067 --> 00:44:29.100
Are you coming back so early?

723
00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:34.033

727
00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:41.267
what did

728
00:44:41.267 --> 00:44:44.500

729
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.100

731
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.967
it's all my fault

732
00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:53.600
But I really...

733
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.667
madam

734
00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:57.233
I really don't know anything

00:44:57.233 --> 00:44:58.667
madam

736
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:04.400
Why are you sitting here so lonely?

737
00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:07.800
Why did you finish work so early today?

738
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.467
How can I decide this?

739
00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:10.700
If you want me to come, I have to come.

740
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.967
If you want me to go, I have to go

741
00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:14.033
It all depends on the mood of the lady

742
00:45:14.633 --> 00:45:18.033
What? Did she ask you to quit your job?

743
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.533
what

744
00:45:19.533 --> 00:45:22.100
Where can I find someone with such a tight-spoken tone like me?

745
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.933
How could she fire me?

746
00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:25.533
Are you feeling unwell?

747
00:45:25.533 --> 00:45:28.000
take a rest

748
00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:30.300
Don't pack it up. Leave it alone.

749
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.000
I bought beef and came back

750
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.467
Let's have roast beef together tonight

751
00:45:34.467 --> 00:45:36.267
Eat it yourself

752
00:45:36.267 --> 00:45:38.167
I have no appetite

753
00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:42.833
what

754
00:45:42.833 --> 00:45:44.967
Beef

755
00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:46.200
Beef

756
00:45:58.433 --> 00:46:00.633
Keiko

757
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.467
uncle

758
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:04.133
Why did you come here?

759
00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:06.533
Have you been kicked out?

760
00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:11.867
Did you tell Madam what I said?

761
00:46:13.733 --> 00:46:16.567
It was all caused by my uncle

762
00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:36.933
I came back after seeing the message

763
00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:38.767
What's the matter

764
00:46:38.767 --> 00:46:40.767
I'm very busy. I need to get back to work quickly.

765
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.500
Why do you look so bad?

766
00:46:54.533 --> 00:46:56.133
Mom, are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

767
00:46:56.133 --> 00:46:58.000
Mom

768
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.100
you seem to be sick

769
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.600
Have you ever gone to the hospital for a checkup?

770
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.333
I'll take you to the hospital. Get up quickly.

771
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:06.933
Tetsuo

772
00:47:08.233 --> 00:47:10.967
Mom doesn’t need to remarry

773
00:47:10.967 --> 00:47:13.733
Mom, as long as you are there, that’s enough

774
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:16.833
OK

775
00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.367
We'll talk about these things later

776
00:47:18.367 --> 00:47:20.800
Let's go to the hospital first

777
00:47:21.533 --> 00:47:23.200
Wait

778
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.000
Tetsuo

779
00:47:28.467 --> 00:47:30.267
your biological father

780
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.567
It’s Deputy Chief Huang Zhongcheng

781
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.800
Li Zhenyu

782
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.367
You can really run

783
00:48:02.367 --> 00:48:04.567
A wanted woman who could hide for so long

784
00:48:04.567 --> 00:48:06.167
you are the first

785
00:48:06.167 --> 00:48:07.667
come with us

786
00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:12.500
let me go

787
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.800
Don't move...

788
00:48:18.067 --> 00:48:20.800
I heard two

789
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.800
They broke up because of my grandpa’s objection.

790
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.200
But this thing...

791
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.300
I don't know either

792
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.900
If it weren't for your grandpa...

793
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.533
Worried that I will be with him again
Anxious for me to marry someone else

794
00:48:36.533 --> 00:48:38.467
But…

795
00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:41.733
You can obviously hide this from me for the rest of your life

796
00:48:42.767 --> 00:48:45.133
why are you telling me now

797
00:48:47.167 --> 00:48:49.767
Because I met him again

798
00:48:50.467 --> 00:48:54.833
This is how we continue our relationship.

799
00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:58.733
He can't even recognize his own children
So pathetic

800
00:49:01.867 --> 00:49:03.500
sorry

801
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.167
I have…

802
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.467
told him

803
00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:14.267
Sorry Tetsuo

804
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.467
sorry

805
00:49:45.467 --> 00:49:47.433
Don't cry

806
00:49:47.433 --> 00:49:49.833
Sorry Tetsuo

807
00:49:51.033 --> 00:49:53.167
thank you

808
00:50:27.567 --> 00:50:28.733
Thank you for your hard work

809
00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:31.167
do you remember me

810
00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:33.967
I was the prosecutor for Choi Cheol-woong last time

811
00:50:33.967 --> 00:50:35.800
Someone from the prosecutor's office

812
00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:39.933
is…

813
00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:42.467
But why are you here today?

814
00:50:43.133 --> 00:50:44.800
Thank you for your hard work

815
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.200
Please quench your thirst first

816
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.567
He also specially asked me
Say you love drinking makgeolli

817
00:50:50.567 --> 00:50:52.600
I must buy it if you want it

818
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.133
who said that

819
00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:56.667
Prosecutor Choi said

820
00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:00.633
thank you

821
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.767
But what's the matter with you?

822
00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:16.867
It seems to be about the issue of ancestral graves in Lishui

823
00:51:17.767 --> 00:51:21.500
Anyway, you can listen to him for the details yourself.

824
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.900
Prosecutor Choi is waiting for you at the restaurant now

825
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.867
Then I'll go back to the house and change clothes.

826
00:51:26.867 --> 00:51:28.067
No need

827
00:51:29.233 --> 00:51:31.000
You go directly

828
00:51:31.833 --> 00:51:32.767
Also

829
00:51:32.767 --> 00:51:36.833
I'll take you back after you finish your meal

830
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.300
What's going on

831
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.433
Popular Prosecutor Choi

832
00:51:45.433 --> 00:51:48.067
He actually found me, a person who has no sense of existence.
Prosecutor

833
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.800
You have no sense of existence

834
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.967
I want to help you create a sense of presence

835
00:51:54.533 --> 00:51:58.767
Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong I know
Don't take care of your colleagues

836
00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:04.200
I rarely express my inner thoughts

837
00:52:04.933 --> 00:52:06.300
what is this

838
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.067
Can you let Park Ji-hwan prosecutor you?

839
00:52:08.067 --> 00:52:09.900
The Case to Become a Star Prosecutor

840
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:15.200
Sounds suspicious

841
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.733
what is the real reason

842
00:52:20.733 --> 00:52:23.500
Because we are friends who grew up together

843
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.333
It's a bit difficult to do

844
00:52:26.233 --> 00:52:27.900
Is it really just like this?

845
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.800
who is

846
00:52:34.933 --> 00:52:36.433
Li Douxue

847
00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:40.200
If you're not careful, he'll run away.

848
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.933
can you take responsibility

849
00:52:55.467 --> 00:53:01.133
"Even if the road is long and rough"

850
00:53:01.133 --> 00:53:03.900
"As long as I go with you, it doesn't matter."

851
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.200
Kiss...

852
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.800
Kiss...

853
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.633
"I'll tell you I'm happy"

854
00:53:18.633 --> 00:53:24.467
"Even if I see everything in the world"

855
00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:30.300
"The best thing is being with you"

856
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.867
"You are the one who gives me happiness"

857
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.700
Congratulations, brother

858
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.633
Brother, happy wedding trip

859
00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:42.767
Call him Special Agent. Do you want to keep calling him Big Brother?

860
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:43.900
Sister-in-law, please bear with me

861
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.000
This is because everyone is not used to it

862
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
In short, dedicated

863
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.800
Forget about business and go have some fun

864
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.400
Thank you for your bouquets

865
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.733
sorry

866
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:53.833
We dated relatively late

867
00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:55.167
But I got married before you could

868
00:53:55.167 --> 00:53:57.500
Yanzhu, you have a rather impatient personality.

869
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.500
We'll catch up with you soon

870
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.033
when coming back

871
00:54:01.033 --> 00:54:02.600
Don't come back empty-handed

872
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.433
Bring a baby back

873
00:54:04.433 --> 00:54:06.633
Really

874
00:54:07.433 --> 00:54:09.633
By the way, sister-in-law

875
00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:11.067
We specialize in…

876
00:54:11.067 --> 00:54:12.300
No experience

877
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.900
Might be a little rusty

878
00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.533
Don't argue with him

879
00:54:17.433 --> 00:54:18.433
I'm not asking you to stop talking.

880
00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:19.400
Did I say something wrong?

881
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.867
Let's go
Is that the kind of person who is in charge?

882
00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:25.300
Let's go

883
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.833
Special task: Use all your strength to suck milk

884
00:54:27.833 --> 00:54:30.467
Come on…

885
00:54:36.533 --> 00:54:39.000
After I received your call
I've been waiting for you

886
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.500
It's almost time to get off work. Do you want to go have a cup of soju together?

887
00:54:42.733 --> 00:54:44.367
No need

888
00:54:44.367 --> 00:54:46.233
I still have some unfinished work

889
00:54:47.667 --> 00:54:51.300
But why didn’t I see Coordinator Wu Wanxu?

890
00:54:54.067 --> 00:54:55.633
He has something to go out

891
00:55:02.767 --> 00:55:04.767
I heard my mother say

892
00:55:04.767 --> 00:55:06.300
you are my biological father

893
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.600
Really?

894
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.500
You must be surprised

895
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.333
Yes

896
00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:23.433
Although I still can’t believe it yet

897
00:55:23.433 --> 00:55:26.267
But I understand your situation

898
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.667
It’s not like I’m marrying a wife

899
00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:32.400
why am i so tired

900
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.767
me too

901
00:55:33.767 --> 00:55:35.133
It’s because we don’t have a girlfriend

902
00:55:35.133 --> 00:55:37.633
That’s why I’m more tired

903
00:55:37.633 --> 00:55:39.200
Who is like you

904
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.267
Hello

905
00:55:40.267 --> 00:55:41.333
Do you want to learn?

906
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.400
Yes mom

907
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.300
Your father hasn't come home yet

908
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.267
He hasn't called back for two days

909
00:55:48.267 --> 00:55:50.233
I don't know if something happened

910
00:55:50.233 --> 00:55:51.867
Probably going to Lishui

911
00:55:51.867 --> 00:55:54.433
He doesn't go to Tetsuo's house occasionally
Weeding ancestral graves

912
00:55:54.433 --> 00:55:56.700
It would be okay if that was the case

913
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.033
But how long has it been since the Cold Food Festival?

914
00:55:59.033 --> 00:56:00.500
Wait a little longer

915
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.033
We still have to prepare to move

916
00:56:04.067 --> 00:56:04.900
Jisoo Sunwoo

917
00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.067
sister-in-law

918
00:56:06.067 --> 00:56:07.867
Mom, I'll call you later

919
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.500
Douxue, from among these
Pick a suit you like

920
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.767
We'll try it on tomorrow

921
00:56:11.767 --> 00:56:14.500
Douxue, this kid...

922
00:56:24.067 --> 00:56:25.867
to be honest

923
00:56:25.867 --> 00:56:27.233
Just wear something custom-made

924
00:56:27.233 --> 00:56:28.933
I can wear an off-the-rack suit

925
00:56:28.933 --> 00:56:31.467
Hey I'm so beautiful

926
00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:33.367
No matter what dress you wear, you will be dazzling

927
00:56:33.367 --> 00:56:35.800
But you must wear customized ones

928
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.533
right

929
00:56:36.533 --> 00:56:39.300
Yes that's right

930
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.233
I…

931
00:56:41.233 --> 00:56:44.000
I can't make my groom look too bad

932
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.967
That's right

933
00:56:46.267 --> 00:56:48.067
ok

934
00:56:49.433 --> 00:56:52.300
Then let's go back first

935
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.333
You...

936
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:55.133
Have fun dating

937
00:56:56.767 --> 00:56:59.000
We probably won't go back today

938
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.800
that's better

939
00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:03.700
Then let's see Luo tomorrow

940
00:57:04.867 --> 00:57:07.333
Hey Xuanyu, you...

941
00:57:07.933 --> 00:57:09.167
Why are you making such a joke?

942
00:57:09.167 --> 00:57:11.700
So what, we are all getting married

943
00:57:13.933 --> 00:57:16.600
Are you still afraid that I will eat you?

944
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.600
not like that

945
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.167
But I have face to take care of in front of my men.

946
00:57:21.167 --> 00:57:22.967
Hello Li Douxue

947
00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:25.667
How dare you show face in front of me?

948
00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:27.700
I won't mention it

949
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.833
good

950
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:31.633
The deceased had no ID on him

951
00:57:31.633 --> 00:57:33.667
I can wear anything
Judging from the bruises and wounds on his body

952
00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:36.533
I like this style
Maybe there was a car accident

953
00:57:36.533 --> 00:57:39.000
The police concluded that the victim may have been
Hit by a hit-and-run vehicle

954
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.567
Wait
Looking for witnesses

955
00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:43.400
Since the incident is estimated to occur in the middle of the night

956
00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.167
The police encountered difficulties in collecting evidence

957
00:57:45.167 --> 00:57:47.533
He forgot to take the cigarette away

958
00:57:47.533 --> 00:57:49.333
I'll take it to him right away

959
00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:51.700
Police in the dead man's pocket

960
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.000
White pine cigarettes and matchbox found

961
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.433
What's wrong

962
00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:58.067
The first person to find the remains said

963
00:57:58.067 --> 00:58:00.167
The deceased had severe head injuries...

964
00:58:00.167 --> 00:58:01.567
Douxue

965
00:58:01.567 --> 00:58:02.533
Li Douxue

966
00:58:02.533 --> 00:58:04.633
You wait

967
00:58:04.633 --> 00:58:06.800
where are you going what happened

968
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.700
I need to confirm something

969
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.400
I'll call you again. You go back first.

970
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.000
Isn't this all because of dad?

971
00:59:24.533 --> 00:59:27.167
Dad, please tell me

972
00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:29.633
Everything is as you wish

973
00:59:29.633 --> 00:59:31.800
You asked me not to study, so I didn’t study.

974
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.333
You want me to go to jail and I will go to jail too

975
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.067
After being released from prison

976
00:59:38.067 --> 00:59:42.000
All I can do is be a gangster

977
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.100
If you don't even let me do this

978
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.200
Or do you want me to die?

979
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.433
I want to…

980
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.500
I'm definitely not my father's son

981
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.667
Looks like a hit and run accident.

982
01:00:10.833 --> 01:00:12.900
It seems he was hit by a large car

983
01:00:13.733 --> 01:00:17.867
We are near there
Looking for residents who witnessed the scene

984
01:00:27.933 --> 01:00:29.300
Hey Dou Xue?

985
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.967
what happened

986
01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:33.000
Is it related to the news just now?

987
01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.667
My dad passed away

988
01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.567
what did you say

989
01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:45.233
Uncle?

990
01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:48.200
Yes

991
01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:17.033
"Can I come back to you again?"

992
01:01:17.033 --> 01:01:20.233
"trembling eyes"

993
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:24.300
"Looks more sad"

994
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.900
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

995
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.033
(Oasis)

996
01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:32.967
Douxue

997
01:01:32.967 --> 01:01:33.833
Tetsuo

998
01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:34.900
Actually…

999
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.733
Choi Cheol-woong’s mother is remarrying

1000
01:01:36.733 --> 01:01:38.700
Her remarriage partner is Huang Zhongcheng

1001
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.500
what

1002
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.400
Please sever ties with Li Douxue

1003
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.400
I will also sever ties with him

1004
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400
Tetsuo

1005
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.933
Please leave me and Douxue alone

1006
01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:47.933
You were arrested on suspicion of violent crimes

1007
01:01:47.933 --> 01:01:49.367
I don't need to get married

1008
01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:50.900
You must rescue Douxue

1009
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.433
Never lose Wu Dingchen

1010
01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:56.467
Li Douxue will definitely go to Wu Dingchen

1011
01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:57.533
Let go of the hostages

1012
01:01:57.533 --> 01:01:58.433
let go

1013
01:01:58.433 --> 01:02:00.867
Or I'll shoot you
