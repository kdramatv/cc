00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:09.200
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.433
Oh my god Tetsuo

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.867
Uncle, Tetsuo is back

4
00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:25.633
you are back

5
00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:38.967
Tetsuo

6
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.767
Your father is so pitiful

7
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
Your father is so pitiful

8
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.667
Your father is so pitiful

9
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.300
Your dad...

10
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.867
Your father is so pitiful

11
00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:00.367
So pathetic…

12
00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:02.833
Tetsuo

13
00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.200
(Episode 6)

14
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:31.533
You must be very sad

15
00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.867
Your father is a local elder

16
00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.200
We truly mourn him...

17
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.667
What you should do is not mourn

18
00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.133
Is she apologizing to him?

19
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.333
How

20
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.200
Did I say something wrong?

21
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.600
He has withdrawn from the election

22
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.333
They also used violation of election laws as an excuse to arrest him.

23
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.200
People who didn't let him sleep for several nights

24
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.833
Isn't it you?

25
00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:57.533
Tetsuo, you seem to have some misunderstanding...

26
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.567
Misunderstanding?

27
00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:02.267
My father has always regarded honor as his life.

28
00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:04.967
How painful it must be for him

29
00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:08.133
Only then would he drink alcohol for several months until he fell ill.

30
00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.000
Let's go

31
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.133
thank you for coming

32
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.533
I will definitely do the same in the future...

33
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.100
Go to your mourning hall to express condolences

34
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.233
Not long ago, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department called us

35
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.467
He said that someone in our village was admitted to a Korean university

36
00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.500
Students who also entertained guests to celebrate

37
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.800
Should I study or not?

38
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.367
Run to become a communist and hold anti-government demonstrations

39
00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.700
and

40
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.533
He also said that if that person appeared in the village

41
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.867
You can catch him at any time

42
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.167
Mom

43
00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:56.233
Mom

44
00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:59.933
You have worked hard for the people, Director.

45
00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.700
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule

46
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.633
Still taking the time to come over

47
00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.633
Our family is having a funeral now

48
00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:10.767
What should I do if there is no bereaved person?

49
00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.000
I will advise him well

50
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.933
Please forgive him, sir.

51
00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:18.533
please

52
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.533
Be careful next time

53
00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:37.267
Your dad...

54
00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.933
Want me to give this to you after the funeral

55
00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.033
Tetsuo

56
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.733
It's because my father is not upright enough
That's why we ended up like this

57
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:58.400
But I've never done anything where I couldn't see anyone

58
00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.100
You must not try to help me take revenge

59
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.300
Just take good care of mom

60
00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:15.933
Dad asked me not to take revenge in his suicide note

61
00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:20.233
But mom...

62
00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.567
Why does that sentence ring in my ears?

63
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:26.733
It sounds like you're begging me
I must avenge him

64
00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:31.500
Me

65
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:35.433
It took a lot of effort to get here

66
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.067
I will become stronger

67
00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.800
After becoming stronger

68
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.467
Let those who wronged Dad

69
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:51.367
Let the guys who made me so miserable

70
00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.167
feel twice as much

71
00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:54.667
the pain we have suffered

72
00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:01.300
My son has grown up

73
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.000
And…

74
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.833
I will protect the people around me

75
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.733
Stop being bullied by people

76
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.833
what do you mean now

77
00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:22.200
Do you want me to help you find someone?

78
00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:29.233
Please help me once, Mediator

79
00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:32.667
Our company only deals with national security issues
related business

80
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:37.333
We are not a credit reporting agency that helps find people.

81
00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:41.000
Company…

82
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.100
Don’t you help when you see your own people in trouble?

83
00:05:57.533 --> 00:06:01.067
I will be loyal to you

84
00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:04.700
please help me once

85
00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.667
are you sincere

86
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.467
Really?

87
00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:15.767
what should i do

88
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.633
He is so innocent

89
00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:19.933
help him

90
00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:21.067
I know

91
00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:28.533
(film distribution contract)

92
00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:31.800
Auntie, how long are you going to hold on?

93
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.567
no time

94
00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:35.400
Call the police

95
00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:38.233
Yes boss

96
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:41.100
Save people first and then talk about it

97
00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.167
Call the police and they can't find her

98
00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.767
You believe my words

99
00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:52.900
He also knew that if he dared to hurt Dingchen

100
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.033
Don't even think about hanging around in this circle.

101
00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:56.067
aunt
boss

102
00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:01.200
You…

103
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.367
Call Che Jinyu now

104
00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:04.533
Ask her to save you

105
00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:07.367
Just ask her to save you

106
00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.800
I will let you go back immediately, do you understand?

107
00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:18.567
If you kneel down and beg me

108
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:20.900
I can think about it for three seconds

109
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.533
Shit Boss

110
00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:27.833
I told you I'm not a poop...

111
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:30.967
Bong Joon

112
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:32.467
Yes eldest brother

113
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:36.700
Do you know a pimp?
Of course

114
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.133
Yes
Of course there is

115
00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:46.700
Hello

116
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.267
it's me

117
00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:50.433
Found it

118
00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:54.867
where is she

119
00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:58.333
In Osan, Gyeonggi-do

120
00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.967
The police are coming over now

121
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.433
Do you want to come along?

122
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.067
But…

123
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.500
How did you find it so quickly?

124
00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:10.333
Boss Bian recently bought a toy

125
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:12.800
That thing can be positioned

126
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.000
Because that thing is rare in Korea

127
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
He probably didn't know that thing could be located

128
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.667
car boss

129
00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.100
I can't stop it anymore...

130
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.367
My little brothers

131
00:08:31.067 --> 00:08:34.867
Listen, I only give you five minutes

132
00:08:34.867 --> 00:08:38.367
Otherwise, Miss Wu will die because of you.

133
00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:39.633
Did you hear that?

134
00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:55.500
After talking for so long, the phone bill will be very expensive.

135
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.867
That's right

136
00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:04.267
what did he say

137
00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:07.633
That guy…

138
00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:09.933
More difficult than imagined

139
00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.400
It's unpredictable

140
00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:16.533
Auntie, Dingchen is not here anyway

141
00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:17.967
Theaters will also be taken away

142
00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:21.067
That's right. Keep the person in charge of the branch.

143
00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:24.967
Only then can I fight him again.

144
00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:26.267
Really?

145
00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.167
aunt
boss

146
00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:34.533
aunt
boss

147
00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:51.467
(film distribution contract)

148
00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:54.333
Big brother

149
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.033
I got a call from Busan

150
00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:57.567
They said take her there

151
00:09:57.567 --> 00:10:01.000
They can buy her for ten years

152
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.233
Do you want to leave now?

153
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.167
ruthless woman

154
00:10:11.467 --> 00:10:12.733
Let's go

155
00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:14.000
Yes eldest brother

156
00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:17.867
Wait...

157
00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:23.600
Hello

158
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.100
Let Wu Dingchen...

159
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.000
come back

160
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.633
Oops, Mr. Che

161
00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:35.167
If it's any later, something will happen to her.

162
00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:38.100
We are about to leave

163
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.367
No…

164
00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:42.500
Can you hear it?

165
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.867
Can you hear it?

166
00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:46.200
Is Dingchen okay?

167
00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:51.833
Then…

168
00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:54.167
I'll send someone to get the contract

169
00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:01.467
OK

170
00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:03.067
It's over

171
00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:05.067
It's over

172
00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.733
Bong Joon

173
00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.133
Yes eldest brother

174
00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.333
You…

175
00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:11.900
Go back to Seoul first

176
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.167
Go get the contract first

177
00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.700
Yes eldest brother

178
00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:26.767
Let's go

179
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.633
what to do

180
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:35.100
i won

181
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.867
I am Bian Yangdou

182
00:11:56.167 --> 00:11:57.333
Don't move

183
00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:00.300
hands up

184
00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:03.333
what is that sound

185
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.700
Don't move
Catch them all

186
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.967
who are you

187
00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:26.133
What to see

188
00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:33.433
What are you doing?

189
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.033
Dingchen

190
00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.633
Hey you brat

191
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.267
are you okay

192
00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:53.300
You're not hurt, are you?

193
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.233
Put down the chair and raise your hands to your head

194
00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.433
Yes sir

195
00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:59.067
Kneel down
Yes sir

196
00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:00.900
What?

197
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.600
how do you know i'm here

198
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.300
I asked the CIA

199
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.400
Didn't expect I was so famous

200
00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:12.533
thank you

201
00:13:12.533 --> 00:13:14.233
safe and sound

202
00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:18.033
Why are you doing this?

203
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:22.200
you listen to me

204
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.333
Don't go

205
00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:24.900
Wait...

206
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.833
wait a moment

207
00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:27.933
Hello…

208
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:29.833
You…

209
00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:43.833
Great shit boss

210
00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:45.533
Miss, you can't do this

211
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.967
thank you

212
00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:50.267
I'll take over your theater

213
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.833
Don't do this

214
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.267
It hurts

215
00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:07.633
South Korea's CIA moves really quickly

216
00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:09.733
South Korea’s CIA…

217
00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:10.933
what is that

218
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.833
Security and Enterprise Department, you bastard

219
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.167
Security and Enterprise Department

220
00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:18.533
We searched for so long but couldn't find it

221
00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:20.733
How did they find it so quickly?

222
00:14:20.733 --> 00:14:23.467
If you know, we'll go find it ourselves, you brat.

223
00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:25.367
are you okay

224
00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:27.567
I thought I was going to die

225
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.267
I really thought I was going to die

226
00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:45.400
It's okay. It's okay now.

227
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:59.667
"Can I ever get close to you again?"

228
00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:02.769
"Your trembling eyes"

229
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.273
"Looks more sad"

230
00:15:07.292 --> 00:15:08.859
Dingchen

231
00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:12.000
You…

232
00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:15.700
Runny nose

233
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.167
what

234
00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:22.900
Are you looking for death?

235
00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:25.733
It will hurt...
Still so fond of joking

236
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.333
"Would it make a difference?"

237
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.900
"It's useless to say anything"

238
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.667
Why are you doing this?

239
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.833
Then this...

240
00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:54.467
It should be ok

241
00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:58.633
Okay, they are friends after all

242
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:02.467
No one knows what will happen in the future

243
00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.733
What's more...

244
00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:06.467
I'm your savior

245
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.667
Yes that's right

246
00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:11.333
But you better not go too far

247
00:16:14.067 --> 00:16:15.567
Let's go

248
00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:19.433
"Your trembling eyes are unbearable to see."

249
00:16:19.433 --> 00:16:22.967
"On a stormy sky"

250
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:27.133
"My floating heart"

251
00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:36.500
"This is the only way to carve your name"

252
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.833
(Trustworthy Seoul Police)

253
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:42.833
Branch manager

254
00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:45.267
I thought you were going to die, bitch

255
00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:46.700
Thank you for your hard work

256
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.367
I heard you told Boss Shit to kill me.

257
00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:54.300
It's better if you're not dead

258
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300
And…

259
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.533
You won't die that easily

260
00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:02.167
Person in charge, don’t be too sad

261
00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:04.667
Even though the boss said that

262
00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.500
But to save you

263
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.400
She was ready to give up the theater

264
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.233
Really

265
00:17:12.267 --> 00:17:14.633
If you don’t believe it, you can look at the contract

266
00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:18.333
Boss, you did something wrong

267
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:19.433
what does it mean

268
00:17:19.433 --> 00:17:21.900
This is what I'm risking my life for

269
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.100
So this contract is more important than my life

270
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.400
Even if I really die
You can't stamp it either

271
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.300
what

272
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.600
I say it again

273
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.233
Some of the shares here belong to me.

274
00:17:34.233 --> 00:17:37.567
Boss, you can't decide on your own

275
00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:39.733
You can only decide your own life or death

276
00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:41.467
My life and death must be decided by me

277
00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:43.467
Wu Dingchen decides by himself

278
00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.033
You vicious woman

279
00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.833
Anyway...this time it's my life on the line

280
00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:51.100
We just ate Mingxingye

281
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.533
So shares…

282
00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:53.900
You need to redistribute it.

283
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.600
From now on, I will become a shareholder of Gyeongjiang area business.

284
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.367
I take six

285
00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:01.433
You take four

286
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.533
what did you say

287
00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:07.167
person in charge

288
00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:10.233
You can't do this to your boss

289
00:18:10.233 --> 00:18:11.633
Otherwise…

290
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.000
I'll go out on my own

291
00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:14.967
what

292
00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:17.467
Dingchen

293
00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:20.267
How is it

294
00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:21.567
Do you want me to go out on my own?

295
00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:23.733
Are you confident you can beat me in the Jingjiang area?

296
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.400
I knew it would be like this

297
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.033
Gao Standing Committee
Yes

298
00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:37.700
What I said to Boss Bian is absolutely correct, right?

299
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.067
I knew she would betray me

300
00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:42.933
So be it

301
00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:46.700
Otherwise, just go to the theater in Jeolla Province
Give it to you too

302
00:18:47.067 --> 00:18:48.033
boss

303
00:18:48.033 --> 00:18:49.933
But I have a condition

304
00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.600
You…

305
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.033
Be my daughter

306
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.100
If you want to play, just play in the palm of my hand

307
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.233
Only then will I pass on my career to you.

308
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.833
Go back

309
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:04.267
Yes

310
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.600
Don't think about it for too long

311
00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:25.600
That...boss

312
00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.400
old…boss

313
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.800
I'm not deaf. Why?

314
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.000
You want to ask me if I really want to make a career
Is inheritance given to Dingchen?

315
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.367
Yes

316
00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:41.667
Although I don’t read much

317
00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:45.400
But I know two famous people who have knelt down with others.

318
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.433
One of them is Heungseon Daewonjun

319
00:19:47.433 --> 00:19:49.867
Gaozong's father

320
00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:53.467
The other is the Han Dynasty of China
A great general named Han Xin

321
00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:57.733
Of course I know, Mr. Xingxuan Dayuan

322
00:19:57.733 --> 00:19:59.933
But that Chinese general

323
00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.433
I don't know him

324
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.833
I don't expect you to know me either

325
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:10.533
Anyway, what do they have in common?

326
00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:12.567
They all lose their strength

327
00:20:12.567 --> 00:20:15.700
In order to prevent your opponent from killing you

328
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.767
Deliberately showing weakness to make the other party put down their guard

329
00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:20.133
They are trying to escape death temporarily

330
00:20:20.133 --> 00:20:22.967
Recharge your batteries

331
00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:24.967
Only then did he pretend to kneel down with his opponent

332
00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:30.233
So insincere

333
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.867
On the battlefield of life and death
What's the use of sincerity

334
00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:36.767
They all have to be lied to

335
00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:41.867
So did anyone else fall for their trick?

336
00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:43.833
Of course there is

337
00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:46.233
Those people are all dead

338
00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:47.867
Oh my god

339
00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:50.433
What a terrible person

340
00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:53.300
So this tells us

341
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.233
Don't trust people who kneel down easily

342
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.033
So kneel down

343
00:21:03.033 --> 00:21:05.167
It's a sign that he's going to deceive people.

344
00:21:05.167 --> 00:21:06.867
Really?

345
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.300
Wait

346
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.933
So the person in charge of the branch also wants to lie to you...

347
00:21:13.933 --> 00:21:16.633
You are so...

348
00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:18.067
sorry

349
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.600
I call a child like that my adopted daughter

350
00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:26.433
Do you think she will accept my offer?

351
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.300
Really

352
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.600
She just contradicted you like that

353
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.767
I think she won't accept it

354
00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:41.200
Then she wants to start a war with me

355
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.833
Wait a little longer

356
00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:47.033
Do you know Choi Young-sik?
Yes

357
00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:50.200
Then you also know Choi Cheol Woong Ra

358
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.633
hello

359
00:21:51.633 --> 00:21:54.400
Do you know Jiang Ruzhen’s son?

360
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.233
Yeah

361
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.633
(Dean Luo Yaoquan)

362
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.400
Do you know Choi Young-sik?

363
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:06.533
Yes

364
00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:08.300
Let me see his medical records

365
00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:24.533
Sorry

366
00:22:26.967 --> 00:22:28.433
who are you

367
00:22:30.633 --> 00:22:32.033
I'm from the prosecutor's office

368
00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:33.633
Do you know Choi Cheol-woong?

369
00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:38.900
Did Tetsuo do something wrong?

370
00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:41.767
No

371
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.367
It's because he's going to be officially appointed as a judge
Prosecutor

372
00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:47.700
Because he is someone who has important work to do

373
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.800
Before that we have to treat him carefully
Do a net worth survey

374
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.267
And…

375
00:22:53.267 --> 00:22:55.367
Please don't tell Choi Cheol-woong about this

376
00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:58.533
Otherwise it may affect his promotion

377
00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:00.500
OK…

378
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.067
I heard about your family

379
00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:06.667
Very close to Choi Young-sik’s family

380
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.800
Yes

381
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.533
Choi Cheol-woong except when he was in high school

382
00:23:11.533 --> 00:23:13.867
In addition to being fined for hitting someone

383
00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:16.733
Have you committed any other crimes?

384
00:23:17.467 --> 00:23:19.733
No not at all

385
00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:20.700
Really?

386
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.300
Then he has mental disorder
Have you been to the doctor?

387
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.033
have you heard of it

388
00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:29.533
Oh my God, I can't find it anywhere.

389
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.467
A child as smart and upright as him

390
00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:34.300
Of course I've never heard of that.

391
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.667
Really?

392
00:23:36.367 --> 00:23:38.600
Then Choi Cheol-woong…

393
00:23:41.467 --> 00:23:44.500
Is he Choi Young-sik’s biological son?

394
00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:52.567
This...what does this mean...

395
00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:56.600
It doesn't matter if he is adopted

396
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.533
That won't change them as father and son
legal relationship

397
00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:08.167
You can safely tell me the truth

398
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.133
He...he...

399
00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:15.467
He is his biological son, yes

400
00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:16.900
Husband

401
00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:21.667
I have lived in their house almost all my life

402
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:24.467
What kind of ridiculous question are you asking?

403
00:24:24.467 --> 00:24:26.267
Choi Cheol-woong…

404
00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:28.067
He is Choi Young-sik’s biological son

405
00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:36.500
Really?

406
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.133
I'm not doubting them

407
00:24:39.767 --> 00:24:42.733
I'm asking to confirm personnel information.

408
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.067
Choi Cheol-woong is Choi Young-sik’s biological son

409
00:24:47.833 --> 00:24:49.167
thank you

410
00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:50.667
Goodbye then

411
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.533
Wait... Excuse me...

412
00:24:55.533 --> 00:24:58.533
Is Tetsuo okay?

413
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.767
Of course

414
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.733
This can't go on like this

415
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.600
what does it mean

416
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.867
In case the lie is exposed in the future

417
00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:29.533
What should I do if Tetsuo is personally threatened?

418
00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.833
As long as the two of us don't speak

419
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:34.133
who would know that

420
00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:36.933
Who can predict the world?

421
00:25:36.933 --> 00:25:39.000
And we haven't committed any crime

422
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.367
Is it time to let Tetsuo know?

423
00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:43.433
what are you talking nonsense

424
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:45.367
We promised the deceased uncle and young master

425
00:25:45.367 --> 00:25:48.600
And the lady will never tell anything about it.

426
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.033
And…

427
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:56.633
That would make Douxue and Tetsuo...

428
00:25:56.633 --> 00:25:58.167
becomes more complex

429
00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:00.567
what does that mean

430
00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:03.800
they know they are brothers
Will definitely be happier

431
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.400
And I want to hear it from my kids too
call me mom

432
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.300
I can't do it if I say no

433
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.800
Why bring up things that happened decades ago?
Create strife

434
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.933
The agreement you made with me may be very important.

435
00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:21.600
but i'm really sad

436
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.100
It was obviously the child I gave birth to in ten months of pregnancy
But I haven’t even been called “Mom”

437
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.767
Every time I see him holding that
The vixen-like woman calls her mother

438
00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:34.533
I'm so angry

439
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.200
Don't do this

440
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.067
I'm not asking them to give us money.
Or give us land

441
00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:46.033
I just hope that when Tetsuo is with us

442
00:26:46.033 --> 00:26:50.367
We only know that we are his biological father and mother

443
00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:51.700
Stop talking

444
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.300
That way after I die

445
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.567
What kind of face should I use to see the master and the young master?

446
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.833
Marry such a stubborn guy
it's my fault

447
00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:12.500
If anyone knew

448
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.500
We have a son who is a prosecutor
How much everyone will envy us

449
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.333
Really

450
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.533
I want to…

451
00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:31.933
Choi Cheol-woong should not be Choi Young-sik’s biological son

452
00:27:32.833 --> 00:27:35.200
Since Choi Young-sik’s father was still alive

453
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.167
Li Zhonghao, who works as a long-term worker in their family
Firmly deny

454
00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:42.167
But his wife's secret was discovered
panicked look

455
00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:44.367
so now

456
00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:49.633
As long as you get Choi Young-sik before her marriage
Is it enough to have a record of going to the hospital for treatment?

457
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.033
Because it was recorded a long time ago

458
00:27:51.033 --> 00:27:52.667
It may take a while to find

459
00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:55.167
Thank you for your hard work

460
00:27:55.167 --> 00:27:56.567
No

461
00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:01.267
I…

462
00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:03.200
Can I take the liberty to ask you a question?

463
00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:07.433
Yes, just like you thought

464
00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:09.400
I'm also troubled now

465
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.933
sorry

466
00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:24.500
Why didn't your father come with you?

467
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.800
Dad is very busy because of the theater

468
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.000
He said he would definitely come with him next time

469
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Lie

470
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.133
Your father promised me to go to Jeju Island with me
Didn't go either

471
00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:38.433
He also said that he would invite me to Mokpo to eat fish.

472
00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:39.300
Lie

473
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.333
he always lies

474
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:47.833
Mom

475
00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:51.233
Dad…

476
00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:53.233
Dad has...

477
00:28:57.733 --> 00:28:59.767
Dad didn't lie

478
00:29:00.367 --> 00:29:03.867
He said the next time he comes to see you
I will fulfill those promises in one fell swoop

479
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:05.733
No

480
00:29:05.733 --> 00:29:11.000
Your father has been lying to you too

481
00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:13.800
I peeked at your letter

482
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:16.933
What letter

483
00:29:16.933 --> 00:29:18.733
your friend's letter

484
00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:22.200
Your friend who killed someone

485
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.467
You tell him not to go to him

486
00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:28.600
He still went to find him

487
00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:33.267
I don't care what you say

488
00:29:34.933 --> 00:29:37.700
The unchanging fact is…

489
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.933
You're more like a prison than here

490
00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:45.667
Please let me go

491
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.767
I mean it

492
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.900
That fool

493
00:29:58.633 --> 00:29:59.433
Brother Dou Xue

494
00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:00.833
Coming

495
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.100
Brother Douxue, who is that person?

496
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.267
Why does the eldest brother bow to him?

497
00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:09.633
He doesn't look like a man from the road.

498
00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:12.100
Terrible person, very rich person

499
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.367
Or maybe he owes him a favor
Probably one of them

500
00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:17.500
Really? I hope he's not a terrible person.

501
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.400
Yes

502
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.133
But…

503
00:30:20.133 --> 00:30:23.100
When you go out to hang out, you will always meet the people you least want to meet.

504
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.567
Brother Douxue, why are you so negative?

505
00:30:25.567 --> 00:30:27.900
You have to say that...

506
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.400
It's okay

507
00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:31.467
Let's go

508
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.133
loyalty

509
00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.200
You seem to have something good going on

510
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.800
Of course

511
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.900
Take a look

512
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.267
These people really have nothing to do

513
00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:46.533
Seoul will soon host the Asian Games
and Olympic Games

514
00:30:46.533 --> 00:30:47.967
Such a world-class event

515
00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:49.800
Can the country maintain its reputation like this?

516
00:30:50.633 --> 00:30:53.767
These ignorant guys

517
00:30:53.767 --> 00:30:57.967
The country is ready
Generous compensation and supporting measures

518
00:30:57.967 --> 00:31:01.500
Those residents are greedy
want to get more money

519
00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:06.333
The owner moved out without saying anything.

520
00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:08.000
How about just letting those people stay there?

521
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.033
The other party will notify us in the next few days.

522
00:31:12.033 --> 00:31:14.500
Just leave as few manpower in the store as possible
Ask everyone else to stand by

523
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.867
Do you know

524
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.567
(Households are also human beings and demand protection of their right to survival)

525
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:33.467
Hehe...

526
00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:35.200
scared me

527
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.867
Hehe...

528
00:31:39.033 --> 00:31:41.600
Young man, let’s eat some kimchi.

529
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.800
Delicious

530
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.333
Very delicious
Right...

531
00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.233
Do you want another bite?

532
00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:50.300
Over there is Mingdang 2-dong

533
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.067
In front of you is the famous 3rd hole.

534
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.033
The area we are responsible for is the 3rd hole.

535
00:31:57.167 --> 00:32:00.400
So will everything here be turned into apartment buildings?

536
00:32:01.233 --> 00:32:03.733
Oh my god, that's amazing.

537
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.767
I wonder if those people have gone anywhere

538
00:32:08.033 --> 00:32:12.133
Those people after the Korean War
Just build houses everywhere to live in

539
00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:13.567
Finally settled in this place

540
00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:17.133
Anyway, the government will provide compensation

541
00:32:17.133 --> 00:32:18.967
They will always find a place to live

542
00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:21.900
Big brother

543
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.733
What's wrong

544
00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:25.067
to be honest

545
00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:28.400
If our gangs were fighting each other

546
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.633
I think it doesn't matter

547
00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:34.267
But these residents…

548
00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:36.900
What's wrong? Do you have a bad conscience?

549
00:32:41.333 --> 00:32:42.600
can't you do it

550
00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:46.967
Yes, I hope you can think about it again.

551
00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:49.433
That's it

552
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.067
Yes, you may indeed think that

553
00:32:53.067 --> 00:32:54.633
I can understand too

554
00:32:57.433 --> 00:32:58.967
Douxue

555
00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:05.100
It seems you are far from being a gangster.

556
00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:09.900
These residents should find a place to stay

557
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900
Just have to move somewhere far away

558
00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:14.967
stop talking

559
00:33:14.967 --> 00:33:17.367
We now have the energy to spare
Do you care about the plight of others?

560
00:33:17.367 --> 00:33:19.900
I heard that gangs have been fighting each other for several years.

561
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.900
The money you make is not as big as this one.

562
00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:25.533
Maybe we can turn our destiny around this time

563
00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:27.033
Please don't think too much, just do it

564
00:33:27.033 --> 00:33:28.167
ok

565
00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:30.800
But it still makes my nose sore

566
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.600
What else should I do?

567
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.433
Do you want to go back to the ballpark and sell tickets to scalpers?

568
00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:37.867
I felt relatively comfortable at that time.

569
00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:40.033
You stinky boy

570
00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:42.267
Abominable

571
00:33:42.267 --> 00:33:44.000
Why do you keep hitting me on the head?

572
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.467
I'm stimulating you and asking you to use your brain

573
00:33:46.467 --> 00:33:48.767
The situation of those people will not change

574
00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:49.767
if we don't

575
00:33:49.767 --> 00:33:51.600
Someone else will take over

576
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.000
Douxue, am I right?

577
00:33:59.433 --> 00:34:01.200
So annoying

578
00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:16.233
Brother, you've been waiting for a long time, right?

579
00:34:16.233 --> 00:34:17.300
Let's go quickly

580
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.967
what do you want to say

581
00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:22.567
Brother, why are you so impatient?

582
00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:24.933
I want to report back to you
Investigation results of Dingchen kidnapping incident

583
00:34:24.933 --> 00:34:27.533
By the way, celebrate the success of our cooperation

584
00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:28.533
Kill two birds with one stone

585
00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.767
What's there to celebrate?

586
00:34:31.533 --> 00:34:34.800
Please help us get the pre-booked package A

587
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.033
Okay, three of them, right?
Sorry to trouble you

588
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.400
yes

589
00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:42.733
What's up? Is anyone else coming?

590
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.500
Yes, it’s the sponsor who invited us to dinner today.

591
00:34:50.167 --> 00:34:52.067
You brat

592
00:34:52.067 --> 00:34:55.233
He's just a newbie trainee
I've already learned bad things.

593
00:34:55.233 --> 00:34:57.900
Hey, I’ll treat you to this meal

594
00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.300
Let’s eat fried noodles

595
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.800
Brother Douxue, why are you like this?

596
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.333
The golden owner is very good

597
00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:05.433
It's okay to have a meal with her

598
00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:08.000
Let’s replenish our body today, okay?

599
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.767
You stinky boy is really...

600
00:35:09.767 --> 00:35:10.900
Hello

601
00:35:11.533 --> 00:35:13.367
Eat it yourself

602
00:35:20.033 --> 00:35:21.300
Li Douxue

603
00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:24.900
Hello…

604
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.567
What's wrong

605
00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:28.267
Let her treat her

606
00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:30.133
Eat it yourself

607
00:35:30.133 --> 00:35:31.733
you sit down

608
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.033
Didn’t you say you never avoided me?

609
00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:38.433
Eating at the same table with gangsters

610
00:35:38.433 --> 00:35:39.767
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

611
00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:42.833
I don't feel uncomfortable

612
00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:44.233
I just feel you are pitiful

613
00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:46.767
What are you two doing standing in front of the dining table?

614
00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:48.833
Stop being in a stalemate. Sit down.

615
00:35:48.833 --> 00:35:51.867
It's been a long time since the three of us got together.

616
00:35:51.867 --> 00:35:53.467
Let's eat, okay?

617
00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:06.533
Oh my God, seeing these dishes

618
00:36:06.533 --> 00:36:08.000
It reminds me of the past

619
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.167
Didn’t I meet Brother Dou Xue once?
Do you want Dingchen to be ranked among the top 200 in the school?

620
00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:15.767
So Dingchen’s father
Just treat us to Chinese food

621
00:36:15.767 --> 00:36:17.367
Do you still remember that incident?

622
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.633
Do you drink like a little hooligan?

623
00:36:22.633 --> 00:36:25.067
Stop being cool and eat some side dishes.

624
00:36:25.067 --> 00:36:26.100
Yes, Brother Douxue

625
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.733
Eat and see. It's delicious.

626
00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:31.200
Damn...

627
00:36:32.433 --> 00:36:34.533
you sit down

628
00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:36.100
I have something to tell you

629
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.000
Yes, Brother Douxue

630
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.600
Let's talk

631
00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:49.667
Okay, my poor rascal.

632
00:36:49.667 --> 00:36:52.133
Already accepted your charity

633
00:36:52.133 --> 00:36:53.700
I'm leaving

634
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.600
Brother, why do you speak so harshly?

635
00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:01.767
Please eat more food
It's not enough to express my gratitude.

636
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.167
Dingchen

637
00:37:04.167 --> 00:37:06.067
What happened when you were kidnapped by Boss Bian?

638
00:37:06.067 --> 00:37:07.300
This news…

639
00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:11.833
Brother Douxue told me

640
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.800
And his attitude at the time
Very urgent and impatient

641
00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:19.200
Hello Cui Zhexiong

642
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.300
What's wrong

643
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.000
I'm not wrong

644
00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:24.700
That's why I can find you

645
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.267
But your life can be said to be
Brother Douxue picked it up

646
00:37:31.633 --> 00:37:32.867
is this true

647
00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:35.500
No, he's all talking nonsense

648
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600
Stop lying

649
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.700
Are you some kind of daddy-long-legs?

650
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.133
Dingchen, even though Brother Douxue said that

651
00:37:44.133 --> 00:37:49.533
In fact, he is always hovering around you

652
00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:51.133
Have you talked enough?

653
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.400
There is a reason why I invited you here today

654
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.267
Because I don't want to be a scumbag anymore

655
00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:03.367
Dingchen

656
00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:05.933
I want to pursue you again

657
00:38:05.933 --> 00:38:08.633
This time is different from the youthful and frivolous days in high school

658
00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.453
I'll bet my life

659
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.467
So Brother Douxue

660
00:38:14.467 --> 00:38:17.633
You should stop pretending to be a bad guy and hide from Dingchen.

661
00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:19.267
Compete with me openly

662
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.067
Brat, you really are...

663
00:38:24.533 --> 00:38:26.367
Are you kidding me?

664
00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:29.400
Am I a snack to satisfy your cravings?

665
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.467
Why do you get mad at me when you have nothing to do?

666
00:38:32.467 --> 00:38:34.000
Are you my saviors?

667
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.300
Hello

668
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.267
Even without you
I won't die so easily

669
00:38:38.267 --> 00:38:41.433
And we are no longer
I was a teenage high school student in Lishui back then.

670
00:38:41.433 --> 00:38:45.100
Please, it’s time for you to grow up, right?

671
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.867
Today's dinner is considered charity from me.

672
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.833
Just enjoy it, both of you.

673
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.533
That's how charming Dingchen is

674
00:38:58.533 --> 00:38:59.767
right

675
00:38:59.767 --> 00:39:03.233
Stop making such jokes

676
00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:04.333
I warn you

677
00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:05.900
I don't care

678
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.600
I'll keep doing this

679
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.100
I want to keep doing this

680
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.067
keep competing with you

681
00:39:12.067 --> 00:39:14.400
Make Dingchen my woman

682
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.500
you are simply crazy

683
00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:58.267
It's too shabby for the gangster Douxue to live, right?

684
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.533
You...what do you want to do?

685
00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:02.567
What do you think?

686
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:04.933
You made it impossible for me to have dinner

687
00:40:04.933 --> 00:40:06.700
you are responsible

688
00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:12.300
I'm starving. Let's prepare dinner.

689
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.167
How could you...

690
00:40:13.167 --> 00:40:16.833
Douxue, is she your girlfriend?

691
00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:18.067
Yes

692
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.600
Eat

693
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.367
How can you serve me with these meals?

694
00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:29.733
This is how I usually eat

695
00:40:29.733 --> 00:40:31.300
Go fry a poached egg

696
00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:33.533
I don't have such a thing at home

697
00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:35.100
It turns out you are not a gangster, but a beggar.

698
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.767
You are really too good

699
00:40:37.767 --> 00:40:40.500
Oh, your eyes are too fierce, right?

700
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.400
Really, a beautiful lady came to my house as a guest.

701
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.200
How can you just entertain people with simple meals?

702
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.567
I'm going to start

703
00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:48.267
It must be delicious

704
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.367
delicious

705
00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:54.167
You eat more

706
00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:55.633
Thank you aunt

707
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:02.167
Awesome

708
00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:03.467
No soju?

709
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.067
You should finish your meal quickly and go back.

710
00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:09.867
Can I have a drink if I want?

711
00:41:24.133 --> 00:41:25.967
What are you doing? You're so stingy.

712
00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:27.533
Bring over the whole bottle of soju.

713
00:41:27.533 --> 00:41:28.933
let's drink together

714
00:41:31.367 --> 00:41:33.067
"You fool"

715
00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:37.800
"If you can't catch him, express your feelings."

716
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.967
"You're just a fool"

717
00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:49.367
"If you can't catch him, tell him you love you"

718
00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:56.267
"He is leaving you"

719
00:41:56.667 --> 00:42:00.967
"Speak quickly"

720
00:42:01.467 --> 00:42:02.700
Dingchen?

721
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.933
Yes

722
00:42:03.933 --> 00:42:05.700
I called the film company

723
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.033
But she didn't answer

724
00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:09.833
She told me she was going to meet someone
He also said that he had something to say to that person.

725
00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:11.133
I should go home later today

726
00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:14.100
Who is she going to see?

727
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.333
What did she say...

728
00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:18.367
Right

729
00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:20.033
She said that the other party was a poor person who was not doing his job properly.

730
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:24.267
But who is that person?

731
00:42:25.033 --> 00:42:26.333
I'm not sure either

732
00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:30.900
I think that girl Dingchen
Sometimes my mind is not so clear

733
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.433
Why are you looking for a guy who doesn't do his job properly?

734
00:42:33.433 --> 00:42:34.867
Don't worry about your personal safety

735
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.333
Anyway, when she comes home later

736
00:42:38.333 --> 00:42:40.633
I should come over here first.
Come home with me again

737
00:42:40.633 --> 00:42:41.900
She usually does this

738
00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:45.233
I know

739
00:42:45.233 --> 00:42:47.467
"Speak up"

740
00:42:47.467 --> 00:42:50.667
"Speak quickly"

741
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:54.100
"Speak quickly"

742
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.800
"Speak quickly"

743
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.800
Hello Li Douxue

744
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.300
I, Wu Dingchen, will become the Korean film industry
A man who moves the wind and rain

745
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.400
I will use the movie I made
Make the audience cry and laugh at the same time

746
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.767
You will also make a lot of money

747
00:43:12.767 --> 00:43:13.867
Very good

748
00:43:13.867 --> 00:43:18.200
But you are a gangster
Why do you still earn so little?

749
00:43:18.933 --> 00:43:21.667
Not every gangster thinks like you do

750
00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:24.067
You might as well stop being a gangster.

751
00:43:24.067 --> 00:43:25.500
come to me

752
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:28.633
Help me with the film company affairs

753
00:43:28.633 --> 00:43:31.033
You can also go to university at the same time

754
00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:32.900
I'll help you pay for all your expenses, okay?

755
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.333
I have that ability

756
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.100
Do you think I look pathetic?

757
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.167
Yes, you are so pitiful

758
00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:48.667
and i'm sorry to you

759
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.433
I shouldn't have let you go like this...

760
00:43:53.767 --> 00:43:56.367
What are you talking about without any end?

761
00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.100
I dumped you in the first place

762
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.367
Hide your true feelings and push me away
are you happy

763
00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:08.833
I heard when you were in jail
My dad went to find you

764
00:44:10.967 --> 00:44:14.900
as long as you are happy
It doesn't matter how I'm doing

765
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.000
Are you acting in a romance movie?

766
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.600
People who are so infatuated these days are really valuable.

767
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.400
The infatuated gangster arrives in Luo

768
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.933
Really handsome

769
00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:26.433
It's time for "Seoul Sunday" weekly to interview you, Luo

770
00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:28.967
Stop talking

771
00:44:28.967 --> 00:44:30.167
Those are all past tense

772
00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.700
Since it is past tense

773
00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:34.167
Why are you still lingering around me?

774
00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:37.767
I'm not like that

775
00:44:37.767 --> 00:44:40.833
You also know that movie companies and gangs
I would have dealt with you

776
00:44:41.567 --> 00:44:45.233
I just heard about you by chance
I just told Tetsuo

777
00:44:45.233 --> 00:44:47.533
I heard you talking nonsense

778
00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:50.967
You still can't forget me, right?

779
00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:53.900
Are you still attached to me, you idiot?

780
00:44:56.167 --> 00:44:58.333
Dingchen

781
00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:00.267
You said it yourself

782
00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:02.467
we are no longer
I was a teenage high school student in Lishui back then.

783
00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:04.400
you are right

784
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.667
I'm a gangster now

785
00:45:07.667 --> 00:45:10.233
This life is destined to live like this

786
00:45:10.233 --> 00:45:13.167
It’s so different from the life of an ordinary person like you

787
00:45:14.133 --> 00:45:16.733
Hey, you're drunk. Go home.

788
00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:21.167
Is it destined to be a gangster?

789
00:45:21.167 --> 00:45:26.267
Then let me ask you, since no one can escape death
Why do we still need to eat?

790
00:45:26.267 --> 00:45:27.900
Isn't it good to be hungry?

791
00:45:34.933 --> 00:45:37.267
Don’t you still want to stay with me?

792
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.967
So please leave the gang

793
00:45:41.967 --> 00:45:46.300
I can support you and provide you with education

794
00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:49.600
I will stay with you

795
00:45:50.967 --> 00:45:52.567
You are still very young

796
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.900
The harm my father caused you

797
00:45:57.133 --> 00:45:59.967
And I made the mistake of letting you go too easily...

798
00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.767
I will make it up to you

799
00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:08.067
Douxue, please leave the gang.

800
00:46:08.067 --> 00:46:09.400
ok

801
00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.233
in this world

802
00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:15.067
How many people can do the job they like?

803
00:46:15.933 --> 00:46:18.667
Everyone is just gritting their teeth and holding on.

804
00:46:18.667 --> 00:46:22.367
Do you want me to make movies and go to college?

805
00:46:22.367 --> 00:46:25.767
Do you think this society will accept ex-convicts?

806
00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:27.433
Besides, I'm still a murderer

807
00:46:30.167 --> 00:46:32.300
Now in the film industry

808
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.133
There should be no one who doesn’t know about the gangster Li Douxue.

809
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.733
If you are involved with me

810
00:46:39.733 --> 00:46:41.333
Even you will be criticized

811
00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:45.033
this is my situation

812
00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:47.700
Do you know

813
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.467
So you go

814
00:46:55.786 --> 00:46:57.220
You go quickly...

815
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.300
"I wanna hold your hand"

816
00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.133
"I wanna be like a birthday"

817
00:47:33.133 --> 00:47:35.900
"No matter you will be here"

818
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:40.967
"Forever love the only one"

819
00:47:40.967 --> 00:47:43.767
"I wanna look at your mind"

820
00:47:43.767 --> 00:47:45.600
"Take me your eyes"

821
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.433
"Let me in
beautiful your life"

822
00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.367
"Come over here"

823
00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:56.033
"Back in your love
in my life"

824
00:47:57.167 --> 00:48:03.733
"Let me go in my life"

825
00:48:04.867 --> 00:48:11.433
"Let me go in your life"

826
00:48:12.433 --> 00:48:17.033
"Love you no more"

827
00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:20.500
"I wanna be myself"

828
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:26.900
"Let me go in my life"

829
00:48:27.933 --> 00:48:32.467
"Love you no more"

830
00:48:32.467 --> 00:48:35.900
"I wanna be myself"

831
00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:42.300
"Let me go in my life"

832
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.300
It's interesting to see you like this

833
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.033
I'm so thirsty. Give me some water.

834
00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:44.067
You ask for so much

835
00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:01.867
Wow so sweet

836
00:50:01.867 --> 00:50:03.200
Is there any honey in it?

837
00:50:04.066 --> 00:50:05.799
How could there be honey in a beggar’s house?

838
00:50:06.386 --> 00:50:07.228
That's right

839
00:50:10.267 --> 00:50:12.267
But did we sleep in the same bed yesterday?

840
00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:15.033
what

841
00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:17.100
Don't talk nonsense

842
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.900
Because of you, I was on the flat bed outside yesterday
Shivering while sleeping

843
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.933
What's the matter? Just come in and sleep.

844
00:50:22.933 --> 00:50:25.267
Afraid I'll knock you down

845
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.333
How could you, girl?
Just say this casually...

846
00:50:29.733 --> 00:50:32.733
A coward like you
That’s why I care about this kind of thing specially

847
00:50:32.733 --> 00:50:33.700
So what if we sleep in the same bed?

848
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.167
OMG…
Is it pure to sleep separately?

849
00:50:35.167 --> 00:50:36.500
Is it dirty to sleep together?

850
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.733
If you really like the other person

851
00:50:38.733 --> 00:50:42.200
When we embrace each other, we will emit pure light

852
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.433
You stupid gangster

853
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.267
Now I take a closer look and realize

854
00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:50.100
Are you still drunk?

855
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.100
You go back quickly

856
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.467
You actually hit me...

857
00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:54.167
You're leaving now

858
00:50:54.167 --> 00:50:55.533
Be careful, I'll beat you up

859
00:50:56.367 --> 00:50:59.267
Send girls to the street
This is the etiquette that boys should have

860
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.667
Do you remember what I said yesterday?

861
00:51:02.667 --> 00:51:03.800
I remember it very clearly

862
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.733
You say that I, a gangster, am no different than a beggar...

863
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.333
You're really good at sarcasm. Really.

864
00:51:11.533 --> 00:51:12.933
follow me

865
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.900
I'm giving you a chance now

866
00:51:18.333 --> 00:51:19.933
I didn't ask you to give me a chance

867
00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:23.433
You just can't say it
But that's what your eyes say

868
00:51:25.633 --> 00:51:29.267
I stayed with you all night yesterday
In fact, you are very happy, right?

869
00:51:30.533 --> 00:51:33.133
What are you talking about?

870
00:51:33.133 --> 00:51:35.633
Ouch, you are shy again

871
00:51:35.633 --> 00:51:37.867
How can someone like you be considered a hooligan?

872
00:51:37.867 --> 00:51:41.767
You are not born to be a gangster.

873
00:51:41.767 --> 00:51:43.700
So cute…

874
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.033
Li Douxue

875
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.633
Why are you so scared? It's not the first time.

876
00:51:58.633 --> 00:52:00.567
We have kissed several times in Lishui before.

877
00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:03.767
And we are
What about sleeping under the same roof?

878
00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:05.033
You…

879
00:52:05.033 --> 00:52:05.967
how

880
00:52:05.967 --> 00:52:06.967
what do you want to do

881
00:52:06.967 --> 00:52:10.700
You...are you going to keep teasing me like this?

882
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.000
Yes you are right

883
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.467
before you leave the gang

884
00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:15.767
I plan to continue teasing you

885
00:52:15.767 --> 00:52:17.400
Come here and let me kiss you again
Hello…

886
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.467
don't come near me

887
00:52:19.467 --> 00:52:21.700
What's wrong...I still smell of alcohol
don't you like it

888
00:52:23.567 --> 00:52:25.133
where are you going

889
00:52:25.133 --> 00:52:26.400
Hello…
Come here quickly

890
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.067
Hello Li Douxue

891
00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:50.433
I'm still worried about him

892
00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:52.533
I'm too overwhelmed to take care of myself...

893
00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.267
Hello

894
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.433
You should make a sound when you call me

895
00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.433
I am willing to be your adopted daughter

896
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.033
Are you Dingchen?

897
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:12.100
I knew you would agree

898
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.733
But boss, you must also abide by the agreement

899
00:54:15.733 --> 00:54:18.167
What, you still call me boss?

900
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.133
mother

901
00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:23.000
Am I your mother-in-law?

902
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.467
Call it more affectionately

903
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.800
Mom

904
00:54:36.167 --> 00:54:40.767
That's right. It sounds so kind.

905
00:54:40.767 --> 00:54:42.433
my good daughter

906
00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:45.033
You have to eat on time

907
00:54:45.033 --> 00:54:47.700
Film distribution business in Jingjiang area
You also have to run harder

908
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.933
Anyway, my property will be yours

909
00:54:48.933 --> 00:54:50.267
The empire you conquer is also yours

910
00:54:50.267 --> 00:54:51.667
Got it?

911
00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:53.567
I know

912
00:54:53.567 --> 00:54:55.800
The phone bill is very expensive. I'll hang up first.

913
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.667
ok bye

914
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.433
Very good, Dingchen, you are right to think so.

915
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.400
You really have to help me

916
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.067
The two of us are cousins now.

917
00:55:11.067 --> 00:55:15.400
Hey, this will make me very tired

918
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.600
Let's just be friends

919
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.700
But…

920
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.700
where did you sleep last night

921
00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:30.433
This is it

922
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.233
After I got drunk, I fell asleep directly.

923
00:55:43.167 --> 00:55:46.200
Shouldn't you
With that guy who is not doing his job properly...

924
00:55:47.767 --> 00:55:49.233
Oh my God, are you crazy?

925
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.733
Which brat is he?
How dare I make you drink...

926
00:55:52.733 --> 00:55:56.367
I was the one who made him drink

927
00:55:56.367 --> 00:55:58.367
What you imagined didn't happen

928
00:55:58.367 --> 00:56:00.200
Miss Xianyangzi, don’t worry

929
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.033
I'm out

930
00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:06.400
Hey... Tetsuo has been waiting for you all night

931
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.067
Tetsuo?

932
00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:11.700
You told me what I said on the phone
Did you tell him too?

933
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.333
Of course

934
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.200
I said you went to meet the poor guy who was not doing his job properly.

935
00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:19.533
What's wrong? Am I talking too much?

936
00:56:21.867 --> 00:56:24.000
It's okay. You did a good job.

937
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.800
He will know sooner or later anyway

938
00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.200
So Tetsuo also knows that person Luo

939
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:34.967
Could it be that strange guy?

940
00:56:34.967 --> 00:56:37.167
I used to spend all day with Tetsuo
Is Lee Doo-hak mixed in?

941
00:56:37.733 --> 00:56:39.367
I dated you briefly

942
00:56:39.367 --> 00:56:42.200
The guy who went to jail later, right?

943
00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:44.600
You don't need to know this

944
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.200
Hello Wu Dingchen

945
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.367
That guy is definitely not good

946
00:56:49.367 --> 00:56:51.133
He's a murderer

947
00:56:51.133 --> 00:56:54.400
Hey, I didn't meet the murderer.

948
00:56:55.333 --> 00:56:57.000
Otherwise who is

949
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.833
Anyway, it’s someone

950
00:57:07.633 --> 00:57:09.600
I think she is completely crazy too

951
00:57:14.633 --> 00:57:16.800
What's going on
You actually come to my workplace to look for me

952
00:57:18.233 --> 00:57:19.733
do you want coffee

953
00:57:21.733 --> 00:57:24.667
I had five drinks in the morning alone. No need.

954
00:57:25.667 --> 00:57:27.533
I heard that you waited for me until very late yesterday

955
00:57:30.133 --> 00:57:33.467
Yeah, because dinner was ruined

956
00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:36.367
I feel so sorry that I want to have a drink with you

957
00:57:37.633 --> 00:57:40.033
I was with Douxue last night

958
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.500
I know, Yoko told me

959
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.633
we had some drinks

960
00:57:48.633 --> 00:57:50.833
I'm trying to convince him to leave the gang.

961
00:57:53.733 --> 00:57:57.333
So what's the gain?

962
00:57:57.333 --> 00:58:00.067
I feel like I have a chance

963
00:58:00.067 --> 00:58:01.733
After all, he is kind-hearted to begin with

964
00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:04.367
He is a gangster

965
00:58:05.433 --> 00:58:07.533
Although Douxue will take action against gangsters

966
00:58:07.533 --> 00:58:09.200
But he won't bully innocent people

967
00:58:10.767 --> 00:58:12.767
Are you here to speak for him?

968
00:58:12.767 --> 00:58:16.067
Or is it because you made me wait too late yesterday?
I came to apologize because I felt guilty.

969
00:58:17.067 --> 00:58:19.833
Did I ask you to wait for me?

970
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:22.333
I don't feel guilty

971
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:24.567
I hope you don't expect any more
What kind of development can you have with me?

972
00:58:29.067 --> 00:58:30.833
It seems that you have decided to choose Brother Dou

973
00:58:32.567 --> 00:58:33.933
Did you sleep together?

974
00:58:37.267 --> 00:58:38.933
That's why I said you can't do it

975
00:58:39.533 --> 00:58:41.733
I'm kidding...

976
00:58:41.733 --> 00:58:44.400
I know that even if you take the initiative to pounce on me
Brother Douxue will also avoid it

977
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.467
I just think it's so unfair

978
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.700
Why don't you even give me a chance?

979
00:58:54.333 --> 00:58:56.733
You have been lacking in everything since you were a child

980
00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.233
Dou Xue means nothing

981
00:58:58.233 --> 00:58:59.600
This is true both before and now

982
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.067
Sympathy and love should be different, right?

983
00:59:07.567 --> 00:59:10.333
I can't just watch you become unhappy

984
00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:13.000
Unlucky?

985
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.967
Do you think you can bring me happiness?

986
00:59:15.667 --> 00:59:17.767
I repeat

987
00:59:17.767 --> 00:59:18.733
Whether I will be happy or unhappy

988
00:59:18.733 --> 00:59:20.033
All created by myself

989
00:59:20.033 --> 00:59:21.567
I will be responsible for myself

990
00:59:38.833 --> 00:59:40.400
The gangster is coming

991
00:59:49.533 --> 00:59:51.133
Come quickly

992
01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:03.600
(Oppose demolition)

993
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:59.900
"Can I come back to you again?"

994
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.833
"trembling eyes"

995
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:06.633
"Looks more sad"

996
01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:13.500
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

997
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.267
"your name"

998
01:01:16.267 --> 01:01:18.467
(Preview of next episode)
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

999
01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.933
I wish I could send someone to investigate him

1000
01:01:20.933 --> 01:01:22.067
Who is the subject of the investigation?

1001
01:01:22.067 --> 01:01:23.867
Douxue, let’s get rid of Guangzhuo.

1002
01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:25.367
Please eat on time

1003
01:01:25.367 --> 01:01:26.900
Ruzhen, please take care of my three meals.

1004
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.767
It's not too late now

1005
01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.100
She must have a man

1006
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.300
You stinky gangster

1007
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.033
That's what you do
Did you just move behind my back?

1008
01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:34.033
I'm attracted to that person

1009
01:01:34.033 --> 01:01:35.067
I want to date him

1010
01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:38.467
Don't talk on paper, just take action.

1011
01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:41.633
Stupid mother
can you do me a favor

1012
01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:42.900
No one is allowed to move

1013
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.067
Just learn from Lian Guangzhuo and Li Dou
Just leave the criminal evidence to us

1014
01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:47.600
Brother, I will take care of it

1015
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.533
Douxue, you look for his weakness and attack him.
