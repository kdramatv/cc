00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.200
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.533
Li Douxue raised his hands and knelt down

3
00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:18.533
No one is allowed to move

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.400
"Can I come back to you again?"

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Please stop

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
everything is over

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.967
Sure enough, you are the one who is doing this

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.000
Just stop it

9
00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.233
If you stop...

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.633
Will you go to jail in my place?

11
00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:47.700
Just like before I took your place...

12
00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.233
Let go of the hostages

13
00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:54.767
let him go

14
00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.700
Otherwise I will really shoot you

15
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.633
Brother, please save me

16
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.633
As long as you save me this time

17
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.667
I will definitely be responsible for you

18
00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:09.867
Wrong

19
00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.033
I'll risk my life to get ahead

20
00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.300
dedicate my life to you

21
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.800
Can't take my son away

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.833
Mom, I'm sorry

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.567
"It's useless to talk too much anyway"

24
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:32.000
"It's all in the past"

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.700
"Cannot hide"

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.833
"Missing you"
No

27
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.633
"It broke out"

28
00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.633
No

29
00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:01.467
Big brother…

30
00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:02.933
Douxue

31
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:08.033
"trembling eyes"

32
00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:12.100
"Looks more sad"

33
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.933
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

34
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.433
Look carefully

35
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:28.433
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

36
00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:31.700
(Report hidden spies)
(Episode 11)

37
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.067
Isn't it this?

38
00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:34.500
I'm serious

39
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.200
Sit down for me Sit down

40
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.633
I told you to sit down

41
00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:38.500
Why don't you sit down for me?

42
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.133
What do you think now

43
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.000
Damn it, won't you sit down for me?

44
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.767
How is it

45
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.000
Have you found someone?

46
00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.200
Have you found it?

47
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.167
not found

48
00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:04.767
He seems to have drifted far out to sea

49
00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:12.967
Find Douxue

50
00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:15.233
Go find him, you brat.

51
00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.667
Is Brother Douxue really dead?

52
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.533
Is he dead or alive?

53
00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:24.733
Douxue

54
00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:26.833
Please help me find him

55
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.767
It must be very cold in the sea

56
00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.367
Douxue

57
00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:57.467
The weather is so cold

58
00:03:58.367 --> 00:03:59.900
Damn enough

59
00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:03.100
I thought I would never go to jail again...

60
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.567
I originally thought that even if I was imprisoned again,

61
00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.733
He will also be a majestic person
powerful prisoner

62
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.167
As a result, he became a pauper again.

63
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.800
Brat, who said we are paupers?

64
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.167
Although only once

65
00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:20.467
But we were also the ones who unified gangs across the country.
Core members of the Loyalty Association

66
00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:23.333
That's not unification by force.

67
00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.067
It's all unified with money.

68
00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:27.167
You ignorant guy

69
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.167
Fists and money are both strengths.

70
00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:33.100
How did Silla unify the three kingdoms in the first place?

71
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.867
Jin Chunqiu relies on business skills

72
00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.133
Kim Yu Shin wields a sword

73
00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.533
Doo Hak and Hyung Soo are in charge of business skills

74
00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.800
The two of us wield swords

75
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.933
Therefore, business skills and military force are equally divided.

76
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:45.267
Only if we each take half of the responsibility can we unify it.

77
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.067
I heard you say that. It's true.

78
00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:53.033
But our main force
He seems to be a Douxue brother too

79
00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:56.367
No matter how much the people below pay,

80
00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.600
Or is it only the boss who will leave his name in history?

81
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.267
Hyung-soo, am I right?

82
00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.333
Be quiet

83
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.633
Don't always remind me of the guy who's no longer here

84
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:07.133
Brat

85
00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:10.533
Do you think I am in love with you?

86
00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:13.000
I also want to be quiet on the way to prison

87
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.567
But I always think of the dead guy

88
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.167
If you don't brag and talk nonsense like this

89
00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:19.233
I will always think of him

90
00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:21.233
I'm going crazy too, brat

91
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.733
Why are you crying again?

92
00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:31.300
Whether I am quiet or noisy

93
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.667
I will always think of Brother Douxue

94
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.867
You crazy person...

95
00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:48.000
(three years later)

96
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.300
Tetsuo happy birthday

97
00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:53.367
thank you

98
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.200
happy birthday to you

99
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.633
Congratulations on your return to Seoul too

100
00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:04.633
Dad thank you

101
00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:06.133
You should have come back long ago

102
00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.533
Are you inferior to others in some way?

103
00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:13.367
Just come back
Is it fun to work near your hometown?

104
00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:15.433
Occasionally when I’m free on holidays

105
00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:18.200
I will go back and study with Brother Douxue
Walk around school

106
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.067
I will also visit our old home.

107
00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:24.067
Where is Dingchen? Why hasn’t she come yet?

108
00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:25.833
Did you ask her to come to dinner?

109
00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.467
That is to say, she clearly said she would come...

110
00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:32.300
She shows up at least on your birthday every year

111
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.633
It seems she forgot this year

112
00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:46.633
Hello Executive Gao

113
00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:47.767
(Paris Salon)

114
00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:50.267
Didn't the boss say anything?

115
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.567
How could she do this

116
00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:57.033
Why did you do this suddenly?

117
00:06:57.867 --> 00:06:59.967
Please wait for me, boss

118
00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:02.800
I must make it clear to her today

119
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.500
Wu Dingchen probably won’t come this year

120
00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:08.100
what

121
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.800
What happened in Dingchen?

122
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.433
Dingchen

123
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.767
Sorry I'm late

124
00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:17.000
long time no see

125
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.100
sorry i'm late

126
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.100
Come sit down

127
00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:26.833
Are you okay? What happened?

128
00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.233
What went wrong?

129
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:30.833
Problem? No?

130
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.900
If things are too easy to solve
If it's a problem

131
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.233
There is indeed a problem

132
00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:35.733
this is your birthday gift

133
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.467
You actually prepared a gift

134
00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:40.933
It's a gift for you to come.

135
00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:43.367
Why are you saying this? It's so disgusting.

136
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:44.867
Shero

137
00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:48.933
Come on, let’s all have a toast

138
00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:51.200
Wish Zhexiong a happy birthday, peace and health

139
00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:53.967
happy birthday

140
00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:55.167
Mom thank you

141
00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:56.200
happy birthday

142
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.567
Thanks

143
00:08:39.367 --> 00:08:41.867
Auntie, why are you here?

144
00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:46.000
I have a date with someone for dinner near here

145
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.033
Come and take a look when it's over

146
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.033
How are you doing?

147
00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:52.467
Not bad

148
00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:55.200
Dingchen is doing well too

149
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.733
Aunt, I should visit you often

150
00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:00.033
really sorry

151
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:04.367
Come in and sit down. You haven't been here for so long.

152
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:06.100
Come in and have a cup of tea before leaving

153
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.533
No need

154
00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:12.200
This is your favorite side dish. Eat it.

155
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.500
And you have time another day
Come and sit at our house

156
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.700
ok i got it

157
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:24.867
When I see your face, I feel better

158
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.433
happy birthday

159
00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:32.300
I haven't seen you every time I've been here before.

160
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.033
So I feel it's a pity

161
00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:36.233
I'm so lucky this time

162
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.633
Really?

163
00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:43.767
Because every time I come to see my parents
will go back to the south

164
00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:49.167
But I'm back in Seoul now

165
00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.633
Will visit you often

166
00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.833
OK thank you

167
00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.967
thank you very much

168
00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:04.633
I'm leaving

169
00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:06.633
Okay, be careful on the road.

170
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:07.933
Drive carefully

171
00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:27.100
let's go in

172
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.567
I'm going to say goodbye first

173
00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:33.100
What, why so fast?

174
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.867
Let's go after eating this

175
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:34.733
No need

176
00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:36.767
Yeah, at least have a cup of tea before leaving.

177
00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:39.700
It's okay, it's already very late

178
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.700
I'm leaving first

179
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.700
Do you really want to leave?

180
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.700
Go ahead with me

181
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.067
I'll contact you later

182
00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.367
let's go in

183
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.300
please have a good rest

184
00:11:00.733 --> 00:11:04.967
Well... congratulations on returning to Seoul

185
00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:15.467
Son, come in

186
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.533
How did you know it was me?

187
00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:23.300
Heard about Dingchen

188
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.600
I know you will come and ask me

189
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.233
Collecting facts is also a way to master intelligence

190
00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:31.600
But reading people's hearts is the first step to mastering intelligence.

191
00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:36.667
It seems that you are going to Japan for a business trip

192
00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:38.267
That's right

193
00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:41.467
In the eyes of ordinary people
It’s an ordinary business trip to Japan

194
00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.967
It seems like there is some important mission

195
00:11:45.967 --> 00:11:49.867
If you go, please ask Team Leader Wu
You can know all the news about Dingchen

196
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.400
I don't want to do that

197
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.867
There is a problem with the shareholding of Dingchen Film Company
Now in trouble

198
00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:02.600
She probably could only take a little money with her
He will be driven away immediately

199
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:10.967
Do you still want to withdraw your shares now?

200
00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:13.233
If mom, your mind hasn’t changed

201
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.133
I won't change either

202
00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.900
Whether it's for film school or something

203
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.167
You misappropriate funds as you wish
Is this the right thing to do?

204
00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:21.167
I told you several times

205
00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.667
That's because the other party agreed
Excellent directors and screenwriters will be

206
00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:24.667
Film companies recommended to us first

207
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:26.633
That's why I made that investment

208
00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:33.100
Really? So you won’t admit your mistake, right?

209
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.900
I understand, Executive Director Gao

210
00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:36.900
OK

211
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.567
this is for you

212
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.000
This is your share

213
00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:50.467
(Check 100 million won)

214
00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:55.833
Are you saying these are my shares?

215
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.367
That's right

216
00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:01.700
My share is half of 400 million won
That’s 200 million won for your shares

217
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.967
No, as far as I know

218
00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.100
Except for Gwangju and Jeonnam regions

219
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.167
Half of your shares in Jingjiang area

220
00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.133
Those are my shares

221
00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:12.367
That’s 2 billion won at least…

222
00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:14.333
2 billion won?

223
00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.067
are you kidding

224
00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:21.033
Executive Gao, explain it to her carefully.

225
00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.733
OK

226
00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:26.833
That's it

227
00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.667
Head of Branch Shares

228
00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:32.400
It is indeed half of what the boss has in the Jingjiang area

229
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.900
But during the start-up period

230
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.767
I asked my boss, I have been fighting for her all my life.
Should we also have some shares?

231
00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:46.267
So the boss put her there
90% of the shares in Jingjiang District were given to me

232
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.767
In this way, the boss’s shares are 10%

233
00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.833
Your share is 5%

234
00:13:56.833 --> 00:14:00.433
Exactly 200 million won

235
00:14:00.433 --> 00:14:02.300
Do you want me to believe this now?

236
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.367
You really are, isn't it?

237
00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:11.167
Here is also the contract between the boss and me at that time.

238
00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:14.367
If these are really high standing shares
I'll take your last name

239
00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:17.400
This is obviously just a registration under a borrowed name.
You're going too far, right?

240
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.167
You are the one who goes too far

241
00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:20.067
Mom

242
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:22.033
do you call me mom

243
00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:24.167
Even if you become my adopted daughter

244
00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:27.167
You also knelt down to me on the roadside
You promised to be my maid

245
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.367
You are not a goldfish brain
How come you forgot so quickly?

246
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:32.367
How dare you use your brain to fight me?

247
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.000
This is my last trace of affection for you

248
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.433
So you don’t have to go out to beg for food

249
00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:42.067
this office
Just find a way to pay the rent on your own

250
00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:43.033
Otherwise get out

251
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:44.700
It's all over. Get lost.

252
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.067
Let me ask you one thing

253
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.333
Do you think of me as a maid or a daughter?

254
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.900
Let me ask you something too

255
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:04.400
Do you regard me as your master or your mother?

256
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200
I will not leave the film industry

257
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.667
Wait...

258
00:15:12.667 --> 00:15:14.467
That's your own business

259
00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.300
Branch manager…

260
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.600
Don't do this

261
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.800
Just kneel down and beg your boss for mercy.

262
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.900
Although the boss's words are unpleasant,

263
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.667
But she loves you very much

264
00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.233
Do you want me to go back and be her Yahuan?

265
00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:39.367
If you want to be a senior executive, you have to do it yourself

266
00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:42.967
Just wait and see

267
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.033
Who can survive in the film industry in the end?

268
00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:48.267
Branch manager…

269
00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:51.000
That girl is really...

270
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.400
That dad

271
00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:01.033
Dingchen she...

272
00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:02.500
do you want to help her

273
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.933
Yes

274
00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:06.700
Then go help her

275
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.233
Now you are also a mature adult

276
00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:13.567
Want to help the woman I love
Just rely on yourself

277
00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:15.300
This is how a man should be

278
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.600
How do you feel about her?

279
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.100
If you can't forget her

280
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.800
Just try your best to get her

281
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.300
If you can't do that, forget about her

282
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.767
I never forgot your mother

283
00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:32.867
To find her and protect her

284
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.067
I did everything I could

285
00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:40.167
But what about you? Have you put in this effort?

286
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:54.233
"I'm leaving. I'm leaving."

287
00:16:54.233 --> 00:17:01.667
"Holding my young son's hand"

288
00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:12.867
"Plant potatoes and corn..."

289
00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:18.533
No husband will come to me

290
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:21.267
No children will come to me

291
00:17:21.267 --> 00:17:25.333
Who's ringing the bell so late?

292
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:27.233
Who is it?

293
00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:28.700
Is it Zhenyu?

294
00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:34.100
It's me Dingchen

295
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.533
I wasn't able to greet you properly just now

296
00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:38.433
Oh my god

297
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.600
why did you come

298
00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:45.167
The old man is gone

299
00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:47.333
Douxue also left

300
00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.800
Even Zhenyu has left home

301
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.700
How could I not drown my sorrows in wine?

302
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.033
I can't sleep without a drink.

303
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.767
Are you in pain too?

304
00:18:09.467 --> 00:18:13.000
What can I do if there is no fate?

305
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.067
Now you should forget about that brat too

306
00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:18.833
drink

307
00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:30.567
A hole in my heart like this

308
00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:34.633
When the cold wind blows in

309
00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:37.533
I will think of Tetsuo

310
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.467
today is his birthday

311
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:42.500
Will he go back to Seoul?

312
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.667
With this thought in mind, I ran to find him.

313
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.667
But have you seen it?

314
00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:53.633
The way the lady looked at me sideways

315
00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.667
"Without my permission
How dare you come to find Tetsuo?"

316
00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.133
That's what she meant

317
00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:00.133
She probably didn't mean that.

318
00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.833
It's better not to have

319
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:05.833
You know that wonderful lady
Have you told me anything before?

320
00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:14.600
No matter what store you want to open
These funds are more than enough

321
00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:21.800
Oh my God, is there all money in this?

322
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.067
But I have something to ask you

323
00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:28.333
Although it may not be easy for you

324
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:32.167
But I hope in the future
Don't you ever meet our family again

325
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:36.300
Especially Tetsuo, never contact him

326
00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:49.400
I miss Douxue
Wouldn't it be okay to visit Tetsuo once in a while?

327
00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:53.233
please take care

328
00:19:57.467 --> 00:19:58.333
(Lee Jong-ho)

329
00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.700
Then it will be about a month later

330
00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:13.267
Oh my god, why are you here?

331
00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:14.500
What's wrong

332
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.733
Did I come to something
Is this the wrong place to come?

333
00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:19.067
this gives you

334
00:20:19.067 --> 00:20:20.467
I brought beef

335
00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:21.800
Please enjoy

336
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.033
Why did you buy so many expensive things?

337
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:30.300
I may not be able to see you often in the future

338
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.400
I was sent to other counties and cities

339
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.667
where are you going

340
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.767
Gwangju

341
00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.133
Really far

342
00:20:44.167 --> 00:20:47.333
before i come back
You should take good care of yourself

343
00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:48.933
You are the one who wants to live in a foreign land

344
00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:51.133
You have to take good care of yourself

345
00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:52.233
I'll help you cook a meal right away

346
00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:53.200
You can leave after eating

347
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.867
That…

348
00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:57.533
I still have a lot to do

349
00:21:00.167 --> 00:21:01.567
I'll leave first

350
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.533
ok

351
00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:09.867
if you need anything

352
00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:12.067
You can talk to me anytime

353
00:21:12.067 --> 00:21:17.200
Like side dishes, undershirts, underwear...

354
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.533
I can send it to you

355
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.900
sorry

356
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.933
What do you have to be sorry for?

357
00:21:31.933 --> 00:21:36.033
I should tell you thank you

358
00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:38.500
I only have you now

359
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:43.633
You must...

360
00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:46.133
Be sure to take care of yourself

361
00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:58.033
at that moment

362
00:21:58.033 --> 00:22:02.967
My cold heart was instantly melted by him

363
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.833
That kid...

364
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:08.800
He is quite affectionate and righteous, right?

365
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.333
No matter whose child he is

366
00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:21.167
Our wonderful lady

367
00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:25.100
You should have seen that scene

368
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.833
As the saying goes, even when a fox dies, he will never forget his roots.

369
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:36.600
Everything will get back on track eventually

370
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.200
Isn't it?

371
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.867
Yes

372
00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:41.500
Dingchen

373
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.533
What's going on

374
00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:47.100
Our Tetsuo is really good, right?

375
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.667
Of course

376
00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.867
Although he is a bit greedy

377
00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:52.800
Other than that he's pretty good

378
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.400
Why don't you marry Tetsuo?

379
00:22:58.267 --> 00:23:00.233
Auntie, you really like to joke too

380
00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:04.400
It seems Tetsuo can’t forget you either
I only think about you

381
00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:10.133
It’s time to let go of those who left

382
00:23:10.133 --> 00:23:12.200
Those who are alive should continue to live their lives.

383
00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:18.667
He sent away Douxue, who was like his own brother

384
00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:21.767
It must be very painful to live

385
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.300
Both you and Tetsuo are like this

386
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.067
If Douxue sees it in the sky

387
00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:33.933
You'll probably say the same thing to me.

388
00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:35.933
Aunt, please don't say such things

389
00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:39.400
you listen to me

390
00:23:39.933 --> 00:23:43.100
In fact, Tetsuo...

391
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.700
I…

392
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.903
I will think of Douxue while eating

393
00:23:48.904 --> 00:23:51.100
When I walk on the road, I will think of him.

394
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.767
Dou learn from him...

395
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:59.533
It has always been in my heart and has not disappeared

396
00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:03.567
You said how could I be attracted to other people?

397
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.133
Alas, poor child

398
00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:12.667
Alas, poor child

399
00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:36.000
Alas, poor child

400
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.800
but you don't know

401
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.233
Tetsuo was also born to me in the tenth month of my pregnancy.

402
00:24:47.233 --> 00:24:50.100
He was born to me...

403
00:24:52.167 --> 00:25:01.033
But throughout life
Douxue’s father sent him away

404
00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:03.967
He said that for that family

405
00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:09.633
Don't call it a child
He can even take his own life

406
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:13.833
Is there anything I can't do?

407
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.533
It is also because of this

408
00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:22.533
Douxue has always given way to Tetsuo all his life.

409
00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:26.100
my poor child

410
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.533
I should have stopped him anyway

411
00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:37.533
my poor child…

412
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.833
Your steak here
As expected, it lives up to its reputation and is very top-notch.

413
00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:49.900
Not inferior to New York's top hotels

414
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.533
thank you for your compliment

415
00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:56.133
To be honest, I heard President
You're going to dine here. I'm shocked.

416
00:25:56.133 --> 00:25:59.000
You probably didn’t come here just for the steak

417
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.667
May I ask what you are doing for me?

418
00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.900
(Chairman of Changsheng Group Qin Wanzhe)
You are really as straightforward as the rumors say.

419
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.633
To be honest, our subsidiaries
The person in charge will be investigated by the prosecutor today

420
00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:15.633
It should be almost the same now
Arrive at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office

421
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.000
The person in charge is my little daughter

422
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.700
That's right

423
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.500
She uses overseas branches
Saved a secret fund of US dollars

424
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.167
I don’t know how the news leaked out

425
00:26:32.167 --> 00:26:35.200
Notified of violation of the "Foreign Exchange Control Act"
to be investigated

426
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.400
I am Geum Yeon Hee from Changsheng Fashion

427
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.000
(Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong)

428
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.567
She used that secret fund
Buy Japanese real estate

429
00:26:47.567 --> 00:26:50.467
It is intended to double the company's assets.

430
00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:55.833
We are not embezzling public funds.
A family that enriches itself

431
00:26:57.033 --> 00:26:57.767
Of course

432
00:26:57.767 --> 00:26:59.900
All statements you make now
But that prosecutor...

433
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.000
may be used against you in court

434
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.400
You moved a lot of funds to overseas branches

435
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.800
(Japanese real estate investment plan)
The whistleblower stated that the money

436
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.300
Is it used to buy recently among Japanese consortiums?
Very popular Japanese real estate

437
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.533
What do you think?

438
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.833
If you are not careful, you will be trapped on the top of the mountain.

439
00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:19.633
On the top of the mountain?

440
00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:20.967
Yes

441
00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:24.433
Is there any real estate in the world that only rises but never falls?

442
00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:26.633
what do you mean

443
00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:29.600
Japanese real estate ranks first in the world

444
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.933
Just sell the land in Tokyo

445
00:27:30.933 --> 00:27:33.233
could buy the whole United States

446
00:27:33.233 --> 00:27:34.467
Haven't you heard of it?

447
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.800
Of course I've heard of it

448
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.767
That's why I want you to be more careful

449
00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:46.033
If one is enthusiastic about an abnormal bull market

450
00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:50.567
Beware of this bubble economy
more likely to crash

451
00:27:50.567 --> 00:27:54.333
you are not conducting an investigation
You're helping me with my lessons

452
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.633
Please help me to have a good word with my son.

453
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.300
Although he is not someone who would accept such a request

454
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.800
But President, you have already spoken.

455
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.567
I will send a message for you

456
00:28:08.567 --> 00:28:11.033
You seem to have studied a lot of economics

457
00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:12.667
Now is the time since Tangun founded the country

458
00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:14.533
The most prosperous period of the economy

459
00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:16.333
It is also the period with the most financial crimes

460
00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:17.600
So I study economics seriously

461
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.067
That's it

462
00:28:19.067 --> 00:28:24.333
In fact, I encouraged her
Engaged in Japanese real estate investment

463
00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:26.967
My little girl’s position is opposite to mine

464
00:28:26.967 --> 00:28:30.633
Then sue me

465
00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:33.867
for violating the "Foreign Exchange Control Act"

466
00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:37.633
Witnesses and evidence should not be sufficient

467
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:39.533
I'll find it for you

468
00:28:39.533 --> 00:28:42.167
Do you know what you are saying now?

469
00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:44.100
Of course

470
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.600
I admit the fact of my crime

471
00:28:52.267 --> 00:28:53.433
what is the reason

472
00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:56.067
Actually…

473
00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:59.267
My thoughts are the same as yours, prosecutor.

474
00:28:59.267 --> 00:29:03.567
Misappropriating the hard-earned money earned by the company
Go engage in Japanese real estate investment

475
00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:05.600
I think it's not only illegal

476
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.633
It may also cause huge losses to the company

477
00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:12.133
To be honest, I am the reporter

478
00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:15.167
If you are prosecuted under the Foreign Exchange Control Act

479
00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:17.700
All major newspapers should know this news

480
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.967
Then the president will also be helpless, right?

481
00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.400
At that time, he can only surrender with his hands up

482
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.867
Give up

483
00:29:22.867 --> 00:29:24.200
If there is no loss of money

484
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.100
It’s good for our company and the country

485
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.033
What’s so difficult about being patriotic?

486
00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:33.133
Just be a patriot with me for once

487
00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:42.033
I brought some evidence here

488
00:29:42.033 --> 00:29:44.000
(Current situation of overseas real estate)

489
00:29:51.067 --> 00:29:53.033
You guys let go

490
00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:54.967
Prosecutor

491
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:57.133
You guys let go

492
00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:00.467
Get in the car quickly

493
00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:02.233
Prosecutor, look at them

494
00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.867
I think you might destroy the evidence or abscond.

495
00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:07.000
So you must be detained

496
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.100
The deposit has also been issued

497
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.133
Just as you expected
It should be on the news tonight

498
00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:13.300
Wait, prosecutor.

499
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.567
There should be no need for detention and prosecution in this case.

500
00:30:15.567 --> 00:30:17.267
That's your wishful thinking

501
00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.433
Let's go

502
00:30:21.433 --> 00:30:23.433
prosecutor…

503
00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:25.067
Right, wait a minute

504
00:30:28.167 --> 00:30:31.600
I originally wanted to accompany you there

505
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.867
But I have very important things to deal with today

506
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.233
Prosecutor

507
00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:42.200
Hello…

508
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.867
Be careful...

509
00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:43.833
let me go

510
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.233
I see…

511
00:30:47.233 --> 00:30:50.067
next movie
Or invest in "007 License to Kill"

512
00:30:50.067 --> 00:30:53.167
More profitable

513
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:54.667
Do you want me to go talk to you?

514
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.333
When has a 007 movie ever made us lose money?

515
00:30:58.333 --> 00:30:59.633
You go and talk

516
00:30:59.633 --> 00:31:01.000
OK I got it

517
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.633
Where is Dingchen?

518
00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:05.500
Didn't she call?

519
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.700
Yes no…

520
00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:11.267
That ruthless woman

521
00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:12.900
crazy woman

522
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.433
Silly woman

523
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.367
"Can't you hear me?"

524
00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:48.433
"You are lingering in my ear"

525
00:31:48.433 --> 00:31:55.667
"Close your eyes again and take a deep breath"

526
00:31:55.667 --> 00:32:03.067
"Count down the moments we have to face oh oh"

527
00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:10.900
"The rough waves will lift you up"

528
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.500
Tetsuo was also born to me in the tenth month of my pregnancy.

529
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.067
He was born to me...

530
00:32:18.067 --> 00:32:21.433
"On a dusty road"

531
00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:24.933
"You are the only respite"

532
00:32:24.933 --> 00:32:32.233
"Can you blow it occasionally?"

533
00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:40.700
"Can't get close to you"

534
00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:47.900
You didn't mean to stay friends for a year

535
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.367
Anyway...my heart made its own decision

536
00:32:56.333 --> 00:33:00.100
Except for the reason that I can't stand you

537
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.800
Are there any other reasons?

538
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.200
Dingchen

539
00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:08.233
Don't have any feelings for me between men and women

540
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:16.167
"The biting wind blows into my heart"

541
00:33:16.167 --> 00:33:19.800
"On a dusty road"

542
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.267
"You are the only respite"

543
00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:31.300
"Can you blow it occasionally?"

544
00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:35.633
I see you have been very depressed recently

545
00:33:35.633 --> 00:33:38.000
I specially prepared a surprise for you

546
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.500
But you don't seem to feel anything

547
00:33:45.167 --> 00:33:46.500
Right

548
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.933
There is a very strange prisoner today

549
00:33:50.933 --> 00:33:53.333
used as a theme for a movie
should be fun

550
00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:54.800
Do you want to listen to it?

551
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.333
Next time

552
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.833
Okay, let's eat first

553
00:34:04.567 --> 00:34:06.267
When we lived in Lishui

554
00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:10.200
You and Douxue are always inseparable

555
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.200
But I always feel that Douxue is always standing behind you

556
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.767
Protect you and sacrifice for you

557
00:34:19.767 --> 00:34:21.933
He even transferred to Agricultural High School

558
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.833
Why do you mention this suddenly...

559
00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.100
I ask you for the last time

560
00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:34.967
Were people really killed by Dou Xue at that time?

561
00:34:42.567 --> 00:34:44.467
Whether it was then or now...

562
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.533
You don't even see me

563
00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:49.633
Tetsuo…

564
00:34:49.633 --> 00:34:51.433
tell me the truth

565
00:34:51.433 --> 00:34:53.333
The truth is…

566
00:34:54.067 --> 00:34:57.267
I've been waiting for you for a long time

567
00:34:57.267 --> 00:35:00.000
But you always push me away

568
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.800
Don't avoid my sight

569
00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:04.933
Is the murderer really Douxue?

570
00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:11.800
Otherwise, do you think the murderer is someone else?

571
00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:15.900
Do you think it's me?

572
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.333
right

573
00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:25.633
I…

574
00:35:25.633 --> 00:35:29.900
I heard you felt aggrieved
Kicked out of film company

575
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.400
I can't even sleep well because I feel sorry for you.

576
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.033
Also indigestion

577
00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:36.433
I really want to help you and protect you

578
00:35:37.933 --> 00:35:40.900
But why do you always do it when I'm close to you?
push me away

579
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.767
Even doubt me

580
00:35:46.733 --> 00:35:48.200
if that's not true

581
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.700
I'm sorry

582
00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:52.400
really sorry

583
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.300
It's time for me to go

584
00:35:57.433 --> 00:36:00.967
After what happened to Brother Douxue

585
00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:04.067
I've been waiting for you to sort out your mood

586
00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.833
Can you give me a chance now?

587
00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:14.700
Let me take a breath, Dingchen

588
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.800
What do I have to do to give me a chance?

589
00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:24.567
I can't give you a chance Choi Cheol-woong

590
00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:30.433
Because when I see you, I will think of Douxue

591
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.367
sorry

592
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.100
Dingchen I...

593
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.000
I can do anything for you

594
00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.067
If you want me to kill someone, I can do it

595
00:36:46.533 --> 00:36:48.133
ok

596
00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.967
Okay…

597
00:36:51.967 --> 00:36:54.633
Even if I killed Yingzhuo with my own hands

598
00:36:54.633 --> 00:36:57.000
Even if I killed you

599
00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:01.267
If I killed you

600
00:37:01.267 --> 00:37:03.200
That's for you too

601
00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:05.133
do you know

602
00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:11.700
"let me go in my life"

603
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:19.333
"let me go in your life"

604
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.833
(Volume Real Estate)

605
00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:31.333
(Boss Xu Guili)

606
00:37:38.667 --> 00:37:43.133
I forget things when I drink lately. It's really bad.

607
00:37:43.133 --> 00:37:44.967
Thank you for the medicine, Boss Gao

608
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.300
you will be like this

609
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.167
It's not because of alcohol, it's because of loneliness

610
00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:54.333
Because there is no one around me and I am lonely

611
00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:55.733
So drink alone

612
00:37:55.733 --> 00:37:58.300
Drink alone, drink more
Of course I forget things

613
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.567
So you have to find a way to cure the root cause

614
00:38:02.467 --> 00:38:04.500
Let's start working

615
00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:09.533
Is it better to invest in the first phase of the new city?

616
00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:11.033
I said

617
00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:12.700
a mountain

618
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.100
Zhongdong

619
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.267
Pingcun

620
00:38:15.267 --> 00:38:16.200
Yamamoto

621
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.467
And Bundang

622
00:38:19.467 --> 00:38:21.700
I have visited all these good spots.

623
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.900
But there isn't even a place to plant the flag.

624
00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:28.933
Is it possible to catch no fish that slipped through the net?

625
00:38:28.933 --> 00:38:32.567
Then you have to have holes in the fishing net to catch fish.

626
00:38:32.567 --> 00:38:34.233
So the real estate industry

627
00:38:34.233 --> 00:38:36.867
The comparison is intelligence power.

628
00:38:36.867 --> 00:38:38.967
Boss Gao, an informant like you

629
00:38:38.967 --> 00:38:40.867
You should buy some land in the new city first, right?

630
00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:43.800
Oops, the government made it public

631
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.000
People all over the world will know

632
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.867
That can't be called intelligence.

633
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.233
Me too

634
00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:51.033
Didn't buy a piece of land

635
00:38:51.867 --> 00:38:52.800
So…

636
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.133
Is there no other place?

637
00:38:57.333 --> 00:38:59.400
Alas yo yo

638
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.700
Land with potential for future appreciation

639
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.467
I think it's here

640
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:04.467
(Pyeongtaek)

641
00:39:05.933 --> 00:39:08.300
West coast?

642
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.000
Although the government has announced reclamation
and west coast highway construction plan

643
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.933
But there's a lot of land here

644
00:39:13.933 --> 00:39:17.400
I think I'll be able to find some good land

645
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.200
My personal favorite is Pyeongtaek

646
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.900
After trade with China begins

647
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.433
Land near Pyeongtaek Port will definitely increase in value

648
00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:29.967
I have a good feeling

649
00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.667
indeed very possible

650
00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:32.933
Then…

651
00:39:32.933 --> 00:39:35.200
We jointly finance

652
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.000
Let’s go see the place together

653
00:39:42.933 --> 00:39:46.767
Are you afraid that I will cheat you of your money?

654
00:39:46.767 --> 00:39:48.700
Not like that…

655
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.333
Otherwise I will deposit the money into your account

656
00:39:53.333 --> 00:39:55.067
So you can trust me, right?

657
00:39:55.067 --> 00:39:57.433
There's no need for that...

658
00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:02.000
But then I can really trust you

659
00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.233
Then do it this way

660
00:40:07.533 --> 00:40:09.167
But in the end you...

661
00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:10.400
How many favors do I owe Douxue?

662
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.300
Are you willing to do this?

663
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.300
It's a long story

664
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.067
I will tell you slowly in the future

665
00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.300
Let's go eat now

666
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.267
No

667
00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:24.400
Strike while the iron is hot

668
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400
Go and have a look now

669
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.800
You can eat there

670
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.833
Don't do this

671
00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:33.367
Let’s find a restaurant with a nice atmosphere…

672
00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:35.100
Ms. Xu

673
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.267
Really

674
00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:41.367
It's really amazing

675
00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:43.067
Reclamation

676
00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:45.300
It’s like the Creator created the world

677
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.600
That's why I said

678
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.567
This has been since the founding of Tangun’s country
The largest land development project

679
00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:53.100
Waiting for the West Coast Expressway to open

680
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.967
There is absolutely no problem if it rises several times

681
00:40:58.133 --> 00:41:00.233
The scenery is so beautiful

682
00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:05.967
OMG…

683
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.500
What's wrong? You saw someone you know?

684
00:41:17.133 --> 00:41:19.100
That's Tetsuo's mother

685
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.167
What, Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong?

686
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.967
That enemy prosecutor

687
00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:30.433
here is what you said
Will that be the land where golden eggs are laid?

688
00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:32.033
That's right

689
00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:34.000
I investigated clearly

690
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.200
So what should I do now

691
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.200
Just do it the way you always have

692
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.933
That's it

693
00:41:44.133 --> 00:41:46.400
10% of income

694
00:41:48.733 --> 00:41:52.833
Team Leader Wu, you are still as greedy as ever.

695
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.733
I also have to support my family

696
00:41:59.833 --> 00:42:01.167
Got it

697
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.167
So be it

698
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.833
He is not an enemy

699
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.433
But that woman is here

700
00:42:10.433 --> 00:42:12.967
It seems like this place is really a treasure.

701
00:42:42.667 --> 00:42:44.800
You eat slower

702
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.367
to you

703
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:05.100
thank you very much

704
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.800
sorry

705
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.800
I've been waiting for you to call

706
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.833
please

707
00:43:12.833 --> 00:43:14.767
Come see me once a month

708
00:43:14.767 --> 00:43:18.000
No, you can meet me once in two months.

709
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.267
You know I can't contact you regularly

710
00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:24.300
And…

711
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.500
Recently I have started to gather comrades again

712
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.033
If I get caught, everything will be in vain

713
00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:31.467
Although it is hard

714
00:43:31.467 --> 00:43:32.667
But please be patient a little longer

715
00:43:32.667 --> 00:43:35.033
Then I will join you too

716
00:43:35.033 --> 00:43:37.067
No

717
00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:39.033
If you are caught again
everyone is in danger

718
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.733
please

719
00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:43.833
Please stay with me

720
00:43:44.533 --> 00:43:46.367
Zhenyu

721
00:44:00.733 --> 00:44:07.267
"Beautiful memories"

722
00:44:07.267 --> 00:44:13.400
"It's love"

723
00:44:15.967 --> 00:44:17.633
What's wrong

724
00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:18.800
Don't

725
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.200
Don't do this

726
00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:25.267
Aren't we lovers in love?

727
00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:28.067
i love you

728
00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:29.567
Then…

729
00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:31.267
why

730
00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:35.867
I'm scared

731
00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:37.367
Later

732
00:44:37.367 --> 00:44:39.233
later

733
00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:41.800
Zhenyu

734
00:44:46.867 --> 00:44:52.833
"Fiery Chest"

735
00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:57.000
"blue sky"

736
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.467
sorry

737
00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:03.533
It doesn't matter

738
00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:05.333
It's me who should apologize

739
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.067
You have to take good care of your body

740
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.567
aunt

741
00:45:32.067 --> 00:45:34.333
Oh, it's Dingchen

742
00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:35.800
Did you get home safely that day?

743
00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:40.433
Did I really say that?

744
00:45:40.433 --> 00:45:41.433
Yes

745
00:45:41.433 --> 00:45:43.233
you tell me

746
00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:45.467
Tetsuo is your child

747
00:45:47.467 --> 00:45:48.933
That's outrageous

748
00:45:48.933 --> 00:45:52.267
I go crazy when I'm drunk these days

749
00:45:52.267 --> 00:45:56.200
I must be crazy to say that.

750
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.900
That's what I said. Don't take it to heart.

751
00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.133
Really? Really not?

752
00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:04.100
No, really not

753
00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.767
Probably Dou Xue and Tetsuo
Play together all day long

754
00:46:07.767 --> 00:46:10.200
I only say that kind of stuff when I'm drunk

755
00:46:20.067 --> 00:46:21.467
That's right

756
00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:23.567
Tetsuo is my child

757
00:46:25.033 --> 00:46:27.200
In my mind he has always been

758
00:46:28.733 --> 00:46:30.567
Aunt, you really are

759
00:46:30.567 --> 00:46:32.900
I was shocked

760
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.800
How could you be frightened by such a thing?

761
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.900
You're so funny

762
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.533
Do you actually believe it?

763
00:46:38.533 --> 00:46:40.567
I want to drink some water

764
00:46:40.567 --> 00:46:41.767
You're really scared

765
00:46:47.833 --> 00:46:51.000
I specially asked Madam

766
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.333
This kind of thing still happens

767
00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:55.433
She was actually put in a detention center

768
00:46:55.433 --> 00:46:57.000
Really

769
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.800
I heard about it on the way here

770
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.933
I haven't even had time to talk to my son yet

771
00:47:06.633 --> 00:47:08.433
after i go home

772
00:47:08.433 --> 00:47:11.367
Ask the minister to intercede with the prosecutor general again.

773
00:47:11.367 --> 00:47:12.900
That level of illegal behavior

774
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.233
All chaebol companies will do

775
00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.800
Actually…

776
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:23.200
I want Prosecutor Choi
Meet my daughter

777
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.133
I heard that your son Prosecutor Choi
Not only very capable

778
00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:29.500
Still a bright future

779
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.500
stand in father's position

780
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.833
I want to help them create some fate

781
00:47:35.167 --> 00:47:38.300
After hearing about Prosecutor Choi

782
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.533
My daughter is very interested in him

783
00:47:39.533 --> 00:47:42.233
I want to meet him naturally

784
00:47:42.233 --> 00:47:44.200
That’s why I passed by myself

785
00:47:45.867 --> 00:47:48.600
I didn't know that was the case

786
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.167
I apologize to you on behalf of my son

787
00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:52.800
But…

788
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.500
The lawyer just went to see my daughter
he told me

789
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.733
Tell my dad for me

790
00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:02.933
I…

791
00:48:02.933 --> 00:48:05.000
The decision is his

792
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.233
My daughter seems to be very satisfied with Prosecutor Choi

793
00:48:09.867 --> 00:48:11.267
Really

794
00:48:11.267 --> 00:48:14.000
He actually likes to lock himself in
man in detention center

795
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.700
Minister please

796
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.033
My daughter must be released on bail

797
00:48:21.033 --> 00:48:24.000
After that our two families

798
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Let’s go play golf together again

799
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.333
The wishes of the parties are most important

800
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:31.167
Why do parents’ wishes matter?

801
00:48:31.707 --> 00:48:34.300
Anyway, you don’t have to worry too much

802
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.000
I will get your daughter released as soon as possible

803
00:48:43.033 --> 00:48:44.900
Things about Changsheng Group

804
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.667
Team Leader Wu’s information is very useful

805
00:48:47.667 --> 00:48:51.767
Most companies want to talk to their ministers
get married

806
00:48:51.767 --> 00:48:54.433
Especially like Changsheng Group

807
00:48:54.433 --> 00:48:56.267
Companies with capital turnover difficulties

808
00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:58.133
Of course it will be more positive

809
00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:02.167
Besides...their family only has daughters

810
00:49:02.167 --> 00:49:05.533
That's why he is so active
Looking for a son-in-law

811
00:49:05.533 --> 00:49:07.033
Although representative Geum Yeon-hee

812
00:49:07.033 --> 00:49:08.333
Just a daughter born to a mistress

813
00:49:08.333 --> 00:49:09.867
i know

814
00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:17.967
She is President Qin’s favorite
The child whose abilities are also most recognized

815
00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:19.700
That's right

816
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.900
Although the group is not in a good situation now

817
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.333
But they are still ranked in the financial world
Top 20 companies

818
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.433
If Changsheng Group can become Zhexiong's backer,

819
00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:32.767
He can dream greater dreams

820
00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:34.667
In short

821
00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:38.433
Tetsuo must be made to think that they met by chance

822
00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:42.400
Otherwise he will definitely reject you. You have to be careful.

823
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.433
Of course

824
00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:48.633
I think even if you enter politics yourself
Can also do well

825
00:49:50.533 --> 00:49:52.233
After it's done

826
00:49:52.233 --> 00:49:55.333
I will prepare another thank you gift for Team Leader Wu

827
00:49:55.333 --> 00:49:57.467
I am always grateful to you

828
00:49:58.933 --> 00:50:00.933
But…

829
00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:03.433
The minister also knows

830
00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:05.533
Prosecutor Choi’s marriage?

831
00:50:07.967 --> 00:50:10.333
Of course let him know

832
00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:11.967
After all he...

833
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:15.000
He is also a very simple person in love.

834
00:50:18.333 --> 00:50:21.033
That person is coming soon

835
00:50:23.233 --> 00:50:25.000
Hello Mr. Che

836
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.400
I have followed the madam's instructions.

837
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.233
Thank you for your hard work

838
00:50:32.567 --> 00:50:36.633
I shouldn't have done that to my daughter

839
00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:41.600
You need to know how to do that
It's not easy for me

840
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.833
I will follow the agreement

841
00:50:42.833 --> 00:50:45.900
Help you avoid tax investigations

842
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.200
It will also give you priority in foreign exchange

843
00:50:52.067 --> 00:50:53.733
But…

844
00:50:53.733 --> 00:50:57.333
I think she's not actually my daughter

845
00:50:57.333 --> 00:51:00.900
It’s Prosecutor Choi who wants to die or live.
like my daughter

846
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.933
Are you trying to break up my daughter and Prosecutor Choi?
That's it

847
00:51:08.133 --> 00:51:09.800
Am I right?

848
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.100
boss

849
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.467
If you have finished speaking

850
00:51:14.467 --> 00:51:16.100
You can go back now

851
00:51:18.233 --> 00:51:22.533
I'm in the film industry
I've seen all kinds of people

852
00:51:22.533 --> 00:51:25.033
But people like mrs.
This is my first time seeing

853
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.533
By a beautiful face

854
00:51:29.533 --> 00:51:33.067
Turn people into pawns in your hands

855
00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:39.133
I will definitely use Madam as a prototype in the future
write a movie

856
00:51:40.733 --> 00:51:41.933
if possible

857
00:51:41.933 --> 00:51:44.433
Please write a happy ending

858
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.600
Is that something I can decide?

859
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.800
If you keep doing this we can't...

860
00:51:52.967 --> 00:51:54.667
Got it

861
00:51:57.767 --> 00:52:01.367
Anyway, I have done as the lady wanted.

862
00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:05.567
Please don't mess with me and my daughter again

863
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.200
If you are tired

864
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.933
Just go back and rest, madam.

865
00:52:21.367 --> 00:52:24.333
It has to be a happy ending

866
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:27.433
Me too, Tetsuo too

867
00:52:27.433 --> 00:52:28.900
And the minister

868
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.633
That must be the case, ma'am.

869
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.067
Special assistant to the Minister of Security and Enterprise?

870
00:52:37.067 --> 00:52:40.267
In order to fulfill your instructions,
important secret mission

871
00:52:40.267 --> 00:52:42.467
I need a reliable person

872
00:52:42.467 --> 00:52:43.967
That's why I'm looking for you

873
00:52:43.967 --> 00:52:46.333
But…

874
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:48.700
I like the prosecutor's job

875
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.167
After the mission is over

876
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:53.167
If you want to go back to the prosecutor's office
i won't stop you

877
00:52:54.733 --> 00:52:56.567
Just think of it as helping me.

878
00:52:57.533 --> 00:52:59.367
What is the important secret mission?

879
00:53:00.067 --> 00:53:01.367
Northern diplomacy…

880
00:53:02.133 --> 00:53:04.967
Northern diplomacy?

881
00:53:04.967 --> 00:53:08.300
(International routes)

882
00:53:22.567 --> 00:53:25.867
(near Tokyo, Japan)

883
00:54:54.367 --> 00:54:56.333
Thank you for your hard work

884
00:54:56.333 --> 00:54:57.733
Thank you for your hard work

885
00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:14.500
Douxue is too much

886
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.333
why take this road

887
00:55:24.733 --> 00:55:26.600
hand over my money

888
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.000
I know you are cheating

889
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.433
before I kill you all
hand over my money

890
00:55:33.533 --> 00:55:34.900
How much

891
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.333
10 million yen

892
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.400
OK, take it

893
00:55:45.067 --> 00:55:46.700
Douxue, come on

894
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.467
"Can I come back to you again?"

895
00:55:55.467 --> 00:55:58.433
"trembling eyes"

896
00:55:58.433 --> 00:56:02.133
"Looks more sad"

897
00:56:02.133 --> 00:56:08.967
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

898
00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:11.967
"your name"

899
00:56:11.967 --> 00:56:16.400
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

900
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.133
Is the amount correct?

901
00:56:53.133 --> 00:56:54.300
Yes, just right

902
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.233
There will be distinguished guests coming from afar tomorrow
You have to be prepared

903
00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:01.300
When will we return to Korea?

904
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.867
(Cai Dongba, underground economic giant in Japan)
The timing is up to me

905
00:57:03.867 --> 00:57:05.633
You must abide by the agreement

906
00:57:05.633 --> 00:57:08.600
It's up to me to decide whether to keep the promise or not.

907
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.567
Only when you have strength can you doubt and protest

908
00:57:11.567 --> 00:57:13.333
Until then…

909
00:57:13.333 --> 00:57:15.567
Don't let others know your thoughts

910
00:57:15.567 --> 00:57:18.267
That's how you can survive

911
00:57:20.633 --> 00:57:21.967
what is that

912
00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:24.967
seems to be human

913
00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:27.333
pick him up

914
00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.033
Pick him up...

915
00:57:29.033 --> 00:57:29.767
Hurry up

916
00:57:29.767 --> 00:57:31.800
Because I haven’t returned to my motherland for a long time

917
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.900
I saved you who was dying
And help you smuggle across the country

918
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.133
Master, he is still alive

919
00:57:37.133 --> 00:57:37.933
he is still alive

920
00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:39.867
His wound is big

921
00:57:39.867 --> 00:57:41.533
Hurry, move quickly

922
00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:44.367
All died once

923
00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:47.100
Should you live longer this time?

924
00:58:07.367 --> 00:58:10.433
Thank you both for coming all the way.

925
00:58:10.433 --> 00:58:11.867
I am Cai Dongba

926
00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:14.467
Nice to meet you. My name is Huang Zhongcheng.

927
00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:15.833
And this is...

928
00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:18.333
My Special Assistant Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

929
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.433
We brought good ones from Korea
Here comes the makgeolli

930
00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.233
Let's talk over a drink together

931
00:58:25.733 --> 00:58:27.000
OK

932
00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:32.900
northern policy

933
00:58:33.433 --> 00:58:34.567
Of course

934
00:58:34.567 --> 00:58:37.900
We have used various channels
Trying to communicate with the Soviet Union

935
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.867
But there is no conclusion yet

936
00:58:39.867 --> 00:58:43.033
Besides, North Korea has been getting in our way

937
00:58:43.033 --> 00:58:46.800
As far as I know you have always
All have exchanges with Kazakhstan

938
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.233
If you are willing to help

939
00:58:48.233 --> 00:58:51.667
The Korean government will definitely reward you

940
00:58:51.667 --> 00:58:54.067
good

941
00:58:54.067 --> 00:58:56.867
I will try my best

942
00:58:56.867 --> 00:58:58.500
thank you

943
00:59:01.167 --> 00:59:06.267
My granddaughter will serve as my agent
Go to Korea first

944
00:59:07.233 --> 00:59:08.967
She came just in time

945
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.433
This is my granddaughter

946
00:59:11.433 --> 00:59:12.833
Cai Xiayan

947
00:59:12.833 --> 00:59:15.833
Say hi. They're from Korea.

948
00:59:15.833 --> 00:59:17.667
Hello, my name is Cai Xiayan.

949
00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:19.033
nice to meet you

950
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.000
My name is Choi Cheol-woong

951
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.167
Please take care of me

952
00:59:34.033 --> 00:59:35.700
Yes

953
01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:38.733
(Oasis)

954
01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:42.267
You will get medals and get promoted

955
01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:43.600
I miss you very much

956
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.700
Douxue

957
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.033
If you want to live peacefully

958
01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:48.100
Everything must be restored to its original state

959
01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.300
Use rogue methods

960
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.000
Did I kill Brother Douxue?

961
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.300
Brother Douxue’s mother said that Dingchen and I are very compatible.

962
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.733
Want us to get married

963
01:00:55.733 --> 01:00:58.833
So you should be nicer to me in the future

964
01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.200
He went around asking for bribes from pachinko operators

965
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.367
Remove immediately

966
01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.000
Let's conduct a detention investigation

967
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Who ordered the hit and run?

968
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.667
You are like that to me

969
01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:08.700
like precious memories

970
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.433
Dingchen
