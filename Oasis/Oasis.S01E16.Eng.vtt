00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.267
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.833
The two are not related by blood

3
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.767
Of course…

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.833
You are still the one

5
00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:38.967
Foolishly unable to recognize his son's father

6
00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.567
You know the size is right without wearing it

7
00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.033
After all, it's my son's pajamas

8
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.467
(Paris Salon)

9
00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:57.933
(final episode)

10
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.367
The guests have all left

11
00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:00.467
Let's go

12
00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.700
I haven’t danced in a long time. Do you want to dance?

13
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.100
Your ex-husband was alive

14
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.833
Do you love you well?

15
00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.200
Why do you suddenly bring up things from the past?

16
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.800
He's not a gentle and considerate kind of man

17
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.033
The elders are also eager to promote marriages.

18
00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.867
I don't have those feelings for him

19
00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:51.533
You're the only man I've ever truly loved

20
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.033
why

21
00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.900
Is it because I have a high position?

22
00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.233
Didn't you have a high position before?

23
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.867
You were...

24
00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:04.167
Really rustic and poor

25
00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.200
Yes

26
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Other female college students
Don't even look at me

27
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.867
Everything about you is attractive to me

28
00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:16.867
That's when I found out

29
00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:19.733
so called love...

30
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.067
It’s not that I think that person is cute

31
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:26.833
But when looking at him...

32
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.633
Heart full of love

33
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.567
Isn't it the same for you?

34
00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.733
Facing flaws

35
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:36.367
Imperfect me

36
00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.267
Still cherish and like me

37
00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm always grateful

38
00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.667
Me too

39
00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:52.933
But…

40
00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.300
You're a little weird today

41
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.067
Feeling a little distant

42
00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:59.000
And a little sensitive

43
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.733
I want to ask you something

44
00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:06.567
What's going on

45
00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:13.600
everyone has a secret

46
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.033
Can't tell the people closest to me

47
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:21.067
The kind of secrets that might hurt each other if you tell them

48
00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:24.533
Do you have that kind of secret?

49
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.633
No

50
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.833
That's good

51
00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:33.667
But even if...

52
00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:36.133
Do you really have a secret like that?

53
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If it's something that will hurt me

54
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.233
I hope you don't tell anyone
Keep that thing in your heart forever

55
00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:53.533
It's not easy for us to renew our relationship

56
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.433
I don't want to lose you again

57
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.967
That won't happen

58
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.967
Because you are my first

59
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.633
He is also the last man to love deeply

60
00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:18.433
thank you

61
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.533
And…

62
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.300
I have one more thing to tell you

63
00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:36.900
Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong

64
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.833
Not your biological son

65
00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:52.567
for our family

66
00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.567
Please be loyal until the end

67
00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:12.367
That guy is really crazy

68
00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.067
Hey, should we call the police and arrest him?

69
00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:17.233
Please don't say stupid things

70
00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.100
If Huang Zhongcheng wants to cover the sky with one hand,
It's so easy

71
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.267
What's urgent now
It’s to protect Douxue’s safety

72
00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:25.467
They will definitely be on Wu Wanxu
Find the bug

73
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.600
This is a top secret

74
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.133
Employees are asked to keep their mouths shut

75
00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.033
We found a bug on him

76
00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:43.367
It's made in Japan

77
00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:46.467
Can receive radio waves
Record sounds within 200 meters

78
00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:47.833
Recording

79
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.067
I heard that after Lee Doo-hak returned to Korea,

80
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:53.000
I've been looking for Lee Yongdeok

81
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.833
what

82
00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.700
He seems to be doubting...

83
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.500
Someone instigated him to kill

84
00:05:58.433 --> 00:05:59.900
minister

85
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.067
I heard that Team Leader Wu died

86
00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:04.500
is that true

87
00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.133
Yes

88
00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.667
He seems to have some relationship with Li Douxue

89
00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:16.300
Immediately publicly arrest Li Douxue

90
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.233
Mobilize all human resources

91
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.600
Cooperate with the prosecutor to arrest him

92
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.500
If he resists, you can shoot him on the spot.

93
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.767
If you find any information, bring it to me immediately

94
00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:27.067
And…

95
00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.400
Monitor all media

96
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.467
Don't let them publish company news

97
00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:31.700
Be quick

98
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.700
Shoot?

99
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.967
Why don't you start taking action soon?

100
00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.333
The Ministry of National Security Planning stated

101
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:41.867
Lee Doo-hak, who was attracted by the Central Federation of Korea in Japan

102
00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.200
Changed identity to Lee Hyung-guo, an overseas Chinese in Japan

103
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.533
Sneaking into the country for espionage

104
00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.333
It is reported that this case is closely related to him

105
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.467
And Li Douxue

106
00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:54.267
Very knowledgeable about domestic geographical information

107
00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:56.700
In order to prevent him from being on the run for a long time
what spy

108
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.600
The police decided to publicly arrest
Damn guys

109
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.267
It seems it's not safe here either

110
00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:02.967
we are surrounded

111
00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.000
May I ask who it is?

112
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.400
It's me Dingchen

113
00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:21.567
Dingchen

114
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.533
sister-in-law

115
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:24.267
Douxue gives it to you

116
00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:25.567
have you seen the news

117
00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:29.767
The police want to catch you
There are inspections everywhere in the city

118
00:07:29.767 --> 00:07:31.233
why do they do this to you

119
00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:32.833
Why do you say you are a spy?

120
00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:33.800
Your situation is also very dangerous

121
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.300
I'll explain it to you later

122
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.567
Are they all here?

123
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:42.867
It would be dangerous for everyone to be together

124
00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:44.433
Don't gather here. Run away separately.

125
00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:45.967
I will take Douxue away

126
00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.067
Where are you taking him?

127
00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:51.533
just in case
It's better if everyone doesn't know.

128
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.700
That's right

129
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.967
Why do you have to do this?

130
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.533
I killed the person

131
00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.467
He and Li Douxue are in the same group

132
00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:29.433
He also used Li Dou to learn about his father’s death.

133
00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:32.000
threaten your mother

134
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.300
So…

135
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.533
I'm here to protect our family
Just killed him

136
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.867
But…

137
00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:41.733
A bug was found in Team Leader Wu's clothes

138
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.433
Li Douxue recorded the sound

139
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.533
is true

140
00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:55.500
I didn't expect to be betrayed by my trusted subordinate.

141
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.033
But still…

142
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:01.500
There is no need to shoot Lee Doo Hak...

143
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.967
Then tell me

144
00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:05.533
is there any better way
Can protect our family

145
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.400
don't worry

146
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:21.067
Dad will take care of everything

147
00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:24.033
Nothing will happen to our family

148
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.200
I guessed you would come

149
00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:43.533
things get a little tricky

150
00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:45.167
Yes

151
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.867
So I didn’t warn you, President

152
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:49.233
This is it

153
00:09:49.233 --> 00:09:50.833
Spy?

154
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.300
So we will be arrested too?

155
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.667
Of course not

156
00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:58.500
you were just taken advantage of

157
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.667
You just need to accept the formal survey

158
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.633
And…

159
00:10:02.633 --> 00:10:04.267
After catching Li Douxue

160
00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.700
Your business can continue

161
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.600
Is this the work of a young prosecutor?
Or...

162
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.500
What era is it now? What works?

163
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.367
So is he really a spy?

164
00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:20.367
That's outrageous

165
00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:21.767
that's not important

166
00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:25.267
If the minister decides that, then that's it

167
00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:26.700
I will cut ties with him

168
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.867
What matters is our business

169
00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:31.433
you are wise

170
00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:34.267
Then we leave first

171
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.833
boat

172
00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:40.033
Well, let me ask the captain who helped you stow away last time.

173
00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:41.533
You stay on that boat for now

174
00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.500
If things don't go right, just leave.

175
00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:45.567
That's not okay

176
00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:46.733
I don't want to leave anymore

177
00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.133
I can go to you Douxue

178
00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:51.333
All smuggling routes should be targeted.

179
00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:54.500
The captain must have also read the news.

180
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.000
Give him more money

181
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.367
He wouldn't be willing to help spies, right?

182
00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:00.500
What should I do?

183
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.567
No one is willing to help hide a spy

184
00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:08.300
Except for people who are really spies

185
00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:11.000
Huang Zhongcheng, the big bad guy

186
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.100
How can I frame you as a spy?

187
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.633
It seems that I have no choice but to surrender.

188
00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.200
what

189
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.867
Prosecutor Kim Sung-yeop

190
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.667
I'm here

191
00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:30.333
homeless man

192
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.800
Will you live alone after your divorce?

193
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.633
I live alone after my divorce
So life is very simple

194
00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:38.067
Take a seat

195

(Shuixi land subscription privileges

196
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.100
You can remarry soon

197
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.700
so suddenly

198
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.000
Do you want to help me introduce a remarriage partner?

199
00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:55.933
My wife ran away

200
00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:58.067
Who dares to marry me

201
00:11:58.067 --> 00:11:59.400
you will become famous

202
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.500
Then...your wife will come back, right?

203
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.733
become famous

204
00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:06.500
You said the one you gave me
Secret financial ledger?

205
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.833
Can that really be believed?

206
00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:11.233
What will it take for you to believe me?

207
00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:15.067
if i tell you
Someone wants to kill me for that account book

208
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.100
Will you believe it?

209
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.867
Think about it

210
00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:20.400
can make the birds in the sky

212
00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:25.567
Why kill a homeless man?

(Shuixi land subscription privileges

214

217
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.767
it's me

218
00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:52.833
Can you believe me now?

219
00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:55.267
But…

220
00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.833
Even if you just catch a spy

221
00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.133
It was also a great contribution to the prosecutor.

222
00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.800
Maybe

223
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.367
Why should I help one?
Mouse with no way to escape

224
00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:12.233
because of mice

225
00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:15.733
Sometimes they bite the bridge of the cat's nose

226
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.767
Is the press release ready?

227
00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.767
Well, it's almost ready.

228
00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:25.667
Proofread it

229
00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:28.967
There will definitely be an uproar in a week

230
00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:30.300
No

231
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.700
Will be released tomorrow

232
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.833
what

233
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.100
It may be too late tomorrow

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.900
The printing house is resting

235
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.300
You have to find a way to solve it

236
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.167
It will still be scrapped

237
00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:43.567
Of course we have to find a way to solve it

238
00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:44.533
So

239
00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.933
Please come into the company immediately

240
00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:55.700

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.100
what should i do

242

Negotiated the shady story of Shuixi land development

All require special subscription

260
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.333
Hello

261
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.467
Is it really you who is on the news now?

262
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.600
Don't you know about this too?

263
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.933
I ask you if you don’t know either

264
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.867
I heard that my mother invested
President Geum Man-cheol’s career

265
00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:04.333
But I never thought about that and the Shuixi area
Privilege subscription case related

266
00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.333
Then you should tell me

267
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:09.433
Because mom...

268
00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:11.433
It seems like I'm hiding it from dad

269
00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:13.200
sorry

270
00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:16.767
How dare you underestimate me

271
00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:18.667
Look down on our family

272
00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.500
Immediately send people to seize the "current affairs attack"

273
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.633
And…

274
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:25.200
Go investigate everyone related to Li Douxue

275
00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:37.100
Borrowed…

276
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.133
Let me borrow it

277
00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:46.800
good

278
00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:51.033
OK I got it

279
00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:58.400
This is a seizure warrant

280
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.867
please help

281
00:15:59.867 --> 00:16:01.300
Just search it

282
00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:04.400
Let's get started

283
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.800
When did you become a current affairs weekly?
Issuer

284
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.500
Didn't I say that?

285
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.400
I will protect Douxue

286
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.967
Hello Dingchen

287
00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:18.067
If this continues, Brother Douxue will really die.

288
00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:20.500
Look, your opponent is state power.

289
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.533
What if you are also injured?

290
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.967
Tetsuo

291
00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:29.267
I was watching some good movies
I realized something

292
00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:33.033
Power is more intoxicating than wine

293
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.100
But those with knives

294
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.467
When you are very drunk, you will hold the knife backwards

295
00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:42.667
What you are holding is not the handle, but the blade.

296
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:45.833
I don’t even know that my hands are bleeding.

297
00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:49.167
Citizens without knives
It’s not because you are strong that you win

298
00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:50.900
So don't be so sure

299
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.067
You are very smart and should know very well

300
00:16:54.767 --> 00:16:57.600
Dingchen, don’t be like this

301
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.833
My protection for you has limits

302
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:02.033
It doesn't matter

303
00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:04.967
I won't die just because of a knife

304
00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:06.533
And…

305
00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:09.533
Where is Douxue? I really don’t know.

306
00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:11.000
Because he didn't tell me either

307
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.700
Shuixi's case

308
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.067
I will be responsible for

309
00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:19.000
congratulations

310
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.133
Congratulations on what

311
00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.533
Are you secretly helping me behind my back?

312
00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:25.100
Right

313
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.433
Should we submit the secret fund documents of the Ministry of Security and Enterprise?
Check it out too

314
00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:30.767
It can’t be made public all at once

315
00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.267
They will definitely deny the suspicion

316
00:17:32.267 --> 00:17:33.367
Or find a way to narrow down the suspicion

317
00:17:33.367 --> 00:17:34.433
There will also be pressure from outside

318
00:17:34.433 --> 00:17:35.400
And…

319
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.200
I might be detained

320
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.400
It takes some time now

321
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.167
sorry

322
00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:44.367
I really don't know at all
That's an illegal privilege

323
00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:46.600
Didn't I give you enough?

324
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.400
I'm not doing it for myself

325
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.033
I know you have big dreams

326
00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:55.767
You are going to participate in the next parliamentary election

327
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.833
There are further plans later

328
00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:01.500
Tetsuo will also succeed you in the future

329
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.267
So…

330
00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:06.200
I was in the mood to reserve food
to do that

331
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.967
if i do something wrong

332
00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:11.600
i am willing to be punished

333
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:15.500
In order not to affect you

334
00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:18.400
I will go to the prosecutor myself to decide

335
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.233
Tetsuo, I’ll leave it to you, my dear.

336
00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:26.433
Tetsuo

337
00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:29.200
Is it really our child?

338
00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:35.033
I will protect our family
you don't have to worry

339
00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.633
Husband

340
00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:43.433
Wait until things are done

341
00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:47.367
I want to dance with you again

342
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.600
I will practice well

343
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.333
I will definitely dance better next time

344
00:18:55.933 --> 00:18:57.833
I love you Ruzhen

345
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.667
Did you even give it to the Blue House?

346
00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.500
How much did you give

347
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.467
About 15 billion won

348
00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:19.533
Then the ruling party should also give it

349
00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.400
Where is the opposition party?

350
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.467
Also gave

351
00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:26.833
Did the opposition parties also receive money?

352
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.067
Yes

353
00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:30.567
Although the amount given is less than that of the ruling party

354
00:19:32.967 --> 00:19:34.667
minister

355
00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.933
I'll be fine

356
00:19:37.933 --> 00:19:40.133
I didn't do this to save you

357
00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:42.567
But you should know if I don't survive

358
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:46.733
No one can survive

359
00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:50.067
including your wife

360
00:19:52.967 --> 00:19:54.533
Sorry

361
00:19:54.533 --> 00:19:57.100
Even if you can save your life

362
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.600
You also have to be prepared to give up an arm

363
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.100
it's me

364
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.967
Chairman Qin bribed people from both parties regardless of whether he was in power or against the opposition.

365
00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:09.667
Please help me tell you

366
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.633
It must be negotiated jointly by both the ruling and opposition parties.
Don't let the incident expand

367
00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:15.533
It is also necessary to coordinate with each other

368
00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:21.233
Punishment and Chairman Geum Man-chul
Just contact the members of Congress directly.

369
00:20:21.233 --> 00:20:22.500
Of course

370
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.000
A few people had to be sacrificed to do this.

371
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.267
And we must apologize to the people

372
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.067
Come

373
00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:33.633
Come

374
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.000
Start over

375
00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:39.867
I'm so hungry

376
00:20:39.867 --> 00:20:42.833
Order me a piece of snow soup

377
00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:50.800
So delicious

378
00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:53.000
You eat it too

379
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.967
I really followed the commander's instructions.

380
00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:57.467
is true

381
00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:04.200
I have a recording of the conversation between the three of them

382
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:10.000
I went to greet President Qin Manchul, a regular customer.
Just went in

383
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.967
He said there was a good business that he wanted me to invest in

384
00:21:11.967 --> 00:21:13.933
I just invested

385
00:21:13.933 --> 00:21:15.900
If you know it's illegal

386
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.100
Wife of a civil servant

387
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.400
How could I do that and get in trouble?
About my husband

388
00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:23.400
what

389
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.767
Stop checking

390
00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:27.233
I've just started now

391
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.100
Other groups will be responsible

392
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.533
You still pretend not to know. Stop checking.

393
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.400
why are you doing this

394
00:21:36.867 --> 00:21:39.800
Don’t you want me to work hard?

395
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.300
This is no ordinary case

396
00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:47.000
What ability do I have?

397
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.967
The superiors don't allow us to do it. What can I do?

398
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:53.700
Please keep your dignity

399
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.600
How do you plan to face your juniors in the future?

400
00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.267
Really

401
00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:07.433
Now…

402
00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:10.233
Is it time to reveal the secret account books?

403
00:22:10.233 --> 00:22:11.333
According to the current momentum

404
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.967
They can even suppress that.

405
00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:15.133
What to do now

406
00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.900
Isn't it just for the account books?
Are you framed as a spy?

407
00:22:21.267 --> 00:22:22.900
There are other reasons

408
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.167
what reason

409
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.367
What other reason is there?

410
00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:28.767
Say it quickly

411
00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:34.967
Could it be...

412
00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:39.533
You have other evidence

413
00:22:39.533 --> 00:22:41.467
give me a little more time

414
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.367
(The president will hold a speech to apologize to the people)

415
00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:44.300
This…

416
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.200
Is this true?

417
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.867
Several high-level representatives were arrested

418
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.700
Then I wanted to apologize and take it with me

419
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.933
They really look down on the people

420
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.267
Can the country function normally like this?

421
00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:02.533
I'd better shave my head and become a monk.

422
00:23:03.567 --> 00:23:04.733
Dingchen

423
00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:07.667
who are you

424
00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:11.733
is my guest

425
00:23:11.733 --> 00:23:14.167
Representative Shen, please let me talk to him alone.

426
00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:16.533
good

427
00:23:18.233 --> 00:23:19.700
what is this

428
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.300
They framed me as a spy

429
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.133
what

430
00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:26.267
This is the last card in my hand

431
00:23:26.267 --> 00:23:27.633
Make this recording public

432
00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:31.033
You can get rid of Huang Zhongcheng and Cui Zhexiong in one go

433
00:23:34.433 --> 00:23:36.933
Who else knows about this besides you?

434
00:23:36.933 --> 00:23:39.067
I'm just telling you

435
00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:40.633
for our family

436
00:23:40.633 --> 00:23:42.867
Please be loyal until the end

437
00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:47.100
Dou…douxue

438
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.467
Huang Zhongcheng will go to jail

439
00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:51.867
Choi Cheol-woong…

440
00:23:51.867 --> 00:23:53.500
Will also fall into the abyss

441
00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:56.000
Then what else is there to worry about?

442
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.467
I might also help raise secret funds

443
00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:01.833
There are also people who are punished for smuggling

444
00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:02.833
What else can we do?

445
00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:05.067
They say you are a spy

446
00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:07.067
There is no other way now

447
00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:10.033
i want the last time

448
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.000
Go and discuss terms with them

449
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.467
With whom

450
00:24:13.467 --> 00:24:15.233
Are you following Huang Zhongcheng?

451
00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:17.500
Will he negotiate terms with you? Impossible

452
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.500
He must want to kill you as soon as he sees you

453
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.667
Dingchen

454
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.367
can you go with me

455
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.167
do you want to die

456
00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:43.767
I'll just say it straight, Auntie

457
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.433
This is about the lives of the minister and Tetsuo

458
00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:52.000
It's also about your life

459
00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:53.767
what

460
00:24:56.633 --> 00:24:58.267
minister

461
00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:00.500
for our family

462
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.533
Please be loyal until the end

463
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.967
How is it possible

464
00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:16.433
To take such a fake tape

465
00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:18.600
come threaten me

466
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.567
if that is false

467
00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:24.533
Why are you trying to frame me as a spy?
Force me to death

468
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.300
You…

469
00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:40.167
You…
I won’t say much more

470
00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:42.033
Please tell the minister

471
00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:43.667
I want him to clear my name

472
00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.767
Let Dingchen and I and my family

473
00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.367
Just live abroad quietly

474
00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:55.067
what
Will Tetsuo be buried by this society?

475
00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:57.767
depends on mrs.

476
00:25:57.767 --> 00:25:59.733
I give you 24 hours

477
00:26:02.867 --> 00:26:06.767
If you want to lie to seduce me
What trick are you playing on me?

478
00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:08.233
I will immediately

479
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.067
Make that recording public

480
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.967
That guy Li Douxue

481
00:26:19.967 --> 00:26:21.300
Husband

482
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.700
I am Huang Zhongcheng

483
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.000
Will he lose to that gangster?

484
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.333
don't worry

485
00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:28.233
I'll catch that guy soon

486
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:29.333
i will kill him

487
00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:30.867
I will kill him with my own hands

488
00:26:30.867 --> 00:26:32.767
But if he releases that recording...

489
00:26:32.767 --> 00:26:35.133
Who would believe what a spy says?

490
00:26:35.133 --> 00:26:36.100
And…

491
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.767
The media is under my control

492
00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:40.767
But what if he does go public...

493
00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:42.200
I've been involved in the Shuixi Incident

494
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.533
Then you will be in danger too

495
00:26:43.533 --> 00:26:45.267
That won't happen

496
00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:47.100
Can't give in to that kid

497
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.700
So don't mention that again

498
00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:54.933
Husband

499
00:26:56.133 --> 00:26:58.033
Husband

500
00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:00.767
sorry

501
00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:03.667
thank you

502
00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:11.433
Yes

503
00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:12.967
Don't worry, just trust me

504
00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:17.000
I now...

505
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.700
I really can only rely on you

506
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.533
(suspected of espionage
Li Douxue is publicly wanted)

507
00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:53.667
Mom, go in and take a nap.

508
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.967
ok

509
00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:59.433
If you continue like this you will fall ill

510
00:27:59.867 --> 00:28:01.400
Zhenyu

511
00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:07.700
I must have committed something in my previous life
heinous crime

512
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.633
Otherwise, how could this happen?

513
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.533
Mom

514
00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:17.100
This can't be the case...

515
00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:25.467
madam

516
00:28:33.167 --> 00:28:35.000
Stupid mother

517
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.800
Tetsuo…

518
00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:41.000
Please save Tetsuo

519
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.133
what

520
00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:51.933
So we have to save Dougak and Tetsuo

521
00:28:51.933 --> 00:28:55.667
We can't let Douxue
Release the tapes he has

522
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.233
Is that what you mean?

523
00:28:57.233 --> 00:28:58.833
That's right

524
00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:01.233
What's that tape about?

525
00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:03.900
I can't tell you this

526
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.967
If I let you know

527
00:29:05.967 --> 00:29:07.767
Your situation will also become dangerous

528
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:12.700
What on earth is so scary?

529
00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:14.667
Anyway…

530
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:16.833
If that tape is released

531
00:29:16.833 --> 00:29:19.167
Fighting to learn will lead to death

532
00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:20.833
Tetsuo will die too

533
00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:23.567
so please

534
00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:25.933
Douxue must be stopped

535
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.333
If we can save them

536
00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:30.867
Of course I want to stop Douxue

537
00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:34.467
I will try my best to stop Douxue

538
00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:47.967
Tetsuo

539
00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:50.133
Why is aunt here?

540
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.267
I came here because I was worried

541
00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:57.667
That's it

542
00:29:57.667 --> 00:29:59.467
News says Dou Hak is a spy

543
00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:02.333
I really can't figure out the reason

544
00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.333
Heart beating wildly every day

545
00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:06.233
Can't sleep at all

546
00:30:06.233 --> 00:30:07.800
Everyone, please sit down first

547
00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.500
What do you want from me?

548
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:19.700
Just wait a moment

549
00:30:25.233 --> 00:30:26.533
Douxue

550
00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:30.900
Douxue
Mom, why are you here?

551
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.600
What's going on

552
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.100
are you okay

553
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.367
You're not injured anywhere, right?

554
00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:38.733
I'm fine

555
00:30:38.733 --> 00:30:39.867
What's this

556
00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:41.667
Didn't you say you would come alone?

557
00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:44.233
This is the best way I can think of

558
00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:46.467
What's wrong? Are you afraid that I will eat you?

559
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.500
So did you get an answer?

560
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.767
What answer

561
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.767
what is he talking about

562
00:30:57.267 --> 00:30:59.100
I asked your dad for something

563
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.200
Let Douxue follow Dingchen

564
00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:03.967
and their families

565
00:31:03.967 --> 00:31:07.500
can leave the country safely

566
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.533
Use this condition to exchange tapes with them

567
00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.833
Mom

568
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.933
Douxue has to survive, right?

569
00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:13.733
Who allowed them to do this?

570
00:31:13.733 --> 00:31:16.167
You don’t want Douxue to die, right?

571
00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:19.000
I didn’t expect you to think about me so much.

572
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.300
What about dad?

573
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.633
Did dad agree?

574
00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.867
It takes some time to convince him

575
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.300
Douxue

576
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.100
I will definitely convince him

577
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.700
give me a little more time

578
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.133
Mom, stop talking

579
00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:36.333
This matter has nothing to do with you

580
00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.167
You also know the contents of the tape, right?

581
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:39.800
If your father falls

582
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.167
whether it's you or me
There's only one way out for both of us.

583
00:31:42.167 --> 00:31:44.033
Don't interfere in this matter

584
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.567
Nothing much to say

585
00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.567
Just hand over the tape and turn yourself in.

586
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.267
That's your way to survive

587
00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:55.667
Surrender yourself?

588
00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:59.200
It’s not enough for me to help you with the crime of murder.

589
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.833
Do you still have to help your father with the murder charge now?

590
00:32:06.267 --> 00:32:07.700
Douxue Tetsuo

591
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.533
You can't have a conflict like this

592
00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:11.833
Really not possible

593
00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:12.667
madam

594
00:32:12.667 --> 00:32:14.800
Now... we can't go on like this anymore

595
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.333
madam

596
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.333
You two are brothers

597
00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:23.933
You two...

598
00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:26.867
I gave birth to them all in ten months of pregnancy...

599
00:32:26.867 --> 00:32:29.133
brothers

600
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.533
Mom...what does this mean?

601
00:32:35.533 --> 00:32:39.033
Aunt, then you were
What you say when you're drunk...

602
00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:42.967
Auntie what are you talking about

603
00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:45.700
How can I be your son

604
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.533
Mom, please say something

605
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.767
Madam, just admit it

606
00:32:57.467 --> 00:33:00.133
Let's tell the truth now.

607
00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:02.967
Didn't you say you wanted to save the two brothers?

608
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.867
it's all my fault

609
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.200
Tetsuo

610
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.100
That's right, I adopted you

611
00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:23.600
But I treat you as my own and raise you with all my heart

612
00:33:26.233 --> 00:33:29.167
Let’s save your brother

613
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.567
Let him live abroad

614
00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:35.267
Douxue, for the sake of him being your brother

615
00:33:35.267 --> 00:33:38.633
Set fire to that tape.

616
00:33:39.433 --> 00:33:43.900
Although Tetsuo is your biological brother

617
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.567
But he is also the minister's son

618
00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:47.900
The minister must be safe and sound

619
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.367
Only Tetsuo can realize his dream

620
00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:56.567
Just listen to Madam

621
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.367
I can't live if you die

622
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.800
Even if Tetsuo dies, I can’t live anymore.

623
00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:09.967
please

624
00:34:12.933 --> 00:34:14.300
Don't tell such outrageous lies

625
00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:20.000
To snatch that tape away

626
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.200
Mom and aunt are the ones who make up such lies, right?

627
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.600
This is not made up

628
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.133
Minister, he also knows

629
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.367
You are not his biological son

630
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.433
So…

631
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.800
Brother Douxue is really my biological brother Luo

632
00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:58.467
Tetsuo

633
00:34:59.533 --> 00:35:01.467
Why on earth are you doing this?

634
00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:03.900
It's not enough to lie to me for a lifetime

635
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.033
He also lied to me and said that the minister was my biological father.

636
00:35:06.033 --> 00:35:08.967
why are you doing this
Why exactly…

637
00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:12.633
I'm doing it for your own good

638
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:14.100
I'm doing this all for your own good...

639
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.133
Damn it, you always say it's all for my own good...

640
00:35:16.133 --> 00:35:17.367
Please stop talking

641
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:19.467
Mom, I'm tired of hearing this

642
00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:27.733
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

643
00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:32.467
I...I didn't expect it to be like this

644
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.467
It's all because I'm such a stupid mother

645
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.967
it's all my fault

646
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.300
sorry

647
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.667
Son, I'm sorry

648
00:35:54.733 --> 00:35:56.200
Tetsuo

649
00:35:58.267 --> 00:35:59.767
That's it

650
00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.367
what do you want me to do

651
00:36:12.433 --> 00:36:14.133
Now I know we are brothers

652
00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:15.167
What difference will it make?

653
00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:22.767
Of course different

654
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.867
I suddenly felt that those days passed

655
00:36:28.867 --> 00:36:30.133
I seem to be living too wrongly

656
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:34.600
If you are just a young master from a rich family

657
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.100
I shouldn't feel so wronged

658
00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:38.333
Just because you are my brother

659
00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:40.567
This makes me feel even more aggrieved, brat

660
00:36:40.567 --> 00:36:41.967
enough

661
00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.267
You two, stop arguing.

662
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.567
Douxue, let’s go out first

663
00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:48.133
Let's go

664
00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:49.767
Who said you can leave

665
00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:51.067
Choi Cheol-woong, are you crazy?

666
00:36:51.067 --> 00:36:53.967
Tetsuo, don't shoot...

667
00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:57.600
He is your brother Tetsuo

668
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.100
Tetsuo, you can't do this

669
00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:04.100
Leave the tape before leaving

670
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.867
Then I will intercede with the minister to let you go abroad.

671
00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.900
That's not okay

672
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.500
The tape is my life saver

673
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:15.333
Let's go

674
00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.500
Go quickly

675
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.667
Didn't you hear what I said?

676
00:37:18.533 --> 00:37:20.833
Choi Cheol-woong, are you crazy?

677
00:37:20.833 --> 00:37:23.133
Tetsuo…

678
00:37:23.133 --> 00:37:25.100
Dingchen, get out of the way

679
00:37:26.633 --> 00:37:28.767
If...you want to kill Douxue

680
00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:30.300
Just shoot me first

681
00:37:36.467 --> 00:37:37.833
Tetsuo

682
00:37:39.767 --> 00:37:41.967
What the hell are you doing, kid?

683
00:37:43.967 --> 00:37:46.400
Do you know that the person who killed dad was Huang Zhongcheng?

684
00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:49.900
what

685
00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:52.700
what does that mean

686
00:37:54.033 --> 00:37:56.533
Who do you think killed your father?

687
00:37:56.533 --> 00:37:58.333
he is lying

688
00:37:58.333 --> 00:38:00.400
Open your eyes and tell lies

689
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.333
That's right

690
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:06.133
The person who killed Uncle Zhong Hao was Wu Wanxu

691
00:38:06.133 --> 00:38:08.400
It was sent by Wu Wanxu

692
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.167
Killed my dad and pretended to be
Hit and run accident, right?

693
00:38:11.867 --> 00:38:16.000
Is this... is this true?

694
00:38:17.533 --> 00:38:18.767
But you have to know

695
00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:23.033
The person who instigated Wu Wanxu to do this

696
00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:24.367
It's Minister Huang

697
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:25.600
He does this because...

698
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.200
No, stop talking.

699
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.167
Tetsuo, he is telling lies with his eyes open.

700
00:38:30.167 --> 00:38:32.200
Mom, don't interrupt

701
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.533
Say it

702
00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:41.867
She's afraid that you are Minister Huang's son
This lie will be exposed

703
00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:45.067
The woman you thought was your mother
Only then would he instruct the thugs to do this?

704
00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:46.833
Not really

705
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.633
Not so

706
00:38:52.067 --> 00:38:53.900
Not so

707
00:38:56.433 --> 00:38:57.900
Not like this

708
00:39:08.067 --> 00:39:09.367
Not like this

709
00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:15.133
Li Douxue

710
00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:04.367
everything is over

711
00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:05.800
Hand over the tape and surrender.

712
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.000
you did a great job

713
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.433
You actually did such a thing...

714
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.600
He was so ruthless until the last moment

715
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.233
This must be done so that everyone can survive

716
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.000
Hurry up and convince him to surrender.

717
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.700
No need to wait for him to surrender

718
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.400
Just shoot and kill

719
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.700
Husband…

720
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.400
Hurry up and shoot and everything will be over

721
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.067
Don't worry about what happens next

722
00:40:29.067 --> 00:40:30.067
I will be responsible

723
00:40:30.067 --> 00:40:31.567
Husband

724
00:40:31.567 --> 00:40:33.533
If you don't shoot now
Just not my son

725
00:40:34.667 --> 00:40:35.733
Dad

726
00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:36.767
No

727
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:37.867
Tetsuo: No.

728
00:40:37.867 --> 00:40:39.267
I beg you not to shoot

729
00:40:39.267 --> 00:40:40.233
Douxue is your brother

730
00:40:40.233 --> 00:40:43.800
Tetsuo…

731
00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:52.333
pull the trigger

732
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.433
son

733
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:15.867
Am I the minister's son?

734
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.533
Is that why you killed someone for me?

735
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.633
Cui Zhexiong

736
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.267
Whether it's Team Leader Wu or Uncle Zhong Hao

737
00:41:29.267 --> 00:41:32.767
He is my biological father...

738
00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:35.300
Is that why you killed them?

739
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.133
Let's do it

740
00:41:38.133 --> 00:41:42.767
"Can I come back to you again?"

741
00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:44.167
Are you crazy?

742
00:41:44.167 --> 00:41:45.000
Cui Zhexiong

743
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.733
"trembling eyes"

744
00:41:47.733 --> 00:41:48.833
No

745
00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:51.767
"Looks more sad"

746
00:41:51.767 --> 00:41:58.567
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"

747

Douxue…

750
00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:29.167
Douxue

751
00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:36.967
If you come earlier

752
00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:39.433
If you learn Dou Xue, you won’t be shot.

753
00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:42.067
Sorry, it took me a while to gather the brothers.

754
00:43:42.067 --> 00:43:45.233
This big brother is always late

755
00:43:46.133 --> 00:43:47.433
Did Dingchen call you here?

756
00:43:47.433 --> 00:43:49.100
How can I trust Tetsuo's mother?

757
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.900
I came to them just in case.

758
00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:56.100
It's all over now... Douxue

759
00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:09.567
Brother

760
00:44:10.133 --> 00:44:12.133
Be careful

761
00:44:33.167 --> 00:44:36.167
Big brother…

762
00:44:41.633 --> 00:44:43.100
Everybody put their guns on the ground

763
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.000
You also put down the stick

764
00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:46.867

766
00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:51.333
Do you want the police to dispatch immediately?

767
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.333
Do you think this sounds reasonable?

768
00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:56.000
If the police don't come out

769
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.667

770

Please come in

771
00:45:05.267 --> 00:45:06.667
The fried noodles are here

772
00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:07.967
What the hell?

773
00:45:07.967 --> 00:45:09.667
I didn’t order fried noodles

774
00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:14.233
Someone ordered fried noodles

775
00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.700

782

right

783
00:46:15.867 --> 00:46:17.367
you can survive

784
00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:19.833
Douxue, you can survive...

785
00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:21.300
Bear it a little longer

786
00:46:22.367 --> 00:46:23.533
Dingchen

787
00:46:23.533 --> 00:46:24.767
What's wrong

788
00:46:27.467 --> 00:46:31.733
I must live with you

789
00:46:32.433 --> 00:46:35.100
Okay, let's live together

790
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.300
So you can't close your eyes, okay?

791
00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:40.933
I won't close my eyes

792
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:44.167
Otherwise you will disappear

793
00:46:44.733 --> 00:46:46.933
Don't worry

794

We…

798
00:46:58.067 --> 00:47:00.467
Go back to live in Lishui

799
00:47:00.967 --> 00:47:03.167
OK let's go back

800
00:47:06.133 --> 00:47:08.033
We are going to have a baby

801
00:47:08.733 --> 00:47:10.100
Also want to watch a movie

802
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.000
Just do it

804
00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:17.000
Brother, what's wrong?

805
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.367
You say it

806
00:47:19.367 --> 00:47:20.900
You will also go back with us, right?

807
00:47:22.133 --> 00:47:24.167
Of course

808
00:47:24.167 --> 00:47:25.600
Let’s go back to Lishui

810
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.067
Brother, I was wrong

811
00:47:37.067 --> 00:47:39.233
it's all my fault

812
00:47:39.233 --> 00:47:41.000
All the bad things I did to my brother

813
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.833
I will surrender and accept punishment

814
00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:47.767
Don't lie like this. Get up quickly.

815
00:47:47.767 --> 00:47:49.467
Get up quickly

816
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.200
Don't do that

817
00:47:57.633 --> 00:47:59.433

825
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.933

wait a moment

834
00:49:42.533 --> 00:49:44.867
Just wait outside

00:49:44.867 --> 00:49:46.333

836
00:50:17.933 --> 00:50:19.933

837
00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:48.533

Yeah, I'm all lying

839
00:50:54.033 --> 00:50:55.400
Nothing wrong

00:50:59.933 --> 00:51:02.100
if it's for you

If I give birth to Douxue

881
00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:30.000
What if the second child is not Tetsuo but Jeongyu?

882
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.333
Wrong

883
00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:34.667
If I insist on not letting Tetsuo be adopted

884
00:54:37.367 --> 00:54:39.333

894
00:55:11.567 --> 00:55:13.033

903
00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:34.833
I don't have any feelings for it either.

904
00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:36.633

905
00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:41.667

913
00:56:42.933 --> 00:56:44.800

917
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.800
Eat something first before going in, okay?

918
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.500
Let's go in after eating. Here's it for you.

923
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.100
Look carefully

924
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.267
My whole body is sore

925
00:57:54.267 --> 00:57:56.633
I can't sit upright and there's nothing I can do about it.

926
00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.000
That's right too

927
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.567
How can anyone who has never been shot understand?

928
00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:09.367
Having said that, a lot has changed here

929
00:58:10.367 --> 00:58:12.300
Right?

930
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.900
Movies are meant to be watched through the back door
It will be particularly delicious

931
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.000
But after the theater was handed over to my aunt,

932
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.700
The back door is blocked

933
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.467
and

934
00:58:21.467 --> 00:58:23.500
I also have to hide from the dean of students so that he won’t catch me.

935
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.167
That will be more exciting

936
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:26.700
Yes

937
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.833
After all, times have changed

938
00:58:28.833 --> 00:58:31.133
But we haven't changed

939
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.533
We finally got back here

940
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:39.100
It takes less than half a day to drive here from Seoul

941
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.533
But we went around a long way before we got back here

942
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:45.800
Do you all want to go back in time?

943
00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.300
Think about it
Don't want to

944
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.233
You brothers
Could you please have some tacit understanding?

945
00:58:50.233 --> 00:58:52.133
I don't want

946
00:58:52.133 --> 00:58:53.067
I don't want it either

947
00:58:53.067 --> 00:58:53.867
why not

948
00:58:53.867 --> 00:58:55.067
Look at this guy

949
00:58:55.067 --> 00:58:58.467
Pretend to let me every time
But in the end they all beat me

950
00:58:58.467 --> 00:59:01.467
If you want to cause trouble in the future, you need to know your limits.

951
00:59:01.467 --> 00:59:03.367
I don't want to wipe your ass again

952
00:59:03.367 --> 00:59:05.033
Wipe your butt?

953
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.833
Really, which guy should I beat first?

954
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:11.300
Beat Tetsuo first

955
00:59:14.267 --> 00:59:15.767
Forget it

956
00:59:18.567 --> 00:59:24.267
"But I don't regret it"

957
00:59:24.267 --> 00:59:29.467
"A dream that made people laugh and cry"

958
00:59:29.467 --> 00:59:37.800
"That's my whole world"

959
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:44.400
"But I don't regret it"

960
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.567
"All the dreams that keep me searching"

961
00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:56.700
"That's my whole world"

962
00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.133
(dedicated to the same as Douxue, Dingchen and Tetsuo
People who spent their youth in hard times)

963
00:59:59.133 --> 01:00:04.033
"That's my whole world"

964
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.733
(Thank you viewers for watching and supporting)

965
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:48.533
"Maybe I don't understand the world"

966
01:00:51.433 --> 01:01:01.733
"Stay alone on that road"

967
01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:08.800
"But I don't regret it"

968
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.800
"A dream that made people laugh and cry"

969
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:21.667
"That's my whole world"

970
01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:25.433
"But I don't regret it..."
