"This play is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious. We hereby inform you"

2
00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:14.671
Why did you come here without contacting me?

3
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:18.871
don't do that

4
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:21.304
what's wrong with you

5
00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:22.938
Blindly asking me not to do anything

6
00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:24.504
Don't marry Li Douxue

7
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:28.438
I'm not here to make you angry

8
00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:30.704
Asking why you didn’t marry him and me

9
00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.471
Anyway, don’t marry Li Douxue

10
00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.304
I already told him to wash his hands in a golden basin

11
00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:36.571
That way I'll be by his side

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.704
He doesn't have a golden basin to wash his hands

13
00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.638
He just concealed the facts of his crime

14
00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:42.404
Li Douxue is now...

15
00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:44.671
In managing a larger criminal underworld organization

16
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.738
Li Douxue

17
00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:47.304
Shouldn't you call him brother?

18
00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:48.304
Yeah

19
00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:49.938
But he could also be a suspect

20
00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:51.104
Wait until he really commits a crime

21
00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:52.704
You can arrest him again and imprison him

22
00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:54.571
I will leave then too

23
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:57.004
You…

24
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.371
Will definitely get hurt

25
00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:08.504
Even if I have to bear it, I will bear it alone

26
00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:10.338
You don't know what kind of person you are dealing with
Falling in love?

27
00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:15.138
Tetsuo, please don't worry about it anymore
I learned this from Dou

28
00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:16.838
Otherwise it will be you who suffers

29
00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:23.138
Hello

30
00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:26.071
It's me Ruzhen

31
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.004
I was threatened again today

32
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.538
I really want to die

33
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.304
Ruzhen

34
00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:34.538
Ruzhen

35
00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:36.804
Ruzhen

36
00:01:40.438 --> 00:01:41.771
Team Leader Wu

37
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.038
Yes Please tell me

38
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.904
I have something that has nothing to do with my country or nation.

39
00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:50.171
But it's important to my family

40
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.904
Please go and help me with a troublesome thing

41
00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:55.171
don't let anyone know

42
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.671
Just go by yourself

43
00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:01.671
I think the deputy chief's stability

44
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.738
It is the stability of the country

45
00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.271
Please feel free to order me

46
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.371
thank you

47
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.971
I need you by my side all my life

48
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.338
I heard my mother say

49
00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:07.771
you are my biological father

50
00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:11.138
Really?

51
00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:12.704
You must be surprised

52
00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:15.238
(Episode 10)
Yes

53
00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:19.638
I want to be with your mother all my life

54
00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:21.171
It's not your mother's fault

55
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.038
i know

56
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.638
But…

57
00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.171
I want to keep the name Cui

58
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:31.771
hope for your understanding

59
00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:33.504
Also

60
00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.438
I have a request

61
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:38.671
Please learn from Li Dou

62
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.271
sever ties

63
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.804
I will also sever ties with him

64
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.838
Because he knows the secret of your murder?

65
00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:59.204
He's a good hunting dog for me

66
00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.071
Please find another hound

67
00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:07.104
Why do you care so much about Li Douxue?

68
00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:10.104
Because he is a criminal

69
00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:11.504
And I am...

70
00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:13.304
A person who specializes in catching criminals

71
00:04:13.304 --> 00:04:15.571
Aren't you friends?

72
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:17.538
You even helped him

73
00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:21.071
At least I can distinguish between public and private affairs

74
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.604
If the deputy chief is not willing to learn from Li Dou
Cut off ties…

75
00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:26.638
If I don't want to...

76
00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:29.938
I will punish you according to law

77
00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:38.471
I mean it

78
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.671
I'll consider it

79
00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:47.671
scared me

80
00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:49.571
Hello

81
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:52.138
What time is it now? Are you still awake?

82
00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:55.804
can't you sleep

83
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:57.838
are you waiting for a call

84
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:00.871
You quarreled with Douxue again

85
00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:03.704
Yoko, you are so annoying

86
00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.004
Go back to your sleep

87
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.104
I need to go to the toilet

88
00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:11.438
And…

89
00:05:11.438 --> 00:05:14.171
Are you more annoyed?

90
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.404
I really hope she gets married soon

91
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:24.704
Do you want to learn?

92
00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:26.371
what happened

93
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:28.338
Is it related to the news just now?

94
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.338
My dad passed away

95
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.938
what did you say

96
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.738
Uncle?

97
00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.338
Yeah

98
00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:44.504
How could uncle...

99
00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:48.504
That's right

100
00:05:48.504 --> 00:05:49.971
Why is he here...

101
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:52.404
did you read it wrong

102
00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:54.504
Is he really his uncle?

103
00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:56.771
There is a father present...

104
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.404
Cigarettes smoked every day

105
00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:02.004
And the last time I was with him

106
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:03.204
When we go to dinner together

107
00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:05.171
That restaurant…

108
00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:06.871
The matchbox given

109
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:08.638
(Xinchuan Garden)

110
00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:10.471
So it must be dad right

111
00:06:13.638 --> 00:06:15.871
How could it be

112
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.004
How could...

113
00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:44.071
I should...

114
00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.671
I told him to finish his meal before leaving.

115
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:56.971
I should keep him...

116
00:07:02.404 --> 00:07:04.038
Why didn't you say a word...

117
00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:46.371
If you don't go to work, where will you go?

118
00:08:11.104 --> 00:08:14.604
Why is the back of your hand as rough as tree bark?

119
00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:19.271
Why are you like this suddenly?

120
00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.204
Wife, thank you for your hard work.

121
00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:31.004
Oh my God, you finally understand.

122
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.838
Then you should be nicer to me in the future

123
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.104
No. Where are you going?

124
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:46.004
It's time to eat

125
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:50.771
Academic father

126
00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:56.271
Academic father

127
00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:58.071
It's time to eat...

128
00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:04.004
Academic father

129
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.371
Academic father

130
00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:16.504
Strange. Is that old man having an affair?

131
00:09:16.504 --> 00:09:19.204
Why is it so worrying?

132
00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:40.638
Mr. Li Douxue

133
00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:45.138
I'm from the Criminal Division of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office
Prosecutor Park Ji-hwan

134
00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:49.138
Now we have to use excessive violence and so on
Relevant laws to arrest you

135
00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:50.971
You have the right to exercise your right to remain silent

136
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.204
What you say may become
Evidence presented against you

137
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:57.771
arrest him
Yes

138
00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:10.171
Douxue

139
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:11.604
Big brother

140
00:10:11.604 --> 00:10:12.904
Douxue

141
00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:14.171
get out of the way

142
00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:15.071
get out of the way

143
00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:16.338
who are you

144
00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:17.938
what are you doing

145
00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:19.204
We're from the Supreme Prosecutor's Office

146
00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:21.471
The underworld boss Li Douxue is currently being arrested.

147
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:22.438
what

148
00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:24.204
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:25.904
He is a legitimate entrepreneur

150
00:10:25.904 --> 00:10:28.504
Yes, he has already washed his hands in a golden basin.

151
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:31.571
You are his little brothers, right?

152
00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:33.338
Don't worry we'll meet again soon

153
00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:36.604
At that time, you will also be investigated together.

154
00:10:36.604 --> 00:10:38.504
His father just died

155
00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:39.904
You guys are going too far

156
00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:43.671
I was on official duty when my dad died.

157
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:45.471
Even though it was a few years ago

158
00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:50.104
come here

159
00:10:50.104 --> 00:10:52.171
you bastards

160
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:54.471
my dad's cigarettes

161
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:56.038
my dad's cigarettes

162
00:10:56.538 --> 00:10:58.604
Don't worry, I will take good care of it for you

163
00:10:58.604 --> 00:11:00.738
Big brother…

164
00:11:00.738 --> 00:11:02.071
Douxue

165
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:03.404
let me go

166
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.404
Something unexpected happened. Prosecutor Choi took action.

167
00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:17.138
what

168
00:11:17.138 --> 00:11:19.638
Li Douxue was arrested just now

169
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:23.738
Prosecutor Choi did not arrest anyone personally

170
00:11:23.738 --> 00:11:26.838
Instead, let other prosecutors go
so i didn't notice

171
00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:28.338
what to do now

172
00:11:29.704 --> 00:11:33.338
(Trustworthy Seoul Police)

173
00:11:33.338 --> 00:11:35.671
Brat, what crime have I committed?

174
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:47.071
Recruit quickly. Where is Wen Dongxiu hiding now?

175
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:49.238
I'll let you sleep well and comfortably

176
00:11:50.004 --> 00:11:52.904
I really don't know

177
00:11:52.904 --> 00:11:55.038
I don't know what you want me to say

178
00:11:59.571 --> 00:12:01.638
I know you are boyfriend and girlfriend

179
00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:04.104
How could you not know where he is?

180
00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:06.404
We're not in that kind of relationship

181
00:12:07.071 --> 00:12:08.704
I'll ask you one last time

182
00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.004
Where is Wen Dongxiu?

183
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:19.371
Your Loyalty Society...

184
00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:22.571
Criminal records are really diverse.

185
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.738
It's like a department store with everything you need

186
00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:27.038
Li Douxue

187
00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.504
You are their leader

188
00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:32.104
Loyalty Association…

189
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:34.371
Just a simple friendship group

190
00:12:35.604 --> 00:12:37.604
Is it possible that some members stole at ordinary gatherings?

191
00:12:37.604 --> 00:12:39.404
Is the organizer the mastermind of theft?

192
00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:44.738
what

193
00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:47.238
Triad groups and general gatherings

194
00:12:47.238 --> 00:12:48.404
Can it be compared?

195
00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:51.904
From now on I will exercise my right to remain silent

196
00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.338
(Lee Jong-ho)

197
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:06.171
No wonder this old man suddenly became so sensible

198
00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:10.938
Douxue?

199
00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:16.704
Something happened to him and he needs to be investigated.
Went to the prosecutor's office

200
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:20.704
Where is Zhenyu?

201
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.604
We've been asking around for her whereabouts.

202
00:13:27.471 --> 00:13:29.771
So…

203
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:31.638
Am I the only one left in this family?

204
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:36.338
Sorry, aunt

205
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:35.104
(ID card Li Zhonghao)

206
00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:34.038
Let's go quickly

207
00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:36.271
A studious father will be very lonely alone

208
00:16:34.404 --> 00:16:36.904
Why are you so cold?

209
00:16:39.871 --> 00:16:42.004
You must be cold

210
00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:49.771
Why don't you dress warmly?

211
00:17:20.138 --> 00:17:24.204
(Prosecutor Choi Cheol-woong)

212
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:28.738
Tetsuo

213
00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:31.671
Let uncle hug you

214
00:17:37.738 --> 00:17:42.404
Uncle... I'm really proud of you

215
00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:47.271
It doesn't matter if I'm not your father

216
00:17:48.004 --> 00:17:49.504
I really…

217
00:17:51.304 --> 00:17:53.571
I really won't regret it

218
00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.171
This is barley tea

219
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:19.471
You drink it

220
00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:24.004
After receiving a call from Dingchen

221
00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:25.271
I'm also surprised

222
00:18:27.904 --> 00:18:29.271
It's because of dad

223
00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:31.871
Or because of me

224
00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:36.304
All

225
00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:40.671
Brother, you might not believe it

226
00:18:43.338 --> 00:18:45.604
But I really like uncle

227
00:18:46.938 --> 00:18:48.538
Sometimes…

228
00:18:49.238 --> 00:18:51.238
He is better than my father

229
00:18:51.238 --> 00:18:53.171
More like my real dad

230
00:18:59.804 --> 00:19:01.304
The autopsy results are out

231
00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:06.771
He was hit and killed by a large car in a hit-and-run accident.

232
00:19:07.504 --> 00:19:09.371
I still can't contact Zhenyu.

233
00:19:11.604 --> 00:19:14.971
Auntie must be feeling very uncomfortable being alone right now.

234
00:19:17.738 --> 00:19:19.571
I helped you mediate a bit

235
00:19:19.571 --> 00:19:22.538
You can finish the funeral first
Come back and take the survey

236
00:19:23.804 --> 00:19:25.271
You go back first

237
00:19:37.904 --> 00:19:39.171
Zhenyu

238
00:19:41.004 --> 00:19:41.971
Brother

239
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:43.538
It's very hard in there, right?

240
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:46.804
I didn't even know you were here

241
00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:48.804
I keep looking for you everywhere

242
00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:53.238
Let's go

243
00:19:53.238 --> 00:19:54.938
Your father is waiting for you

244
00:21:22.904 --> 00:21:24.338
Thank you for your hard work

245
00:21:25.504 --> 00:21:28.004
I don't have to worry about the driver who caused the accident, right?

246
00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:31.538
I've handled it perfectly

247
00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:32.938
you don't have to worry

248
00:21:39.304 --> 00:21:41.038
Li Douxue seems to be here

249
00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:43.804
what to do

250
00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:45.471
In case Li Douxue is detained

251
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.038
Currently ongoing projects

252
00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:49.738
will be greatly affected

253
00:22:08.904 --> 00:22:10.438
Big brother

254
00:22:10.438 --> 00:22:11.904
Douxue

255
00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:22.971
Your dad...

256
00:23:22.971 --> 00:23:28.671
Your father is so pitiful

257
00:23:32.638 --> 00:23:34.704
what to do

258
00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:37.138
Dad is so pitiful

259
00:23:41.604 --> 00:23:43.138
You girl

260
00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:44.738
Why are you coming back now?

261
00:23:44.738 --> 00:23:46.171
why

262
00:23:46.171 --> 00:23:49.338
Your father has been waiting for you for a long time

263
00:23:49.338 --> 00:23:55.571
sorry dad
You girl...

264
00:23:55.571 --> 00:24:02.838
You...your father has been waiting for you for a long time

265
00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:07.571
Your dad...

266
00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:15.438
Your dad...

267
00:24:34.504 --> 00:24:36.071
Tetsuo

268
00:24:36.804 --> 00:24:38.771
You also come out and give a grand ceremony

269
00:24:39.971 --> 00:24:42.271
Together with my brother and Zhenyu

270
00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:44.004
good

271
00:25:27.904 --> 00:25:29.438
Douxue

272
00:25:31.938 --> 00:25:33.671
Tetsuo

273
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.071
Actually…

274
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:41.071
Take uncle...

275
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:43.471
Buried in the ancestral grave of the Cui family

276
00:25:45.138 --> 00:25:46.338
What...

277
00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:48.071
Yes

278
00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:49.538
uncle…

279
00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:52.304
Just like the elders in our family

280
00:25:52.304 --> 00:25:56.204
I also agree with what my mother said
I hope to do that too

281
00:26:00.304 --> 00:26:01.971
No matter what, it’s still not good...

282
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:04.404
We owe him a lifetime of favors

283
00:26:04.404 --> 00:26:05.538
At least use this method

284
00:26:05.538 --> 00:26:07.571
Let's make it up to him

285
00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:09.604
That way…

286
00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:13.471
It’s also better for young people

287
00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:16.438
Relatives around me are passing away one after another

288
00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:18.871
The children should be very busy too

289
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:20.604
No

290
00:26:21.571 --> 00:26:24.538
My father will take care of him even after he dies.
Are you from the Cui family?

291
00:26:25.538 --> 00:26:27.004
Brother

292
00:26:27.004 --> 00:26:28.304
what are you talking about

293
00:26:28.304 --> 00:26:30.738
Even if dad left a last word and said he wanted to do that

294
00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:32.604
I absolutely disagree

295
00:26:34.104 --> 00:26:35.738
That's not what we meant

296
00:26:35.738 --> 00:26:37.338
why do you do this

297
00:26:37.704 --> 00:26:38.771
Brother

298
00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:40.438
Brother

299
00:26:40.438 --> 00:26:42.304
Brother

300
00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:03.538
Zhenyu

301
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:04.838
are you okay

302
00:27:06.138 --> 00:27:07.504
sister

303
00:27:08.438 --> 00:27:10.371
I'm so scared

304
00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:21.171
It's okay

305
00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:22.704
It'll be okay

306
00:27:29.138 --> 00:27:31.304
Damn it

307
00:27:58.338 --> 00:27:59.938
You are here

308
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:03.904
I can't come in person

309
00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:06.238
He asked me to convey my regrets to you

310
00:28:13.904 --> 00:28:15.871
Why not be careful?

311
00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:20.671
It seems that your communication with the prosecutor
something went wrong

312
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:22.371
Please handle it as soon as possible

313
00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:25.838
I received the report
There is already a conclusion above

314
00:28:27.438 --> 00:28:28.071
thank you

315
00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:29.771
No…

316
00:28:30.438 --> 00:28:32.838
The top brass of the prosecutor's office heard that you were
The head of the mafia organization

317
00:28:32.838 --> 00:28:34.804
Seems reluctant to let you go

318
00:28:35.604 --> 00:28:38.138
The establishment of the Loyalty Association was a big failure

319
00:28:38.138 --> 00:28:39.971
Because people regard the Loyalty Association

320
00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:42.604
Think of it as being like other mafia organizations in the country

321
00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:45.704
You should be judged first

322
00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:48.071
what

323
00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:53.571
leader of a criminal group
Can the sentence be life imprisonment or death?

324
00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:57.404
Yes that's right

325
00:28:58.238 --> 00:28:59.238
But…

326
00:28:59.238 --> 00:29:01.004
Except that career is a problem

327
00:29:01.004 --> 00:29:03.404
Also we can’t be sure about Lee Doo Hak

328
00:29:03.404 --> 00:29:06.871
Will silence be maintained during the trial?

329
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:10.171
Prosecutor Choi said he wanted to arrest him
Let's support him

330
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:11.804
We also owe him a favor

331
00:29:15.304 --> 00:29:17.471
Deputy Chief…
This is my son's business

332
00:29:20.771 --> 00:29:22.571
So…

333
00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:25.171
I will expose the illegal behavior of the Loyalty Association

334
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:27.638
They got rid of Lian Guangzhuo

335
00:29:27.638 --> 00:29:30.538
And the inside story of the underworld struggle

336
00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:32.071
Tell the media everything

337
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:33.971
That's it

338
00:29:33.971 --> 00:29:36.204
It's not just spies we want to catch

339
00:29:36.204 --> 00:29:38.671
We also have the obligation to purify society

340
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:39.704
And…

341
00:29:39.704 --> 00:29:42.738
Maybe it will be over before the trial.

342
00:29:42.738 --> 00:29:43.904
After all…

343
00:29:43.904 --> 00:29:47.404
Anything can happen in a detention center

344
00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:50.871
Revenge from enemies on the road

345
00:29:50.871 --> 00:29:53.171
or commit suicide

346
00:29:57.038 --> 00:29:59.538
I will find an opportunity to bail you out during the process

347
00:29:59.538 --> 00:30:00.671
you don't have to worry

348
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:03.238
You are now…

349
00:30:04.371 --> 00:30:06.471
Are you trying to sell me out?

350
00:30:08.971 --> 00:30:11.304
betray

351
00:30:11.304 --> 00:30:14.071
Didn't you say we want you to die?
Are you going to die?

352
00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:21.971
This is a very important period in my life

353
00:30:22.804 --> 00:30:25.204
my father passed away

354
00:30:25.204 --> 00:30:27.671
And I'm getting married soon
please help me

355
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:29.771
After that…

356
00:30:29.771 --> 00:30:32.004
If you want me to die, I will definitely die.

357
00:30:32.004 --> 00:30:34.971
After that…

358
00:30:34.971 --> 00:30:37.338
We don't have a future

359
00:30:37.338 --> 00:30:40.571
Why don't you put off your important things to a later date?

360
00:30:42.838 --> 00:30:43.571
Team leader

361
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:46.304
Don't think too much

362
00:30:49.338 --> 00:30:50.971
Team leader

363
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:08.371
What? Is there no way?

364
00:31:08.371 --> 00:31:10.171
Should you say this now?

365
00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:11.904
The method is found by people

366
00:31:11.904 --> 00:31:13.271
He had a hard time getting it
Live an ordinary life

367
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.404
Do you want to watch him hit rock bottom again?

368
00:31:16.004 --> 00:31:18.238
Not like that

369
00:31:18.238 --> 00:31:19.138
Dingchen

370
00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:23.438
This matter was decided by the superiors.

371
00:31:24.304 --> 00:31:25.771
No matter what the investigation reveals, it doesn't matter

372
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:27.538
Because the result is a foregone conclusion

373
00:31:27.538 --> 00:31:30.004
Have you heard of the Sanqing Education Team?

374
00:31:30.004 --> 00:31:31.471
The superiors plan to imitate the Sanqing Education Team

375
00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:36.038
The boss of the gang
Achieve the effect of social purification

376
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:39.338
Whether you want to get married or not is not the point now.

377
00:31:39.338 --> 00:31:43.038
Brother Dou Xue will be imprisoned for at least ten years.

378
00:31:43.038 --> 00:31:47.704
You might be sentenced to life imprisonment.
Even the death penalty

379
00:31:49.504 --> 00:31:50.938
what

380
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:55.638
This is not something I can interfere with

381
00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:58.504
So didn’t I tell you?

382
00:31:58.504 --> 00:32:00.371
You can't marry Brother Douxue

383
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:02.204
you will definitely get hurt

384
00:32:04.671 --> 00:32:06.271
This matter...

385
00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:08.971
It wasn't your plan, was it?

386
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:14.538
Do you think I'm that mean?

387
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:23.038
Me too

388
00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:25.471
I've asked everything I can.

389
00:32:25.471 --> 00:32:27.171
if i had the ability

390
00:32:27.171 --> 00:32:28.938
I also want to save Brother Dou

391
00:32:28.938 --> 00:32:30.371
Then go save him

392
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:32.038
We must save him by any means

393
00:32:33.204 --> 00:32:34.538
Douxue's father passed away

394
00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:37.471
Zhenyu was detained by the police again

395
00:32:37.471 --> 00:32:39.504
Did you also see your aunt's state just now?

396
00:32:41.938 --> 00:32:43.371
It doesn't matter if I don't get married

397
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:45.038
But you must rescue Douxue

398
00:32:45.038 --> 00:32:46.938
Otherwise I will never see you in my life

399
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:57.571
How could so many things happen at once...

400
00:32:57.571 --> 00:33:00.438
The boss of each branch of the Loyalty Association
All were arrested

401
00:33:01.904 --> 00:33:04.038
We should also avoid the limelight.

402
00:33:04.038 --> 00:33:06.271
The superiors also let go and let the prosecutors take action.

403
00:33:09.604 --> 00:33:11.138
Feeling like something is fishy

404
00:33:11.138 --> 00:33:12.638
Douxue will go to jail again this time
You will definitely not be able to get out.

405
00:33:12.638 --> 00:33:14.104
We have to rescue him

406
00:33:14.104 --> 00:33:16.371
I think so too

407
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:17.704
what to do

408
00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:20.971
The spies are watching him with their eyes wide open.

409
00:33:20.971 --> 00:33:23.338
no matter what means
We have to rescue him

410
00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:29.038
Xuanyu and I will find a way

411
00:33:29.038 --> 00:33:30.271
Don't interfere

412
00:33:31.438 --> 00:33:33.504
Can you think of any method with your brains?

413
00:33:41.904 --> 00:33:43.704
Does it have to be you?

414
00:33:44.738 --> 00:33:46.238
sorry

415
00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:54.871
You go quickly

416
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:00.271
thank you

417
00:34:02.304 --> 00:34:05.104
We just came back from our honeymoon

418
00:34:05.104 --> 00:34:06.204
If you are caught by a police officer

419
00:34:06.204 --> 00:34:07.971
Just waiting to die by my hands

420
00:34:09.138 --> 00:34:12.538
Don't worry, I don't want to die in your hands

421
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:39.404
(Lee Jong-ho)

422
00:35:00.604 --> 00:35:07.571
"I'm leaving. I'm leaving."

423
00:35:07.571 --> 00:35:14.304
"Holding my young son's hand"

424
00:35:14.304 --> 00:35:20.404
Douxue, dad is in a good mood today

425
00:35:20.404 --> 00:35:23.638
The teacher keeps praising you
Say I taught you well

426
00:35:35.504 --> 00:35:38.571
Old man, you really worked hard

427
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:45.238
Never be reincarnated as a long-term worker in your next life

428
00:35:46.871 --> 00:35:51.438
You must be reincarnated as a child of a rich family

429
00:36:07.138 --> 00:36:13.404
Have a good trip…

430
00:36:16.071 --> 00:36:19.104
This is already a great honor to you.

431
00:36:19.104 --> 00:36:23.238
I know but...

432
00:36:23.238 --> 00:36:29.104
Can you let him finish lunch with his family before leaving?

433
00:36:30.071 --> 00:36:33.404
No, I have to leave immediately

434
00:36:33.404 --> 00:36:35.138
The chief of Nanshan said this guy is dangerous

435
00:36:35.138 --> 00:36:36.871
Nothing can go wrong

436
00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:02.204
There will be some commotion later

437
00:37:02.204 --> 00:37:06.871
Just run to the top of the hill in the direction of two o'clock.

438
00:37:37.438 --> 00:37:38.204
uncle

439
00:37:38.204 --> 00:37:39.604
Come here

440
00:37:39.604 --> 00:37:42.504
Come here, you brat
Don't you drive well?

441
00:37:42.504 --> 00:37:44.204
Oh, you brat...

442
00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:50.538
Brat

443
00:37:50.538 --> 00:37:52.238
Damn...

444
00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.104
catch that kid

445
00:38:32.438 --> 00:38:34.204
Douxue

446
00:39:39.004 --> 00:39:40.671
catch that kid

447
00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:42.204
catch him

448
00:39:45.904 --> 00:39:48.238
Wait a minute...

449
00:39:48.238 --> 00:39:49.871
catch him…

450
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.304
Wait a minute...

451
00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:05.171
stop

452
00:40:14.971 --> 00:40:16.338
let's go

453
00:40:20.938 --> 00:40:23.271
Don't drive away. I'm not in the car yet.

454
00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:28.771
I will send him abroad

455
00:40:31.771 --> 00:40:33.771
what are you talking about

456
00:40:33.771 --> 00:40:36.338
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

457
00:40:36.338 --> 00:40:38.638
Dingchen, think about it carefully

458
00:40:38.638 --> 00:40:40.171
if you intervene

459
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.071
If you're not careful, something could happen to you too

460
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:43.571
I will figure out how to deal with those later.

461
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:45.504
The most important thing now is to rescue Douxue first.

462
00:40:45.504 --> 00:40:47.638
Do you want to rescue Douxue first?

463
00:40:48.471 --> 00:40:50.171
What about me?

464
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:51.804
what should i do

465
00:40:51.804 --> 00:40:55.238
Why should I risk my life to save him?

466
00:40:55.238 --> 00:40:59.638
Don't say it's because he and I are friends

467
00:41:01.004 --> 00:41:03.771
Tetsuo, no one can predict the future.

468
00:41:03.771 --> 00:41:09.004
I promise you I will bet my life on the future
save you once

469
00:41:18.338 --> 00:41:21.971
Just take him to the port
No matter what, let him sneak away

470
00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:26.771
Douxue wouldn't want to do this

471
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:28.571
No time now

472
00:41:41.638 --> 00:41:43.204
Why are you so hungry?

473
00:41:43.204 --> 00:41:45.138
Would you like a bowl of soup and rice?

474
00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:46.938
let me think

475
00:41:54.604 --> 00:41:57.404
Captain, I paid more than originally agreed.
More

476
00:41:57.404 --> 00:41:58.938
Sorry to trouble you

477
00:41:58.938 --> 00:42:01.238
There's no time now. This is the only way.

478
00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:02.904
The other person is a boatman I met when I was making a movie.

479
00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:05.438
He owes me a favor, so he will definitely help me

480
00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:10.304
"my love"

481
00:42:10.304 --> 00:42:13.538
"No matter where you are"

482
00:42:13.538 --> 00:42:20.138
"Please take good care of yourself
Goodbye"

483
00:42:20.138 --> 00:42:23.471
"Our time to shine"

484
00:42:23.471 --> 00:42:28.504
"will become eternity"

485
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:33.704
"Please remember"

486
00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:39.671
sorry

487
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:43.871
He won't take the road prepared for him

488
00:42:43.871 --> 00:42:45.671
He is indeed that kind of person

489
00:42:46.538 --> 00:42:48.271
I'll take care of this myself

490
00:42:48.271 --> 00:42:49.771
Just wait and see

491
00:42:49.771 --> 00:42:50.938
That person Li Douxue

492
00:42:50.938 --> 00:42:53.238
You should be prepared and contact us again.

493
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:59.171
If the prosecutor wants to arrest you, forget it.

494
00:42:59.171 --> 00:43:00.738
But there was nothing wrong with the process of passing on the secret funds.

495
00:43:00.738 --> 00:43:01.738
Confidentiality is kept tight

496
00:43:01.738 --> 00:43:03.438
Plus you haven’t gone against them before.

497
00:43:03.438 --> 00:43:04.471
Where can I find a loyal dog like you?

498
00:43:04.471 --> 00:43:06.004
How could they suddenly abandon you?

499
00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:09.104
Is it because of Lian Guangzhuo?

500
00:43:09.104 --> 00:43:09.904
not him

501
00:43:09.904 --> 00:43:12.104
He fled to the United States a long time ago

502
00:43:13.171 --> 00:43:16.871
Prosecutor Park Ji-hwan and Choi Cheol-woong
Is a concurrent student of the Judicial Examination

503
00:43:20.304 --> 00:43:23.538
But if he wants to catch me
There's no reason to help me unlock my handcuffs.

504
00:43:23.538 --> 00:43:25.604
Besides...

505
00:43:25.604 --> 00:43:28.438
The biggest handle in his life is in my hands

506
00:43:30.238 --> 00:43:33.271
In short, if the people over there in Nanshan abandon you,
This is the only way

507
00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:34.704
Let's get on this boat and sneak to Japan.

508
00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:35.504
After arriving in Japan…

509
00:43:35.504 --> 00:43:38.471
Whether it's smuggling or going to jail

510
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:42.338
I'll lose everything anyway

511
00:43:42.338 --> 00:43:44.404
Is it possible that you want to fight against them?

512
00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:45.804
You wake up

513
00:43:45.804 --> 00:43:47.004
not just us

514
00:43:47.004 --> 00:43:49.938
Dingchen also bet on his life
Want to help you sneak across

515
00:43:49.938 --> 00:43:51.704
if you get caught
Dingchen will also become a criminal

516
00:43:51.704 --> 00:43:53.238
Her life is ruined

517
00:43:56.304 --> 00:43:58.071
So say

518
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:01.504
To restore everything to its original state

519
00:44:01.504 --> 00:44:03.004
Only then can we find a stable life

520
00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:08.471
Hello Li Douxue

521
00:44:09.204 --> 00:44:10.404
Douxue

522
00:44:11.504 --> 00:44:12.871
Hello Li Douxue

523
00:44:14.904 --> 00:44:16.004
Douxue

524
00:44:19.538 --> 00:44:21.638
secret money ledger

525
00:44:21.638 --> 00:44:22.838
If this is made public to the world

526
00:44:22.838 --> 00:44:25.871
Those guys should have been hit hard too.

527
00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:28.404
But if they don't want to negotiate with you
It's not as simple as going to jail

528
00:44:30.038 --> 00:44:32.204
They'll cut you off by the roots.

529
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.638
Just hide first

530
00:44:35.638 --> 00:44:36.771
Let's accumulate strength

531
00:44:36.771 --> 00:44:37.704
Then give them a fatal blow

532
00:44:37.704 --> 00:44:39.738
Brother

533
00:44:39.738 --> 00:44:44.071
I experienced two near-death escapes
Just got here

534
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:46.838
Are you lucky?

535
00:44:46.838 --> 00:44:49.304
No matter how lucky you are
I've never heard of anyone escaping death three times.

536
00:44:51.204 --> 00:44:52.971
but i want to try

537
00:44:54.138 --> 00:44:54.938
Douxue

538
00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:56.971
Big brother

539
00:44:56.971 --> 00:44:59.038
The man who killed your father turned himself in

540
00:44:59.038 --> 00:45:00.538
It's a guy named Lee Yongdeok

541
00:45:00.538 --> 00:45:02.138
Has four previous convictions

542
00:45:02.138 --> 00:45:03.938
Includes violence, fraud and gambling

543
00:45:03.938 --> 00:45:05.371
He was driving while fatigued

544
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.504
He said he had no idea he was causing the accident

545
00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:11.104
We have called brothers
Went to investigate his background.

546
00:45:11.104 --> 00:45:13.671
The most amazing thing is…

547
00:45:15.604 --> 00:45:18.171
Choi Cheol-woong’s mother is getting remarried

548
00:45:18.171 --> 00:45:21.971
The person she remarried was Huang Zhongcheng

549
00:45:22.538 --> 00:45:23.938
what did you say

550
00:45:33.904 --> 00:45:35.071
hello

551
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:36.504
I am Li Douxue

552
00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:41.771
Do you think you are making a movie?

553
00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:43.471
what is the reason

554
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:46.304
I told you, things have gotten too big.

555
00:45:46.304 --> 00:45:48.638
I can't let you
Affects the work of our unit

556
00:45:48.638 --> 00:45:52.304
But you are obviously capable of solving this matter

557
00:45:52.304 --> 00:45:54.338
What is the real reason?

558
00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:55.938
You are so suspicious

559
00:45:57.971 --> 00:46:02.571
It's not okay for a hound to think too much.

560
00:46:08.904 --> 00:46:11.104
I sent a package

561
00:46:11.904 --> 00:46:13.738
Let’s have a serious discussion with your master.

562
00:46:13.738 --> 00:46:15.471
I will contact you again

563
00:46:19.438 --> 00:46:21.671
(Gongchangdong has more subscription money)
Secret financial ledger?

564
00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:32.104
Didn't I say you can't keep this kind of document?

565
00:46:32.638 --> 00:46:33.938
sorry

566
00:46:33.938 --> 00:46:36.704
I'm having a wedding this week

567
00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:38.471
Things need to be properly handled before this happens

568
00:46:38.471 --> 00:46:40.071
Be sure to get the original account books back

569
00:46:40.071 --> 00:46:41.471
I know

570
00:46:46.938 --> 00:46:52.004
We sent investigators and police
Tracked everyone he might contact.

571
00:46:52.004 --> 00:46:54.771
But the whereabouts of key figures could not be found

572
00:46:54.771 --> 00:46:58.338
That group of people can be said to be one and the same.

573
00:46:58.338 --> 00:47:00.471
When you were catching Li Douxue
The others should be arrested together

574
00:47:00.471 --> 00:47:01.971
Didn't I tell you before?

575
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.138
Sorry

576
00:47:08.504 --> 00:47:11.571
But how on earth did that guy unlock the handcuffs?

577
00:47:22.838 --> 00:47:25.938
We found Li Douxue

578
00:47:36.838 --> 00:47:38.204
are you dissatisfied

579
00:47:40.338 --> 00:47:41.771
No

580
00:47:43.638 --> 00:47:45.238
very beautiful

581
00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:47.904
thank you

582
00:47:49.238 --> 00:47:51.238
Did you listen to Prosecutor Choi?

583
00:47:51.238 --> 00:47:53.071
I heard Douxue escaped

584
00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:57.771
I heard Douxue’s mother said that

585
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:04.038
She also asked me if I could help Bang Douxue

586
00:48:04.838 --> 00:48:06.271
what

587
00:48:06.271 --> 00:48:09.438
I know it's shameless to ask you like this

588
00:48:09.438 --> 00:48:12.038
But Douxue’s father passed away like that

589
00:48:12.038 --> 00:48:14.471
If something happens to even Douxue

590
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:18.104
I really have no confidence that I can survive

591
00:48:18.104 --> 00:48:20.171
I understand

592
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:24.071
I understand your mood better than anyone else

593
00:48:24.871 --> 00:48:26.638
But…

594
00:48:26.638 --> 00:48:30.071
This is not something I can help with

595
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.871
A wanted criminal who has committed a serious crime and is on the run.

596
00:48:32.871 --> 00:48:35.604
How can I save him from punishment?

597
00:48:36.604 --> 00:48:38.171
i know

598
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:42.671
If you make a mistake, you should be punished

599
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:44.271
I mean

600
00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:46.038
Laws are made by people

601
00:48:46.038 --> 00:48:47.771
Judges and prosecutors are human beings too

602
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:50.638
It should be a little more humane.

603
00:48:50.638 --> 00:48:52.571
It was a crime that was originally going to be punished by the top ten

604
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:54.938
Can it be changed to playing five big boards?

605
00:48:56.038 --> 00:48:58.471
But a peasant woman like me

606
00:48:58.471 --> 00:49:02.571
Even if you ask for mercy
No one will pay attention to me

607
00:49:02.571 --> 00:49:07.238
If the gentleman next to my wife

608
00:49:07.238 --> 00:49:09.271
Say something to Douxue

609
00:49:09.271 --> 00:49:11.771
Maybe those officials will listen.

610
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:14.638
You may not know clearly

611
00:49:14.638 --> 00:49:16.671
But the more senior public officials are

612
00:49:16.671 --> 00:49:18.904
The less likely you are to ask for help or make excuses

613
00:49:18.904 --> 00:49:21.438
Something will happen if you do this

614
00:49:21.438 --> 00:49:25.171
It will also make it difficult for him

615
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.304
How could I not want to help?

616
00:49:28.304 --> 00:49:29.671
If you can help

617
00:49:29.671 --> 00:49:32.804
Whatever you want me to do
I can't deny it

618
00:49:33.404 --> 00:49:37.471
But it's really not possible to do this

619
00:49:44.604 --> 00:49:46.671
Madam, please help me

620
00:49:46.671 --> 00:49:48.304
as long as you help

621
00:49:49.704 --> 00:49:54.438
You want me to pull out all my hair
I can knit it into shoes for you

622
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:58.138
What if something goes wrong in Douxue?

623
00:49:58.138 --> 00:50:00.704
How can I survive

624
00:50:00.704 --> 00:50:04.338
Please, madam, please help me once.

625
00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:07.038
Just help me once

626
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.738
Although I sympathize with you
But there's nothing I can do

627
00:50:09.738 --> 00:50:11.704
Get up quickly

628
00:50:18.704 --> 00:50:20.771
Really not possible?

629
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:23.271
yes

630
00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:25.204
We fight to learn...

631
00:50:27.804 --> 00:50:30.904
He and Tetsuo are brothers whose blood is thicker than water.

632
00:50:33.438 --> 00:50:35.438
Can't you help me?

633
00:50:37.804 --> 00:50:39.404
A studious mother

634
00:50:40.238 --> 00:50:43.838
After I give the child to you

635
00:50:43.838 --> 00:50:46.904
I've never asked you for help, right?

636
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:52.471
Did you have to mention that?

637
00:50:54.271 --> 00:50:57.171
I can do anything now

638
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:04.238
Do you want me to go to Tetsuo to beg for mercy?

639
00:51:04.238 --> 00:51:08.204
A studious mother
Do you really want to do this?

640
00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:09.904
So please...

641
00:51:09.904 --> 00:51:14.704
Please help me this time

642
00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:17.838
Please...

643
00:51:23.204 --> 00:51:24.771
I know

644
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:28.104
If Douxue is investigated by the prosecutor

645
00:51:28.904 --> 00:51:30.738
I will intercede for him then.

646
00:51:33.371 --> 00:51:34.438
thank you

647
00:51:34.438 --> 00:51:36.571
thank you very much

648
00:51:36.571 --> 00:51:38.938
But don't have high expectations

649
00:51:38.938 --> 00:51:41.704
Even if you just say a word for him
I will also be grateful

650
00:51:41.704 --> 00:51:44.338
thank you very much

651
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:50.438
Also

652
00:51:50.438 --> 00:51:52.904
Please never mention Tetsuo again

653
00:51:52.904 --> 00:51:56.871
Okay, it's all my fault

654
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:00.104
I will never mention it again

655
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:04.704
So what do you want me to do

656
00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:08.838
Do you want me to help Li Dou learn?

657
00:52:14.538 --> 00:52:16.304
I hope…

658
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:21.071
can you help

659
00:52:22.838 --> 00:52:24.804
But only about our son

660
00:52:29.671 --> 00:52:33.304
Didn't he hide after he escaped?

661
00:52:33.304 --> 00:52:35.738
Do you want to risk your life to negotiate?

662
00:52:39.138 --> 00:52:40.771
What's the deputy chief's idea?

663
00:52:42.904 --> 00:52:46.538
The deputy chief will not compromise with the hound.

664
00:52:52.638 --> 00:52:53.938
Where is Wu Dingchen?

665
00:52:56.671 --> 00:52:59.038
Never lose Wu Dingchen

666
00:53:00.071 --> 00:53:04.304
Li Douxue will definitely appear in front of Wu Dingchen

667
00:53:05.604 --> 00:53:10.938
"i love you"

668
00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:16.938
"I should say this"

669
00:53:16.938 --> 00:53:22.238
"Without you"

670
00:53:22.238 --> 00:53:28.038
"I can't survive"

671
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:33.571
(Let’s pretend to be crazy while drinking to drive the police away)
"i love you"

672
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:39.504
"I should say this"

673
00:53:39.504 --> 00:53:45.171
"Hesitated and didn't say anything"

674
00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:48.438
"You will leave me"

675
00:53:48.438 --> 00:53:51.704
You two have worked really hard.

676
00:53:51.704 --> 00:53:54.038
Monitor me all day

677
00:53:54.938 --> 00:53:57.204
what are you talking about

678
00:53:57.204 --> 00:53:58.938
You seem to have the wrong person

679
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:01.671
Do you think I'm a fool?

680
00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:02.938
waiter

681
00:54:02.938 --> 00:54:04.571
Serve me wine

682
00:54:05.204 --> 00:54:06.738
I'll treat you to a drink

683
00:54:06.738 --> 00:54:08.404
Is this lady drunk?

684
00:54:09.038 --> 00:54:11.971
Who is drunk?

685
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:16.104
Do you know the whereabouts of Li Douxue?

686
00:54:16.104 --> 00:54:18.804
I'm so curious too

687
00:54:18.804 --> 00:54:21.271
If you know, just tell me

688
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:22.704
I'm having a wedding soon

689
00:54:22.704 --> 00:54:25.471
The groom has to be there

690
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:28.671
Will he come or not?

691
00:54:29.538 --> 00:54:31.038
Let's make a bet

692
00:54:31.804 --> 00:54:33.571
Uncle, which side do you want to bet on?

693
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:35.204
Miss, are you crazy?

694
00:54:35.904 --> 00:54:38.604
Yeah, I'm crazy

695
00:54:38.604 --> 00:54:41.471
If it were you, wouldn't you go crazy?

696
00:54:42.171 --> 00:54:43.804
Damn...

697
00:54:43.804 --> 00:54:44.971
What's wrong

698
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:47.838
Come follow me
Didn't you expect to be caught by me?

699
00:54:47.838 --> 00:54:48.904
what are you doing

700
00:54:48.904 --> 00:54:50.004
Come out quickly

701
00:54:50.004 --> 00:54:51.404
come out with me

702
00:54:51.404 --> 00:54:52.471
You all come out

703
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:54.871
I'm going to beat you to death with nunchucks

704
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:57.504
Sorry, she seems too drunk.

705
00:54:57.504 --> 00:54:58.471
sorry

706
00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:00.704
Did Li Dou learn to come here?
Cheers to me?

707
00:55:00.704 --> 00:55:01.971
where are you going

708
00:55:01.971 --> 00:55:02.871
Come out with me

709
00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:04.138
Where are you going?

710
00:55:04.138 --> 00:55:05.038
You are really...

711
00:55:05.038 --> 00:55:07.304
If you want to follow me, just follow me to the end.

712
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:09.671
You've had enough

713
00:55:12.204 --> 00:55:14.238
They're gone, you don't have to act anymore

714
00:55:18.238 --> 00:55:19.838
Yeon Joo

715
00:55:24.004 --> 00:55:28.871
Douxue wants me to take you there safely

716
00:55:28.871 --> 00:55:30.004
what

717
00:55:30.504 --> 00:55:32.238
He's super romantic

718
00:55:32.238 --> 00:55:35.571
Don't think it's like
Hollywood movie plot?

719
00:55:37.804 --> 00:55:39.204
Now is not the time to joke

720
00:55:39.204 --> 00:55:40.104
Yoko
What's wrong

721
00:55:40.104 --> 00:55:41.438
Is there a backdoor here?

722
00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.838
Of course over there

723
00:55:43.838 --> 00:55:45.071
Come with me

724
00:55:59.871 --> 00:56:01.271
Dingchen

725
00:56:03.804 --> 00:56:04.938
Yeon Joo

726
00:56:10.804 --> 00:56:12.371
Hyung Soo

727
00:56:27.704 --> 00:56:29.004
Yeon Joo

728
00:56:29.938 --> 00:56:31.738
Of course I want a kiss

729
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:35.238
Why didn't you leave and still stayed here?

730
00:56:35.238 --> 00:56:38.671
Where can I go if you are here?

731
00:56:38.671 --> 00:56:40.204
you are crazy

732
00:56:40.204 --> 00:56:42.271
You should leave quickly before you get caught.

733
00:56:42.271 --> 00:56:44.071
We agreed

734
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:47.604
To live a steady and ordinary life

735
00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.704
I still need to pick up the wedding dress.

736
00:56:52.604 --> 00:56:54.271
can we really do it

737
00:56:55.038 --> 00:56:56.338
Of course

738
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:02.904
Yoko said I'm a crazy woman

739
00:57:03.738 --> 00:57:05.104
It seems she is right

740
00:57:06.638 --> 00:57:09.738
I'm probably a lunatic too

741
00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:18.571
Hey let's go...

742
00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:20.804
Let's go

743
00:57:26.804 --> 00:57:28.871
You should listen carefully to what I say now

744
00:57:29.871 --> 00:57:33.204
I have the secret fund account book of the Ministry of Security and Enterprise

745
00:57:33.204 --> 00:57:35.571
As long as that document is made public...

746
00:57:39.338 --> 00:57:41.171
Hello…

747
00:57:48.538 --> 00:57:51.371
Li Douxue raised his hands and knelt down

748
00:57:52.704 --> 00:57:53.871
Douxue

749
00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.471
Douxue

750
00:57:56.471 --> 00:57:58.638
Come on, raise your hands and kneel down

751
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:01.138
Douxue

752
00:58:01.371 --> 00:58:03.138
Hey you guys...

753
00:58:05.704 --> 00:58:07.504
Dingchen

754
00:58:10.704 --> 00:58:12.071
I don't want

755
00:58:14.904 --> 00:58:16.771
Dingchen, I’m begging you

756
00:58:22.438 --> 00:58:24.471
Come on, raise your hands and kneel down

757
00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.371
Let go

758
00:58:34.138 --> 00:58:36.004
No one is allowed to move

759
00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:49.471
Please stop

760
00:58:49.471 --> 00:58:51.504
everything is over

761
00:58:54.438 --> 00:58:56.638
Yes

762
00:58:56.638 --> 00:59:00.404
Why is Choi Cheol-woong missing here?

763
00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:03.071
I heard your mother remarried to someone

764
00:59:03.071 --> 00:59:04.971
It's Huang Zhongcheng

765
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:09.938
It all makes sense now

766
00:59:09.938 --> 00:59:12.538
I was really curious before

767
00:59:12.538 --> 00:59:16.404
As expected, it's you who is doing the trick

768
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:19.071
Don't talk nonsense

769
00:59:19.071 --> 00:59:21.904
These two things have nothing to do with each other

770
00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:27.471
Just stop it

771
00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:34.071
If you stop

772
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:38.204
Will you go to jail in my place?

773
00:59:39.204 --> 00:59:41.371
Just like before I took your place...

774
00:59:45.571 --> 00:59:47.071
Let go of the hostages

775
00:59:47.771 --> 00:59:51.171
Otherwise I will really shoot you

776
01:00:04.704 --> 01:00:11.438
"Can I come back to you again?"

777
01:00:11.438 --> 01:00:18.104
"trembling eyes"

778
01:00:18.104 --> 01:00:21.071
"Looks more sad"

779
01:00:21.071 --> 01:00:25.004
"My heart is swaying in the desolate sky"
No

780
01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:27.771
"your name"

781
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:32.771
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

782
01:00:38.038 --> 01:00:42.838
"Where did it all go wrong?"

783
01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:46.904
"I don't know"

784
01:00:51.571 --> 01:00:56.204
"It's useless to talk too much anyway"

785
01:00:56.204 --> 01:01:00.804
"It's all in the past"

786
01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:08.504
(Preview of next episode)

787
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:10.838
I only have you now

788
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:15.071
I plan to let Prosecutor Cui meet my daughter.

789
01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:17.004
Wu Dingchen probably won’t be attending this year.

790
01:01:17.004 --> 01:01:18.571
What happened in Dingchen?

791
01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:21.504
I did as the lady said

792
01:01:21.504 --> 01:01:22.671
Thank you for your hard work

793
01:01:22.671 --> 01:01:24.738
Why don't you marry Tetsuo?

794
01:01:24.738 --> 01:01:26.871
It’s time to let go of those who left

795
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:28.704
Those who are alive should continue to live their lives.

796
01:01:28.704 --> 01:01:32.138
Does the Minister also know about Prosecutor Choi’s marriage?

797
01:01:32.138 --> 01:01:33.471
Special assistant to the Minister of Security and Enterprise?

798
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.571
Just think of it as doing something for me

799
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:37.638
What is the important secret code?
