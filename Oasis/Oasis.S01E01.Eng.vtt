It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.130
(We buy and sell books)

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.700
Brother, come out

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.830
Come out for a moment

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.100
What's wrong

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.430
(Flowers blooming in Buzhuang)

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.960
(Yuanzu Dumplings and Steamed Buns)

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.100
Hello

10
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260
Brother, that girl is very beautiful, right?

11
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.500
Let's go over there and have a look

12
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.860
Li Douxue

13
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.000
Come out quickly

14
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.960
(Gwangju Prison in the early 1980s)

15
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.730
Really, what are you doing?

16
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.430
You'll be dead when I get out

17
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.200
Li Douxue, someone came to visit the prisoner

18
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100
Tonight at eight o'clock
That brat...

19
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.260
Room 8 2-5
Really annoying

20
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.760
Perform pest control and disinfection

21
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.730
(Lishui, late 1970s)

22
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.160
What are you doing? Eat quickly and then go out.

23
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.030
Don't keep Tetsuo waiting too long

24
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.260
Really, he's going to have indigestion

25
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.960
Soak it in water and eat it

26
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.430
ok dad

27
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.430
I want it too

28
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.360
You little girl

29
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.600
Your school is very close. Just eat slowly.

30
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.230
You should eat more

31
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.060
My son is so handsome

32
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.560
(National meritorious person’s name: Cui Bingzhe)
Study hard

33
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.600
If you fight with your brothers, you will never lose.

34
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.460
Whatever happens, mom will help you solve it

35
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.200
Your son is not inferior to others in studying
You won't lose in a fight

36
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.100
As expected of my good son

37
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.160
Drink it in one gulp

38
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.600
Tetsuo, why don't you come out quickly?

39
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.160
Douxue is waiting for you

40
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.030
Come on, your dad is going to be angry.

41
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.800
I have a date with someone tonight. I'll be back later.

42
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.930
Okay, don't drink too much

43
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.300
Please walk slowly

44
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.900
Be careful on the road Be careful on the road

45
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.730
Goodbye…

46
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.960
we went to school

47
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.200
we went to school
go ahead

48
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.130
You two are always inseparable
It's very reassuring

49
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.830
Like brothers. Looks great.

50
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.700
What's wrong?

51
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.400
Nothing

52
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.660
My brother and I were like brothers

53
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.260
We're going to be late. Let's go.

54
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.360
Let's go

55
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.130
Be careful on the road

56
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.560
Why did you specially send your son out?

57
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.160
I didn't come out to see him off.

58
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.300
I want to help Qingzi do it together
Just a side dish for the kids.

59
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.130
I'm going to make fried anchovies and a few side dishes...

60
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.160
Yes, after all, my mother is a scholar
The craftsmanship is very good

61
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.530
Why are you still so ignorant?

62
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.460
The fields have been very busy recently

63
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.060
Why do you call people here for such a trivial matter?

64
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.100
Oh, don't say that. I'm not busy at all.

65
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.060
My mother-in-law just happened to send it
Good quality anchovies...

66
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.130
No need
I just...

67
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.260
Thank you very much for your consideration

68
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.730
But this is related to the education of children

69
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.200
Please come back

70
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.830
Come in quickly

71
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.560
(city bus)

72
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.530
(city bus)
The train is about to leave

73
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.060
We are going to school...
Go quickly...

74
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.330
"The years are gone forever"

75
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.760
(The heyday of Yingzi)
"I heard this sentence once when I was young and frivolous"

76
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.160
From today on, we will only have half-day classes on Saturdays

77
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.600
The movie will be shown in urban areas

78
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.960
I heard it's very pretty. How about it?

79
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.530
You are looking for death

80
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.130
Besides, we look like students at first sight.
How can I get in?

81
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.160
Why are you so timid?

82
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.130
Sit down

83
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.430
Get up

84
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.300
I'm gonna wake you up, brat

85
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.200
You guys in the second grade are not big or small.

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.700
He even asked the senior to stand
Sit on your own

87
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.230
But neither are you
It’s time for me to respect the elderly and give way to the virtuous.

88
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.800
Brat, what did you say?

89
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.930
What do you want to do, brat?

90
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.700
Are you really studying a year late?

91
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.030
If you don't believe it

92
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.830
Just go to our school by yourself
Look at Li Douxue's student record book.

93
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.330
Let’s talk about that later, bastard

94
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.830
Brat

95
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.230
well played

96
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.130
Come on

97
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.860
Brat
One more punch

98
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.030
Damn it, you took advantage of people's unpreparedness

99
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.260
Come here quickly

100
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.500
Brother, we are going to be late for school

101
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.200
Let's go

102
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.300
good

103
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.030
That's ok

104
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.430
Let's go
Let's go

105
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.600
Brother, we are really going to be late

106
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.500
Hello…

107
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.360
(Practice that focuses on security and education)

108
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.660
Close the door

109
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.500
Hello…

110
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.630
Put it on quickly

111
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.160
You shouldn't be able to tell, right?

112
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.260
It's really getting thicker and thicker.

113
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.530
These brats

114
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.360
Your butts are really unlucky

115
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.830
Follow the wrong master and get beaten every morning

116
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.060
Look at these two guys

117
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.160
Can read a little bit

118
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.260
The principal said it doesn't matter if you are late.

119
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.230
Guys like you are the worst. You are bad enough.

120
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.460
Don't let me get up

121
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.900
Lie down for me

122
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.730
No movement allowed

123
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.730
The midterm exam results are out

124
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.800
Hey, congratulations to you bunch of pig heads.

125
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.600
Our class this time
Also the last one in the second grade

126
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.860
Although Cui Zhexiong maintained the number one ranking in the school,

127
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.500
Li Douxue ranked second in the school

128
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.060
Still can't clean up our class
The stigma of being at the bottom of the grade

129
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.430
What is a class?

130
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.000
life community

131
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.200
What will happen to everyone

132
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.560
take responsibility

133
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.030
The whole class went to the playground and ran five laps

134
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.960
You bunch of brats
Still unclear about the situation?

135
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.260
Move quickly

136
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.330
Why don't you go out quickly?

137
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.330
Really, if you hate me, just say so.

138
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.260
Why bother talking about education?

139
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.400
How amazing she is

140
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.900
So, didn’t I tell you not to go?

141
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.900
Why did you go there and ask for trouble?

142
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.560
And to be honest

143
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.960
He graduated from a university in Seoul

144
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.430
There's no woman around here who's more knowledgeable than her.

145
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.630
what did you say

146
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.130
This big brother
Who were you talking to just now?

147
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.560
I'm talking about doing housework

148
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.360
What’s the use of graduating from college?

149
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.830
Are you good at cooking after graduating from college?

150
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.100
Still good at washing clothes

151
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.460
Compared with housework skills

152
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.930
I'm a university professor

153
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.730
Okay, you go and be your professor

154
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.230
But I've said it thousands of times

155
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.660
Keep some distance from that house.

156
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.460
Abominable

157
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.700
(The heyday of Yingzi)

158
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.160
(The heyday of Yingzi)

159
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.060
Hey, look over there...

160
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.860
In front of the proud Taegeukgi flag

161
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.560
For the endless glory of the motherland and nation

162
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.600
Uncle…
Give us all

163
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.830
Can he hear you like this?

164
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.360
Uncle…
Determined to serve the country with loyalty

165
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.600
What time is it?

166
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.160
The movie is about to start

167
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.530
(Kowloon Sports Center)
He should come out

168
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.200
Won't we get caught doing this?

169
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.530
what are you doing here

170
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.030
us?

171
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.300
That's right. Otherwise, who else is here?

172
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.100
What about you?

173
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.930
I know without looking

174
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.560
You two bad boys
Want to sneak into the theater through the back door?

175
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.360
What are you talking about? This little thing is real.

176
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.030
Then what are you doing here?

177
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.400
This is my home. What's wrong?

178
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.130
Really, is this girl’s head shell broken?

179
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.000
How could he tell such an outrageous lie?

180
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.660
You guys get out of here, or I'm going to call someone here.

181
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.760
You are so funny

182
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.630
We were legitimately invited

183
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.930
Don't mess with big brother

184
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.700
Let's go play while I'm in a good mood.

185
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.860
Dingchen, you are here

186
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.800
Are you from a lumber factory?

187
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.100
Yes

188
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.000
Uncle, did you ask them to come?

189
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.900
This is a long story

190
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.060
In short, because
My friend works in a lumber factory

191
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.360
That friend asked me to let them watch the movie...

192
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.730
Kick them out immediately

193
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.130
Otherwise I will file a complaint with my father.

194
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.900
You girl are so unreasonable and unforgiving

195
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.300
Then let me ask you

196
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.560
What about you sneaking in through the back door to watch a movie?

197
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.660
Does your dad know

198
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.830
Does he know

199
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.100
Don't go further and further

200
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.430
What does this have to do with you...

201
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.960
Who are you?

202
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.530
Don't be like this

203
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.330
I might not be able to come back in a short time.

204
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.760
why

205
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.000
It seems like something good is going to happen

206
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.360
what's going on

207
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.300
Thank you for inviting us to watch the movie

208
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.630
What nonsense are you talking about?
How could she invite us to watch a movie?

209
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.060
Watch free movies at our theater
What's the difference between giving me a treat?

210
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.830
You are not allowed to appear around here again.

211
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.730
Do you know?

212
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.430
I'll give you this sentence

213
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.200
That's your dad's theater, not yours

214
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.560
Could it be yours?

215
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.130
what did you say

216
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.600
You two guys who look like potatoes

217
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.460
what did you say

218
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.560
We are not like potatoes
Have you ever seen a potato that looks so handsome?

219
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.060
No

220
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.300
Want to explode

221
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.630
Really
Really loud

222
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.860
Oh, you two

223
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.660
Brother, they are those brats

224
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.030
What a brat, big or small

225
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.900
How dare you seduce a little girl when you are still young?
what to do

226
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.930
Hanging around the theater
Did you see what he had in his hand?

227
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.760
Brother, run quickly

228
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.300
Run quickly...

229
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.760
where to run

230
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.160
Brother, are you okay?

231
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.460
Catch the two brats

232
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.900
"The years are gone forever"

233
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.960
"I heard this sentence once when I was young and frivolous"

234
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.960
are you okay

235
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.900
"My lover who left Wanshou Mountain"

236
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.030
catch them quickly

237
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.130
Catching up

238
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.100
Run quickly

239
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.400
"Hope to see her again today"

240
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.100
"With my lips full of sorrow and joy"

241
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.000
"Although I can speak freely, I just want to say"

242
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.330
"I live so ignorantly"
(Wutong Wood Factory)

243
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.100
"I live so ignorantly"
Where did they go?

244
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.160
What are you still doing here?

245
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.430
OK

246
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.500
Oh my God, there are rats...
Oh my god

247
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.600
lied to you

248
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.500
Why are you like that?

249
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.600
Just kidding

250
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.060
Come over here...

251
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.760
Abominable

252
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.930
This is my dad's lumber factory.

253
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.630
I should go to the pharmacy first.

254
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.000
Her legs are hurt

255
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.860
If you show up in front of me again

256
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.300
He will die in my hands then

257
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.200
Accomplish complete

258
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.500
Adventure event adventure

259
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.030
Adventure…

260
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.930
what are you doing

261
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.260
scared me

262
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.660
when did you come

263
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.900
Just now, why are you so scared?

264
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.330
It's okay. I was just memorizing English vocabulary words.

265
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.830
Hey what are you doing

266
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.260
I said I was memorizing English words just now

267
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.930
To the girl whose name I don’t know

268
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.830
Is this memorizing English words?

269
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.500
My name is Li Douxue

270
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.360
I'm really sorry about what happened at the theater last time

271
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.560
It makes me worried and troubled all the time...

272
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.330
Is this a love letter to that girl?

273
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.960
That's not a love letter

274
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.030
I saw that her knees were all skinned that day.

275
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.860
I wrote this because I felt so sorry.

276
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.800
I didn't mean to give this letter to her

277
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.000
Then why did your face become so red?

278
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.630
That...because the sun is very big

279
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.130
Really, will I still not understand you?

280
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.760
Let's be honest with each other

281
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.660
Are you like me?

282
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.760
I think that girl’s face
Just lingering in front of my eyes

283
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.130
The heart beats like a drum
Make a buzzing noise in your ears

284
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.230
Brother, have you ever won me?

285
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.960
Who said I would fight with you?

286
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.530
I'm really not interested in her
It's up to you to decide

287
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.930
Brother, don’t think of me as a despicable person.

288
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.730
If you also have a crush on her
We have to compete openly and honestly.

289
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.830
And compared to the two of us,

290
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.660
That girl's thoughts are the most important, right?

291
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.000
She is not a girl whose name is unknown

292
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.700
Her name is Wu Dingchen

293
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.400
Studying in the second grade of Lishui Girls' High School

294
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.230
She just transferred here at the beginning of this year

295
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.130
I heard that her father originally opened a theater in Seoul

296
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.730
I came to the south to recuperate because of health reasons.

297
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.260
She followed

298
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.860
But do you know what’s most amazing?

299
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.830
This isn't the first time we've seen her

300
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.160
what

301
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.530
Don't you remember?

302
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.760
It was at the Zhennan Festival before
The captain of the honor team I saw

303
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.860
Do you remember

304
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.700
The girl twirling the baton

305
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.230
it's her

306
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.330
Really?

307
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.000
If you want to chase someone

308
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.760
At least you need to know this information, right?

309
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.930
We are Korean athletes

310
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.160
Majestic, brave and good at fighting

311
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:36.900
Excellent physical strength and strong skills...

312
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.630
Eat it...

313
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.400
Thank you. You're welcome.
I will enjoy it

314
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.060
Alas, everyone is here

315
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.660
They're all gathered together

316
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.660
No need to get up. Please sit down...

317
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.000
Alas, you are here

318
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.900
You are here

319
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.400
Everyone, let’s have fun today
OK

320
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.960
OMG…

321
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.730
Alas...
Dad, you are back

322
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.160
The young master seems a little drunk

323
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.960
Tetsuo

324
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.260
yes dad

325
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.900
You want to live like your grandpa, you know?

326
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.100
Got it

327
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.100
no matter what others say

328
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.330
Black is black, white is white

329
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.430
Why are you telling your child this? Come on in

330
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.600
Got it…

331
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.300
Alas, brother

332
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.530
Sorry to cause you trouble

333
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.200
Please walk slowly

334
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.560
Really, Master, don’t say that.

335
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.930
You go in and have a rest.

336
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.500
You go back, I'll go in first

337
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.230
please have a good rest

338
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.960
Uncle, thank you for your hard work

339
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.960
Your dad has a lot of worries

340
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.860
Just be considerate of him

341
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.660
OK

342
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.360
Tetsuo Every time I see you

343
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.600
I think you look a lot like your grandfather

344
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.360
You will definitely be like your grandpa

345
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.460
become an excellent person

346
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.260
I wish I were a quarter of his size

347
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.260
Oh my god, even the modesty is like your grandpa.

348
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.560
You are such a mature adult.

349
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:45.900
I'm leaving I'm leaving

350
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:52.630
Holding young son's hand

351
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:58.860
Planting potatoes…

352
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:05.130
Douxue, dad is in a good mood today

353
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.300
Dad, is that right?

354
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.630
When I was staying with the young master in town

355
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.160
meet your teacher

356
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.400
He said when you were in high school
Enrolled with first place score

357
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.730
He said you came on stage to give a speech on behalf of all the freshmen.

358
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.200
Why didn't you tell me?

359
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.500
I'm afraid if you go to school
I have to treat everyone to dinner again

360
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.660
No matter how poor I am
Just tell me

361
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.960
Even if there is no way to kill a cow
It's more than enough to slaughter a pig.

362
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.760
Anyway, you know how to read and are polite

363
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.500
The teacher keeps praising you
Say I taught you well

364
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.000
So I will ask your teacher
Let’s have a cup of millet wine

365
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.960
But... don't do that again.

366
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.930
what

367
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.400
How can you beat Tetsuo?

368
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.660
I heard that Tetsuo didn't get first place because
He cried a lot about it

369
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.930
The young master was just joking today
Mention this to me

370
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.200
Douxue, I've said it many times, right?

371
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.560
We must understand how to be a human being

372
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.200
No matter how smart you are, no matter how good you are at studying

373
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.530
If you don’t know how to be a human being

374
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.160
Then they are no different from pigs and cows

375
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.000
Whose fields are these?

376
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.960
Who do I owe that I can barely read?

377
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.400
And let you live a life of adequate food and clothing

378
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.930
It's all thanks to Zhexiong and his grandfather.

379
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.230
If you understand this

380
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.230
You even stepped on the shadow of their family members
You should also feel guilty

381
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.960
So…

382
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.160
Don't take first place again

383
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.560
Don't beat others

384
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.930
Never beat Tetsuo in any aspect

385
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.530
I said this, do you understand what I mean?

386
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.400
I understand what you mean

387
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.360
But how long will I be like this?

388
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.630
a lifetime

389
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.160
Can you promise me

390
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.960
yes dad

391
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.930
I saw your toes this morning
They all came out to say hello.

392
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.700
Your mother picked up a pair of worn-out shoes from somewhere

393
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.860
Did you see it?

394
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.260
Not yet

395
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.500
Abominable

396
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.200
Do they really have to practice today?

397
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.860
I heard with my own ears that there is an alumni sports meeting
They will practice today

398
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.860
It'll be out soon

399
00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.830
You come down first

400
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.460
Came out...

401
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.660
Have you found her?

402
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.530
Not yet. I haven't seen her yet.

403
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.560
Is she out?

404
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.260
Has it come out?

405
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.460
Really

406
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.160
Hi

407
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.730
how are you

408
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.700
Really funny

409
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.460
I said if you
Appear in front of me again...

410
00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.130
will die in your hands

411
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.900
Right

412
00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.300
Is it Bruce Lee?

413
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.660
You know so much

414
00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.160
"Tangshan Big Brother" "Jingwu Sect"
"The Dragon Crossing the River" and "Enter the Dragon"

415
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.900
I've watched it dozens of times
So I order nunchucks

416
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.860
Come on, which one of you will die first?

417
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.330
We have a wish before we die

418
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.660
How about you die before you make a wish?

419
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.730
what

420
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.900
You two are not afraid of death
Is there something wrong with your brain?

421
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.160
He tried his best to bully me before

422
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.900
What are you saying now? Do you want to date me?

423
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.700
You two really need some repairs.

424
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.560
Please decide now

425
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.900
Otherwise you will kill us
to leave here

426
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.930
You are really heroic

427
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.700
Don't you think I'm scary?

428
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.560
It's scary but...

429
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.460
you are beautiful

430
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.850
Really

431
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.760
Don't laugh
I'm risking my life now

432
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.030
good

433
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:43.500
Brother, are you exaggerating?

434
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.630
Will it?

435
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.700
What about you? What are you betting on?

436
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:49.960
Me?

437
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.230
Don't I dare to risk my life?

438
00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.060
If you want me to risk my life, I won't hesitate

439
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.200
But if you don't date me

440
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.630
I will still call your name

441
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.330
Running around in the streets and alleys

442
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.930
I haven’t put on my clothes yet…
Okay…

443
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.800
You two are really crazy.

444
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.200
This is the first time I meet someone
He risked his life to date me

445
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.630
But if I have to choose between you

446
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:32.530
Who should I choose?

447
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.860
What do you think?

448
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.630
Don't beat others

449
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.430
Never beat Tetsuo in any aspect

450
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.360
What's the relationship between you two?

451
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.160
we are friends
He is my brother

452
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.130
what

453
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.130
He is like my brother

454
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.430
We are one year apart

455
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.500
The relationship between Brother Douxue’s family and our family
unusual

456
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.460
Brother Douxue’s family…

457
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.700
Alas, it's probably because I ate too fast just now
My stomach hurts a little

458
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.800
Tetsuo, I'm leaving first

459
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.460
Just keep talking.

460
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.000
sit down

461
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.260
But my stomach hurts

462
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.960
Don't go

463
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.860
sit down for me

464
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.760
sit down

465
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.600
Okay, it's not that difficult anyway.

466
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.160
So are you willing to date us?

467
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.760
OMG…

468
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.160
I can meet you first

469
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.760
Then who are you going to choose?

470
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.600
Well, I need to think about this again.

471
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.430
After all, you need to get along with each other a lot to understand each other.

472
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.160
How long do you need to think about it?

473
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.330
About...a year or so

474
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.330
Until then, we can just be friends, okay?

475
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.130
Can't you decide faster?

476
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.700
A year is a bit…

477
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.460
Brother, what do you think?

478
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.330
I think it doesn't matter if you go slower.

479
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.300
It's okay to go slower

480
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.660
Otherwise, you might as well never decide.

481
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.960
Do you want to wait until the day you wear your braids?

482
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.460
Okay, then just follow my advice.

483
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.130
You guys stand up

484
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.660
and you

485
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.560
Talk to me more easily from now on. Do you understand?

486
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.530
Yes…

487
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.100
OK... OK

488
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.730
Okay friends, let's go then

489
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.430
Hey, let's go

490
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:59.130
"The years are gone forever"

491
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.800
"I heard this sentence once when I was young and frivolous"

492
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.800
"My lover who left Wanshou Mountain"

493
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.630
"Hope to see her again today"

494
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:25.200
"With my lips full of sorrow and joy"

495
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.560
"Although I can speak freely, I just want to say"

496
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.630
"I live so ignorantly"

497
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.030
Come on, sergeants.

498
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.660
Come on

499
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.100
("College Troublemaker" "Chaos Diary")
"I live so ignorantly"

500
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.930
("0mother's apartment")

501
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.630
I just said that...

502
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.100
"Things said casually while turning around"

503
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.000
"Do you understand what that means?"

504
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.700
(I don’t know. It’s so difficult)

505
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.260
"My love lit the fire of Mount Shakti"

506
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.300
Come

507
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.260
"Burn all the weeds off the grave"
I want to eat it, it’s so hot

508
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.830
Isn't it hot?

509
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.860
very hot

510
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.830
"My bittersweet mouth"

511
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.800
Don't sit here. Come back to the team quickly.

512
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.500
"You can say anything"

513
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.900
Hey your gun

514
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.860
(Nominations for the 10th National Assembly election are coming soon)

515
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.400
"I live so ignorantly"

516
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:56.130
"I live so ignorantly"

517
00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.730
Lieutenant Colonel Huang

518
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.760
If the sun shines brightly every day, the trees will die

519
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.700
The trees must have experienced wind, rain and heavy snow

520
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.700
to grow into a big tree

521
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.630
Don't think you've been demoted

522
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.960
Let's get along well

523
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.300
thank you for your blessings

524
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.860
Please give me more advice in the future, Head of Teachers

525
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.000
Come

526
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.230
Use this money to boost morale

527
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.200
That's why I want to ask for your advice

528
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.560
thank you

529
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.660
This guy treats me like a beggar

530
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.600
Team Leader Wu

531
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.830
Let’s use the subsidy when making kimchi this year.

532
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.760
No need, Captain

533
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.960
Take it

534
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.700
You're the only one following me

535
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.600
thank you

536
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.830
what

537
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.900
Trees go through wind, rain and heavy snow

538
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.500
Am I a tree?

539
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.000
A guy who overestimates his abilities
What does he think of our security headquarters?

540
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.100
What era is it now?

541
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.160
Team Leader Wu

542
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.200
Go find out the details of that person

543
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.530
You can rest assured

544
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.600
I'll find out everything about him

545
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.900
And…

546
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.530
How are the opinions of the local gentry surveyed?

547
00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.600
I'm doing it. I'm sorting it out by selection.

548
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.430
This year’s parliamentary election
Must win a big victory

549
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.560
Only then can we go back

550
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.760
yes

551
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.600
(Bring your ID card to participate in the voting)

552
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.600
The test results are out

553
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.530
Are you all ready to hit the playground?

554
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.700
OK

555
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.430
But this time there is a big change

556
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.130
Li Douxue Cui Zhexiong

557
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.860
Yes

558
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.300
Your ranking has changed

559
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.830
The first place in the school this time is Li Douxue

560
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.930
Full marks in every subject

561
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.560
Come on, everyone applaud

562
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.560
Tetsuo

563
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.960
congratulations

564
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.230
No more

565
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.760
I guessed several questions. I was just lucky.

566
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.600
You are taking this exam for Dingchen
Did you study so hard?

567
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.600
How could it be

568
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.700
I'm just lucky

569
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.130
Also

570
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.460
It's a bit boring without any competition

571
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.230
But I still feel bad

572
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.000
Then let's go and relax

573
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.560
Dingchen should be waiting for us

574
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.060
I don't feel well today

575
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.730
Go yourself

576
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.160
Tetsuo…
Douxue Tetsuo

577
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.960
Why did you come here?

578
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.900
Hello

579
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.830
Do you know how I did in this exam?

580
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.500
How is it

581
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.430
My grades improved by eight places

582
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.130
Great. So where did you get it?

583
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.830
Ranked 17th in the class and 190th in the school

584
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.460
I got into the top 200 for the first time

585
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:12.960
What are you doing?

586
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.760
Do I also want to take the first and second place exams in the school?

587
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.960
No

588
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.430
you are great

589
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.260
All of these...

590
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.560
Thank you Li Douxue

591
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.800
So

592
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.230
You are going to a place with me today

593
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.560
Let's go

594
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.230
Let's go

595
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.860
Why are you still standing there?

596
00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.260
Let's go

597
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.460
Mom ordered a lot of food

598
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.230
Mom

599
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.000
His name is Choi Cheol-woong

600
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.360
His name is Li Douxue

601
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.030
They compete for first and second place in the school all day long

602
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.560
This time Douxue won first place

603
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.100
Tetsuo took second place

604
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.460
Really?

605
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.760
thank you

606
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.560
I heard that you taught Dingchen how to read.

607
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.930
No

608
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.660
It's Dingchen who works very hard

609
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.200
That's right, I worked hard

610
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.430
Will I not understand her?

611
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.130
If it weren't for you

612
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.530
Even if the earth falls apart

613
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.530
It's impossible for her to get into the top 200

614
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.400
I could have passed without them

615
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.360
Your father is back from the hospital

616
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.030
Long time no see Brother Zhongzhong

617
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.960
I was shocked when I received your call

618
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.330
Although I also thought that one day

619
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.800
we will definitely meet again

620
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:59.830
Me too. I heard about your coming to Lishui.

621
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.060
shocked

622
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.300
Take a seat

623
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.230
You're still the same

624
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.830
You haven't changed much

625
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.760
do you have children

626
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.430
i have a son

627
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.160
He should be in high school now

628
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.030
Yes

629
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.160
Fortunately you didn't marry me

630
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.600
if you marry me

631
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.100
You have to follow the army everywhere

632
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.230
She has probably become a country aunt long ago

633
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.060
sorry

634
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.160
If my father hadn't objected...

635
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.730
No, he was very prescient.

636
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.630
Is he in good health?

637
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.930
he passed away

638
00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.830
He died of a stroke due to losing the election.

639
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.230
So that's it

640
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.660
sorry

641
00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.660
It doesn't matter

642
00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.630
but what happened

643
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.300
Didn't you invite me here to have a normal conversation?

644
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.200
Actually…

645
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.160
I have something to ask you

646
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.930
Do you like to eat Chinese food?

647
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.730
come to play occasionally

648
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.130
I'll treat you to food again

649
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:21.330
Okay, we will come often

650
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.400
Your father runs a lumber factory, right?

651
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.930
Your family is very famous in Lishui

652
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.130
Yes

653
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.960
Maybe because my grandfather participated in the independence movement

654
00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.700
I heard

655
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.430
He is a very good person

656
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.800
what does your dad do

657
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.800
Well...

658
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.530
He is a farmer

659
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.900
It must be very hard

660
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.830
He has a son like you who is good at reading.

661
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.530
Must be very gratifying

662
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.460
Yes

663
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.600
Originally successful people were young
We all live very hard.

664
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.260
Yes

665
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.060
Academic father

666
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.660
He used to be a long-term worker in our family

667
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.830
My grandfather sent him to primary school

668
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.200
Later, before he went to Manchuria to participate in the independence movement,

669
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.600
And burned the slave contract with him

670
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.130
Choi Cheol-woong, you are really...

671
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.500
No

672
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.800
You are not a successful person
I lived very hard when I was a child

673
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.760
Douxue was born in a poor family

674
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.700
That's what I mean

675
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.660
Successful people lived very hard when they were young
I have never heard this sentence

676
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.730
But our family did suffer
Grandpa Tetsuo takes great care of you

677
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.330
me and my dad

678
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.600
I will never forget his great kindness in this life.

679
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.230
Yes, you are so sensible

680
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.530
(Li Douxue)

681
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.930
are you serious

682
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.100
I'm serious

683
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.000
His position is opposite to ours

684
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.300
So does his father

685
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.200
That’s why the image of the South Korean Party will improve.

686
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.860
independence activist family

687
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.060
Opposition figures
Also joined the Korean Party

688
00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.700
In addition, it can also be cut off
The financial resources of Hunan opposition members

689
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.600
I'm just guessing

690
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.030
I'm so embarrassed when you put on such an expression

691
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.300
Please, Brother Zhongzhong

692
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.860
Are we in this kind of relationship now?

693
00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.830
But does your husband agree?

694
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.200
Of course

695
00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.300
Help your husband

696
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.060
what can i get

697
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.330
are you okay

698
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.830
Douxue

699
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.800
Wipe this for you

700
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.230
Let's go to the pharmacy

701
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.000
i'm fine

702
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.860
You go back

703
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.730
You are obviously not good

704
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.760
Go back quickly

705
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.330
Brother

706
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.800
I don't want to see you, go back quickly

707
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.130
Douxue

708
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.100
Really…

709
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.700
I'm sorry

710
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.360
Do you call me friend like this?

711
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.400
Only you have self-respect

712
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.330
Does Douxue have no self-esteem?

713
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.460
you are so despicable

714
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.460
This girl is really strong

715
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.500
are you okay

716
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.700
I'm really sorry

717
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.500
I really didn't mean that

718
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.730
Brother

719
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.500
it's my fault

720
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.860
Please forgive me once

721
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.500
Why don't I die?

722
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.630
I want to tear my mouth apart

723
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.860
Don't do this

724
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.460
Just hit me until you are angry.

725
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.300
Tetsuo, you bad guy

726
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.260
Despicable person

727
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.160
Unloyal guy

728
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.200
A guy who is worse than a dog

729
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.860
you hit me

730
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.900
A guy like me deserves to be beaten.

731
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.160
Okay, it's okay

732
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.900
It doesn't matter what

733
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.500
I want to be beaten by you

734
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.930
I understand your mood

735
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.660
Don't do this again

736
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.330
Do you really understand how I feel?

737
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.230
Yes

738
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.760
Oops

739
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.400
The water tastes so sweet

740
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.500
Although you were born to me

741
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.800
But looking at you really feels magical

742
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.160
why

743
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.600
Your father can only read a little bit

744
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.900
I'm illiterate and can't understand anything.

745
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.030
How could I give birth to such an excellent child as you?

746
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.030
And you come to help farm all day long

747
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.000
How come you still read so well?

748
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.030
You reap what you sow. I have inherited it from you.

749
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.430
If grandpa sends you to study

750
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.600
You can definitely become a judge or prosecutor

751
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.130
right

752
00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.160
If so

753
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.100
I will definitely not be with your stupid person
dad together

754
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.000
I'll be with a handsome guy from Seoul

755
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.400
right

756
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.200
Right

757
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.530
Dou Xue

758
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.200
Do you know when I am most relieved?

759
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.660
I woke up in the middle of the night

760
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.860
I saw your back studying at the desk

761
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.760
I was most pleased then

762
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.400
I feel like you will definitely become a big shot in the future

763
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.600
You envy Tetsuo, right?

764
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.700
No

765
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:58.060
Don't worry, I'm already saving money for you

766
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.830
You can also live a good life in the future

767
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.130
Why do you want to help me save money?

768
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.500
I know my family has no money

769
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.960
It’s not just money that can be saved

770
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.800
Sometimes connections can be saved

771
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.100
what does that mean

772
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.230
That's it anyway

773
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.330
Go to the library quickly or go home and study

774
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.200
I'll do the rest

775
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.160
i can help you

776
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.930
You go back quickly, hurry up...

777
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.030
Come sit here and let's talk

778
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.160
Dad thinks

779
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.300
You have read enough books

780
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.200
Can you start going to the fields with daddy?

781
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.460
what

782
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:34.630
After Zhenyu gets married, she becomes someone else's family.

783
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:36.700
What to do with these fields?

784
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.100
And just with these few acres of land

785
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.300
I'm not sure I can send you to college

786
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.960
Dad, are you like this because of Tetsuo?

787
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.700
Are you doing this because I beat Tetsuo in the exam?

788
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.600
What? Did Tetsuo cry again?

789
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.660
Dad

790
00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.360
why can't i study

791
00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.030
Why can't I get first place in the exam?

792
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.030
other parents

793
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.200
I heard that my child came first in the exam
It’s too late to praise

794
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.960
Why don't you let me study

795
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.000
Don't let me take the first place in the exam

796
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.630
Dad

797
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.900
Although we received help from Grandpa Tetsuo

798
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.730
But I can repay them later

799
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.900
This is not the feudal era

800
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.600
It’s not the Joseon era either

801
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.500
Why do I have to live like a slave?

802
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.160
you guy

803
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.160
How can you contradict dad?

804
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.100
Let you study more
Are you going to climb on top of me?

805
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.460
That's why I don't let you study

806
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.400
Dad…

807
00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:44.800
I won't talk back anymore

808
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.360
I did that in a moment of madness

809
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.000
Dad

810
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.430
I won't mess with Tetsuo and Tetsuo's family anymore.

811
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.260
I swear it's true

812
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:04.160
Dad, I really want to study

813
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.260
I can't hope to go to college

814
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.700
But at least let me finish high school

815
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.700
From now on I will completely listen to dad

816
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:24.160
And I will never do Tetsuo again
Sad thing

817
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.930
Dad please

818
00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:27.330
please

819
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.700
Then…

820
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.760
You transfer to another school

821
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.300
Why did you come here at this time?

822
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.760
Husband

823
00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.860
No problem anymore

824
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.960
Finally got it done

825
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.130
what does that mean

826
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.530
You're going to be a member of Congress

827
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.730
what

828
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.360
You're about to be nominated

829
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.460
Wife, come here

830
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:36.660
what on earth are you talking about

831
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.360
what was nominated

832
00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.860
Have you ever met people from the Democratic Party?

833
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.400
You have to choose a side anyway.

834
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.160
Of course, you must choose the safest and most reliable backer.

835
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.430
what

836
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.300
You went to the South Korean Party

837
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.330
are you crazy

838
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.000
You're finally going to be nominated.

839
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.330
Will soon become a member of Congress

840
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.030
why are you so angry

841
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.930
You are really too much

842
00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.730
Korea Party

843
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:04.060
Do you want me to be an authoritarian dog?

844
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.800
Who told you to be a dog?

845
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.460
It’s not that you can’t catch tiger cubs if you don’t enter the tiger’s den.

846
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.200
People from the opposition party go in and tell them the truth.

847
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.530
How good is this

848
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.800
stand on the opposite side and oppose
They won't listen at all

849
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.660
Others have agreed to accept you

850
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.260
How can you say no?

851
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.160
It doesn't seem to make sense to you

852
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.530
ok

853
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:30.330
That's fine. You can go by yourself.

854
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.400
Husband

855
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.000
I managed to help you negotiate it with great difficulty

856
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.560
Our family can stand up again

857
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:42.360
It’s your family that needs to stand up again

858
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.100
My house has never fallen down

859
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.330
Husband

860
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:50.630
We have lived together for more than 20 years
Why don’t you understand me yet?

861
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.660
Yes

862
00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.900
You donate all your hard earned money

863
00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.900
Help others become members of Congress

864
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.200
Since you are so worried about the country and the people

865
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.560
Can't you become a member of Congress yourself?

866
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.260
Don’t drink makgeolli with the farmers all day long

867
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.930
I will stay in this small village my whole life.

868
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.700
This small village is my hometown

869
00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.130
me as your wife

870
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:20.160
I have been the daughter-in-law of this family for 20 years

871
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.930
I never thought you were so stupid

872
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.660
I run everywhere for you

873
00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.530
So hard

874
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.960
But you didn’t even say thank you

875
00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.930
what

876
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.230
Oops, such a thing can happen

877
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.230
He won't eat even if the food is brought to him

878
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.560
I'm really angry

879
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.030
So

880
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:55.730
Uncle, he might listen to you.

881
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.830
what

882
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.400
A rough guy like me

883
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.430
I only know things in the fields

884
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:08.360
Besides, the young master has a bad temper to begin with.

885
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.300
Once you make up your mind, you rarely change your mind

886
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.730
lumber mill

887
00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:13.930
Just looks grand

888
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.330
Strictly speaking, those are bank assets.

889
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:19.530
And…

890
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:23.560
Providing funds to opposition parties
Looks like he's about to be discovered

891
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.130
But his opponent said he would nominate him

892
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:29.200
Refusal of nomination in this case

893
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.900
They will definitely not let our family go

894
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.330
The bond between our families is so deep...

895
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:50.130
Although starting in 1973

896
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.260
Unified rice cultivation

897
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:54.360
Significantly increase domestic rice production

898
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.200
But the current level of self-sufficiency…

899
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.360
you guy

900
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.360
Hey brat

901
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.600
If you dare to mess with me, I will definitely kill you.

902
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.660
Brat

903
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.900
Is that person named Li Douxue?

904
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.860
Without him, he is nothing.

905
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.960
2,500 won

906
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:37.560
That bastard

907
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.330
welcome

908
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:48.060
thank you

909
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.630
Why hasn't the child's father come yet?

910
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.960
He will be here soon

911
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.230
Has he really changed his mind?

912
00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:00.200
Say to the young master

913
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.060
He will announce his candidacy today

914
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.960
These are like-minded people

915
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.760
We need people with electoral experience.

916
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.300
Doesn't he want to run as a member of the Democratic Party?

917
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.130
Candidates have been selected long ago

918
00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:19.630
Really?

919
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.660
President…

920
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.430
You are here...

921
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.600
I originally just wanted to live a low-key life

922
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.900
But this world won’t let me go

923
00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:43.130
So this time

924
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.030
I still have many shortcomings

925
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:48.760
Decided to participate in this election for members of Congress

926
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:55.000
Choi Young-sik…

927
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.100
thank you

928
00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:02.930
Choi Young-sik…

929
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.000
Everyone

930
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.130
Drops of water can penetrate rocks

931
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.130
Even a small force

932
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:11.360
We must also work together

933
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:17.400
Let’s defeat dictatorship together, everyone.

934
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:33.760
Choi Young-sik…

935
01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.700
Captain, you guessed it right

936
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.000
Fortunately he was not nominated in the first place

937
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.960
I just said it

938
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.830
He will never run as a member of the South Korean Party

939
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.400
OK

940
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.860
Start torturing him slowly

941
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.400
Li Douxue

942
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.930
Stop

943
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.130
why are you hiding from me

944
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.260
I didn't hide from you

945
01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.103
You didn't even go to the library or contact me.

946
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.400
I want to help with farm work

947
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.000
not like that

948
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.800
You did it because your father worked as a long-term laborer
You avoid me because you feel embarrassed

949
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.500
You go back

950
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.330
Li Douxue, you are really too much.

951
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.700
What does it mean to be a long-term worker?

952
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.900
It’s not like being a traitor

953
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.630
What's there to be ashamed of?

954
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:48.300
The future is more important, right?

955
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.230
You study as hard as you do now

956
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.260
Who dares to look down on you when you get ahead in the future?

957
01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.060
I transferred schools

958
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.330
Went to Agricultural High School

959
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.160
You have to study hard

960
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.400
Take care of yourself

961
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.230
Are you not going to see me anymore?

962
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:16.830
Can't we be friends if we go to agricultural high school?

963
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.960
I've decided who to choose

964
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.430
why

965
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:20.700
why choose you

966
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.430
Why don't you choose Tetsuo?

967
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.330
Don't ask stupid questions like this again

968
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:31.530
Just say you like me

969
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.900
Hello

970
01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.030
Are you a newcomer who just came here last week?

971
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.330
As soon as they arrive, take the prisoners in Room 7
Beaten them all

972
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.600
The lunatic who was imprisoned in the punishment room
Is that you?

973
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.160
what crime have you committed

974
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.300
Didn't answer

975
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:20.830
kill

976
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.760
who did you kill

977
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:29.400
Qi Yingzhuo, wake up

978
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.400
Qi Yingzhuo

979
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.400
Where did you throw the ball?

980
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.130
Yingzhuo

981
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:55.200
The man you killed was named Qi Yingzhuo

982
01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:00.330
He is my only brother

983
01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:04.660
The only one who comes to see me

984
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.160
Will give me money

985
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.260
It's just him

986
01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.330
you know i'm here

987
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:23.030
How long have you been waiting for me, brat?

988
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:24.430
I didn't kill the person

989
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.460
Dare you say no?

990
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.060
Li Douxue, you brat

991
01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.660
really not me

992
01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.660
Tetsuo

993
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.630
(Oasis Oasis)

994
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:54.730
I'm dating you
It’s not like I’m dating Tetsuo

995
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.230
Choi Cheol-woong, do you know him?

996
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.930
Yeah

997
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.300
Who hit you?

998
01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.830
Please go back

999
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:01.530
Impolite girl

1000
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.600
you bastard

1001
01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.560
Ms. Jiang

1002
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.530
It’s hard to have such a noble and upright husband, right?

1003
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:08.730
Are you hiding something from me?

1004
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.030
Brother, please save me

1005
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.400
why should i save you

1006
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.760
Douxue, please say it’s not you

1007
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.800
all because of you

1008
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.330
Never say you know me

1009
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.260
Didn't you say you would be responsible for my life?

1010
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.430
Didn't you say you would stand out?
Then make it up to me, brat
