00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:10.100
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

2
00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.700
(Episode 5)
Alas, let’s fight each other

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.233
(Lishui, early 1960s)
Are you starving?

4
00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.833
Okay...Mom, let's feed you milk

5
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm going to weed the master's field

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.467
After you sow the seeds, go back first.

7
00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:27.467
Oh my god

8
00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.233
Do I have to sow all that barley alone?

9
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.500
I still have to take care of the kids

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.067
This is too much, right?

11
00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.500
We are not servants of the Joseon Dynasty

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.433
Could it be that after you die?
Will that master help you erect a monument to praise your virtues?

13
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.767
Really, what do you know?

14
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:44.233
I know everything, okay?

15
00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.200
If you know everything, don't say such things

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500
It’s not that I’m ungrateful

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.700
I just think you paid too much

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000
One person takes care of that family's farm work
That's not enough

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Even our crops
Give it to them after the harvest

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.167
Other long-term workers will not do their job to the death.

21
00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:02.033
You're the only one who has lost your mind

22
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:03.267
That's what I mean

23
00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:05.767
Even if others don't do it
I have to do this too

24
00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.367
It’s those people who don’t know how to be grateful

25
00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.333
Even if the world is in decline

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.733
We must not forget the principles of life

27
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.033
Sigh, if only everyone were like you

28
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.867
The world no longer needs Confucius and Mencius.

29
00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:21.633
That old woman is really...
You're leaving soon...

30
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.933
Don't worry about my life or death. Just leave.

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.167
Practice more principles of being a human being.

32
00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:33.233
By the way, I seem to be pregnant again

33
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.267
My period has not come for three months

34
00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:42.733
You burn the grass

35
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.167
Leave the rest of the sowing work to me

36
00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:46.667
You go back and rest

37
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.933
Alas, Douxue

38
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.767
I heard you are going to have a brother

39
00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:00.367
Your dad still looks indifferent

40
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.800
You will definitely not be like your dad when you grow up.

41
00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.467
You are really a person. Please ride slower.

42
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.300
If you ride like this, I will go to see King Yama first.

43
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.067
Oh my god

44
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.533
The master must be killed quickly
Just send it to a big hospital in Gwangju

45
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.500
Can we call an ambulance now?

46
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.467
Okay, let me make a call

47
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:38.733
No need…

48
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:40.900
Dad
Dad

49
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.967
Send the doctor home

50
00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:48.333
Call Douxue's father to come in

51
00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:02.967
Master

52
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:06.867
I don't have to ask you to make him your adopted son.

53
00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.200
But if the second child is a son
Just do it

54
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.233
Because my wife cannot give birth to a child...

55
00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.367
My sins are heavy

56
00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:21.533
It doesn’t matter if there are no descendants to offer sacrifices after death...

57
00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:30.067
But I'm afraid I won't have the face to see my ancestors after I die

58
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600
I'll take care of you

59
00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:35.567
Master

60
00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.133
Even so

61
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.600
We are of untouchable blood...

62
00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:42.867
Young-sik

63
00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:45.100
Big brother

64
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.967
Please

65
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.833
I have only one request

66
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.033
Since we have to do this

67
00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:59.133
Just treat that child as my own.

68
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.467
I know

69
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.867
I will keep this matter secret

70
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.033
I will keep it in my heart until I die

71
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.500
Master

72
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.933
thank you

73
00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:42.433
Why are you crying like this

74
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.067
Because it's sad...

75
00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:49.467
The child is not born yet

76
00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:52.533
He was snatched away as an adopted son
Is this true?

77
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
If he is a son, he will be adopted by them

78
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.467
And how do you say someone snatched it away?

79
00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:01.533
On the contrary, we are receiving favors from others, right?

80
00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.767
Oh my god, the kids are going to be taken away.

81
00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:06.300
What kind of favor is this?

82
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.333
Think about it

83
00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.033
Every spring famine period
It’s too hard to eat with one more mouth

84
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:14.900
People are willing to help raise children
What a lot to be thankful for

85
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.800
Say it again

86
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.133
our children
To grow up well in such a wealthy family

87
00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.867
How gratifying it would be for us to see

88
00:05:22.867 --> 00:05:26.433
But will that kid recognize us?

89
00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:29.700
You are a real person
Does it matter whether he recognizes us or not?

90
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.833
we know it ourselves
As long as God knows and Earth knows, that’s fine

91
00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.467
I can't hold him in my arms
Can you still say it’s your own child?

92
00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:39.467
The child will think that those who raise him are his parents

93
00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:43.133
Even if he grows up to be a judge or a prosecutor
It's of no use at all

94
00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:47.700
If... is a son

95
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.500
Just consider him lucky.

96
00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:09.100
Why did I break up with you?

97
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.067
She got married in a hurry and became a woman.

98
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.233
Guro Industrial Zone happened again
What about the headache?

99
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.500
I will do it the same way as last time

100
00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:40.700
Don't be too arrogant. Just follow your brother's lead.

101
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.433
Otherwise, you can just hide in the corner

102
00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:46.000
(Fangri Industrial)

103
00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:02.900
(Demand to stop suppressing trade unions)

104
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.767
thank you

105
00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:21.833
Douxue
Yes eldest brother

106
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.400
Yongbi
Yes eldest brother

107
00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:26.900
(Personal profile Wen Dongxiu)

108
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.233
This guy is the culprit

109
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:29.867
Dropped out of a prestigious university

110
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.500
Pretending to be employed in a factory

111
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.867
Inciting workers who know nothing

112
00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:35.233
bring down the company

113
00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:36.667
(Unite and fight)
This despicable man

114
00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.600
It must be in the factory

115
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.300
We must catch him, you know?

116
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.467
Brother, I also came to work in a factory in Seoul.

117
00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:45.933
Bangil Industrial Co., Ltd. just over Guro-ri

118
00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:48.333
They make hinges and razors.

119
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.533
Then just ask the police to arrest them.

120
00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.500
After the union was established here

121
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.700
The company has been closed down

122
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.833
So there is no reason to arrest workers

123
00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.933
But we still have to get rid of that kid.

124
00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:04.200
See what I mean

125
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.200
I understand

126
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.767
Do you understand?

127
00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:10.067
Yes brother

128
00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:34.167
follow me

129
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.667
Wait to die

130
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.567
Brat

131
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.367
Brother, are you okay?

132
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.800
Damn...

133
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.000
Come with us obediently

134
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.333
Brother

135
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.967
Brother, please don’t do this

136
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:34.700
Don't do this

137
00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.233
Wen Dongxiu

138
00:09:40.633 --> 00:09:42.400
Brat

139
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.200
Let's go

140
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.067
Brother, don't be like this

141
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:23.400
(Requesting to revoke the temporary suspension of business and protect the right to survival)

142
00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:31.200
(Trustworthy Seoul Police)

143
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.367
Teacher…

144
00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.100
Zhenyu…

145
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.600
let go

146
00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:39.633
Take me away too

147
00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:41.233
I asked you to take me away

148
00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:41.933
Be calm

149
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:42.667
let go

150
00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:44.300
Hello

151
00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:47.233
come with us

152
00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:52.133
Take care of your family

153
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.200
Give this to Boss Lian

154
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.267
I finally got you out

155
00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:16.967
Just stay at home

156
00:11:17.967 --> 00:11:20.400
I'm really grateful

157
00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:22.733
If I didn't have a gangster brother...

158
00:11:22.733 --> 00:11:23.333
Hello

159
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:26.333
do you know what you are doing

160
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.733
Those black-hearted bosses are worse than animals

161
00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:30.667
And you are acting as their lackey

162
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.133
where are you going

163
00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:38.700
Let go, I want to be with my friends

164
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.200
your partner?

165
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200
Those who go to night school
Are you a partner in the demonstration?

166
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.733
Are those guys more important than family?

167
00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:46.900
They are my family and my comrades

168
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.133
Gay?

169
00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:50.867
It seems you have become a red element too, right?

170
00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.367
If you go to the police station now

171
00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:53.900
You might be arrested and sent to jail directly.

172
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.900
If you want me to go to jail, I will sit there.

173
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.100
Only criminals like you are afraid of going to jail

174
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.500
I'm not afraid at all

175
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.833
why

176
00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:04.300
Because all I do is
In order to live with dignity

177
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.733
Abominable

178
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Why on earth do you have to live like this?

179
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.333
You were obviously not this kind of person before

180
00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:21.900
Don’t you feel that you are ashamed of God?

181
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.400
After all, I'm used to living a life without seeing the light of day.

182
00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:26.167
What's more

183
00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.933
God won't care about a guy like me.

184

Zhenyu

185

Douxue

186
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.833
OMG…

187
00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.700
You...look at your virtues

188
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.500
Go back

189
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.367
It's best not to let your parents know about this

190
00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:40.367
what does this mean

191
00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:41.967
What can't we know?

192
00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:44.467
Mom, don’t let Zhenyu go out

193
00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.033
Just let her stay home

194
00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.767
Don't let her go to work in the company

195
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.633
Company?

196
00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:50.667
The factory is temporarily closed

197
00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:54.567
So let her eat and sleep at home, okay?

198
00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:56.467
Did you get into trouble?

199
00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:58.733
The person who caused trouble is my brother

200
00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:01.400
The son who made you proud

201
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.367
Now he's gone to be a gangster.

202
00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:09.967
What is she talking about?

203
00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:21.200
Mom

204
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.167
Don't let Zhenyu go to work in the factory anymore

205
00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:26.767
Let her go to college

206
00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:28.933
I will be responsible for her tuition

207
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.433
I came here to give you this

208
00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:37.567
This…

209
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.867
Take it back

210
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.400
I asked you to take it back

211
00:13:47.252 --> 00:13:52.200
My son was bought with us in mind.
why are you like this

212
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.033
What have you been doing lately?

213
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.133
Zhenyu just said it

214
00:13:59.133 --> 00:14:00.467
I'm being a gangster

215
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.033
You bastard

216
00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:05.900
The arrogant dad...

217
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.633
What's wrong

218
00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:11.200
You beat me like you did before

219
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.767
It's all because of my dad that I'm like this.

220
00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:32.467
Douxue

221
00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:37.000
Dou Xue Even so
You shouldn't live like this either

222
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.633
How can you be a gangster?

223
00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:41.367
You are obviously a kind child

224
00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:44.000
Mom, you don’t understand

225
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.667
I don't understand where...

226
00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:50.633
An ex-con with nothing and no skills.

227
00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:52.800
What else can you do after you get out of prison?

228
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.467
Do you want me to go back to my hometown to farm?

229
00:14:55.467 --> 00:14:57.200
Do you have fields that I can plant?

230
00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:01.000
Dad, what can you say?

231
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.500
I've always listened to you

232
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.700
If you tell me not to study, I will give up studying.

233
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.133
If you tell me to go to jail, I will go to jail.

234
00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:11.967
After I get out of prison

235
00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:14.600
All you can do is be a gangster.

236
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:17.533
If you don't even let me do this

237
00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:21.433
How about I just die?

238
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.233
You answer me

239
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.800
Douxue…

240
00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:45.467
I'm definitely not my father's son

241
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.733
(Supreme Prosecutor's Office)

242
00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.433
This is the Supreme Prosecutor's Office

243
00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:13.400
All trainees, please follow me

244
00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:25.300
Yes, he is Choi Cheol-woong

245
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.933
The guy who was the mole before

246
00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:30.833
Let's go upstairs

247
00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:46.667
congratulations

248
00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:52.100
long time no see

249
00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:55.267
why are you here

250
00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:57.133
Why else

251
00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.967
I work here too

252
00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:03.233
to you

253
00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:05.567
(Wu Wanxu)

254
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.067
The Ministry of Security and Enterprise sent me to work here.

255
00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:14.033
I believe…

256
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.633
Will you help me as much as you did before?

257
00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:20.067
Let's have a cup of soju together later

258
00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:26.600
Don't get me wrong

259
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:29.567
I'm no longer the puppet I used to be

260
00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:32.967
I am Choi Cheol-woong, a prosecutor of the Republic of Korea.

261
00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:37.300
Why are you like this?
You are still just a trainee now, right?

262
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.800
If you mess with me again

263
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.167
Don't blame me for tearing you into pieces

264
00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:50.333
Do you want to be a prosecutor?

265
00:17:51.933 --> 00:17:54.000
What can we do?

266
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.167
The future prosecutor

267
00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.700
In the files of our Security and Enterprise Department
I have your record

268
00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:01.867
I want you to serve the country

269
00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:04.300
And let you retire early

270
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:09.100
But you are completely uncooperative...

271
00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:18.000
But it doesn't matter

272
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.433
Is it possible to make more money as a lawyer anyway?

273
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.167
Are you threatening me now?

274
00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:28.867
How dare I

275
00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:31.267
I'm just reminding you that this is the reality

276
00:18:31.267 --> 00:18:32.567
Results are important

277
00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:35.333
But political orientation is also a part that must be considered

278
00:18:37.267 --> 00:18:41.033
But you want to be a prosecutor
It's not like there's no other way

279
00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:47.767
The prosecution currently lacks information on the All-Students Federation

280
00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:51.433
Because we didn’t provide everything to them

281
00:18:51.433 --> 00:18:54.300
I'm here today to give them relevant files

282
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.467
That's all information you already know

283
00:18:58.467 --> 00:19:01.333
As long as you report it personally on my behalf

284
00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:07.367
There shouldn't be anyone
I doubt your political leanings

285
00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:11.133
you now...

286
00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:13.700
Could it be...

287
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:19.467
Do you want me to betray my friends with my own hands again?

288
00:19:19.467 --> 00:19:21.600
That's what you mean, right?

289
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.233
you didn't betray anyone

290
00:19:24.233 --> 00:19:27.200
Because whoever among us reports

291
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200
The result will be the same

292
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.333
But if you do it instead of me

293
00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:36.200
you can achieve your goal

294
00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:47.867
That being the case

295
00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:50.533
Just report it yourself

296
00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:53.733
Why do you keep looking for me?

297
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:03.133
I'm not sure either

298
00:20:03.133 --> 00:20:06.167
You half-assed dead mole

299
00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:14.600
listen up

300
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.733
This is your last trial and chance

301
00:20:18.733 --> 00:20:21.000
Don't be a scumbag
Always in the gray area

302
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.233
state your position

303
00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:25.033
See if you want to be a family with us

304
00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.633
Or are we enemies?

305
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.433
to be honest

306
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:41.067
I don't want to at all
Reuse your waste

307
00:20:41.067 --> 00:20:45.500
I really can't understand
Why are my parents so nice to you?

308
00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:49.100
If you see him someday

309
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.667
You must bow three thousand times to him

310
00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:06.500
I'm waiting for you in front of the big conference room

311
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.033
If you don't show up within five minutes

312
00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.367
I'll just assume you don't want to be a family with us anymore

313
00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:50.600
In addition to Mingxingye and Hanjiang Film and Television
Outside the theaters of these two film companies

314
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.000
All theaters on a pro-rata basis
They were all eaten by the middle of us

315
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.867
But won’t we lose money by doing this?

316
00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.867
If you look at each theater separately
Theaters that are indeed losing money

317
00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:01.533
But overall

318
00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:04.100
Because there are so many theaters
We will never lose money

319
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.067
You girl, you are very ambitious.

320
00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:14.233
But if you expand your business too quickly

321
00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:17.400
I'm afraid there won't be enough silver bullets

322
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.333
Eating too fast will break the bowl

323
00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:22.500
let's take our time

324
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.867
I know your hard work

325
00:22:24.867 --> 00:22:27.000
But please hold on a little longer

326
00:22:28.467 --> 00:22:29.900
Bring something

327
00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:35.100

Just got it back

Oh, it's true

340
00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:10.333
I envy you so much

341

this gives you

I'm so sorry to trouble you every time.

348
00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:38.233
Don't say that. To me it's an investment.

349
00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:40.733
I am also very happy to see the company grow

The driving force and vanguard force behind the All-Students Federation

359

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:35.500
Don't live in such a shameful way

367
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.233
If I really am a mole

368
00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:40.700
Whether it's brother or someone else

369
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.900
None of them will be here now

370
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.733
(Arrest the headquarters of the Three People's Struggle Committee...)

371
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:52.133
(Arrest of the Three People's Struggle Committee Headquarters
is the first priority)

372
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:04.600
what is he doing...

373
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.000
Damn...

374
00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:20.867
sorry

375
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.933
Don't be nervous

376
00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:28.533
Young people who contribute to the country

377
00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:30.400
Don't be discouraged

378
00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:32.633
See you next time

379
00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:02.333
If you become a red molecule
This record cannot be washed away no matter how you wash it.

380
00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:06.133
I really don’t know how your sister could do this
Get involved with them

381
00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:12.367
My friend's sister works in a textile factory

382
00:26:12.367 --> 00:26:14.467
according to her
There are no red molecules in it at all

383
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.167
Because the boss treats them really badly

384
00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:20.567
Most people are protesting against the boss
Just joined the demonstration

385
00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:26.267
I want to fight my brother’s sister
He should also be from that group.

386
00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:29.200
Brother, don't worry too much

387
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200
What do you know? How dare you talk nonsense?

388
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.400
A guy who didn't even graduate from junior high school

389
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.667
Why are you suddenly talking about academic qualifications?

390
00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:39.900
Is it because I don’t want to study that I can’t graduate?

391
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.900
How many times have I told you
It’s because my family doesn’t have money to pay tuition fees

392
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.833
I gave the opportunity to study to my younger brothers and sisters

393
00:26:43.833 --> 00:26:46.700
Then why don't you take the entrance exam while you're in prison?

394
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.467
You don’t have to pay tuition for taking exams

395
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.000
There is no atmosphere for reading in prison

396
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.100
I need someone to study with me
It makes me excited to read it

397
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.867
It's full of thieves and fraudsters
There are also a bunch of pretty boys

398
00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:59.833
How can I continue reading, you brat?

399
00:26:59.833 --> 00:27:01.800
Really bad boy

400
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.867
Is it because there are classmates who study together?

401
00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:05.933
Did you just pass the entrance exam?

402
00:27:05.933 --> 00:27:07.400
What nonsense are you talking about?

403
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.667
Damn it, don't hit me

404
00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:12.367
Really

405
00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:13.867
Big brother is here...

406
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.267
You are here

407
00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:20.400
How are they going?

408
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.333
It seems that Yongpil has finally taken action.

409
00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:30.267
Yongbi?

410
00:27:30.267 --> 00:27:31.333
Later than I expected

411
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:33.733
When will they probably take action?

412
00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:35.733
Yongbi will handle it with you.
After the incident at Guro Industrial Zone

413
00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:37.733
So I went to see Mr. Park from the United Wine Dealers.

414
00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:41.733
It seems that Mr. Park is trying to frame you.
All transaction information is ready

415
00:27:41.733 --> 00:27:43.500
I think they should be there within a week

416
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.533
great

417
00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:46.367
Start protecting aggressive learning today

418
00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:48.267
Yong Pil may launch a surprise attack at any time

419
00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:49.267
Yes brother

420
00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:50.767
I know

421
00:27:59.033 --> 00:28:00.967
The guy who wants to treat me to delicious food tonight

422
00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:03.533
Why did you have to call me here at noon?

423
00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:05.300
What is this?

424
00:28:09.433 --> 00:28:13.133
Sorry, I'm so hungry

425
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.200
How about falling in love with me?

426
00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:20.367
what

427
00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:24.433
I asked you how the business deal went

428
00:28:27.267 --> 00:28:29.067
Hello Cui Zhexiong

429
00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:32.133
What do you want to say to me?

430
00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:34.000
do you want to be my boyfriend

431
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.533
Right

432
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.200
how do you know

433
00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:44.833
You can read minds

434
00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:52.867
Do you know what kind of morning makes me happiest?

435
00:28:54.433 --> 00:28:56.967
It’s the morning I wake up after dreaming about you

436
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.200
Although I will feel a little empty when I wake up

437
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.867
But I feel really good

438
00:29:08.467 --> 00:29:11.233
Sorry, I made you confused

439
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.333
It seems like you're having a hard time, too.

440
00:29:16.267 --> 00:29:19.467
I also had a very hard time

441
00:29:19.467 --> 00:29:20.933
See you like this now

442
00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:22.933
Reminds me that I was in this state at that time

443
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.633
The last time I met Douxue

444
00:29:26.633 --> 00:29:29.167
His state is also very similar to yours.

445
00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:32.000
But I just scolded him

446
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.333
You can't stand me

447
00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:41.067
I will only make you suffer more

448
00:29:41.767 --> 00:29:43.400
Let's just be good friends

449
00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:47.167
I'm leaving first

450
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.000
Is this the only reason?

451
00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:56.267
In addition to being unable to parry

452
00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:58.600
Is there no other reason that can convince me more?

453
00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:01.933
Could Brother Douxue be able to

454
00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:05.200
Can't I?

455
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.000
Let's make an appointment again some time

456
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.567
You must buy me a drink

457
00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:23.733
She hasn't eaten a bite

458
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:30.600
Here is the principal and interest

459
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.167
We put a little more

460
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.000
You don't have to be like this

461
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.200
Thanks to you, the movie is a hit

462
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.033
Eating everything and wiping it clean is not the way to be a human being

463
00:30:39.033 --> 00:30:40.767
I am the dignified Cha Jinyu

464
00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:43.433
I understand thank you

465
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:47.133
However

466
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:51.633
when do you plan to
Introduce me to the president of the Overseas Chinese Association in Japan

467
00:30:51.633 --> 00:30:55.100
I must say hello to him

468
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.200
The president happens to be returning to Korea soon.

469
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.667
I will convey it to you

470
00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:03.367
What?

471
00:31:03.367 --> 00:31:05.567
Aren’t you going to see Tetsuo today?

472
00:31:09.533 --> 00:31:11.100
Hey what's wrong with you

473
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.400
What happened?

474
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.467
nothing

475
00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:15.533
It's just that I'm too hopeless

476
00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:17.000
Too bad

477
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.567
who said that

478
00:31:18.567 --> 00:31:19.500
who is

479
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.333
I'm going to tear his mouth apart

480
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:22.900
Yoko

481
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.500
a person with a legitimate profession

482
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.033
and people without legitimate occupations

483
00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:30.767
If you want to choose one of the two

484
00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:32.200
who would you choose

485
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.367
Of course they are people with legitimate professions

486
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.400
right

487
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.200
But I keep thinking about that
A person without a legitimate occupation

488
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.033
That means you are not normal either

489
00:31:44.033 --> 00:31:45.433
You are crazy too

490
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.567
right

491
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.600
Have you met Tetsuo?

492
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.000
But...who is the person without a legitimate profession?

493
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.133
who is

494
00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:01.133
someone

495
00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:02.733
some poor guy

496
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.700
Hey, listen carefully

497
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.033
It is fate to be with someone who has a legitimate profession

498
00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:12.800
It's a bad fate to be with someone who doesn't have it

499
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.033
But

500
00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.467
People always misunderstand fate as fate

501
00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:20.467
Then regret it again

502
00:32:21.033 --> 00:32:23.667
Although I don’t know who that person is

503
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:25.733
But please give up

504
00:32:25.733 --> 00:32:27.267
Don't go to him

505
00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:34.567
How can you drink without music?

506
00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:49.367
"You are a fool"

507
00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:52.100
"Keeping him but speechless"

508
00:32:54.433 --> 00:33:00.067
"You are a fool"

509
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.500
"Keep him but can't say I love you"

510
00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:14.467
"He will leave"

511
00:33:15.033 --> 00:33:18.067
"Tell him quickly"

512
00:33:20.167 --> 00:33:25.700
"Every street that leaves no trace"

513
00:33:27.733 --> 00:33:33.033
"Only people who are speechless"

514
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.233
"What's the use of giving your heart?"

515
00:33:40.233 --> 00:33:42.233
I hope there will be an entrance exam every month

516
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:45.400
Do you want to be number one in the country?
Do you have a big meal like this every month?

517
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.100
No

518
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.200
Because I don’t have to see you through the bars

519
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:57.633
"What's the use of hating"

520
00:33:57.633 --> 00:34:03.733
"You will definitely regret it after you leave"

521
00:34:03.733 --> 00:34:07.367
"Say quickly"

522
00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:11.167
"Say quickly"

523
00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:12.467
"Say quickly"

524
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:15.400
It's because of you that I can persist until now

525
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.967
don't let go of my hand

526
00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:22.433
"Say quickly"

527
00:34:22.433 --> 00:34:26.167
"Say quickly"

528
00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:29.867
"Say quickly"

529
00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:34.833
"Say quickly"

530
00:34:36.733 --> 00:34:38.233
Who?

531
00:34:39.167 --> 00:34:40.867
wow

532
00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:42.600
The song is so nice

533
00:34:46.433 --> 00:34:47.867
Miss Wu

534
00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:50.500
who are you

535
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.267
Who sent you?

536
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.133
(Boss Che Jinyu)

537
00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:00.600
here

538
00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:04.233
it's me

539
00:35:04.233 --> 00:35:07.633
Auntie, something happened here

540
00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:11.533
Dingchen was kidnapped

541
00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:13.600
what

542
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.300
She was taken away by a group of hooligans

543
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.700
Got it, I'll be there right away. Just wait.

544
00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:22.867
Gao Standing Committee

545
00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:23.667
Go and drive quickly

546
00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:25.267
We're going to the office in Seoul

547
00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:26.200
what

548
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.733
what happened?

549
00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:29.400
Something happened in the office

550
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.933
Let’s have dinner together next time

551
00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:39.800
it's me

552
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.433
Something seems to have happened in Dingchen's office

553
00:35:42.467 --> 00:35:44.933
Oh my god

554
00:35:44.933 --> 00:35:47.200
What? What's going on?
aunt

555
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.167
Boss, let’s call the police first

556
00:35:54.533 --> 00:35:55.400
aunt

557
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.133
Dingchen has no enemies and no debts

558
00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:00.567
don't you know anything

559
00:36:00.567 --> 00:36:02.300
What's going on

560
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.000
You are so noisy

561
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.800
Stop talking first, stinky girl

562
00:36:22.067 --> 00:36:23.267
Boss Jin

563
00:36:23.267 --> 00:36:25.433
I was worried so I followed.

564
00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.300
What the hell is going on

565
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.400
I heard that a group of unknown guys broke in.

566
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.867
The person in charge of our branch was kidnapped

567
00:36:33.867 --> 00:36:35.733
Do you have any suspects?

568
00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:38.833
Someone will call

569
00:36:55.767 --> 00:36:57.100
Hello

570
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.500
car boss

571
00:37:00.067 --> 00:37:02.300
I am Lao Bian from Xingxingye

572
00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:06.700
I just got a call

573
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.367
I heard my boys got into trouble

574
00:37:14.267 --> 00:37:18.100
They said they were going to lose their jobs

575
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.133
Reluctant to let Miss Wu go

576
00:37:22.767 --> 00:37:25.733
So that's it

577
00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:28.633
In fact, I already guessed it was you

578
00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:30.500
I knew it was him

579
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.100
But…

580
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.867
Boss Bian, I thought you were an entrepreneur

581
00:37:34.867 --> 00:37:38.100
I didn’t expect you to be a gangster.

582
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.500
If you're a man, don't mince words.
Speak directly if you have anything to say

583
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.867
What do you want?

584
00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:49.267
It’s great that the boss of the car is so direct in his speech.

585
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.067
ok

586
00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:56.467
Take the theater I was originally responsible for

587
00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:58.167
Give it back to me

588
00:37:58.167 --> 00:37:59.267
Remove your people

589
00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:01.100
what

590
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.533
What nonsense are you talking about?

591
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.200
Really

592
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.367
Hey, catch her

593
00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:15.333
car boss

594
00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:17.533
I'm not kidding

595
00:38:18.067 --> 00:38:21.067
I, the younger brothers, have never read any books.

596
00:38:21.067 --> 00:38:23.367
Not polite

597
00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:25.467
I finally stopped them

598
00:38:25.467 --> 00:38:27.367
They said they would only give two days

599
00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:33.600
You don’t want to take the Jingjiang District Theater
Letter of termination comes

600
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.467
I may never see Miss Wu again

601
00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:48.333
That's a really good idea

602
00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:50.767
You helped me solve a problem

603
00:38:50.767 --> 00:38:52.800
Just do whatever you want

604
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.833
I do like Miss Wu very much

605
00:38:56.833 --> 00:39:00.967
But I'm also a little afraid of her

606
00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:04.800
To put it harshly, she is my right-hand man
But not my daughter

607
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.933
I will also worry that she will betray me in the future
So a little uneasy

608
00:39:11.533 --> 00:39:13.433
This is just right

609
00:39:13.433 --> 00:39:15.700
I mean it, Boss Bian

610
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.300
i won't tell anyone

611
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.633
Please help me get rid of her

612
00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:22.567
Throw her into the iron barrel

613
00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:25.200
Take it to the reservoir and throw it away

614
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.700
Thank you for your hard work

615
00:39:32.033 --> 00:39:34.200
Hello…

616
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.267
car boss

617
00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.667
Hello Che Jinyu

618
00:39:39.267 --> 00:39:41.833
This crazy woman

619
00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:49.133
you're dead

620
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.367
Don't stand in the way

621
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.267
Miss Wu

622
00:39:56.267 --> 00:39:57.933
Your boss…

623
00:39:57.933 --> 00:39:59.900
Want me to kill you

624
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.033
are you crazy

625
00:40:01.033 --> 00:40:02.667
what

626
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.233
you're dead

627
00:40:06.233 --> 00:40:07.700
Shit Boss

628
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.367
Shit…

629
00:40:09.367 --> 00:40:10.600
you woman

630
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.700
I'm going crazy

631
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.967
Hello

632
00:40:14.967 --> 00:40:17.267
Put here…

633
00:40:17.267 --> 00:40:18.600
tidy up

634
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.600
put her...

635
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.767
get rid of her

636
00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:23.533
Come on...get rid of her quickly

637
00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:25.467
you guy

638
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.300
Crazy woman, you are looking for death

639
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.100
aunt

640
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.000
You want to kill Dingchen?

641
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.367
Whether she can live or not is her life.

642
00:40:34.367 --> 00:40:38.267
There are still people who will not die so easily

643
00:40:38.267 --> 00:40:40.067
I'll call the police now

644
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.333
aunt

645
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.767
If we lose momentum now, everyone will die together.

646
00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:50.733
People who need help will come to their door.

647
00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:52.367
Wait a minute

648
00:40:56.667 --> 00:40:57.833
Dingchen was kidnapped

649
00:40:57.833 --> 00:40:59.367
what to do now

650
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:03.000
I don’t know when Yongbi will come to see you
You can't ask the younger brothers to look for them separately.

651
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.800
too dangerous

652
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.767
We don't know each other either
What kind of organization is it?

653
00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:08.233
Call all the boys immediately

654
00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:10.000
Find where Dingchen is

655
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.433
Douxue

656
00:41:11.433 --> 00:41:13.200
don't worry

657
00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:16.767
50 million for foreign wine and 30 million for beer.

658
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.067
A total of 80 million won was washed

659
00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:21.467
what is the method

660
00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:22.933
I charge normal drink prices

661
00:41:22.933 --> 00:41:25.100
Give him the rest in cash and help him launder money.

662
00:41:26.333 --> 00:41:29.500
But you want to teach him a lesson

663
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.133
Still want to kill him

664
00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:36.600
kill him

665
00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:40.333
To track Douxue’s whereabouts

666
00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:42.933
Call everyone to assemble

667
00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.467
Yes eldest brother

668
00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:47.300
(Xingxingye is on vacation)

669
00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:54.700
Boss Bian’s whereabouts cannot be found

670
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.100
Ji Su asked them to keep looking.

671
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.000
Xuanyu, please ask them to come back.

672
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.967
No need to do that

673
00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:00.233
Hey brat

674
00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:02.300
What if Yong Pil comes looking for you now?

675
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.700
Do you think he will let you go?

676
00:42:06.867 --> 00:42:08.900
Mom…

677
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.667
Mom…

678
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.833
What's wrong

679
00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:18.333
The urinal is full

680
00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:20.233
Wait

681
00:42:24.033 --> 00:42:26.400
what is this doing

682
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.067
This is not a prison

683
00:42:31.133 --> 00:42:32.533
Where's dad?

684
00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:33.400
Don't know

685
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.100
He went out to smoke after dinner

686
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.900
Give me the urinal

687
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.933
what are you doing

688
00:42:46.933 --> 00:42:48.167
Hey stinky girl

689
00:42:48.167 --> 00:42:49.767
Don't stop yet

690
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.533
Hello

691
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.867
Yes aunt

692
00:42:57.233 --> 00:42:58.733
what

693
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.767
Your sister ran away from your mother's house

694
00:43:05.033 --> 00:43:07.600
Why is everything going wrong today?

695
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.900
are you sure

696
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.433
Are there only four of them?

697
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.167
Yes, there are only four of them

698
00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:18.900
No... there are only three people

699
00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:22.000
Got it

700
00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:24.100
Tell everyone to copy the guy and get ready to go out

701
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.233
Call Mr. Park

702
00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:26.800
Yes eldest brother

703
00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:31.500
Brat, you're dead

704
00:43:33.067 --> 00:43:43.367
(Waterfall Nightclub)

705
00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:45.900
scared me

706
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.833
Didn't Zhenyu come to find you?

707
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:50.733
I haven't seen her since that day

708
00:43:51.867 --> 00:43:53.600
If she comes to you

709
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.300
Give her this money, saying it's car money

710
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.567
I'll help you get it to her

711
00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.700
But I'm not a night school person
Not from the union either.

712
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.433
Will she come to me?

713
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.300
If she is caught by the police again

714
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.300
No one can help her

715
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.167
Help me tell her to go back to her hometown in the south of the city quickly.

716
00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:08.867
Please, Ms. Yoshiko

717
00:44:28.767 --> 00:44:30.133
What's going on

718
00:44:34.133 --> 00:44:36.533
On…

719
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.467
Who is this

720
00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:56.667
Turns out it’s my brother Douxue

721
00:44:57.367 --> 00:44:59.867
I almost had a car accident. I'm still wondering who it was.

722
00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:01.067
Have you eaten?

723
00:45:01.067 --> 00:45:02.900
We're going to a dinner party. Do you want to come with us?

724
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.900
drive away

725
00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.267
If you are caught by the police, you will be ticketed.

726
00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:08.867
Issue a ticket

727
00:45:08.867 --> 00:45:10.833
If you are fired, you will be fired

728
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:12.567
As long as it allows you to...

729
00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:14.200
Get out of our gang

730
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.733
If brother knew

731
00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:17.667
you may suffer

732
00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.067
No

733
00:45:21.067 --> 00:45:23.367
He will find it interesting

734
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.167
You're doing this because I won't let you in the hotel
Is this how you eat soup and rice?

735
00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:28.100
sorry

736
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.667
But…

737
00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:33.133
If you want to eat soup and rice, go to the soup rice restaurant.
You little hooligan

738
00:45:35.033 --> 00:45:37.067
Brat

739
00:46:16.767 --> 00:46:18.167
Just now

740
00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:03.933
what are you doing

741
00:47:29.867 --> 00:47:34.900
"Where did it all go wrong?"

742
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.267
"I don't know"

743
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.567
"It's useless to talk too much anyway"

744
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:54.300
"It's all in the past"

745
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.667
"Cannot hide"

746
00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:06.733
"Missing you"

747
00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:10.467
"It broke out"

748
00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:17.633
"Can I come back to you again?"

749
00:48:17.633 --> 00:48:24.967
"Can't hide the uneasy look"

750
00:48:24.967 --> 00:48:32.233
"Those Bygone Days"

751
00:48:32.233 --> 00:48:35.433
"your name"

752
00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:38.767
"It's deeply etched in my heart"

753
00:48:38.767 --> 00:48:41.567
help him up

754
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.333
You say I'm a hooligan

755
00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:55.133
Really?

756
00:48:55.133 --> 00:48:57.933
You are so powerful but you defeated me today

757
00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:00.933
after you go to hell

758
00:49:00.933 --> 00:49:02.967
It's better not to meet the hooligans again

759
00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:17.833
What are you doing?

760
00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:43.700
Are you crazy?

761
00:49:46.533 --> 00:49:48.500
Hey, take him to the hospital quickly

762
00:49:50.867 --> 00:49:52.667
Come

763
00:49:59.067 --> 00:50:00.767
Come here you idiot

764
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.400
I came too late

765
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.867
Don’t you like excitement?

766
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.067
Douxue

767
00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:14.833
It would be the end if we were raided

768
00:50:14.833 --> 00:50:17.133
We should ask Xuan Yu's people to withdraw.

769
00:50:18.033 --> 00:50:19.833
Hello Li Douxue

770
00:50:20.067 --> 00:50:21.933
Brother

771
00:50:21.933 --> 00:50:23.633
Change your strategy

772
00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:28.300
I'll deal with Yong Pil

773
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.367
what

774
00:50:29.367 --> 00:50:30.633
you alone

775
00:50:31.567 --> 00:50:33.500
You want to die so much

776
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.967
I will take two people with me now

777
00:50:34.967 --> 00:50:37.400
Go to where Zhenyu lives

778
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.767
Yongbi should have sent someone to follow me.

779
00:50:41.567 --> 00:50:43.633
What better opportunity than this?

780
00:50:43.633 --> 00:50:45.867
Anyway, I don’t know when I will be raided.

781
00:50:45.867 --> 00:50:47.467
Just seduce him first

782
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.767
I'm going to find Brother Guangzhuo

783
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.133
That's right

784
00:50:52.133 --> 00:50:54.233
This method is much better than a head-on battle

785
00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:55.300
This way our people won't get hurt

786
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.000
It also stimulated Brother Guang Zhuo's compassion.

787
00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:00.800
What if something happens to you?

788
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.767
Of course it's your fault if you come too late

789
00:51:02.767 --> 00:51:04.233
madman

790
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:06.433
Does it have to go to this point?

791
00:51:06.433 --> 00:51:08.767
How can it be exciting enough if you don’t work hard?

792
00:51:10.433 --> 00:51:12.700
Is there any news about the person who went to Dingchen?

793
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.600
Not at all

794
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.500
Who is she to you?

795
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.600
Why do you do so much for her

796
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.833
Invest in film company shares

797
00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:21.433
and ownership of the Nanhai Theater

798
00:51:21.433 --> 00:51:25.867
You work so hard just to find her
Isn't it?

799
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.533
I don't know either

800
00:51:28.533 --> 00:51:29.933
Maybe it’s because I feel empty

801
00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:31.933
What's going on?

802
00:51:31.933 --> 00:51:34.367
I feel empty just like Yong Pil
Go to eat soup rice

803
00:51:34.367 --> 00:51:40.067
Really? It turns out he feels empty too

804
00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:45.833
Really

805
00:51:58.467 --> 00:51:59.800
is this true

806
00:52:00.267 --> 00:52:02.733
How dare I lie to brother

807
00:52:02.733 --> 00:52:04.333
I'm not saying this out of selfishness

808
00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:05.833
I swear, bro

809
00:52:08.133 --> 00:52:11.467
You just because he embezzled some public funds
Do you just want to kill him?

810
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:13.100
Not like that

811
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.433
I heard that he wanted to expand his power
kill you

812
00:52:17.433 --> 00:52:20.733
He uses your money to please his younger brothers.

813
00:52:20.733 --> 00:52:23.400
You also know

814
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.967
Recently, everyone listens to him more

815
00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:30.733
And I just wanted to hurt his leg

816
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.900
Douxue this guy

817
00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:42.967
Duplicitous guy

818
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.833
Big brother

819
00:52:55.967 --> 00:52:57.433
(money cashier book)

820
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.833
I have never heard of Guan Yu and Zhang Fei

821
00:53:01.833 --> 00:53:06.100
Will cheat Liu Bei's money
And stabbed him in the back

822
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.567
Is this considered a sworn friendship in Taoyuan?

823
00:53:08.567 --> 00:53:12.900
I've never heard of Liu Bei doubting his younger brother.

824
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.667
This account book is fake

825
00:53:16.667 --> 00:53:17.933
I can bet my life

826
00:53:17.933 --> 00:53:20.933
Hey, you guys also bet together

827
00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:23.767
Brat, you're looking for death

828
00:53:24.533 --> 00:53:26.233
I have witnesses

829
00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:28.600
Hello, Executive Park

830
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.767
Did you say you laundered the money for me?

831
00:53:30.767 --> 00:53:33.600
Brother, it’s all over

832
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.300
Just admit it

833
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.700
Brother

834
00:53:42.633 --> 00:53:44.233
come in

835
00:53:50.433 --> 00:53:53.167
long time no see

836
00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:54.033
What?

837
00:53:54.033 --> 00:53:55.400
Have they worked with you?

838
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.800
They are the Republic of Korea

839
00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.667
The most powerful forger

840
00:53:59.667 --> 00:54:00.967
Hello Yongbi

841
00:54:00.967 --> 00:54:02.633
You know them too, right?

842
00:54:03.533 --> 00:54:06.533
What do you want us to help look at?

843
00:54:06.533 --> 00:54:09.067
This is the alcohol trading account book for the past two years

844
00:54:09.067 --> 00:54:12.900
They said this would prove me
Misappropriated 80 million public funds

845
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.367
You guys check it out

846
00:54:14.367 --> 00:54:17.400
Eighty million?

847
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.367
You stole money

848
00:54:20.067 --> 00:54:21.367
Don't steal money

849
00:54:21.367 --> 00:54:23.933
You have to teach him a lesson before he can cheer up.

850
00:54:23.933 --> 00:54:26.800
But if someone wants to frame him

851
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.867
Then you have to give that person a good beating.

852
00:54:28.867 --> 00:54:30.000
Replace eyes, nose and mouth with eyes

853
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.567
Trade hands with teeth

854
00:54:31.567 --> 00:54:35.400
The rules in this circle
It's quite strict to begin with

855
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.800
Hey, how dare you come here?

856
00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.133
Get out of here

857
00:54:40.133 --> 00:54:42.033
I'm so scared

858
00:54:42.033 --> 00:54:43.400
How is it

859
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.567
are we going out

860
00:54:44.567 --> 00:54:47.133
No, you decide

861
00:54:48.433 --> 00:54:51.467
Brother, this is our family’s problem

862
00:54:51.467 --> 00:54:53.300
They are my family too

863
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.133
You guys keep talking

864
00:54:54.133 --> 00:54:56.733
Feng Hao, look carefully

865
00:54:56.733 --> 00:54:57.500
good

866
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.912
Check to see

867
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.012
look at this

868
00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:18.067
too rough

869
00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:23.167
Paper is different from old to new
The color is much different

870
00:55:23.167 --> 00:55:25.800
And these numbers were scratched with a knife

871
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.633
I'm not an amateur. How do I do this?

872
00:55:28.633 --> 00:55:29.933
So this kind of work

873
00:55:29.933 --> 00:55:33.767
Should be left to professionals like me

874
00:55:33.767 --> 00:55:36.033
What are you talking about? Impossible

875
00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:40.333
Hey, come here and talk more carefully

876
00:55:46.467 --> 00:55:48.467
I committed a capital crime, President

877
00:55:48.467 --> 00:55:51.467
It was Brother Yongbi who ordered me...

878
00:55:51.467 --> 00:55:53.433
Don't talk nonsense

879
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:54.867
Brother, wait a minute

880
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.233
a leg

881
00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:04.200
Do you still want to cripple a person’s leg?

882
00:56:05.333 --> 00:56:08.433
That's why you...

883
00:56:08.433 --> 00:56:10.400
Being called a hooligan

884
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.233
Useless trash

885
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.167
From now on you...

886
00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:20.367
Dare to appear in front of me again

887
00:56:20.367 --> 00:56:22.067
He's dead

888
00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:23.400
Did you hear that?

889
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.200
take him out

890
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:55.600
So

891
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.800
Don't worry if anyone is looking for you

892
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.767
This is what you have to do in business

893
00:57:00.767 --> 00:57:03.067
You woman talk too much

894
00:57:03.067 --> 00:57:04.400
I'm going to die

895
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.933
Really

896
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.500
Brother, the time is coming

897
00:57:12.433 --> 00:57:14.500
She thinks I can't do it

898
00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.500
Then come and give it a try

899
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.733
Who do you think I am?

900
00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:25.067
Thank you, brothers

901
00:57:25.067 --> 00:57:26.400
And eldest sister

902
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.300
what are you talking about

903
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.567
you are our boss

904
00:57:30.567 --> 00:57:32.267
Something happened to the boss

905
00:57:32.267 --> 00:57:34.833
How can we survive?

906
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:40.267
Yeah, but you almost got into trouble

907
00:57:40.267 --> 00:57:41.667
Yes

908
00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:45.567
That account book is guaranteed to be genuine

909
00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:49.433
They probably found someone better than me.

910
00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:50.633
I've read that account book

911
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:54.467
My whole back is sweating

912
00:57:55.267 --> 00:57:58.967
Fortunately, Executive Park admitted that he felt guilty.

913
00:57:58.967 --> 00:58:01.000
Otherwise you might almost get into trouble

914
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.533
I was so worried that my heart almost stopped.

915
00:58:03.533 --> 00:58:04.833
Thought I would die

916
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:07.467
We act with you because we believe you

917
00:58:07.467 --> 00:58:08.900
Otherwise…

918
00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.433
We almost ended up together

919
00:58:11.433 --> 00:58:13.267
Dou Xue

920
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.267
We all have only one life

921
00:58:17.267 --> 00:58:19.200
Don't take too many risks

922
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.167
Didn't you also say

923
00:58:21.167 --> 00:58:24.100
Don't want to see anything happen to us

924
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.367
sorry

925
00:58:25.367 --> 00:58:27.000
I'm too impatient

926
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.433
Okay, it's okay

927
00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:32.267
Then let's not disturb the boss.

928
00:58:32.267 --> 00:58:34.700
let's go back

929
00:58:37.167 --> 00:58:38.933
we are a family

930
00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:41.733
family

931
00:58:41.733 --> 00:58:42.733
Let's go

932
00:58:42.733 --> 00:58:43.500
Be careful

933
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.267
good
we will always be a family

934
00:58:47.533 --> 00:58:48.967
Sorry, brother

935
00:58:48.967 --> 00:58:50.267
I have sent all my brothers

936
00:58:50.267 --> 00:58:53.267
I searched all the organizations in Seoul.

937
00:58:53.267 --> 00:58:54.567
But I can't find out

938
00:58:54.567 --> 00:58:56.300
It seems they are from other counties and cities.

939
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.500
It's not a nationwide case

940
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.400
Now our strength alone is not enough

941
00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.533
I asked a detective I know to check it out.

942
00:59:01.533 --> 00:59:04.200
That boss Bian has no criminal record

943
00:59:07.333 --> 00:59:10.067
This kind of person absconded

944
00:59:10.067 --> 00:59:11.900
Time is not on our side, right?

945
00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.533
If he decides to hide

946
00:59:13.533 --> 00:59:15.133
Even the police and prosecutors

947
00:59:15.133 --> 00:59:16.900
It's impossible to find him right away

948
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.433
right

949
00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:20.233
But…

950
00:59:20.233 --> 00:59:22.333
I watch movies

951
00:59:22.333 --> 00:59:25.367
A place like the CIA in the United States

952
00:59:25.367 --> 00:59:30.267
You can find it in just a few dozen minutes

953
00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:32.267
That's a movie

954
00:59:32.267 --> 00:59:34.833
That's a made-up story

955
00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:36.000
made up story

956
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.667
Hello Xuanyu
Yes

957
00:59:37.667 --> 00:59:38.767
Go and drive

958
00:59:38.767 --> 00:59:39.667
where are you going

959
00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:41.267
Since it is beyond our capabilities

960
00:59:41.267 --> 00:59:43.033
Just go find someone for help.

961
00:59:43.033 --> 00:59:46.133
Why are you telling me now?

962
00:59:46.133 --> 00:59:47.700
no time

963
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.867
Just tell me if I can find it

964
00:59:49.867 --> 00:59:54.500
Brother, I'm not a prosecutor yet

965
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.267
You should go to the police...

966
00:59:56.267 --> 00:59:58.500
You should go to the police first

967
00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.833
Must find her

968
00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:01.433
no time

969
01:00:06.967 --> 01:00:08.933
But…

970
01:00:08.933 --> 01:00:10.700
Aren’t you no longer nostalgic for Dingchen?

971
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.600
Are you still paying attention to her latest news?

972
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.600
That's because...

973
01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.367
I have a business relationship with her boss

974
01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:21.133
I knew that by accident

975
01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:25.967
If you are willing to help

976
01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:27.967
There should be a way

977
01:00:30.633 --> 01:00:32.267
what does it mean

978
01:00:32.267 --> 01:00:36.500
The Security and Enterprise Department wanted to use you as a mole before.

979
01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:42.600
How could you say such things to me?

980
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.867
you don't know those guys
Did it cause any trauma to me?

981
01:00:45.867 --> 01:00:48.667
you owe me a debt

982
01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.900
I will treat you as half of what you paid me back

983
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.233
you must help

984
01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:56.100
This is the only way now

985
01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:28.100
(Oasis)

986
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.333
Is Choi Cheol-woong Choi Young-sik’s biological flesh and blood?

987
01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:33.667
what does this mean

988
01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:34.967
I want to go out independently

989
01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:38.300
I knew this girl would betray me

990
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.933
Stop making such jokes

991
01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:41.733
No, I want to keep driving

992
01:01:41.733 --> 01:01:43.733
I want to continue to compete with you

993
01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.967
Make Dingchen my woman

994
01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:47.533
He is a murderer...

995
01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:50.200
Hey, I'm not dating a murderer.

996
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.267
Do you think I'm pitiful?

997
01:01:52.267 --> 01:01:52.867
Hello…

998
01:01:52.867 --> 01:01:56.000
Leave everything behind and come to me

999
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.267
I will stay with you
