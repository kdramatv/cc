00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.533
(This drama is related to specific characters, institutions, and groups
It has nothing to do with the case and is purely fictitious (I hereby inform you)

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.333
(Episode 3)

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.133
aunt uncle

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700
You must abide by your agreement with me

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.700
Got it...don't worry

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.133
By the way, our office has moved.

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.533
Jeongjin, if you come to Seoul, please stop by.

8
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.200
I will treat you to the Chinese food you like

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.733
I really can't stand you

10
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.466
Husband, don’t you think we have been
Isn't it too smooth sailing?

11
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.000
This scares me so much

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.633
Will we really become rich?

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.833
What are you afraid of?

14
00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.266
The fortune teller in Miali said that

15
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.800
About this time
There will be huge changes in our lives

(Representative of Shinil Industries, Zheng Guoyong)

17
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.200
(Representative of Shinil Industries, Zheng Guoyong)

18
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.300
Hello, Boss Wu

19
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.766
Ryoko, give me a drink

20
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.366
It seems you and your aunt had a big fight again.

21
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.400
Do you want me to introduce you to a wealthy widower?

22
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.133
So that you can keep the theater

23
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.133
Are there no rich young men?

24
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.333
Why would a young guy fall in love with you?

25
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.500
He must have taken a fancy to me.

26
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.233
I really can't stand you

27
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:08.566
By the way, you said it before
Do you have an aunt who runs a theater in Gwangju?

28
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.000
Yeah, she's my mom's cousin

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.266
what's her name

30
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.366
Aunt Jinyu Che Jinyu

31
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:18.466
She is the only one in Korea
The woman who can make a movie a hit

32
00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.300
Even my grandpa can't compare to her

33
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.633
What's going on with this girl?

34
00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:23.166
Who is this aunt?

35
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.133
If you don't want to get hurt, just get out of the way first

36
00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.700
(Boss Che Jinyu)

37
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.200
It turns out you are Nanhai Theater
Boss Wu’s daughter

38
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.000
But how do you know Aunt Jinyu?

39
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:41.466
General, he... is wrong

40
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:47.433
The deputy chief is worried about you when you move
Is there any inconvenience?

41
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:50.066
That's it

42
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.666
But has he become the second-in-command?

43
00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.600
All I know is that he is going to be discharged from the army.

44
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.633
I didn't expect to arrive at another unit so soon.

45
00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.666
Yes, he went to Nanshan to serve

46
00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:02.866
If Nanshan...

47
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.966
Then he has really risen a lot.

48
00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:08.800
Your residence in Seoul has been cleaned

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.200
If you need anything else, tell me

50
00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.033
No thank you

51
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.933
What are you worried about?

52
00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.100
nothing

53
00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:29.000
I contacted my son in Seoul

54
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.566
But I don’t know if he will come today

55
00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:34.666
I know my mom is moving to Seoul
He should come and take a look

56
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:38.266
Maybe

57
00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:52.933
How are you satisfied?

58
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.600
I'm very satisfied

59
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.033
Thanks to you, I can sell it below the market price
Price to live in this nice house

60
00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.300
thank you very much

61
00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.200
Isn't Tetsuo here yet?

62
00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:07.833
He said he would stay in the small suite first

63
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.866
It's too far from his school

64
00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:15.466
I also want to ask him to greet you formally.

65
00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:16.866
I should see him soon

66
00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:21.266
Having said that
You should also be looking for something to do.

67
00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.800
Otherwise, your diploma from a prestigious school will be in vain.

68
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.433
Alas, how long ago was that?

69
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.733
I just have something to ask you

70
00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:30.833
Are you interested?

71
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.100
Hey, get up quickly

72
00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.200
Get up soon

73
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.200
(God is also crazy)

74
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.466
What are you doing?

75
00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:54.600
Sleeping in front of such a sacred theater early in the morning

76
00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:58.266
You came here by night train, right?

77
00:04:58.266 --> 00:04:59.833
You have the final payment ready so quickly

78
00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:04.133
It's not like that...

79
00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:08.100
Boss Gao
Do you want to have a drink with me... No

80
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.100
It’s only right to extend the payment

81
00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:16.733
This cognac…
I bought it with great difficulty

82
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.833
Are there any pubs around here that are open in the morning?

83
00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:24.966
No need to run so far

84
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:46.700
Do you want me to buy the Nanhai Theater?

85
00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.933
Yes

86
00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:51.100
Our debt to the bank
There are 70 million won

87
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.033
There are also some other debts

88
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.466
You take over these debts
And buy the Nanhai Theater

89
00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.866
As long as I help pay off the debt

90
00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.033
It doesn't matter if the theater is sold at a low price
Is that what you mean?

91
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.100
Yes

92
00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:05.366
What's the reason?

93
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.833
Although I missed my appointment earlier

94
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.533
But you chose to believe me

95
00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:17.300
Furthermore, if in the future
I intend to buy back the Nanhai Theater

96
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.700
I think you'd be willing to sell it to me

97
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:28.433
You little girl
How dare you say such ungrateful things?

98
00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:32.033
I don't do loss-making business

99
00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.666
In the movie "The Godfather"

100
00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:46.166
Vito Corleone once said this line

101
00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:50.466
"I'll offer you
An offer you can't refuse"

102
00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:53.033
In fact, the theater is just an accessory product

103
00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:55.200
What I really want to sell is myself

104
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.633
I want to sell myself to you

105
00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:06.233
It's ridiculous

106
00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.666
Who are you?

107
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:12.766
I know your goals are not limited to
Working as a film distributor in Jeolla Province

108
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.900
Do you want to be all Korean
The overlord of film distributors

109
00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:18.300
please let me help you

110
00:07:23.533 --> 00:07:25.366
girl

111
00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:29.466
Have you watched a lot of movies?

112
00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:39.866
The way you proposed the proposal was dramatic.

113
00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:43.566
But I want to answer you in a very realistic way

114
00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:51.066
Get out of here

115
00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:52.933
thank you for the nice wine

116
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.466
That…

117
00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:06.566
Boss Gao…

118
00:08:10.466 --> 00:08:13.666
I even rejected your proposal

119
00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:15.233
do you have anything else to say

120
00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:19.566
I was wrong

121
00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.133
where did you go wrong

122
00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:24.466
I'm too arrogant

123
00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:26.133
Could you please state the conditions?

124
00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:27.366
No matter what I will agree to

125
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.133
Really?

126
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:35.800
Then I will mention one
It's an offer you might refuse.

127
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.266
But you have to kneel down to listen

128
00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:52.719
Are you kneeling here?

129
00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:55.173
You can choose to refuse

130
00:09:12.466 --> 00:09:13.733
You say it

131
00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:19.233
First, after I help you pay off the theater debt
The theater is mine

132
00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:21.400
I'll wait until the time is right before I take over

133
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:25.800
Second, you have to work under me.

134
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.200
Be my maid

135
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.066
You can choose to refuse

136
00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:53.966
I do

137
00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:11.733
"Look at me..."

138
00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:14.600
(Struggle can stop dictatorship)
"Like admiring flowers in the cold winter months"

139
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.366
(Demand for the abolition of the Security Command)
"Look at me"

140
00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:29.766
Mom

141
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.300
come out with me

142
00:10:39.903 --> 00:10:42.470
I heard that you haven't been back to your residence for several days.

143
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.970
Your mother moved to Seoul and you didn’t come to see her

144
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.937
sorry

145
00:10:49.103 --> 00:10:51.037
It's time for you to stop

146
00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:53.403
You have already been arrested once and sent to the army.

147
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.070
Stop going to demonstrations and prepare for the exam seriously

148
00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:03.337
Are you saying the same thing as Brother Douxue?

149
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.037
Have you met Douxue?

150
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:06.570
Yes

151
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.403
How is he doing?

152
00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:12.370
Don't know

153
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.470
I just think he seems to have changed a lot

154
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.370
Don’t meet Douxue again in the future

155
00:11:18.737 --> 00:11:20.603
Nothing good will happen if you get involved with him

156
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.470
He and I...have been involved for a long time, right?

157
00:11:28.203 --> 00:11:30.403
And it’s still an inseparable relationship

158
00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:31.670
Tetsuo

159
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.270
You go back

160
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.003
I will find you again later

161
00:11:42.103 --> 00:11:43.803
Stop saying stupid things like that

162
00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.570
You have nothing to do with Douxue.

163
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.703
He's an ex-con who committed murder.

164
00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:50.603
You are a college student with a bright future, you know?

165
00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:52.837
why are you doing this

166
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.970
Mom

167
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.270
The truth of the matter is known to heaven and earth

168
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.737
And you know and I know

169
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.503
Do you want to see your mother not survive?

170
00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:13.848
Tetsuo

171
00:12:13.849 --> 00:12:18.515
Who do you think mom is alive for?

172
00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:29.803
I said how can you keep acting useless here?

173
00:12:29.803 --> 00:12:33.337
How can it be so easy to find fat sheep?

174
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:34.670
What matters is timing

175
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.537
If you continue to drag it out, you have to stop.

176
00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:38.503
Just wait a moment

177
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.137
This is the last step

178
00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:46.337
So you should have
Find the fat sheep who want to step through this door.

179
00:12:47.703 --> 00:12:50.237
I think you were let go

180
00:12:52.237 --> 00:12:53.603
Big brother

181
00:12:54.337 --> 00:12:55.503
this is for you

182
00:12:57.803 --> 00:12:59.103
who is this person

183
00:13:01.037 --> 00:13:02.870
He is a gangster, full of bad people

184
00:13:03.937 --> 00:13:05.903
No matter if he is a gangster or an angel

185
00:13:05.903 --> 00:13:07.170
The point is, does he have money?

186
00:13:07.437 --> 00:13:09.537
very rich

187
00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:14.603
Looking for a greedy guy
Only then will I spit out the money.

188
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.203
(Representative Zheng Guoyong)

189
00:13:18.203 --> 00:13:19.903
(Chengjin Construction)

190
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.203
(House ownership certificate)

191
00:13:30.203 --> 00:13:35.037
The house is nice, but the price is a bit expensive

192
00:13:35.037 --> 00:13:36.670
I plan to pay it all in one lump sum

193
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.970
Think it’s cheaper for me

194
00:13:43.203 --> 00:13:44.703
How expensive is this?

195
00:13:44.703 --> 00:13:45.837
I tell you

196
00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:48.570
I'm going to the United States soon

197
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.170
That’s why it’s sold at a discounted price of less than half the price.

198
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.837
You actually want me to make it cheaper?

199
00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:55.703
Is there any mistake?

200
00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:59.370
It's so speechless. Oh my God.

201
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.870
Boss, please "Kansa" off this transaction.

202
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.437
"Kansas"?…
lady

203
00:14:04.437 --> 00:14:05.770
please wait a moment

204
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.637
Give them some time to think about it

205
00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:10.103
Just one moment...

206
00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:12.137
Really

207
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.670
What does "Kansa" mean...

208
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.070
I don't know either

209
00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:20.703
ok…

210
00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:24.337
Okay, I understand what you mean

211
00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:25.837
Just sign the contract

212
00:14:25.837 --> 00:14:27.937
Alas, madam

213
00:14:27.937 --> 00:14:30.170
That's a wise decision

214
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.703
Just wait to become a rich man

215
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.703
But…

216
00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:42.570
After I took out the loan, I was still a little short of cash.

217
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:44.737
(Nanhai Theater Ownership Certificate)
part of the amount

218
00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:47.304
Can I use real estate to pay for it?

219
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:50.437
The assessed value of this building
Up to 120 million won

220
00:14:50.437 --> 00:14:53.071
Excluding bank loans
You can also get 50 million won

221
00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:55.937
I'll give you 30 million won

222
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.104
That's right

223
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:59.804
what is this

224
00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:03.471
It’s Nanhai Theater in Lishui

225
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.771
(Nanhai Theater Ownership Certificate)
Business is very good

226
00:15:06.037 --> 00:15:07.804
It is the number one theater in Lishui

227
00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:10.371
Why don't you believe it?

228
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:12.704
Go ask the locals in Lishui

229
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:17.404
We offer this price
You got a bargain

230
00:15:17.404 --> 00:15:19.571
It’s just like giving it to you for free

231
00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:25.571
We generally do not accept payment in real estate

232
00:15:28.304 --> 00:15:29.704
But since they are eager to buy this house

233
00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:31.171
Just do it, ma'am.

234
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:34.537
I will complete the relevant procedures as soon as possible

235
00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:40.604
Boss, if there is a problem, you are responsible

236
00:15:41.237 --> 00:15:43.204
Of course

237
00:15:44.737 --> 00:15:45.871
Come and sign a contract

238
00:15:45.871 --> 00:15:47.371
OK

239
00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:51.437
Let me calculate the money

240
00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:54.237
Alas, why do we need to calculate it?

241
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:02.271
This is for you

242
00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:05.504
And this

243
00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:06.904
Because the bag is too small

244
00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:07.904
The bag is too small to fit...

245
00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:10.071
ok…

246
00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:17.537
Come on, this is it.

247
00:16:17.537 --> 00:16:19.071
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of money.

248
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.171
I haven't seen that much money in a long time

249
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:28.271
(Boss Gao Fenghao)

250
00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:32.137
(The darkest corner
The brightest light will appear)

251
00:16:32.137 --> 00:16:34.537
How to deal with this

252
00:16:34.537 --> 00:16:37.471
Although I collected it, I collected it
But I always feel a little suspicious

253
00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:38.704
That woman must be lying

254
00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:42.171
this theater
I don’t think it’s worth 20 to 30 million at all.

255
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:44.204
Brother, this kind of thing is very tricky

256
00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:45.504
If you want to get rid of it, it will take time to process it.

257
00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.537
If your identity is accidentally exposed...

258
00:16:46.537 --> 00:16:48.104
Leave it to me

259
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.071
good

260
00:16:54.071 --> 00:16:55.904
Just think of it as a referral fee for fat sheep.

261
00:16:56.737 --> 00:16:58.337
This is a good idea

262
00:16:58.337 --> 00:17:00.904
Trainees usually do not receive dividends for one year

263
00:17:00.904 --> 00:17:02.904
But I made a lot of money this time
Let's show our kindness

264
00:17:08.304 --> 00:17:12.737
Come and take it

265
00:17:12.737 --> 00:17:13.704
Are you satisfied with this?

266
00:17:13.704 --> 00:17:15.071
I'd be very grateful if you can take it.

267
00:17:15.071 --> 00:17:18.671
Okay, then let's go our separate ways.

268
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:21.271
I'll call you again if I have anything later.

269

Everyone, take care of yourself

(Owner: Wu Dingchen)
Trainee, take care of yourself too.

271
00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:26.504
Let's go

272
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:31.137
Leave from there

273
00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:33.371
Where should I spend this money?

274
00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:35.204
You guys want to exclude me

275
00:17:35.204 --> 00:17:36.471
Let’s go quickly…

276
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:38.537
Oh my god

277
00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:41.771
We're going in the wrong direction

278
00:17:43.404 --> 00:17:44.371

You...what's the matter with you coming here?

282
00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:54.871
The news has spread

283
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:58.804
I heard you made a fortune from the ocean.

284
00:17:59.137 --> 00:18:02.737
Who is talking nonsense?

285
00:18:07.037 --> 00:18:08.004
eldest sister

286
00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.271
Sister, you were in the hotel yesterday
Said something good was going to happen

287
00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:13.304
You said you want a piece of my pie, right?

288
00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:16.071
Hey, isn't it because you keep shouting about poverty...

289
00:18:16.071 --> 00:18:17.071
Really

290
00:18:18.604 --> 00:18:22.071
You big mouth
He actually told that kind of newspaper guy

291
00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:25.571
Hello…

292
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.771
No…

293
00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:42.937
Okay, let's divide the money.

294
00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:45.271
How about seventy-three points?

295
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:47.504
Seven of us, three of you

296
00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:48.137
How is it

297
00:18:48.137 --> 00:18:50.071
What a joke

298
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:53.671
Otherwise, it’s fifty-fifty...

299
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:54.837
That's ok

300
00:18:57.204 --> 00:18:59.504
Okay, let's be happy with this small amount of money.

301
00:18:59.504 --> 00:19:01.171
Seventy-three points

302
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:04.304
Let's get three scores

303
00:19:04.304 --> 00:19:05.104
Big brother

304
00:19:05.104 --> 00:19:10.171
I'll give you this little money to have a barbecue and soju.

305
00:19:10.737 --> 00:19:11.937
Get out of here after you finish eating

306
00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:13.704
Really…

307
00:19:16.904 --> 00:19:18.237
There's another guy

308
00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:20.571
Boy, come here

309
00:19:21.237 --> 00:19:22.671
did you call me

310
00:19:29.304 --> 00:19:31.571
Brat, you are also with them, right?

311
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:33.104
Not now

312
00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:35.271
We've gone our separate ways, haven't we?

313
00:19:36.504 --> 00:19:38.171
Hand over your share too

314
00:19:39.004 --> 00:19:40.404
what does it mean

315
00:19:41.037 --> 00:19:42.604
It’s really hard to communicate

316
00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:50.737
This guy is a pauper

317
00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:53.237
Is that all you have?

318
00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:55.371
Brother, aren’t you a family?

319
00:19:55.371 --> 00:19:58.971
We are not a family

320
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:02.371
He is just a handyman...

321
00:20:04.376 --> 00:20:06.037
See you next time Luo

322
00:20:06.504 --> 00:20:07.904
wait a moment

323
00:20:07.904 --> 00:20:09.171
You are looking for death

324
00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:11.471
Forget the money, but the ownership certificate must be returned to me

325
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:13.037
Because the owner is someone else

326
00:20:14.904 --> 00:20:16.504
Little ghost head

327
00:20:16.504 --> 00:20:18.804
The master you are talking about

328
00:20:19.637 --> 00:20:22.971
It's me, brat...

329
00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:27.671
I told you that there is another master

330
00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:29.471
I'll go first

331
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.771
How can you go first by yourself?

332
00:21:30.771 --> 00:21:31.637
wait for us

333
00:21:31.637 --> 00:21:33.937
Hey... pick up the banknotes

334
00:21:37.404 --> 00:21:44.337
you guys
Eat several times more than others

335
00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:47.837
In the end, they all lost to one boy?

336
00:21:52.537 --> 00:21:54.071
Get down here

337
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:56.537
Get down

338
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:06.037
OK

339
00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:08.304
Brother, this is not okay

340
00:22:08.304 --> 00:22:10.404
I want to establish military discipline for these guys.

341
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:14.171
(President Lian Guangzhuo)

342
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:15.671
Get down

343
00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:19.471
Guys who grew up in and out of jail

344
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.671
No one has ever been a soldier

345
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:23.704
What kind of military discipline do you want to establish?

346
00:22:23.704 --> 00:22:25.237
Get up

347
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:28.471
(Integrity, loyalty, trust)

348
00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:30.337
You all get out

349
00:22:35.337 --> 00:22:36.604
Was it you who ordered it?

350
00:22:37.837 --> 00:22:39.271
what

351
00:22:39.937 --> 00:22:43.871
Yes, I heard that Gao Fenghao made a fortune...

352
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:46.271
Brother, you are in another county or city
So I don’t have time to report to you

353
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:49.071
Kill first and play later?

354
00:22:49.071 --> 00:22:53.304
That's right, as the squad leader
You should have this kind of quick judgment ability

355
00:22:53.304 --> 00:22:55.071
well done

356
00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:56.904
Thanks for the compliment, brother

357
00:22:57.971 --> 00:22:59.637
But the results are not very good

358
00:23:00.104 --> 00:23:01.337
Brother, I'm sorry

359
00:23:01.337 --> 00:23:03.071
It doesn't matter

360
00:23:03.404 --> 00:23:05.604
Choose it
Depends on which guy you want to be repaired by

361
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:07.004
what

362
00:23:07.204 --> 00:23:08.537
Hurry up and pick one

363
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:10.404
Brother, I'm sorry

364
00:23:10.404 --> 00:23:12.404
This will never happen again next time

365
00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:14.237
You brat

366
00:23:14.237 --> 00:23:16.871
Come here, lean your head over

367
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:21.204
Yeah, the results were pretty bad.

368
00:23:23.637 --> 00:23:26.237
And is Gao Fenghao your friend?

369
00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:27.337
He is senior than me

370
00:23:27.337 --> 00:23:29.137
You rude guy

371
00:23:29.137 --> 00:23:30.437
Stinky guy

372
00:23:30.437 --> 00:23:34.571
Bring Feng Hao to me within three days

373
00:23:35.257 --> 00:23:38.537
Beat the boys to pieces
Bring that guy too

374
00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:39.871
Do you know?

375
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:41.824
Yes brother

376
00:23:41.825 --> 00:23:43.325
Get out, brat

377
00:23:45.571 --> 00:23:47.271
God, I'm exhausted.

378
00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:51.504
Is it still far away?

379
00:23:52.237 --> 00:23:53.637
Almost there

380
00:23:54.137 --> 00:23:57.171
Why are there endless stairs again?

381
00:23:58.447 --> 00:23:59.447
Ouch, so exhausted

382
00:23:59.448 --> 00:24:02.514
Why aren't you looking for a house?
A place with flatter terrain

383
00:24:02.514 --> 00:24:05.048
If you don't have money, just talk to me.

384
00:24:05.048 --> 00:24:07.181
Maybe I can lend it to you...

385
00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:08.681
scared me

386
00:24:11.681 --> 00:24:14.148
You don’t treat me as family
How can I have the nerve to ask for a loan?

387
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:17.481
do you have rice

388
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:18.814
I usually eat instant noodles

389
00:24:18.814 --> 00:24:22.648
Go to church on weekends
Volunteer groups prepare meals

390
00:24:22.648 --> 00:24:24.314
Otherwise, go to the construction site to work for a living.

391
00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:27.948
I said I should buy rice.

392
00:24:27.948 --> 00:24:30.081
That’s it, brother

393
00:24:31.214 --> 00:24:37.214
Having said that
Guangzhuo must be mad now.

394
00:24:39.214 --> 00:24:40.881
Yes

395
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:44.848
If that guy gets angry,
Not afraid of anything

396
00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:48.581
Especially that guy No. 2...

397
00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:52.248
The fat sheep are almost the same now
It’s time to discover that you have been defrauded.

398
00:24:52.748 --> 00:24:54.714
(Chengjin Construction)
Uncle, look here...

399
00:24:54.714 --> 00:24:56.448
You guys are so annoying
My name is written here

400
00:24:56.448 --> 00:25:00.814
Your wife clearly said she was going to the United States

401
00:25:00.814 --> 00:25:03.581
What are you two talking about?

402
00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:05.381
My wife passed away a long time ago

403
00:25:05.381 --> 00:25:06.681
did she pass away

404
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:07.681
How could she pass away

405
00:25:07.681 --> 00:25:09.814
How is it possible

406
00:25:09.814 --> 00:25:12.281
No, uncle, this document of yours is fake, right?

407
00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:14.081
Is this a fake of yours?

408
00:25:14.081 --> 00:25:15.814
(House ownership certificate)
You see, these two copies are exactly the same

409
00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:18.848
It's true. Your part is fake.

410
00:25:18.848 --> 00:25:20.814
This is the real thing about me

411
00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:22.948
You've been deceived at first glance

412
00:25:22.948 --> 00:25:26.281
Cheer up and go to the police station to report the crime.

413
00:25:27.748 --> 00:25:29.114
Why do you want us to go to the police station?

414
00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:32.314
Oh my God, how could this happen?

415
00:25:32.314 --> 00:25:32.981
Wife…

416
00:25:32.981 --> 00:25:34.281
Husband

417
00:25:35.048 --> 00:25:37.648
what to do now

418
00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:41.681
You have to hide from Guangzhuo and you have to hide from the police.

419
00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:46.248
Hey, now is not the time to yawn.

420
00:25:46.248 --> 00:25:48.681
You offended Guangzhuo's gang

421
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:51.548
You should at least help clean up the mess.

422
00:25:52.081 --> 00:25:54.648
Otherwise, give them all the money you got from the fraud.

423
00:25:54.648 --> 00:25:56.114
That'll be fine

424
00:25:57.314 --> 00:25:59.481
And what clues does the police have?
Can we be caught?

425
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.881
Just give the money to those people
There shouldn't be any problems

426
00:26:04.514 --> 00:26:06.714
But that money…

427
00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:08.681
Didn't you say you wanted to part ways?

428
00:26:08.681 --> 00:26:11.014
Boss Gao just said it casually.

429
00:26:11.014 --> 00:26:12.948
I'm just a trainee. Isn't it my fault?

430
00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:14.314
Who told you to talk too much?

431
00:26:14.314 --> 00:26:15.848
Everyone, go back

432
00:26:15.848 --> 00:26:18.448
I have to go to the construction site early tomorrow morning to work

433
00:26:18.448 --> 00:26:21.548
Okay…

434
00:26:21.548 --> 00:26:23.148
it's my fault

435
00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:26.048
We are all a family now, okay?

436
00:26:26.048 --> 00:26:27.614
Yes, we are a family...

437
00:26:27.614 --> 00:26:30.881
Just do it
Now give him his share.

438
00:26:34.822 --> 00:26:36.649
Do you really consider me one of your own?

439
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.650
Really
Of course

440
00:26:39.122 --> 00:26:41.922
I will also treat you all as my family

441
00:26:41.922 --> 00:26:43.922
Of course
Needless to say

442
00:26:43.922 --> 00:26:48.855
No, you are our boss from now on

443
00:26:48.855 --> 00:26:50.622
The boss lets you be

444
00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:57.322
great

445
00:26:57.322 --> 00:26:59.055
We are a family from now on

446
00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:00.722
a family…
a family…

447
00:27:00.722 --> 00:27:01.889
You guys go back quickly

448
00:27:01.889 --> 00:27:03.622
Got it, let's go back

449
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:04.255
Let's go

450
00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:06.322
OK

451
00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:07.622
You go in

452
00:27:07.622 --> 00:27:09.289
my family

453
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:10.722
Let's go
Goodbye

454
00:27:10.722 --> 00:27:12.255
we are a family

455
00:27:18.155 --> 00:27:19.622
young man

456
00:27:19.622 --> 00:27:20.955
Is today a big day?

457
00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:22.589
Your family is all here

458
00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:24.189
Come and have a look

459
00:27:32.522 --> 00:27:33.889
Brother

460
00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:41.322
Why don't you come home and there is no news?

461
00:27:41.322 --> 00:27:43.422
Do you know how worried mom is about you?

462
00:27:43.422 --> 00:27:46.655
Stop talking nonsense and hurry up and eat.

463
00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:50.622
You didn’t even know Mom received your call
How long have you cried

464
00:27:50.622 --> 00:27:52.122
You stinky girl...

465
00:28:02.955 --> 00:28:06.122
Little girl, why did you take the chicken legs and gnaw them?

466
00:28:06.122 --> 00:28:09.755
Really, I only ate one bowl of noodles today

467
00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:12.822
I'm so hungry that my chest touches my back

468
00:28:17.889 --> 00:28:19.755
Mom, please eat more

469
00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:25.522
You were just released from prison not long ago
But he became so handsome

470
00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:27.489
Just like a Seoulite

471
00:28:28.322 --> 00:28:29.722
Really?

472
00:28:29.722 --> 00:28:30.589
Right

473
00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:33.889
Brother, I also came to work in a factory in Seoul.

474
00:28:33.889 --> 00:28:35.889
Sister Yoshiko introduced me there

475
00:28:35.889 --> 00:28:38.322
A factory just over there in Guro-ri

476
00:28:38.322 --> 00:28:40.422
They make hinges and razors.

477
00:28:40.422 --> 00:28:42.189
Are you not going to school?

478
00:28:42.722 --> 00:28:44.155
Brother, you also know, right?

479
00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:46.389
Although I'm not as good at reading as you are

480
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:48.922
But I always ranked among the top five in the class

481
00:28:48.922 --> 00:28:53.855
A girl who can’t read better than me
All went to high school

482
00:28:53.855 --> 00:28:58.255
My dad told me not to continue my studies
go to factory to work

483
00:28:58.255 --> 00:29:00.922
You don't know how angry I am

484
00:29:02.689 --> 00:29:04.255
Why don't you shut up?

485
00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:07.089
Why do I have to be obedient and go to work in a factory?
Give up further education

486
00:29:07.089 --> 00:29:08.255
I want to make money with my own hands

487
00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:10.089
Then go back to school to study

488
00:29:10.455 --> 00:29:11.655
Just wait and see

489
00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:14.989
I will definitely go to university

490
00:29:15.889 --> 00:29:17.555
Stop talking nonsense

491
00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.055
Might as well eat more food

492
00:29:19.055 --> 00:29:20.855
Eat more

493
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:28.722
One two three wooden man

494
00:29:29.022 --> 00:29:32.622
One two three wooden man
You blame your dad very much, right?

495
00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:35.389
I blame him too

496
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:37.889
Son is in jail
He never visits the prison

497
00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:40.855
How can a person be so ruthless?

498
00:29:41.622 --> 00:29:44.189
Don't ever tell me about dad again

499
00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:49.722
When you were 20 years old, you were transferred to Gwangju Prison.

500
00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:52.055
It was the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival

501
00:29:52.055 --> 00:29:58.122
Your father suddenly said that he was going to his cousin's house in Guangyang to worship his ancestors.

502
00:29:58.122 --> 00:30:01.522
I think he should feel
Preparing food for sacrifice at home is troublesome

503
00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:05.055
Mom, go in and sleep

504
00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:07.822
Don't you want to hear it?

505
00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:09.802
Yes

506
00:30:11.422 --> 00:30:13.555
Hear me out

507
00:30:22.222 --> 00:30:24.889
He went out on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival

508
00:30:25.289 --> 00:30:28.055
It’s the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival and I haven’t gone home yet.

509
00:30:28.822 --> 00:30:30.055
I'm worried something happened to him

510
00:30:30.055 --> 00:30:33.255
I called his cousin who lives in Guangyang.

511
00:30:33.255 --> 00:30:34.489
As a result, the other party was confused.

512
00:30:34.489 --> 00:30:36.822
He said your dad never went to his house at all

513
00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:41.889
How scared I was

514
00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:45.922
I'm so worried that I can't even sleep or eat.

515
00:30:46.955 --> 00:30:51.489
The night of the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival

516
00:30:51.489 --> 00:30:53.755
Your dad just showed up in the yard

517
00:30:55.789 --> 00:31:00.355
The arrogant dad...

518
00:31:00.355 --> 00:31:01.989
what happened

519
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:03.889
Where have you been? Why are you back now?

520
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:08.322
You worry me to death

521
00:31:08.322 --> 00:31:11.122
Okay, go and help me prepare food.

522
00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:28.489
(Ticket Yeosu to Gwangju)

523
00:31:28.489 --> 00:31:33.122
Your dad has no relatives in Gwangju

524
00:31:34.689 --> 00:31:36.889
What was he doing there?

525
00:31:39.589 --> 00:31:41.455
He is looking for you

526
00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:48.122
A month later, when Zhenyu and I went to visit the prison
Confirmed this

527
00:31:49.922 --> 00:31:54.522
Your dad went to the prison to get some pocket money and gave it to you.

528
00:31:55.755 --> 00:32:01.255
Your dad even paid for the return ticket and meals.
All given to you

529
00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:07.789
It took two days
Just walked back to Yeosu from Gwangju

530
00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:16.755
I hope you don't blame your dad too much

531
00:32:17.755 --> 00:32:19.522
Go in and sleep quickly

532
00:32:19.522 --> 00:32:21.189
Douxue

533
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:22.222
Let it go

534
00:32:22.222 --> 00:32:24.455
Douxue

535
00:32:33.422 --> 00:32:34.922
Be attentive

536
00:32:40.655 --> 00:32:43.589
Hey, don't doze off

537
00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:45.189
Go wash your face

538
00:33:04.422 --> 00:33:07.789
Sister, can you give me some energy-boosting tablets?

539
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:10.955
Just one

540
00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:12.322
you really are...

541
00:33:12.322 --> 00:33:13.589
please

542
00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:15.922
How many pills have you already eaten?

543
00:33:15.922 --> 00:33:18.055
I'm really sleepy

544
00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:22.089
What if I can't finish my work?

545
00:33:22.089 --> 00:33:22.989
please

546
00:33:23.722 --> 00:33:26.489
If you overdose
I don't care if you feel dizzy or faint.

547
00:33:26.489 --> 00:33:27.955
Got it

(Caffeine Refreshing Tablets)

549
00:33:32.089 --> 00:33:33.755
Thank you for your hard work

550
00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:35.955
If you have time, you can come to night school.

551
00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:38.555
Hello, Ms. Yoshiko

552
00:33:39.189 --> 00:33:40.255
hello

553
00:33:40.255 --> 00:33:43.055
Have a cup of barley tea

554
00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:44.522
I don't need it

555
00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.855
I won't ask you to come to night school

556
00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:48.055
Just have a drink

557
00:33:48.055 --> 00:33:49.222
No need really

558
00:33:49.222 --> 00:33:50.855
please give me a drink

559
00:33:52.255 --> 00:33:53.755
OK

560
00:33:57.555 --> 00:33:58.955
Come here quickly

561
00:33:59.755 --> 00:34:00.955
Are you Zhenyu?

562
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.489
Yes

563
00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:06.355
Many students have passed the entrance exam

564
00:34:06.355 --> 00:34:08.222
(Night school students are currently recruiting)
As long as you prepare a little

565
00:34:08.222 --> 00:34:10.289
Definitely can pass in one go

566
00:34:10.522 --> 00:34:12.122
OK

567
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:17.389
But I have something to ask you

568
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.789
Teacher, are you a red element?

569
00:34:19.789 --> 00:34:21.489
Wha...what

570
00:34:22.022 --> 00:34:23.855
Sister Yoshiko said

571
00:34:23.855 --> 00:34:27.589
People who run night schools and engage in trade unions

572
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:29.022
They are all red elements

573
00:34:48.855 --> 00:34:50.055
You are here

574
00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:54.355
It’s time to paint well today, right?

575
00:34:57.455 --> 00:34:59.255
That…

576
00:34:59.255 --> 00:35:00.989
I haven’t…

577
00:35:17.922 --> 00:35:19.522
Get off the car

578
00:35:44.889 --> 00:35:46.889
I'll give you a week

579
00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:50.155
If you still can't find it by then
The hiding place of those in the Guidance Department

580
00:35:50.155 --> 00:35:52.622
Your family will receive a death notice

581
00:35:55.455 --> 00:35:57.522
do you know what this is

582
00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:00.989
These are the hard-earned money of the people

583
00:36:04.155 --> 00:36:05.989
So…

584
00:36:08.355 --> 00:36:10.022
Please be patriotic

585
00:36:27.989 --> 00:36:30.689
You guys still don't understand the situation?

586
00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:31.655
Hello

587
00:36:31.655 --> 00:36:34.355
Descendants of independence activists don’t know how to be patriotic

588
00:36:34.355 --> 00:36:38.089
Still want to be a red element and challenge national sovereignty?
Take to the streets to demonstrate

589
00:36:38.645 --> 00:36:40.755
Send him to the training center immediately

590
00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:42.522
Transform him well

591
00:36:42.522 --> 00:36:44.755
go forward

592
00:36:50.655 --> 00:36:52.289
go forward

593
00:36:54.522 --> 00:36:55.989
Get on the bus

594
00:36:55.989 --> 00:36:58.889
Hurry up and get in the car Hurry up

595
00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:05.255
Hello

596
00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:06.022
Mom

597
00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:07.722
Tetsuo

598
00:37:07.722 --> 00:37:08.955
Tetsuo, is that you?

599
00:37:08.955 --> 00:37:11.689
is it really you

600
00:37:11.689 --> 00:37:12.855
Yes mom

601
00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:14.322
Tetsuo

602
00:37:14.322 --> 00:37:15.722
where are you

603
00:37:15.722 --> 00:37:17.855
Did you really voluntarily enlist in the army?

604
00:37:17.855 --> 00:37:18.822
(Special student status changes, Army Headquarters)

605
00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:20.455
Mom, don't cry

606
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:21.922
That's it anyway

607
00:37:21.922 --> 00:37:23.355
I'm living a good life now

608
00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:24.489
Tetsuo

609
00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:27.522
You don't need to be a soldier

610
00:37:27.522 --> 00:37:28.555
where are you

611
00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:30.222
Mom goes to find you

612
00:37:33.122 --> 00:37:35.755
Mom, there's no time

613
00:37:35.755 --> 00:37:37.389
It's easy to be a soldier now

614
00:37:37.389 --> 00:37:38.455
I ate well in it

615
00:37:38.455 --> 00:37:40.055
sleep well

616
00:37:40.055 --> 00:37:42.389
The commander won't hit anyone either

617
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:44.229
So you don't have to worry, Mom...

618
00:37:48.955 --> 00:37:50.722
Mom…

619
00:37:53.122 --> 00:37:55.355
Mom…

620
00:38:14.722 --> 00:38:17.755
Do you miss your mother very much?

621
00:38:19.855 --> 00:38:21.755
I can give you leave tomorrow

622
00:38:21.755 --> 00:38:23.902
It also allows you to retire early

623
00:38:25.089 --> 00:38:27.645
Are you willing to do something patriotic?

624
00:38:29.655 --> 00:38:34.022
I am already very patriotic

625
00:38:36.655 --> 00:38:39.455
You should know that's not what I meant

626
00:38:39.922 --> 00:38:43.822
I don't understand what you want to say

627
00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:45.222
Don’t you understand?

628
00:38:46.422 --> 00:38:48.689
It literally means patriotic

629
00:38:48.689 --> 00:38:50.222
what is patriotism

630
00:38:50.222 --> 00:38:52.855
Find out those red spies

631
00:38:53.655 --> 00:38:56.289
As long as you find those red spies
Report them

632
00:38:56.289 --> 00:38:59.289
we can catch them
consolidate national security

633
00:39:00.236 --> 00:39:03.770
Do you want me to be a mole?

634
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.370
What to be a mole

635
00:39:06.336 --> 00:39:09.736
That's a patriotic act

636
00:39:10.503 --> 00:39:11.703
patriotic

637
00:39:13.703 --> 00:39:16.603
This is the front line

638
00:39:16.603 --> 00:39:18.770
very dangerous

639
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.470
Even if you are missing here

640
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.236
No one will know

641
00:39:28.136 --> 00:39:29.570
Cui Zhexiong

642
00:39:33.303 --> 00:39:36.003
I'm giving you a chance now

643
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:41.003
You should inherit your family’s patriotic spirit, right?

644
00:39:46.103 --> 00:39:47.570
I don't want

645
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.236
Sign quickly

646
00:40:04.897 --> 00:40:06.797
Dip him again

647
00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:21.403
OK I do

648
00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:24.870
i do

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.870
-What?
-What?

653
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.670
You boy

654
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.570
What?

655
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.570
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

656
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.936
Well I'm fine

657
00:40:44.936 --> 00:40:46.470
great

658
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.036
now is the time

659
00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:53.736
That's right, right now

660
00:40:53.736 --> 00:40:56.836
No, everyone was arrested

661
00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:59.870
How long will it take?

662
00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.103
Senior

663
00:41:01.103 --> 00:41:03.070
why did you come

664
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.036
You are here

665
00:41:04.036 --> 00:41:05.403
Thank you for your hard work

666
00:41:05.403 --> 00:41:08.270
We are really worried that you will be caught by the police

667
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.836
-thank you
-Have a seat

668
00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:11.270
Take a seat

669
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.036
But why did you come?

670
00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:15.803
Of course I want to come and meet you all

671
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.570
are you okay

672
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:19.203
Eat some of this

673
00:41:19.203 --> 00:41:20.736
where are you going next

674
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.270
You know him?

675
00:41:23.603 --> 00:41:25.070
You obviously know him

676
00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.780
you bastards

677
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.314
They confirmed each other's feelings

678
00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:49.980
Zhu Xi gave black gloves to the taxi

679
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.880
Zhu Xi and Junri helped put the luggage on the cart
Move into a taxi

680
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.980
The three of them felt hope

681
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.014
Then the camera zooms out

682
00:41:58.014 --> 00:41:59.847
The script ends here

683
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.980
The content is a bit dark

684
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.080
Who do you think the director is?

685
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.647
Pei Changhao This is his first film
Directed works

686
00:42:08.647 --> 00:42:11.114
Starring Kim Bo-kyeon, Ahn Sung-ki and Kim Hee-ra

687
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.580
The cast is good

688
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.014
But I have something to ask you, boss.

689
00:42:18.014 --> 00:42:19.880
It should be faster if you read the script yourself

690
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.747
why do you always want me to read

691
00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:23.880
You don't know

692
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.180
Because I can't read

693
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.514
what

694
00:42:28.514 --> 00:42:30.347
Are you really illiterate?

695
00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:32.514
How do you read the account books?

696
00:42:32.514 --> 00:42:34.214
How could I see it

697
00:42:34.214 --> 00:42:36.947
I asked my assistant to read it to me.
I'll recite it again

698
00:42:39.547 --> 00:42:41.447
How to carry this?

699
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.347
(Sun Pictures)

700
00:42:46.347 --> 00:42:47.847
The owner here

701
00:42:47.847 --> 00:42:50.280
Indulge in the gentle land of Japanese little wives

702
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.980
Almost not in Korea

703
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.747
So this is the right place for us to start

704
00:43:00.447 --> 00:43:02.814
Total production cost…

705
00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:03.714
200 million won

706
00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:06.480
Right, Mr. Che

707
00:43:09.914 --> 00:43:11.714
The work is very complete

708
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:12.947
But because it is the story of the urban poor

709
00:43:12.947 --> 00:43:15.047
should be strictly scrutinized

710
00:43:15.047 --> 00:43:17.580
The rating will also be set as restricted level

711
00:43:17.847 --> 00:43:20.880
So can this movie make money?

712
00:43:24.947 --> 00:43:26.647
if it were me

713
00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:28.280
I probably won't invest

714
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.647
Then…

715
00:43:32.647 --> 00:43:34.047
I want to invest

716
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.180
why

717
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.247
A person who is arrogant and thinks he is smart
Everything you say is wrong

718
00:43:42.747 --> 00:43:46.214
Make a money order of 30 million won to him

719
00:43:46.214 --> 00:43:48.480
Pay after one month

720
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.647
thank you

721
00:43:49.647 --> 00:43:51.280
Thank you boss

722
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.114
No one is willing to invest

723
00:43:53.114 --> 00:43:54.780
Car boss…

724
00:43:55.547 --> 00:43:57.214
It's like giving me thousands of troops

725
00:43:57.214 --> 00:43:59.480
I'm not here to help you

726
00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:04.847
I smell money

727
00:44:05.214 --> 00:44:07.414
what

728
00:44:07.414 --> 00:44:08.814
the taste of money

729
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.114
This building is really nice

730
00:44:15.447 --> 00:44:17.914
I heard that this area will be updated later.

731
00:44:17.914 --> 00:44:23.447
Now sold for 300 million won
Everyone should rush to buy it

732
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.180
That person is an actor, right?

733
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.347
so beautiful

734
00:44:29.347 --> 00:44:31.547
But who is she?

735
00:44:31.547 --> 00:44:32.680
boss

736
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.380
do you know who she is

737
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.547
Let's go if you like it

738
00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:38.780
Come and take a look

739
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.280
she is really beautiful

740
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.014
Come and take a look. Come on...

741
00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.414
Why are young people not interested in women?

742
00:44:45.414 --> 00:44:47.347
Over there…

743
00:45:10.014 --> 00:45:11.214
Am I right?

744
00:45:11.214 --> 00:45:12.680
She is beautiful, right?

745
00:45:13.147 --> 00:45:15.314
Where is it beautiful?

746
00:45:15.314 --> 00:45:16.847
Let's go

747
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.280
Obviously I can't take my eyes off it

748
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.480
The boss has really high vision

749
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.314
You will live here from now on

750
00:46:05.947 --> 00:46:10.114
Wait, where is this place?

751
00:46:10.114 --> 00:46:14.214
Sigh, your powers of observation are so slow.

752
00:46:14.214 --> 00:46:16.247
Can't you see?

753
00:46:16.247 --> 00:46:20.447
This is from our South Island Film Company
Seoul Office

754
00:46:20.447 --> 00:46:21.647
There was a silly boy who lived here before

755
00:46:21.647 --> 00:46:23.714
I was fired half a month ago

756
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.547
So starting from today

757
00:46:25.547 --> 00:46:28.547
You are an employee here
concurrently branch owner

758
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.614
What's wrong

759
00:46:30.614 --> 00:46:32.780
Promotion too fast

760
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.680
you are so happy

761
00:46:36.847 --> 00:46:39.514
Take it and buy whatever you need.

762
00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:51.247
boss

763
00:46:55.114 --> 00:46:56.780
boss

764
00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.514
You haven't told me what I'm going to do yet

765
00:47:01.147 --> 00:47:04.047
You girl

766
00:47:04.047 --> 00:47:05.714
Didn't you also run a movie theater?

767
00:47:05.714 --> 00:47:08.080
why ask me

768
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.880
And I'm illiterate

769
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.980
You are a college dropout

770
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.914
Who should teach whom now?

771
00:47:29.714 --> 00:47:31.480
Never mind

772
00:47:54.814 --> 00:47:57.480
Wu Dingchen, you must be crazy

773
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.647
So bad at looking at people

774
00:47:59.647 --> 00:48:01.247
What else do you want to do?

775
00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:05.447
Why break the bottle

776
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.647
Hello

777
00:48:20.747 --> 00:48:22.314
Hello

778
00:48:25.414 --> 00:48:26.914
Is it the boss?

779
00:48:29.447 --> 00:48:32.247
Just talk when you call me

780
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.980
What?

781
00:48:57.247 --> 00:48:58.747
Who is it again?

782
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.514
Hello

783
00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:09.380
Hello

784
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.747
What the hell?

785
00:49:13.547 --> 00:49:14.847
Hey brat

786
00:49:14.847 --> 00:49:16.380
Are you going to keep making prank calls?

787
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.014
Are you a primary school student?

788
00:49:18.014 --> 00:49:20.614
It seems you don't know your sister's temper

789
00:49:20.614 --> 00:49:22.814
If you dare to call me again to prank me

790
00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:25.080
Even if I have to chase you to the end of the universe
I'll catch you too

791
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.114
I'll break your fingers
So that you can no longer make phone calls

792
00:49:27.114 --> 00:49:28.747
Did you hear that?

793
00:49:29.114 --> 00:49:30.847
Abominable

794
00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:44.480
Senior, run quickly

795
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.680
The police are coming

796
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.214
Hurry up

797
00:49:48.014 --> 00:49:49.180
Fast

798
00:49:56.147 --> 00:49:57.880
This way

799
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.147
Hello

800
00:50:14.247 --> 00:50:15.647
Over there…

801
00:50:15.647 --> 00:50:16.880
Don't run

802
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.580
You go down first

803
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.047
Senior, are you okay?

804
00:50:30.047 --> 00:50:31.447
can you walk

805
00:50:31.447 --> 00:50:32.580
I'm fine

806
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.047
You guys go quickly

807
00:50:33.047 --> 00:50:34.447
are you really okay

808
00:50:34.447 --> 00:50:36.414
Just say it's okay, you go quickly

809
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.814
Don't run

810
00:50:45.214 --> 00:50:46.814
catch that kid

811
00:50:55.914 --> 00:50:57.414
catch him

812
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.814
OK

813
00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:09.247
what

814
00:51:13.647 --> 00:51:15.047
he is our man

815
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.080
Then…

816
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.714
Thank you for your hard work

817
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.680
What? Are you following me?

818
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.247
What tracking

819
00:51:38.214 --> 00:51:39.914
you are ours

820
00:51:39.914 --> 00:51:42.047
we want to protect you

821
00:51:45.147 --> 00:51:48.447
They are not from the guidance department

822
00:51:48.447 --> 00:51:50.080
Just students from ordinary clubs

823
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.280
I get it…

824
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.747
But maybe some of them know
the information i need

825
00:51:58.747 --> 00:52:01.580
That's why I took them back

826
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.480
Cui Zhexiong

827
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.847
I don’t want hundreds of small fish

828
00:52:06.847 --> 00:52:09.014
Just give me a big fish

829
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.880
That way you can save face

830
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.880
I want you to watch it a few times, that’s enough

831
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.914
Please be patriotic for once

832
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.608
patriotic

833
00:52:25.747 --> 00:52:27.080
good

834
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.414
Then you let me

835
00:52:28.414 --> 00:52:30.647
Be patriotic

836
00:52:31.847 --> 00:52:34.014
Just let me go back to the army

837
00:52:34.014 --> 00:52:36.114
Let me go back and guard the front line

838
00:52:42.247 --> 00:52:44.047
you are crazy

839
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.514
Do you really want to die?

840
00:52:46.514 --> 00:52:48.547
you talk too much

841
00:52:52.447 --> 00:52:55.247
You go back to the army now

842
00:52:55.247 --> 00:52:57.808
Maybe even if you die, no one will know

843
00:52:59.247 --> 00:53:01.380
No one knows why you died

844
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.914
I don’t know how you died

845
00:53:02.926 --> 00:53:05.055
In technical terms, that's called unknown cause of death.

846
00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.380
Have some social experience
You have become bolder too

847
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.547
How is it

848
00:53:11.547 --> 00:53:13.080
Do you want me to take you back to the army?

849
00:53:16.414 --> 00:53:18.447
I say this because I treat you as one of my own.

850
00:53:19.147 --> 00:53:21.547
You have to live with a grateful heart, kid.

851
00:53:24.814 --> 00:53:28.847
Although the building has guards

852
00:53:28.847 --> 00:53:30.714
But they only know the property manager

853
00:53:30.714 --> 00:53:33.780
Don't know the owner

854
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.880
God is so helpful

855
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.547
Money actually fell from the sky

856
00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:42.547
How much money can we make this time?

857
00:53:42.547 --> 00:53:46.147
Everyone should be careful

858
00:53:46.147 --> 00:53:48.314
No matter how sure you are

859
00:53:48.314 --> 00:53:50.080
Still have to be careful

860
00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.947
Be careful not to be deceived by the pretty boy

861
00:53:55.247 --> 00:53:57.280
Really

862
00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.547
looks

863
00:53:58.547 --> 00:53:59.647
Get the land registration certificate

864
00:53:59.647 --> 00:54:01.480
good

865
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.080
Who?

866
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.314
Why do you live so high up?

867
00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.116
come out

868
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.714
Drink with me

869
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.880
who is this guy

870
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.847
He is my brother

871
00:54:21.447 --> 00:54:22.114
I thought it was the police

872
00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:23.314
I almost wet my pants in fear

873
00:54:23.314 --> 00:54:25.080
That's right

874
00:54:30.047 --> 00:54:31.480
I mean it

875
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.247
Let's go have another drink

876
00:54:34.247 --> 00:54:35.980
You go home and sleep quickly

877
00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.014
Also

878
00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:40.680
If you dare to come to me for a drink next time, you will be dead.

879
00:54:41.314 --> 00:54:44.880
Then you might as well kill me now

880
00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:47.914
Who were you beaten by?

881
00:54:47.914 --> 00:54:49.247
Why do ankles hurt?

882
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:51.214
Me...

883
00:54:51.214 --> 00:54:53.214
It's for patriotism

884
00:54:53.214 --> 00:54:54.947
Were you involved in the independence movement?

885
00:54:54.947 --> 00:54:56.847
Okay, here we are

886
00:54:57.547 --> 00:54:59.247
Cui Zhexiong

887
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.847
You are still alive and well

888
00:55:16.314 --> 00:55:18.147
let's talk

889
00:55:18.147 --> 00:55:19.714
what's the matter with you

890
00:55:19.714 --> 00:55:21.080
I have something to say here

891
00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.680
I am Tetsuo's senior

892
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.947
Don't worry, just go back first

893
00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:26.747
Let's just talk to him

894
00:55:26.747 --> 00:55:28.747
I have something to say here

895
00:55:34.947 --> 00:55:37.980
Got it…

896
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.647
These seniors are very familiar with me

897
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.947
Brother

898
00:55:44.947 --> 00:55:47.414
You go back to my room and rest first

899
00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:48.547
I'll be right back

900
00:55:48.547 --> 00:55:50.314
I'm leaving, brat

901
00:55:52.847 --> 00:55:55.047
Yes...is it?

902
00:55:55.447 --> 00:55:58.047
Okay, then go back

903
00:56:25.114 --> 00:56:26.680
Tetsuo

904
00:56:27.114 --> 00:56:28.514
Cui Zhexiong

905
00:56:40.547 --> 00:56:43.647
Where is the film club?

906
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.114
"Thirty million compatriots in three thousand miles"

907
00:56:59.114 --> 00:57:02.914
"It's your and my responsibility to save the country"

908
00:57:02.914 --> 00:57:06.514
"Come on...stand up and fight"

909
00:57:06.514 --> 00:57:10.714
"Come on...stand up and fight"

910
00:57:11.414 --> 00:57:12.747
Tetsuo

911
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:16.780
Let's be honest

912
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.647
How many times do you want me to say it?

913
00:57:19.647 --> 00:57:21.780
really not me

914
00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.980
I'm not a mole

915
00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.380
Then why did the police let you go?

916
00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.447
who is talking to you

917
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.314
So

918
00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:35.980
Call that female student who saw me in the dormitory
Confront me

919
00:57:36.747 --> 00:57:39.480
It's so dark. How can she be sure it's me?

920
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.547
She said that man walked with a limp

921
00:57:41.547 --> 00:57:42.547
Is there anyone else besides you?

922
00:57:42.547 --> 00:57:44.114
Everyone who was not injured was arrested.

923
00:57:44.114 --> 00:57:46.347
Only your foot is injured and you haven't been arrested yet

924
00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:47.380
Do you think this sounds reasonable?

925
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.880
Say it

926
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.614
Senior, I didn’t run to the back hill.

927
00:57:51.614 --> 00:57:54.147
I'm running to the east gate

928
00:57:54.147 --> 00:57:56.414
And I don't walk with a limp

929
00:57:56.414 --> 00:57:59.447
I'm too nervous
I don’t feel any pain when running

930
00:57:59.447 --> 00:58:03.747
Only after I successfully escaped from the police did I feel the pain.

931
00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:06.514
That's why I go drinking

932
00:58:06.514 --> 00:58:07.414
Isn't it?

933
00:58:07.414 --> 00:58:10.680
Everyone has had this experience, right?

934
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.314
Really

935
00:58:11.314 --> 00:58:13.147
Tetsuo

936
00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:25.947
We know you didn't become a mole by choice.

937
00:58:26.514 --> 00:58:29.014
You don't have to be a soldier but you are forced to join the army

938
00:58:29.014 --> 00:58:31.047
Later he was discharged early

939
00:58:34.447 --> 00:58:38.147
We can guess what they did to you

940
00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:41.114
Many students even died because of that

941
00:58:42.114 --> 00:58:45.080
So you give up and tell us the truth

942
00:58:45.547 --> 00:58:48.280
We don't want to do anything to you

943
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.314
But we have to let the whole world know

944
00:58:50.314 --> 00:58:51.814
In order to trample on democratization

945
00:58:51.814 --> 00:58:53.714
What a bad thing you did

946
00:58:54.647 --> 00:58:56.580
Tetsuo, please

947
00:58:57.714 --> 00:58:59.514
Make confession

948
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:04.247
Senior

949
00:59:06.947 --> 00:59:08.980
"We will do it because the enemy is strong"

950
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.880
"Are you just timid and cowardly?"

951
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.947
"In justice..."

952
00:59:12.947 --> 00:59:14.714
It’s not that we just have a chat

953
00:59:14.714 --> 00:59:16.414
You guys chatted all night

954
00:59:16.414 --> 00:59:18.180
Where is Tetsuo?

955
00:59:18.547 --> 00:59:21.247
We talked to him yesterday
Just let him go home

956
00:59:21.247 --> 00:59:23.480
Why are you doing this?

957
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.247
I slept in Tetsuo's room until I woke up just now

958
00:59:26.247 --> 00:59:29.114
He might have gone to drink with other friends.

959
00:59:30.747 --> 00:59:32.480
Wait

960
00:59:33.414 --> 00:59:36.714
Even college students who have read so many books will still lie.

961
00:59:39.047 --> 00:59:40.547
Tetsuo is here, right?

962
00:59:41.547 --> 00:59:42.947
he is not here

963
00:59:42.947 --> 00:59:44.647
You are very strong

964
00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:45.847
You go back

965
00:59:45.847 --> 00:59:47.714
they are marines
And someone from the underwater demolition team

966
00:59:48.847 --> 00:59:51.080
So scary

967
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.514
I count to ten

968
00:59:52.514 --> 00:59:54.647
If Tetsuo hasn't come out yet

969
00:59:54.647 --> 00:59:57.247
I started to act like a ghost and catch people.

970
01:00:02.814 --> 01:00:06.347
seven eight

971
01:00:09.447 --> 01:00:11.280
Is everyone hiding?

972
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.614
ninety

973
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.180
Okay, I'm going to arrest him.

974
01:00:38.414 --> 01:00:40.380
You come closer again

975
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.880
Don't blame us for taking action

976
01:01:38.714 --> 01:01:39.514
Senior

977
01:01:39.514 --> 01:01:40.880
There are police

978
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.380
Tetsuo

979
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.047
Choi Cheol-woong, where are you?

980
01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:53.014
You hid so well, I was so tired of looking for you

981
01:02:01.347 --> 01:02:05.880
I didn't want to do this to students

982
01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:08.847
But the devil catches people

983
01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:11.047
The game will end if someone is caught

984
01:02:12.347 --> 01:02:14.247
come on

985
01:02:14.447 --> 01:02:16.147
Brat

986
01:02:29.647 --> 01:02:31.314
OK

987
01:02:34.314 --> 01:02:35.847
Come out

988
01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:42.580
finally found it

989
01:02:45.647 --> 01:02:47.314
You go

990
01:02:55.014 --> 01:02:56.247
Brat

991
01:02:56.247 --> 01:02:58.147
I was almost beaten to death

992
01:02:58.147 --> 01:02:59.847
Let's go

993
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.414
Cui Zhexiong

994
01:03:07.447 --> 01:03:09.080
you made a good friend

995
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.680
But

996
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.914
Don't live in such shame

997
01:03:23.914 --> 01:03:25.914
That's right

998
01:03:25.914 --> 01:03:28.447
We cannot live in disgrace

999
01:03:28.447 --> 01:03:30.614
Can't live without shame

1000
01:03:30.947 --> 01:03:32.580
But

1001
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.047
I'm at my worst
I also try my best to live a life without shame.

1002
01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.547
If I really am a mole

1003
01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:42.847
Senior

1004
01:03:42.847 --> 01:03:45.414
And you

1005
01:03:45.414 --> 01:03:47.880
It's impossible to be here now

1006
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.014
Do you know

1007
01:03:53.347 --> 01:03:55.680
Hey, gone

1008
01:03:56.347 --> 01:03:58.080
Let's go

1009
01:04:08.814 --> 01:04:10.847
why not tell the truth

1010
01:04:13.347 --> 01:04:16.114
It's that confession of conscience

1011
01:04:17.814 --> 01:04:20.280
You must have a conscience to confess your conscience

1012
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.580
but you

1013
01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.714
no conscience

1014
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.514
Yes

1015
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.714
Why did you rush in and get beaten?

1016
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.547
Are you worried that something will happen to me?

1017
01:04:35.547 --> 01:04:37.980
Of course

1018
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.314
Something happened to you or you were beaten to death
I don't care

1019
01:04:41.314 --> 01:04:42.914
But you owe me a debt

1020
01:04:42.914 --> 01:04:44.680
Who am I going to ask for?

1021
01:04:46.514 --> 01:04:48.547
You

1022
01:04:48.547 --> 01:04:49.947
before you pay off your debt to me

1023
01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:52.047
I can't die even if I want to

1024
01:04:54.247 --> 01:04:56.380
My life is really full of troubles

1025
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.580
At least now there's one less problem

1026
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.447
You can't continue to be a mole now.

1027
01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:06.914
Now that everything has happened, can you still go back?

1028
01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:13.114
Really?

1029
01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:18.780
I, Cui Cheol-woong, am really lucky.

1030
01:05:20.647 --> 01:05:22.414
madman

1031
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.414
Brother

1032
01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:45.647
I…

1033
01:05:45.647 --> 01:05:48.647
I really didn't betray anyone.

1034
01:05:48.647 --> 01:05:51.447
Friends who participated in the student movement together

1035
01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.814
Even if I get beaten and threatened by those bastards
I didn't say anything either

1036
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.414
But…

1037
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.680
How could they do this to me

1038
01:06:14.514 --> 01:06:16.080
Come up

1039
01:06:17.547 --> 01:06:19.380
Come up here, brat

1040
01:06:34.314 --> 01:06:36.414
Why are you so heavy?

1041
01:06:40.547 --> 01:06:42.147
Brother

1042
01:06:42.514 --> 01:06:45.980
Do you want to find time to go back to Lishui together?

1043
01:06:48.914 --> 01:06:51.614
go to the movies

1044
01:06:51.614 --> 01:06:53.347
go see my dad

1045
01:06:53.347 --> 01:06:56.514
Go see your dad too

1046
01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:57.747
Also go and see Dingchen

1047
01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.714
Stop talking

1048
01:06:59.714 --> 01:07:01.314
What's wrong

1049
01:07:01.314 --> 01:07:03.847
You actually really want to go, right?

1050
01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:05.680
You really want to set the time, right?

1051
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.047
You want to go on your own, brat?

1052
01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:09.747
Forget it, come down

1053
01:07:09.747 --> 01:07:11.780
You come down

1054
01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.947
Just carry me there

1055
01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:17.380
Then please be quiet

1056
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.680
stop talking

1057
01:07:59.347 --> 01:08:02.447
(Preview of next episode)

1058
01:08:02.447 --> 01:08:05.580
Please invite Jiang Ruzhen, a representative of the Paris Salon

1059
01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.480
Who is this

1060
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.580
long time no see

1061
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.780
We will also be a family from now on

1062
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.547
what

1063
01:08:11.547 --> 01:08:12.380
family

1064
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.414
who is that

1065
01:08:13.414 --> 01:08:16.080
Help mom in the store

1066
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.380
If I accomplish that thing

1067
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.347
can you give me shares

1068
01:08:19.347 --> 01:08:21.180
Even so, don't date her

1069
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.980
what bullshit are you talking about

1070
01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.414
He is your friend and your brother

1071
01:08:24.414 --> 01:08:25.914
But you just let him become a gangster?

1072
01:08:25.914 --> 01:08:30.414
But I started to want to do other things

1073
01:08:30.414 --> 01:08:33.047
Li Douxue, why are you here?
