﻿1
00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:17.124
Changed back

2
00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:19.661
Finally changed back...

3
00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:29.861
who are you

4
00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:34.024
Are you Ji Tong?

5
00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:36.694
The sword was clearly placed on my neck just now

6
00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:39.030
Represents now…

7
00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:40.949
jujube sword

8
00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:59.686
Liangjian will not be able to get the answer you want

9
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:01.580
I don't think so

10
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.752
The sword can dig out the true words of human beings the fastest

11
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:10.168
If you suspect that I am a lucky boy

12
00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:12.008
Please report me to the Robbery Hall

13
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.899
All I can say is this

14
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.852
If you can tell the truth because of a sword

15
00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:31.749
I might actually swing my sword to kill you

16
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.702
Why are you testing me?

17
00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:39.571
I won't go to the Robbery Hall to report you.

18
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.618
Join me

19
00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.799
Because we need the name Ji Tong

20
00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:47.149
Name?

21
00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:56.849
Hong Eun-jo

22
00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.105
where

23
00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.430
Hong Eun-jo

24
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.415
Right…

25
00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:04.861
Right?

26
00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:31.143
I'm on my way here

27
00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:33.921
Keep praying to come back to your body

28
00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:36.765
Even if you can never return to your own body, it doesn't matter

29
00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.686
I'm waiting for you to come

30
00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:48.999
I'm afraid if I move erratically

31
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.077
Will miss it like last time

32
00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:57.543
Are you injured?

33
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.586
No, I'm really fine

34
00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:07.211
Don't move yet

35
00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:09.965
I have no selfish motives at all

36
00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.636
Just checking to see if this is a dream

37
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.305
Wake up from this nightmare quickly

38
00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:29.196
Although I just said it now

39
00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:31.908
I'm scared every night

40
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.418
What to do if you can’t change it back from now on?

41
00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.099
Although there is nothing more terrifying than becoming a young widow overnight

42
00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:53.993
"Nice to meet you Hong Eun-jo"

43
00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:56.824
I'm afraid all the time

44
00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.005
Maybe I won’t be able to say this sentence until the end

45
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.536
Then

46
00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:09.186
Who is wielding the sword?

47
00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:13.061
Jitong rejected me at that time

48
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.758
She said she was different from what the rumors said

49
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.874
The death of Da Sijian was not caused by her

50
00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:30.224
Do you want to meet her in person?

51
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.774
If you tell the truth, he will definitely be worried.

52
00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.449
It's a robber

53
00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:38.706
Robber?

54
00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.309
The king is accompanied by bodyguards and warriors all day long

55
00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:42.767
Of course you won't meet

56
00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:44.959
But people like me who act alone

57
00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.609
Except for encountering wild beasts in the middle of the night

58
00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:48.274
You'll also encounter robbers like this

59
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:50.327
You shouldn't be so scared that you lose your mind, right?

60
00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:53.315
How can I meet a robber without changing my expression?

61
00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:58.581
I was also frightened the first time or two

62
00:04:59.262 --> 00:05:00.090
What's more

63
00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:06.196
It’s also a bit scary for a thief to encounter a robber…

64
00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.312
If we really want to say it, we are considered peers, right?

65
00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:12.884
Are you still in the mood to joke?

66
00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:16.315
是要你放心

67
00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:20.711
你真的没事吗

68
00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:22.715
Look

69
00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:24.681
Is the head on my neck okay?

70
00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:27.524
Even if I say "look" you can't see it

71
00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:29.996
My frightened and restless heart

72
00:05:30.974 --> 00:05:32.907
真是令人庆幸

73
00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.515
If I feel it, it means I'm not in my body

74
00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:43.119
I stand on my own feet

75
00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:44.621
speak with your own mouth

76
00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:48.646
See the world with your own eyes

77
00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:51.018
竟是如此欣喜之事

78
00:06:02.782 --> 00:06:05.284
Horseshoe prints continue all the way to the alley

79
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.981
catch up

80
00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:08.474
Yes

81
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.627
catch up

82
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:10.831
Yes Yes

83
00:06:15.034 --> 00:06:15.781
Sir

84
00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.034
I asked how the two of you could meet so quickly.

85
00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:23.859
该说是…

86
00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:27.131
我们正好碰到吗

87
00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:28.627
I sent the carrier pigeon behind your back

88
00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:29.281
what

89
00:06:29.562 --> 00:06:31.318
Experienced adults, this way

90
00:06:31.953 --> 00:06:33.637
The Yijin Mansion is about to catch up.

91
00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:34.652
so fast

92
00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:38.678
By the way, the soldiers from Yijin Mansion set up a formation to block the way.

93
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:39.768
Why is this?

94
00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.931
Why do you talk like you've seen it with your own eyes?

95
00:06:44.794 --> 00:06:48.971
Because he said it very vividly

96
00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:50.446
right

97
00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:54.249
The only people who can mobilize the Yijin Mansion are His Highness and Du Chengzhi.

98
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.715
However, it is impossible for His Highness to violate the agreement he made with me in the Gengwu Year.

99
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:01.790
Then it is Du Chengzhi

100
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.665
Why exactly

101
00:07:05.482 --> 00:07:06.206
jujube

102
00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:09.259
When have I not acted like myself lately?

103
00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:13.899
Punish the chief minister and save the people?

104
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.128
Do you think it is too abnormal to suddenly seek justice?

105
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:20.793
You wait here

106
00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:23.037
chat with me

107
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:27.762
The secret record you gave me before as a lucky boy

108
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.462
Did you find it at Du Chengzhi's home?

109
00:07:30.187 --> 00:07:33.253
No, I was among the items that the Chief Admonisher planned to burn.

110
00:07:33.278 --> 00:07:34.696
discovered by chance

111
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:37.334
Da Sijian tried to burn the secret records

112
00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:40.765
Now I finally understand

113
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.980
understand what

114
00:07:44.258 --> 00:07:45.055
portrait

115
00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.293
Why do you suddenly ask this?

116
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.649
I'll explain later

117
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.184
You must keep what you promised me

118
00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:56.915
Can't be caught by anyone but me

119
00:07:58.434 --> 00:07:59.718
Something happened, right?

120
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:00.540
answer me first

121
00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.030
I understand

122
00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:07.337
I'll tell you first, don't worry about me

123
00:08:08.274 --> 00:08:09.546
why do you say that

124
00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:10.758
jujube

125
00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:15.706
Yes sir

126
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.405
send her back

127
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.571
If you encounter robbers or other people on the road

128
00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:20.093
Teach him a lesson on my behalf

129
00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:29.674
Hello I'm here

130
00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:38.580
You seem to be in a hurry to go somewhere

131
00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:43.387
Only the Maharaja can I ask questions

132
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:44.893
then you are wrong

133
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:47.858
I'm interrogating you now

134
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.052
Interrogation of the Maharaja suspected of letting go of the thief Ji Tong

135
00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:52.012
Ji Tong?

136
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:54.368
It's not simple

137
00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:56.155
Have you finally found it?

138
00:08:57.842 --> 00:08:59.902
Do you admit the suspicion?

139
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:01.721
Is it necessary to hide it?

140
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:09.446
Take me to Yijin Mansion

141
00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:11.405
obey orders obey orders

142
00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:17.134
Now is not the time for you to come forward

143
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.920
I can understand that you are worried

144
00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:20.490
but there's nothing you can do

145
00:09:21.987 --> 00:09:24.590
He said there was no need for him to hide his suspicions

146
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.349
He must be trying to save the face of the royal family

147
00:09:29.966 --> 00:09:31.834
I almost felt ashamed of myself

148
00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:35.780
Scandals about the royal family uncovered by self-proclaimed scholar-bureaucrats

149
00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:39.537
He just let go a righteous thief who helped the people

150
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.162
It seemed that I had exhausted my use, so I quit now.

151
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.209
因为我实在不想支持这场斗争的任何一方

152
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.555
The Yijin Mansion is about to catch up.

153
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.855
Interrogation of the Maharaja suspected of letting go of the thief Ji Tong

154
00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:06.196
Take me to Yijin Mansion

155
00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:20.130
Didn't you hear some terrible bad news?

156
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.980
For example

157
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:25.855
Things like the prince being imprisoned in Yijin Mansion

158
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.974
i have nothing to say

159
00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:33.246
Why did you suddenly become so respectful?

160
00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:36.968
It seems you are finally afraid?

161
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:39.446
Afraid that I will tell everything

162
00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:42.187
I don't need to be afraid

163
00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:44.880
Even if you say it out

164
00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:47.918
I'm thinking about the timing

165
00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:50.068
See when to tell the most deadly

166
00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:54.227
He is the king of Korea

167
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.018
Why don't you remind me first?

168
00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:59.115
那么我就不会说出没有天子会出面解救沈清

169
00:10:59.337 --> 00:11:01.327
Such ridiculous advice

170
00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:05.162
It doesn't matter how much you want to mock me

171
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:07.530
I can bear it thousands of times

172
00:11:07.858 --> 00:11:11.334
But don't talk about that person casually

173
00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:16.515
Because he never did anything that would lead to ridicule

174
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.577
Is that really the case?

175
00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:31.718
Why don't you put away the worry on your face first?

176
00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:37.349
Don't expect that the other lady will save him.

177
00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:40.349
The emperor will soon fall into the abyss

178
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.783
I sent her back to the gate

179
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.027
how does she look

180
00:12:02.052 --> 00:12:03.424
Feeling quite scared

181
00:12:08.612 --> 00:12:12.493
But I was riding a horse in the middle of the night. Where was I supposed to go?

182
00:12:13.428 --> 00:12:14.949
Did you forget so quickly?

183
00:12:15.471 --> 00:12:18.084
You said you were going to rescue Hong Shi from Ren Zai Yi?

184
00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:19.380
Did I say that?

185
00:12:19.911 --> 00:12:21.799
Why are you so scary?

186
00:12:22.038 --> 00:12:23.104
Half of what you say lately is

187
00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:24.396
"Oh, did I say that?"

188
00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:25.827
"Ah, so I said that"

189
00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:27.015
These are the two sentences

190
00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:33.924
She could have been a heroine saved by Prince Charming

191
00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:35.827
As a result, I missed it

192
00:12:35.852 --> 00:12:37.227
what does that mean

193
00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:39.630
Sir

194
00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:42.876
Isn't this called memory loss? It's been withdrawn.

195
00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:46.164
jujube

196
00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:48.092
Have I been very kind to you lately?

197
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.724
In this case

198
00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:53.436
Do you still have a way to break the situation?

199
00:12:54.197 --> 00:12:55.333
Of course there is

200
00:12:56.002 --> 00:12:56.858
Beauty Trap

201
00:12:56.883 --> 00:12:58.283
No chance of winning

202
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:00.836
sorry

203
00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:03.248
I'm following orders and can't give you two too much time.

204
00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:06.028
Just say it was a mistake.

205
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.236
this is the only way

206
00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:11.005
Since the other party has resorted to extraordinary measures,

207
00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:14.029
Of course I have to come up with a decent counterattack, right?

208
00:13:19.323 --> 00:13:20.070
who?

209
00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:23.780
Has the Lord been imprisoned in the Yijin Mansion?

210
00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:27.586
The person who kidnapped the Maharaja happened to be you...

211
00:13:30.317 --> 00:13:31.117
Hailin

212
00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:32.973
The lady arrived…

213
00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:35.198
Go and report quickly

214
00:13:41.011 --> 00:13:44.692
My young lady wants to see Lord Daoyue.

215
00:13:44.717 --> 00:13:46.305
The Lord is being imprisoned

216
00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:48.136
Go back and tell your lady that you can't

217
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:51.044
We only see each other for a quarter of an hour at most

218
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:54.030
Oops, it takes a long time to wait now.

219
00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:55.895
Don't you count how much money you have?

220
00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:58.345
Experience adults

221
00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:01.397
Anyway, it will become your remaining money.

222
00:14:01.422 --> 00:14:02.558
Of course you have to charge more

223
00:14:03.012 --> 00:14:03.686
Right

224
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.797
Remember to split it in half

225
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:08.105
After all, it’s the price of two lives.

226
00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:10.692
Miss

227
00:14:22.364 --> 00:14:23.817
Since you have experience in Yijin Mansion

228
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.186
You must know more about your Majesty than I do.

229
00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:29.016
Who on earth caught the Maharaja and did such a thing...

230
00:14:29.964 --> 00:14:31.351
You don't need to think about it

231
00:14:31.624 --> 00:14:34.055
He must be an ignorant and wanton person.

232
00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:36.467
You've met that person several times

233
00:14:37.496 --> 00:14:38.789
Also watching now

234
00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:42.355
I just looked at it carefully again

235
00:14:45.307 --> 00:14:46.736
I happen to play the villain

236
00:14:49.268 --> 00:14:51.495
You were with the Maharaja last time in the palace.

237
00:14:51.818 --> 00:14:53.311
How close are you?

238
00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:57.145
If we talk about seniority in private,

239
00:14:57.405 --> 00:15:00.036
Your Highness is my cousin-in-law

240
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.273
Then I and Your Majesty are considered to be related by marriage.

241
00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:06.573
I'm not asking about genealogy, I'm asking about the distance between hearts.

242
00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:11.411
A lady from a famous family who has never even been on the verge of breaking the law

243
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:14.089
In order to meet the so-called brother-in-law

244
00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:16.423
Trying to bribe soldiers of the Yijin Prefecture

245
00:15:18.773 --> 00:15:20.158
This is an unexpected out-of-order behavior

246
00:15:21.078 --> 00:15:22.578
Or deep love?

247
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.717
Not like that

248
00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:30.876
Go back to the palace

249
00:15:31.338 --> 00:15:33.336
The Maharaja should have returned to the main hall.

250
00:15:36.463 --> 00:15:38.105
Although we are about to break off the engagement

251
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.103
But as your external fiancé

252
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.555
I still want to say something

253
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.042
I support your love

254
00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:48.614
enthusiastically

255
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:02.264
The emperor will soon fall into the abyss

256
00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:19.653
Oops Eunjo

257
00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:22.378
Why didn't you take a bite?

258
00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:27.164
Is there no one in the sarangcha now?

259
00:16:27.303 --> 00:16:29.748
Well, I went out early in the morning and no one is here now

260
00:16:30.774 --> 00:16:33.086
Then I also want to go out for a while

261
00:16:36.483 --> 00:16:39.517
Your Majesty wants me to tell you that there is no need to worry...

262
00:16:39.542 --> 00:16:40.658
Nonsense

263
00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:44.211
It's like a thieves in the market humiliating a scholar-bureaucrat with death

264
00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:47.023
Do you think the court officials and scholar-bureaucrats will give up?

265
00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:54.367
Your Majesty, please be aware of everything.

266
00:16:55.802 --> 00:16:58.426
我已经交代过了  要他们适度煽动就好

267
00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.811
The royal family sided with the thieves

268
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.948
This is something that has never happened before in the world

269
00:17:06.315 --> 00:17:07.901
Your Highness

270
00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:10.555
Isn’t that Dayi? Please be aware of everything.

271
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.145
It was my instigation

272
00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:14.249
Since we live on charity from our family

273
00:17:14.274 --> 00:17:15.770
You should pay for your meal

274
00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:17.580
Hurry up, please be aware of everything.

275
00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.605
The ministers are waiting in the main hall

276
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.570
Please be aware of everything

277
00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:38.211
Your Majesty

278
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.289
you look happy

279
00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.192
Is it because the prey you are targeting is right in front of you?

280
00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:52.358
Someone who would do such a thing to the Maharaja

281
00:17:53.135 --> 00:17:55.889
It's just you and His Highness, isn't it?

282
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:00.317
Why doesn't he doubt the Lord, but directly doubts me?

283
00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:01.945
All agree

284
00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:06.401
Your Highness will only restrain me but will not attack me.

285
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.246
The Bloody Year of Gengwu

286
00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.914
We two brothers made a vow

287
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.808
It was established with blood thicker than water

288
00:18:16.668 --> 00:18:17.992
you misunderstood

289
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:20.655
I have no reason to do this to you...

290
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.851
I probably know

291
00:18:23.132 --> 00:18:23.905
Reason

292
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.664
Threat, blackmail, obedience

293
00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:33.246
For a certain need, you handed over the secret records to Da Si Jian.

294
00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:35.358
But at that time

295
00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:39.439
The Maharaja picked up the document and presented it to His Highness

296
00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:43.408
It seems like you are deliberately trying to humiliate me.

297
00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.471
I was still guessing

298
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.983
Who is the owner of the huge amount of information and records in the secret book?

299
00:18:53.618 --> 00:18:54.824
Now it seems clear

300
00:18:58.269 --> 00:19:02.161
I don’t understand what you are talking about

301
00:19:04.623 --> 00:19:06.314
Of course, it's all just speculation up until now.

302
00:19:06.943 --> 00:19:08.349
But now it's a command

303
00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:11.124
from now on

304
00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:13.986
You are not allowed to interfere in cases related to Ji Tong anymore

305
00:19:17.002 --> 00:19:19.183
If so, can your Majesty also promise?

306
00:19:19.486 --> 00:19:24.305
From now on, I will no longer speculate about secret records.

307
00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:27.827
Transaction…

308
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:32.642
deal

309
00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:34.558
I accept the order

310
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.674
Right

311
00:19:42.711 --> 00:19:45.490
Teach your two sons good manners again.

312
00:19:46.047 --> 00:19:47.365
Like father, like son?

313
00:19:58.557 --> 00:20:00.100
Did everyone agree to arrest Yue'er?

314
00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:04.659
Are you arresting people without my permission?

315
00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:08.461
I heard it was an emergency early in the morning

316
00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:13.249
Isn’t this the loyalty of wanting to relieve His Majesty’s worries as soon as possible?

317
00:20:13.573 --> 00:20:15.845
It’s also a good opportunity to remove the thorn in the side.

318
00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:19.717
Your Highness, I have requested you to see me.

319
00:20:19.742 --> 00:20:21.864
Looks like he came with good news

320
00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.255
It seems like bad news

321
00:20:25.821 --> 00:20:28.020
Isn't this what it looks like to be scolded by my brother?

322
00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:32.792
The minister is frightened

323
00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:35.164
About Daoyue Dajun

324
00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:37.799
It seems that Yijin Mansion has some misunderstanding.

325
00:20:38.554 --> 00:20:41.780
Du Chengzhi, your loyalty is too much

326
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:45.071
You are not allowed to do unnecessary things without my order.

327
00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:49.249
Yes, Your Highness

328
00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:55.057
This medicine is getting better and better every day

329
00:20:55.676 --> 00:20:57.933
My body and mood feel much more relaxed than I have in a long time.

330
00:20:58.236 --> 00:21:01.111
I'm going to the palace for hunting. Ask the people below to prepare.

331
00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:03.805
Yes

332
00:21:16.201 --> 00:21:19.182
This step actually led to an army being defeated

333
00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:21.550
We two brothers made a vow

334
00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:24.422
There is no need to do anything like this in the future without my order.

335
00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:27.550
Brothers have at least half the same blood flowing through them

336
00:21:28.148 --> 00:21:29.744
I only know now

337
00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.519
I will find another status

338
00:21:31.544 --> 00:21:34.177
Next time, I must hit Lord Daoyue hard.

339
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:35.820
until the water becomes clear

340
00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:38.800
Now we need to stay put for now

341
00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:42.097
Until His Highness's blood

342
00:21:43.832 --> 00:21:46.550
Let’s talk about it when it’s completely owned by our family.

343
00:21:47.588 --> 00:21:48.891
Actually want to suspend the investigation?

344
00:21:51.326 --> 00:21:52.113
Wait

345
00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:54.997
What will happen if you arrest the Maharaja without permission?

346
00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:57.600
He will be held accountable for the crime of arresting the Maharaja without authorization.

347
00:21:59.823 --> 00:22:01.304
If it were me, I'd just kill him and silence him

348
00:22:01.344 --> 00:22:02.894
As it should be

349
00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.610
Observe the etiquette, you are the concubine

350
00:22:08.676 --> 00:22:09.607
Concubine

351
00:22:09.632 --> 00:22:11.044
I'm Kim Seung-baek

352
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.154
The next family will be able to benefit

353
00:22:13.683 --> 00:22:15.866
You are the second son of Du Chengzhi Ren Shiheng, right?

354
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.963
I will remember you who threatened my son

355
00:22:18.988 --> 00:22:20.791
And your father's name

356
00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.879
Your Majesty is heading to the place

357
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:53.844
Is there anything cool to see in my place?

358
00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:55.419
Your Majesty?

359
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.335
Messenger of the underworld?

360
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.626
what

361
00:22:58.678 --> 00:22:59.541
Yes

362
00:23:00.408 --> 00:23:02.169
Did Yi Jin Mansion let you out?

363
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:03.125
as you can see

364
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:05.457
so good

365
00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:08.191
are you passing by

366
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.797
That…

367
00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:12.935
I came to the place to have a look because I was worried about you.

368
00:23:18.793 --> 00:23:20.826
It seems that we have become a relationship where we worry about each other.

369
00:23:21.751 --> 00:23:23.618
It was me who overstepped the bounds

370
00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:24.932
I don't mean that

371
00:23:25.087 --> 00:23:26.525
Just a routine confirmation

372
00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:30.260
are you okay

373
00:23:30.336 --> 00:23:31.316
Doesn't it look bad?

374
00:23:31.968 --> 00:23:34.004
My handsome face cannot be damaged.

375
00:23:35.389 --> 00:23:36.900
you look so good

376
00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:40.154
Anyway, thank you for your concern

377
00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:56.439
Jinshang Palace

378
00:23:57.391 --> 00:23:59.958
Silently asking who that woman is

379
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.569
Yes

380
00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:09.094
This is the only way

381
00:24:09.354 --> 00:24:11.254
After all, that's my crime

382
00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:13.504
You look like you're about to surrender

383
00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:16.032
Yes, I want to tell you the truth...

384
00:24:19.944 --> 00:24:21.291
How can you be so impatient?

385
00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:25.360
Don't worry, this case won't be a problem

386
00:24:26.115 --> 00:24:27.341
Really?

387
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.538
It should be said that it is thanks to the status of the Maharaja.

388
00:24:29.563 --> 00:24:31.960
Is it worthy of my clever mind?

389
00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:36.800
That's right. I'm too impatient.

390
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.763
I've told you so many times, but you can't bear your temper

391
00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:39.550
Surrender immediately...

392
00:24:41.928 --> 00:24:44.382
You are a thief, but you came here to arrest the thief yourself?

393
00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:50.082
It's totally out of character for me to pretend not to know.

394
00:24:50.107 --> 00:24:51.779
Aren't you anxious because you're worried about me?

395
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:54.685
Absolutely not so

396
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.982
Think about it logically

397
00:24:56.007 --> 00:24:56.469
One…

398
00:24:57.786 --> 00:25:00.210
A little thief implicates the great king

399
00:25:00.235 --> 00:25:01.260
Do you want me to stand by and watch?

400
00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:04.672
Do you want me to punish you for being so weak?

401
00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:05.800
Me?

402
00:25:06.198 --> 00:25:09.600
How could a noble prince be whipped?

403
00:25:09.892 --> 00:25:12.547
I feel better if I take the punishment myself.

404
00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:15.451
My body relies on difficult physical training

405
00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:16.510
Trained with the martial arts of the royal family

406
00:25:17.847 --> 00:25:19.141
You should know very well

407
00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:21.625
Your Majesty

408
00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:35.141
even if not in jail

409
00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.669
You went to such a dangerous place

410
00:25:36.694 --> 00:25:38.572
We must quickly get rid of the impure air

411
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.535
Are you going to burn me too?

412
00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:44.297
Actually it's all my fault

413
00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:47.066
I didn't know that the Yijin government wanted to do harm to you

414
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.419
So I handed over all the paperwork.

415
00:25:49.555 --> 00:25:51.407
How could this be your fault

416
00:25:51.571 --> 00:25:52.900
It's my fault, the great king

417
00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:56.404
So you are so kind

418
00:25:59.345 --> 00:26:00.516
Jiang is an official

419
00:26:01.504 --> 00:26:04.878
I brought more mugwort

420
00:26:04.878 --> 00:26:05.612
give me

421
00:26:05.612 --> 00:26:06.813
That's enough. No need.

422
00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:08.482
You have even removed the non-existent impurity.

423
00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:11.752
Should we also remove all the impurities from the future?

424
00:26:11.777 --> 00:26:13.069
Okay, I don’t want it

425
00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:15.550
Thank you so much for your hard work, Dr. Hong.

426
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.807
By the way, I happen to have something to ask you.

427
00:26:18.832 --> 00:26:20.166
What is your relationship with Jitong?

428
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:23.244
what

429
00:26:23.627 --> 00:26:24.560
What's wrong

430
00:26:27.744 --> 00:26:29.729
It seems that the unclean air has not been purified yet

431
00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.769
Quickly light the fire

432
00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.538
You need to burn it a little more, right?

433
00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:35.170
Put it in the fire first...

434
00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:36.060
Fan yourself…

435
00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:41.585
Am I the only one who thinks the topic suddenly changed to ignition?

436
00:26:45.454 --> 00:26:46.657
Why do you ask this question?

437
00:26:47.945 --> 00:26:51.279
Because it was Dr. Hong who confirmed Ji Dong’s body last time.

438
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.682
I confirmed it at that time

439
00:26:58.896 --> 00:27:01.472
Ji Tong’s identity has not yet been determined

440
00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:02.607
Seems like someone you know

441
00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:05.700
No, completely strangers

442
00:27:06.474 --> 00:27:09.008
But when Gildong’s body was confirmed,

443
00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:10.907
Why do you act like the sky is falling?

444
00:27:12.895 --> 00:27:17.047
Do I...do that?

445
00:27:18.107 --> 00:27:19.694
Don't say unnecessary words

446
00:27:20.627 --> 00:27:23.954
I saw tears in her eyes and thought she knew Ji Tong

447
00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:25.194
watch your mouth

448
00:27:25.486 --> 00:27:27.352
I'm talking to Dr. Hong

449
00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:31.349
Is there any

450
00:27:31.374 --> 00:27:33.482
How could I do that?

451
00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:36.235
It's not tears, it's sweat

452
00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:37.182
Because she ran over

453
00:27:37.497 --> 00:27:38.447
So that's it

454
00:27:38.879 --> 00:27:40.087
Of course it will be hot when you run

455
00:27:40.112 --> 00:27:42.145
When your body is hot, you will sweat

456
00:27:42.882 --> 00:27:46.341
The two of them seemed to be saying what each other should say.

457
00:27:47.044 --> 00:27:51.888
I was a little emotional that day

458
00:27:51.913 --> 00:27:53.047
Because I'm just like other people

459
00:27:53.072 --> 00:27:55.919
Think Ji Dong is like his neighbor

460
00:27:55.944 --> 00:27:57.938
Like his own brother

461
00:27:57.963 --> 00:28:00.632
Yes, neighbors are almost like relatives.

462
00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:02.100
Yes

463
00:28:08.596 --> 00:28:11.663
Yes, after all, you have a kind nature

464
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:16.132
Sorry, I can't help

465
00:28:20.543 --> 00:28:22.777
I just got out of aiding an evader for letting a thief go.

466
00:28:22.812 --> 00:28:23.791
less than an hour

467
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:27.357
I was immediately charged with hiding a thief thanks to you.

468
00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:29.832
Sorry for making you an accomplice

469
00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:30.979
The reason why he doubts

470
00:28:31.007 --> 00:28:34.713
It was because my eyes were filled with tears when I caught the fake lucky boy

471
00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.604
If you really want to say it, this is your fault, Maharaja.

472
00:28:39.078 --> 00:28:40.629
Is it my fault?

473
00:28:41.157 --> 00:28:44.472
Also, I shouldn’t have let Ji Tong go at all.

474
00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:46.103
when we first met

475
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:48.944
I should take off Baiding's mask to confirm my appearance

476
00:28:51.011 --> 00:28:52.282
This way we can avoid these incidents

477
00:28:52.642 --> 00:28:54.750
I can also protect you from the beginning.

478
00:29:00.314 --> 00:29:03.203
Why did you suddenly take the topic so far?

479
00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.210
I'm bringing the topic back to the topic.

480
00:29:05.927 --> 00:29:08.227
What really needs to be said hasn’t even begun yet.

481
00:29:10.236 --> 00:29:10.960
come with me

482
00:29:13.562 --> 00:29:15.329
I always told you first

483
00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:17.788
I will do it more freely in the future

484
00:29:18.212 --> 00:29:20.385
Won't hesitate for a moment

485
00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:30.400
Do you want to go back to the capital?

486
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.808
It would be better to rest here for a day and then go back tomorrow.

487
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.869
I got a letter asking me to hurry up

488
00:29:34.894 --> 00:29:36.050
I'll come over again when I come back

489
00:29:39.647 --> 00:29:40.378
do you think

490
00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:42.610
Why did the two of us suddenly switch back?

491
00:29:43.752 --> 00:29:44.800
didn't you do something

492
00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:48.801
No...no

493
00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:49.735
What about you?

494
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:50.819
Me neither

495
00:29:55.378 --> 00:29:56.613
Could it be that again...

496
00:29:56.638 --> 00:29:58.766
After all, we didn't do anything special when we switched bodies.

497
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.016
Don't think too complicated. Just accept it.

498
00:30:01.077 --> 00:30:02.069
I'm working on it too

499
00:30:03.082 --> 00:30:05.203
Did something happen when you were in my face?

500
00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:07.250
If there's something that needs attention, say it now

501
00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:10.428
Although I made a small mistake due to unfamiliarity

502
00:30:10.566 --> 00:30:12.097
But he didn't cause any trouble

503
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.000
What about you?

504
00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:14.710
I have only one thing to say

505
00:30:20.578 --> 00:30:22.413
Isn't this a door latch?

506
00:30:24.686 --> 00:30:27.172
There are wild wolves in the hall

507
00:30:27.464 --> 00:30:28.475
Wild wolf?

508
00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:29.956
Not even a wild boar

509
00:30:30.226 --> 00:30:31.275
where does it appear

510
00:30:32.194 --> 00:30:34.344
It seems to come from Beiyue Mountain Valley

511
00:30:35.353 --> 00:30:38.066
Anyway, be sure to lock the door when sleeping

512
00:30:38.323 --> 00:30:39.487
After all, I lived in that body too

513
00:30:39.512 --> 00:30:41.247
I am reminding you because I have feelings

514
00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:43.594
thank you

515
00:30:45.188 --> 00:30:46.456
Sorry too

516
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:51.782
You were even arrested because of Ji Tong's case

517
00:30:52.724 --> 00:30:54.163
I feel so guilty

518
00:30:54.923 --> 00:30:56.697
I don't even dare to apologize to you

519
00:30:59.073 --> 00:31:00.463
I want to speak clearly

520
00:31:00.582 --> 00:31:01.991
The detailed incident is

521
00:31:02.063 --> 00:31:03.400
A thief is in the robber hall

522
00:31:03.501 --> 00:31:06.001
Getting involved with a prodigal son who has no ability to have fun all day long

523
00:31:06.026 --> 00:31:07.716
Only then will they become victims of political power.

524
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.481
Do you know why?

525
00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:11.299
Because that prodigal son is the king of a country

526
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.697
So you just complain about why you have anything to do with me

527
00:31:14.928 --> 00:31:16.760
caused this abominable situation

528
00:31:16.785 --> 00:31:18.400
Just curse as much as you want

529
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.828
Then let's go back to our lives

530
00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:28.941
That's all you have to say, right?

531
00:31:29.216 --> 00:31:30.269
Do you have anything else to say?

532
00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.089
no no

533
00:31:56.156 --> 00:31:58.135
What makes me most angry now is

534
00:31:58.484 --> 00:32:00.071
Because I'm not in my body

535
00:32:00.152 --> 00:32:02.531
Even if I have to drag you out of that damn place,

536
00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:03.685
Can't do it

537
00:32:05.827 --> 00:32:08.488
He said all kinds of things with my face

538
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:14.122
I must have gone through various things in my body.

539
00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:18.522
He must know

540
00:32:19.514 --> 00:32:20.613
Myself and me…

541
00:32:25.016 --> 00:32:26.525
I also know that this is common sense

542
00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:50.288
Don't do anything until it's over

543
00:32:52.358 --> 00:32:55.741
Our Lord Supervisor will not back down so easily

544
00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:58.719
It seems that Lord Daoyue has caught you.

545
00:33:04.226 --> 00:33:06.426
I will surrender obediently and wait for punishment

546
00:33:07.773 --> 00:33:10.238
You propose that we secretly track down Ji Dong ourselves?

547
00:33:10.603 --> 00:33:11.444
Isn't he dead?

548
00:33:12.105 --> 00:33:13.353
But the king is still alive

549
00:33:13.988 --> 00:33:17.300
I think the Maharaja has a deep relationship with the thief

550
00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:18.760
so

551
00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:20.816
So

552
00:33:22.387 --> 00:33:24.725
Your Excellency orders us to close Ji Tong's case

553
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.570
And it was your father who gave that order

554
00:33:27.955 --> 00:33:28.705
So

555
00:33:29.512 --> 00:33:30.361
"So"?

556
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.614
this case

557
00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:34.633
If we continue to pursue the investigation, one party will eventually be destroyed.

558
00:33:35.974 --> 00:33:37.514
It would be better if both sides were destroyed

559
00:33:38.647 --> 00:33:40.308
I heard his name is Ren Jiazaiyi

560
00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:45.775
I must deal with this arrogant son of Du Chengzhi severely.

561
00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.884
I'm not satisfied with everything about him, especially his eyes

562
00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:50.818
The way you look at me

563
00:33:51.224 --> 00:33:52.731
Shaking very violently

564
00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:56.193
The way he looks at me is so hot

565
00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:00.000
what are you talking about

566
00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:03.256
I will use this as an excuse to exile him immediately tomorrow

567
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.518
I will behead him for insulting the royal family.

568
00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:10.962
This way there won't be any future troubles, right?

569
00:34:11.261 --> 00:34:12.893
After all, political opponents must be eliminated

570
00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:13.850
Are you referring to him?

571
00:34:14.608 --> 00:34:19.212
Please don't get your hands dirty. I will take care of this myself.

572
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:20.799
what are you going to do

573
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.897
A door latch is not enough

574
00:34:23.336 --> 00:34:24.190
Door latch?

575
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:28.578
He must be poking his head towards the other hall like a wild wolf now

576
00:34:43.105 --> 00:34:45.772
There are wild wolves in the hall

577
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:51.969
What are you doing? Is it true?

578
00:34:58.396 --> 00:34:59.396
my god

579
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:10.050
I need to boil these medicinal materials for my mother to drink. Please give me more.

580
00:35:11.201 --> 00:35:13.325
Of course I will give more

581
00:35:15.002 --> 00:35:15.802
please get out of the way

582
00:35:15.827 --> 00:35:17.193
Come on...get out of my way

583
00:35:17.218 --> 00:35:17.997
go this way

584
00:35:18.022 --> 00:35:19.322
Get out of the way...

585
00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:21.414
Get out of the way

586
00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:23.139
Come on please get out of the way

587
00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:27.581
What happened to the Huimin Administration Bureau?

588
00:35:38.934 --> 00:35:39.765
Click on Uncle Bai

589
00:35:40.032 --> 00:35:40.786
Enzu

590
00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:43.602
Why are everyone wearing masks...

591
00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:45.293
Is it an epidemic?

592
00:35:45.318 --> 00:35:47.730
Yes, it seems that an epidemic has begun to spread outside the capital.

593
00:35:47.755 --> 00:35:51.070
Patients who pretend to be infected with the disease and insist on receiving treatment

594
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.830
Make a mess here

595
00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:54.139
I'm here to help too

596
00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:56.320
I need to seek permission from Mr. Titiao first.

597
00:35:56.345 --> 00:35:57.412
where is he

598
00:36:00.669 --> 00:36:02.339
A woman whose engagement was broken off

599
00:36:02.717 --> 00:36:05.955
Which family's son would treat her well?

600
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.247
You should have heard about Du Chengzhi’s second son

601
00:36:08.275 --> 00:36:10.208
这次拘捕了道月大君一事吧

602
00:36:11.158 --> 00:36:13.461
Who else could be responsible for this?

603
00:36:13.874 --> 00:36:15.155
It is the decree of Dudu

604
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:17.477
If His Highness changes his mind,

605
00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:20.233
He may be kicked out at any time just like in the Gengwu Year

606
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:23.888
Do you have to marry Hailin into such a dangerous family?

607
00:36:26.677 --> 00:36:28.077
I'll go back and deliver the news right away.

608
00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:35.151
brother

609
00:36:35.921 --> 00:36:37.387
Because the epidemic outside the capital is rampant

610
00:36:37.412 --> 00:36:39.073
The Huimin Administration Department is also very busy, right?

611
00:36:39.462 --> 00:36:40.883
I'll come along and help too

612
00:36:43.263 --> 00:36:44.548
Don't need your help

613
00:36:54.827 --> 00:36:57.167
Just as you thought, Gildong's body disappeared.

614
00:36:57.478 --> 00:36:58.926
Who is it...

615
00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:01.058
Actually…

616
00:37:02.573 --> 00:37:04.251
On the day when Ji Dong's body was buried

617
00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:06.683
Saw a suspicious person nearby

618
00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:07.586
What?

619
00:37:07.822 --> 00:37:08.667
i know

620
00:37:09.002 --> 00:37:09.902
I've seen it too

621
00:37:09.905 --> 00:37:10.645
What?  What?

622
00:37:12.047 --> 00:37:13.147
I mean what I just heard

623
00:37:13.255 --> 00:37:14.426
As vivid as if you saw it with your own eyes

624
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.158
Why are you reporting it now?

625
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.473
small fear

626
00:37:18.789 --> 00:37:20.167
When I was little I thought it was no big deal

627
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.561
Just ignore it

628
00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:22.951
I was already doubting

629
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.808
I didn't expect it to really happen

630
00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:30.976
Find a samurai with this scar

631
00:37:31.758 --> 00:37:33.106
If you find him, don't pursue him.

632
00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:34.506
Come back and report to me privately

633
00:37:38.901 --> 00:37:40.639
Are you going to find a fake lucky boy?

634
00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:41.276
Yeah

635
00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:43.755
I still need to know who is pretending to be so that I can feel at ease...

636
00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:46.614
What kind of fake lucky boy?

637
00:37:46.867 --> 00:37:48.776
Isn’t the real lucky boy Hong Shi?

638
00:37:49.727 --> 00:37:50.698
Hong Shi?

639
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.264
What ridiculous words is this?

640
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.067
she is a woman

641
00:37:55.223 --> 00:37:57.872
Is it justified for a woman to commit theft in North Korea?

642
00:37:57.872 --> 00:37:59.306
I'm very doubtful too

643
00:37:59.383 --> 00:38:02.170
Suspicious of the Maharaja who let the thief Ji Tong go

644
00:38:02.197 --> 00:38:05.839
When Hong Shi heard the name "Jitong", her face changed suddenly

645
00:38:05.864 --> 00:38:07.031
I thought she was just being careless and let her go.

646
00:38:07.056 --> 00:38:08.505
What is your relationship with Jitong?

647
00:38:09.772 --> 00:38:10.680
What?

648
00:38:10.947 --> 00:38:11.981
What's wrong

649
00:38:12.006 --> 00:38:13.906
Even if I see her face pale and restless

650
00:38:13.906 --> 00:38:14.865
I also think it’s too unreasonable

651
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:15.818
Let her go again

652
00:38:16.299 --> 00:38:17.151
But?

653
00:38:17.823 --> 00:38:20.198
Faced with my temptation, she didn’t ask why

654
00:38:20.223 --> 00:38:21.417
But first he became angry

655
00:38:21.442 --> 00:38:23.639
This makes me even more convinced

656
00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:29.480
You're not going to sue her, are you?

657
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.714
I uphold the spirit of being fair and abiding by the law

658
00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:34.337
Dazao, please think clearly

659
00:38:34.362 --> 00:38:35.543
If she is taken away

660
00:38:35.568 --> 00:38:37.246
As your master, I will definitely be taken away too.

661
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:38.739
Then you will lose your job

662
00:38:38.739 --> 00:38:40.539
Your parents will be furious

663
00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:42.590
My parents died when I was 10

664
00:38:43.153 --> 00:38:44.453
They will feel sorry for you in heaven

665
00:38:44.478 --> 00:38:46.078
I only ask you a question

666
00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:48.745
What do you and Hong Shi plan to do in the future?

667
00:38:50.836 --> 00:38:53.886
Since we are accomplices, we can only advance and retreat together.

668
00:38:53.911 --> 00:38:55.844
It seems that you are very happy to be her accomplice.

669
00:38:55.869 --> 00:38:56.969
Where are you happy?

670
00:38:57.012 --> 00:38:58.376
It's just unlucky that I got caught up in it, okay?

671
00:38:58.401 --> 00:39:00.073
It seems that you are entangled and feel very excited.

672
00:39:00.098 --> 00:39:00.948
Where is your heartbeat?

673
00:39:01.123 --> 00:39:02.720
She's so heavy that I'm almost exhausted

674
00:39:03.173 --> 00:39:05.039
if you die

675
00:39:05.078 --> 00:39:06.908
I'll lose my job

676
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.812
And my parents will feel sorry for me in heaven...

677
00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:13.158
Or should I handle it myself?

678
00:39:13.504 --> 00:39:14.933
Until then…

679
00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:17.978
Until then, I'll handle it myself...you

680
00:39:26.146 --> 00:39:27.946
i got the message

681
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:29.095
I can see you when I go to the Robbery Hall

682
00:39:33.895 --> 00:39:36.104
I've been waiting impatiently to be dealt with

683
00:39:36.263 --> 00:39:38.806
But there has been no order for the past few days, so I had to come in person.

684
00:39:38.864 --> 00:39:40.259
That's my father's order

685
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.006
sins of the father

686
00:39:42.925 --> 00:39:45.640
Therefore, the son should not be responsible for the disposal.

687
00:39:50.112 --> 00:39:52.045
I can't be mean enough to punish my son.

688
00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:54.852
So just keep living.

689
00:39:56.933 --> 00:39:58.809
If you tell me to continue living

690
00:39:58.834 --> 00:40:00.577
It sounds more humiliating than telling me to die.

691
00:40:00.637 --> 00:40:02.302
Then just live your life with a heart of shame.

692
00:40:07.262 --> 00:40:10.062
Hong Eun-jo is a married woman

693
00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:13.024
I think you don't seem to understand the situation

694
00:40:15.078 --> 00:40:16.012
Can't figure out what's going on

695
00:40:16.037 --> 00:40:18.712
In this farce, it was the woman who was ultimately stigmatized.

696
00:40:20.649 --> 00:40:22.274
She was teased by the royal family

697
00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:24.715
You will be despised by the world for the rest of your life

698
00:40:29.187 --> 00:40:31.402
Beside the old man at the Huangquan intersection

699
00:40:31.743 --> 00:40:33.377
Make her a bride

700
00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:35.005
This is your family's joke

701
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.859
Didn’t you already know that?

702
00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:38.940
So

703
00:40:39.614 --> 00:40:40.852
You must save it

704
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.609
This is water for boiling medicine for patients, right?

705
00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:01.849
yes

706
00:41:06.378 --> 00:41:07.878
Are you the new doctor girl?

707
00:41:08.688 --> 00:41:09.577
Ah…

708
00:41:11.412 --> 00:41:12.378
I am…

709
00:41:12.378 --> 00:41:13.531
Hailin girl

710
00:41:15.162 --> 00:41:17.274
Ah, it’s Miss Hailin

711
00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:18.537
Do you know who I am?

712
00:41:19.717 --> 00:41:22.237
Aren't you the sister of Mr. Titiao?

713
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.281
I seem to have seen you here several times

714
00:41:31.108 --> 00:41:33.018
Have we met in the palace before?

715
00:41:34.037 --> 00:41:37.137
You were obviously wearing the clothes of a palace maid at that time.

716
00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:38.249
Ah…

717
00:41:39.045 --> 00:41:40.140
that day

718
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:43.659
Because of some reasons…

719
00:41:44.815 --> 00:41:45.949
So that's it

720
00:41:47.545 --> 00:41:51.746
I mean, why are you wearing doctor's clothes?

721
00:41:52.797 --> 00:41:53.690
Ah…

722
00:41:54.962 --> 00:41:56.912
I also have some reasons

723
00:41:58.545 --> 00:42:01.856
It turns out that the person who broke off the engagement was Du Chengzhi’s second son

724
00:42:04.278 --> 00:42:06.309
If it is the concubine of an ancestor

725
00:42:06.777 --> 00:42:08.746
Aren't those the grandparents of Mr. Zai Yi?

726
00:42:09.846 --> 00:42:12.787
Anyway, the concubine will not be recorded in the family tree.

727
00:42:13.112 --> 00:42:15.845
I just married into their family as a caregiver.

728
00:42:19.212 --> 00:42:21.178
Maybe in the eyes of others

729
00:42:21.421 --> 00:42:23.459
The complaints of noble ladies are nothing but luxury

730
00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:26.188
But a woman’s marriage is really a difficult matter.

731
00:42:29.979 --> 00:42:32.637
Although everyone has their own difficulties

732
00:42:32.662 --> 00:42:34.940
But the essence should be the same

733
00:42:40.245 --> 00:42:41.312
How strange

734
00:42:41.381 --> 00:42:43.878
Although we met for the first time, we felt very cordial

735
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:46.156
Although you may not understand

736
00:42:47.969 --> 00:42:51.502
I probably understand more than you know

737
00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:53.983
What's even stranger is

738
00:42:54.065 --> 00:42:56.087
I always feel like we've known each other for a long time

739
00:42:57.062 --> 00:42:59.356
That might just be your feeling

740
00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:05.402
To be honest, I just recently broke off my engagement because of this

741
00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:07.859
I have been very sad after losing my best friend.

742
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:11.746
Don't be sad

743
00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:14.849
Sometimes greater misfortune can dispel previous bad luck

744
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:19.231
Do you want to be my best friend?

745
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.799
Hasn’t anyone arrived yet?

746
00:43:32.145 --> 00:43:32.915
what are you doing

747
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:35.106
You came so early today, Master

748
00:43:35.842 --> 00:43:38.565
Why do you call me Master

749
00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:43.287
I'm here to see Superintendent Hong Minzhi

750
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.124
My father is currently away in other counties and cities

751
00:43:46.597 --> 00:43:47.868
Will come back next year

752
00:43:48.178 --> 00:43:49.406
He will be back in a few days

753
00:43:49.508 --> 00:43:50.452
I'll come find him again then

754
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:53.406
That…

755
00:43:55.778 --> 00:43:56.643
who are you

756
00:43:56.924 --> 00:43:58.746
Why do you peek into other people's homes?

757
00:43:59.747 --> 00:44:00.443
"You"?

758
00:44:01.587 --> 00:44:03.859
Because of our past relationship, I will put it into practice.

759
00:44:04.178 --> 00:44:04.934
let go

760
00:44:08.108 --> 00:44:09.242
What are you doing?

761
00:44:10.445 --> 00:44:11.212
Enzu

762
00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:13.646
Go to the burglary hall and file a complaint. We have a thief in our house.

763
00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:14.643
What?

764
00:44:14.896 --> 00:44:17.463
This guy is spying on our house

765
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.293
"Guy"?

766
00:44:18.452 --> 00:44:21.027
Look, this expression shows a guilty conscience.

767
00:44:21.149 --> 00:44:23.183
I shouldn't be the one with that expression, right?

768
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.527
young master

769
00:44:26.868 --> 00:44:30.202
Is there anything worth stealing in our house? Let the thief explore the way first.

770
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:32.453
Gather all the belongings of our family

771
00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:34.902
It's no match for the fabric this grown-up is wearing.

772
00:44:38.992 --> 00:44:39.760
Really

773
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.583
I can tolerate this tone today

774
00:44:47.554 --> 00:44:48.436
sorry

775
00:44:48.681 --> 00:44:50.514
I heard that thieves are rampant in the capital.

776
00:44:50.539 --> 00:44:51.464
That's why I'm extra sensitive. Please forgive me.

777
00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:54.918
What's his name? Is he Ji Tong?

778
00:44:55.198 --> 00:44:58.108
Oh, you mean the thief?

779
00:44:59.487 --> 00:45:00.802
I'm very familiar with

780
00:45:03.078 --> 00:45:04.099
Forget it

781
00:45:04.162 --> 00:45:07.149
I heard that the majestic king of the country also sided with that thief.

782
00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:10.024
I don't know what's going on in his head...

783
00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:15.355
what to do

784
00:45:18.052 --> 00:45:20.752
I only know that I saved your life

785
00:45:27.597 --> 00:45:29.439
I told you before

786
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.627
My young master has a good personality

787
00:45:33.692 --> 00:45:35.005
He doesn't have a bad personality

788
00:45:35.436 --> 00:45:36.733
It's stupid

789
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:38.863
Do I look like a thief dressed like this?

790
00:45:39.912 --> 00:45:41.695
Then why are you spying on our house...

791
00:45:42.565 --> 00:45:44.976
No. What are you doing here?

792
00:45:45.984 --> 00:45:47.079
Could it be...

793
00:45:48.057 --> 00:45:49.654
Are you waiting for me?

794
00:45:55.245 --> 00:45:57.873
I'm troubled by your unexpected visit like this.

795
00:45:58.045 --> 00:45:59.857
I have a family

796
00:46:01.012 --> 00:46:01.720
you misunderstood

797
00:46:02.278 --> 00:46:03.598
I'm just passing by

798
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.923
I will also start a family

799
00:46:07.145 --> 00:46:09.582
It turns out you noticed a private house when you were passing by.

800
00:46:11.495 --> 00:46:13.461
Are those people okay?

801
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:16.501
Could it be that if you live with your enemy for a long time, you will really develop feelings for each other?

802
00:46:16.787 --> 00:46:18.492
I actually started to care about their life and death.

803
00:46:18.517 --> 00:46:19.464
Who are you talking about?

804
00:46:20.227 --> 00:46:21.279
Uncle valet?

805
00:46:22.643 --> 00:46:24.176
Or Uncle Shi San?

806
00:46:24.245 --> 00:46:25.001
None

807
00:46:26.539 --> 00:46:27.495
It's Uncle Lin's family

808
00:46:29.139 --> 00:46:30.723
You have such a good personality

809
00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.745
You actually care about the officers and soldiers of Yijin Prefecture who arrested you

810
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.042
How are you doing?

811
00:46:35.278 --> 00:46:37.151
This is the magnanimity that a great king should have

812
00:46:39.279 --> 00:46:40.223
what to do

813
00:46:40.248 --> 00:46:41.870
I can't help you convey it

814
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.820
Because I can't see him these days

815
00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:45.414
Really?

816
00:46:45.713 --> 00:46:48.311
If you really want to know, go see him today

817
00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:49.986
Who cares?

818
00:46:51.212 --> 00:46:53.145
I wish I could exile them all to an uninhabited island

819
00:46:53.145 --> 00:46:54.212
I just don't want to appear too mean.

820
00:46:54.212 --> 00:46:55.454
I finally endured it

821
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.704
Did you lock the door latch?

822
00:47:13.312 --> 00:47:15.412
The Shen family sent a divorce letter

823
00:47:15.437 --> 00:47:16.992
It's a good thing you did, right?

824
00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:22.570
Unwilling to serve as the family stallion with a humble body

825
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.048
I don’t want to rely on this shabby ambition

826
00:47:24.245 --> 00:47:28.373
The fame, fortune and wealth gained

827
00:47:28.718 --> 00:47:29.779
What can be done?

828
00:47:30.078 --> 00:47:33.311
I can only hold on to the skirt of my soft-hearted fiancée.

829
00:47:34.412 --> 00:47:36.104
After all

830
00:47:36.932 --> 00:47:39.845
That kind of blood just can't fulfill the duty of a human being.

831
00:47:41.114 --> 00:47:42.795
Since you have done something worse than a beast

832
00:47:44.088 --> 00:47:45.851
Just don't expect me to treat you as a human being.

833
00:47:50.346 --> 00:47:52.213
If this continues, someone will die.

834
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:54.412
Go and find the young master quickly. Hurry up.

835
00:47:54.412 --> 00:47:56.354
Hurry up...

836
00:47:58.067 --> 00:47:59.629
Auntie the proprietor Eunjo

837
00:47:59.654 --> 00:48:01.014
Where are you guys going?

838
00:48:01.307 --> 00:48:02.974
Something happened at the sarangchae

839
00:48:03.012 --> 00:48:04.278
Ah, young master

840
00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:05.478
I'm leaving first

841
00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:08.420
Please think of a solution quickly...

842
00:48:11.245 --> 00:48:12.401
what happened

843
00:48:12.802 --> 00:48:16.814
The master has been whipping the second young master all day long

844
00:48:19.821 --> 00:48:22.729
No one in the family can stop the master

845
00:48:25.287 --> 00:48:26.562
I'll go and persuade him

846
00:48:27.511 --> 00:48:28.844
Wait a minute...

847
00:48:42.978 --> 00:48:43.786
Get away

848
00:49:01.317 --> 00:49:04.145
Put Zai Yi in a warehouse and don't give her a drop of water.

849
00:49:34.827 --> 00:49:35.976
This is a decoction

850
00:49:38.691 --> 00:49:39.417
farewell

851
00:49:56.149 --> 00:49:57.370
Oops

852
00:50:01.293 --> 00:50:02.448
you can go out

853
00:50:07.827 --> 00:50:08.673
Oops

854
00:50:10.878 --> 00:50:12.098
are you okay

855
00:50:13.524 --> 00:50:14.832
Thanks to you

856
00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:18.201
This sentence should be to Eunjo...

857
00:50:20.578 --> 00:50:22.389
You should tell Mrs. Bietang

858
00:50:47.354 --> 00:50:50.867
Last night, she was cooking medicine all night long without telling the master.

859
00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:54.295
Today I also started decoction from early in the morning.

860
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:56.542
why

861
00:50:58.378 --> 00:50:59.232
Are you feeling well?

862
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:00.832
what are you doing

863
00:51:03.319 --> 00:51:06.542
If you get up and move around so soon, the wound will worsen.

864
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.007
Are you sympathizing with me?

865
00:51:17.927 --> 00:51:19.427
Why are your ideas so extreme?

866
00:51:19.452 --> 00:51:20.685
I'm just worried

867
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.420
Don't pity me and don't worry about me

868
00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.220
Do you think you are really my family?

869
00:51:25.316 --> 00:51:27.683
I'm not planning to play your family either.

870
00:51:27.712 --> 00:51:29.079
then why did you do this

871
00:51:29.104 --> 00:51:31.371
Anyone who is injured or sick

872
00:51:31.412 --> 00:51:33.229
should be taken care of

873
00:51:33.254 --> 00:51:34.645
no matter if i hate him

874
00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:43.386
If you don't want to drink the soup I boiled

875
00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:45.616
I'll ask the valet

876
00:51:48.035 --> 00:51:49.339
What a waste

877
00:52:01.647 --> 00:52:02.754
What do you want

878
00:52:03.149 --> 00:52:04.645
I just wanted to ask you

879
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.661
What's the problem

880
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:13.970
let go

881
00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:17.632
I told you to let go, didn't you hear me?

882
00:52:20.278 --> 00:52:21.514
I warn you

883
00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:24.047
Don't show kindness to this family

884
00:52:25.527 --> 00:52:27.014
While staying here

885
00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:30.270
Don't

886
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.298
Worry about me

887
00:52:33.745 --> 00:52:35.426
不要让我想对这个该死的家

888
00:52:37.499 --> 00:52:39.195
generate feelings

889
00:52:41.221 --> 00:52:42.395
What are you talking about?

890
00:52:54.785 --> 00:52:55.554
Enzu

891
00:52:56.284 --> 00:52:57.417
What happened?

892
00:53:00.421 --> 00:53:01.914
I accidentally spilled the soup

893
00:53:02.671 --> 00:53:04.289
I'm going to buy some medicinal materials again

894
00:53:07.212 --> 00:53:10.248
I believe that the Maharaja will protect the palace well

895
00:53:10.336 --> 00:53:11.703
We can set off with confidence

896
00:53:11.745 --> 00:53:13.773
I'll be back in about a month

897
00:53:15.118 --> 00:53:16.918
Let's go Let's go

898
00:53:31.478 --> 00:53:32.367
Wait

899
00:53:33.645 --> 00:53:36.232
Du Chengzhi and his eldest son should also go to the palace

900
00:53:36.412 --> 00:53:37.186
Then

901
00:53:37.669 --> 00:53:39.379
Only Hong Eun-jo and... were left in that family.

902
00:53:41.774 --> 00:53:44.492
I will meet the royal team at the palace gate

903
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.026
Don't you need me to go with you?

904
00:53:48.212 --> 00:53:50.812
You stay and deal with the things I asked you to do

905
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.064
Yes

906
00:53:55.622 --> 00:53:57.455
You seem to be going on a far journey

907
00:53:57.578 --> 00:53:58.251
Yeah

908
00:53:58.945 --> 00:54:00.764
I'm going to Wenyang Palace

909
00:54:01.145 --> 00:54:02.751
Be careful on the road

910
00:54:04.478 --> 00:54:05.364
Let's go

911
00:54:18.575 --> 00:54:19.717
Lord Superintendent

912
00:54:22.449 --> 00:54:24.249
why did you come

913
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.529
I received a letter from Eunjo

914
00:54:26.554 --> 00:54:27.689
Enzu?

915
00:54:28.862 --> 00:54:32.196
When we met yesterday, she didn't mention the letter to me either.

916
00:54:32.312 --> 00:54:34.123
It was delivered the day after the wedding.

917
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:36.198
She said there was something important. What was it?

918
00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:39.379
Was that letter really from Eun Jo?

919
00:54:39.958 --> 00:54:41.725
this is your punishment

920
00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:47.565
My grandfather passed away because you didn't keep your duty.

921
00:54:48.678 --> 00:54:50.812
You'd better accept it

922
00:54:55.478 --> 00:54:56.657
Then

923
00:54:57.578 --> 00:54:58.778
It's your father's fault

924
00:54:59.378 --> 00:55:01.278
I will reward you well

925
00:55:04.188 --> 00:55:05.076
How dare you catch me

926
00:55:05.778 --> 00:55:06.870
let go

927
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.873
I can take a beating

928
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:14.701
It doesn't matter if I get beaten a few more times.

929
00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:16.612
But if it concerns the Superintendent,

930
00:55:16.612 --> 00:55:18.726
Then I won't give in even a step.

931
00:55:19.078 --> 00:55:21.412
You woman must be crazy

932
00:55:49.028 --> 00:55:49.995
Your Majesty

933
00:55:50.312 --> 00:55:51.064
Ah

934
00:55:51.993 --> 00:55:53.654
Accidentally shot askew

935
00:55:54.449 --> 00:55:55.223
Missed

936
00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:58.523
Originally I wanted to target the back of the head.

937
00:56:05.788 --> 00:56:07.182
why do you do this to me

938
00:56:07.329 --> 00:56:08.329
stand up

939
00:56:09.042 --> 00:56:10.792
I won't cum this time

940
00:56:18.424 --> 00:56:19.273
enough

941
00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:22.976
Stop it

942
00:57:00.992 --> 00:57:03.173
I originally wanted to wait until you left this home before giving it to you.

943
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:05.623
But I changed my mind

944
00:57:06.314 --> 00:57:09.364
(when hands are put together)

945
00:57:09.945 --> 00:57:14.812
(The moment you longed for came true)

946
00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:20.404
(I'll call again)

947
00:57:21.045 --> 00:57:26.142
(What I miss, what I treasure)

948
00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:30.292
what is this

949
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:32.904
As early as the moment when the soul was changed back

950
00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:34.898
I should hand over this battle post

951
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.554
Caught in deep-rooted hereditary

952
00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:40.142
There is a huge gap between these two powerful enemies.

953
00:57:40.882 --> 00:57:42.787
This is my battle against the severe hardships that will come in the future

954
00:57:42.812 --> 00:57:44.089
the determination shown

955
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:47.586
I can also rescue you from this damn Du Chengzhi mansion.

956
00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:51.114
This is the only one and only one.

957
00:57:54.212 --> 00:57:55.501
i want to marry you

958
00:57:57.245 --> 00:58:00.604
This is my marriage proposal

959
00:58:02.845 --> 00:58:06.345
(The moment I see you again)

960
00:58:06.345 --> 00:58:10.878
(My heart is calling you)

961
00:58:11.712 --> 00:58:16.712
(We Again Again)

962
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:19.129
i am a widow

963
00:58:19.345 --> 00:58:20.036
i know

964
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.707
You are the king of this country

965
00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:22.607
i don't care

966
00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:25.817
People will scold me and ridicule me for being unruly.

967
00:58:26.173 --> 00:58:27.257
Whatever they say

968
00:58:32.245 --> 00:58:35.978
(You're my everything to me)

969
00:58:35.978 --> 00:58:39.107
(The moment I see you again)

970
00:58:39.132 --> 00:58:39.829
Let's go

971
00:58:53.122 --> 00:58:54.245
Don't hold that hand

972
00:59:09.299 --> 00:59:10.366
you can't go

973
00:59:11.412 --> 00:59:12.479
until death

974
00:59:14.354 --> 00:59:15.695
You can only stay at this home

975
00:59:24.645 --> 00:59:29.178
(Want to hug you Loving you)

976
00:59:29.178 --> 00:59:34.412
(I don’t want to let go for a moment)

977
00:59:34.412 --> 00:59:38.770
(Looking as dreamy as ever)

978
00:59:38.812 --> 00:59:43.012
(Even if time passes, will you stay with me?)

979
00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:48.345
(Come to me now Loving you)

980
00:59:48.345 --> 00:59:53.045
(Just take one step closer to me)

981
00:59:53.045 --> 00:59:58.212
(Every day is filled with us)

982
00:59:59.232 --> 01:00:03.032
(all seem to shine beautifully)

983
01:00:13.204 --> 01:00:14.557
The duel is not over yet

984
01:00:14.895 --> 01:00:15.707
Let's compete

985
01:00:15.836 --> 01:00:18.170
Forget about official rank and identity

986
01:00:18.212 --> 01:00:19.151
Put away the gift

987
01:00:19.176 --> 01:00:21.051
You chose the wrong opponent

988
01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:22.462
Lord Daoyue?

989
01:00:22.487 --> 01:00:24.142
Don't come to me again

990
01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:27.604
I don’t want me to hurt Eunjo too

991
01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:29.229
please help me

992
01:00:29.278 --> 01:00:30.145
what are you laughing at

993
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.824
why you keep laughing

994
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:32.554
No reason

995
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.189
I just want to continue laughing with you

996
01:00:34.241 --> 01:00:35.986
I want to laugh as much as I can today

997
01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:37.957
An order has been issued that patients here are to be shot

998
01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:39.945
and a total blockade

999
01:00:39.945 --> 01:00:41.323
I will never forget it in my life

1000
01:00:41.348 --> 01:00:42.636
this is my answer
