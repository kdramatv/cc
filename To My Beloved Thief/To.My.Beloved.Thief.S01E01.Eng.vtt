﻿1
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.068
At the moment when the clouds swallow the full moon

2
00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:11.081
Is that when he showed up?

3
00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:11.987
No

4
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.862
That's when he ransacked the warehouse

5
00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:18.425
So you really saw it with your own eyes?

6
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:20.806
Of course I saw it

7
00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:24.143
At the moment when the clouds spit out the moon

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.087
that person

9
00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.525
It's a white guy

10
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.915
It's Lin Juzheng's soul that has been resurrected

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.040
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.178
I heard he has a high nose bridge

13
00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:36.837
He can be called the most handsome man in North Korea

14
00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:37.975
over there

15
00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:41.378
Damn it, that's not even human.

16
00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:44.103
He is clearly a monster covered with hair.

17
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.504
Isn’t he a Taoist priest who lived to be a hundred years old?

18
00:00:53.418 --> 00:00:54.885
An old man who lived to be a hundred years old

19
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.182
Who has the strength to distribute thousands of stones of white rice throughout the capital?

20
00:00:58.207 --> 00:00:58.941
so

21
00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:01.932
Is that thief a handsome man?

22
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.553
Are you planning to rob the widow and get married?

23
00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:05.660
You are really... Don’t pay too much attention to a man’s appearance

24
00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:07.925
They say it's a hairy monster.

25
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.517
So powerful that it scares people to death

26
00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.970
You people are really

27
00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:14.628
I told you last night... Auntie

28
00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:18.344
I saw our righteous thief with my own eyes

29
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:20.381
He is Bai Ding

30
00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:25.210
Much better

31
00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:29.119
Wash your eyes with salt water for three days

32
00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:31.016
Rinse twice with warm water

33
00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:32.294
Eunjo thank you

34
00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:33.509
But uncle

35
00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.657
Did you know that eye diseases can cause blurry vision?

36
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:39.182
pig

37
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.773
That's right, chicken head

38
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:47.588
what is that

39
00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.922
Is it Chilong?

40
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.088
What a ghost

41
00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:54.042
It turns out to be a snakehead

42
00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.291
It's a chicken head

43
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.997
I originally thought that guy Shi San was just bragging.

44
00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:59.322
I didn’t expect that even my eyes were unreliable

45
00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:02.879
This is a medicinal material that helps improve jaundice syndrome

46
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.079
He must not have even seen the shadow of the righteous thief.

47
00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:09.176
Does it make sense that thieves still talk about justice?

48
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.253
do you really think so

49
00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:15.113
Corrupt officials fill their coffers by exploiting the people

50
00:02:15.713 --> 00:02:17.239
Strictly speaking, the property in the warehouse

51
00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:18.792
Originally belonged to the common people

52
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.861
So it's not so much shoplifting

53
00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.505
It's more like returning the property to its original owner, right?

54
00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.683
Isn't that true?

55
00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:29.758
Does Mr. Ti Tiao also support that thief?

56
00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:32.852
How could I support thieves?

57
00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:34.214
Just stating the facts

58
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.649
Rumors are always mixed in truth, right?

59
00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:42.474
So...is that name also fake?

60
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:44.586
name?

61
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.830
The people called that person "lucky boy"

62
00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:49.811
A companion on the road?

63
00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:51.983
Ji Tong for short?

64
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.431
Some people also say that it is "a lifeline for people on the streets."

65
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:58.192
What a headache

66
00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:01.167
Various rumors make the case confusing.

67
00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.277
I just... You just...

68
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.320
Did you say it was confusing?

69
00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:37.496
If the case is confusing, you should come to me.

70
00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.105
It's really mysterious. I heard the news and came here again.

71
00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.783
We meet again, Your Majesty.

72
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.189
long time no see

73
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.136
However

74
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.242
Tsunasa's laws have turned into a mess. What a big trouble.

75
00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.221
Please take a seat

76
00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:00.039
We're both busy, so we can skip the courtesy.

77
00:04:02.332 --> 00:04:03.483
No need to thank you

78
00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:07.327
I lend my wisdom and wisdom to you dull people.

79
00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:08.542
Not once or twice

80
00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:11.883
Every time I investigate a case, I’m grateful for your help.

81
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.742
I'm really grateful, little one

82
00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:19.689
The thief who stole thousands of stones and rice?

83
00:04:21.383 --> 00:04:23.227
Where are the victims? There are none.

84
00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.311
It seems that corrupt officials are afraid that their crimes will be exposed

85
00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:29.133
I don’t even dare to report to the police anymore.

86
00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:30.408
It’s not that I don’t dare, it’s that I didn’t report it

87
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.523
If it were me, I wouldn't repay it

88
00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:34.077
why

89
00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:36.958
Someone informed me the night before yesterday

90
00:04:36.983 --> 00:04:38.774
He said that he saw Ji Tong in the warehouse of Da Si Jian Mansion

91
00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.632
Yes, we have a servant in the house

92
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:43.008
Saw something suspicious

93
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.107
The warehouse was filled up so quickly?

94
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.497
Da Sijian looks shabby in appearance

95
00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:55.894
The fortune is very prosperous

96
00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:57.525
Not like that

97
00:04:57.552 --> 00:04:59.818
I guess I didn't find the stolen items.

98
00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:02.766
Yes everything is intact

99
00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:05.051
Go in and search Yes

100
00:05:14.903 --> 00:05:15.879
Found it

101
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.497
Looks like a gourd bowl filled with rice

102
00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.197
Was this painting left by Ji Tong?

103
00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:28.407
Exactly

104
00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:34.863
Could it be...

105
00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:37.775
Quickly measure the weight

106
00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:45.397
How much less

107
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.782
Pour a bag of rice in

108
00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.300
The rice vat should be full

109
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:50.704
This is exactly three buckets short

110
00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.732
So what did Ji Dong really steal?

111
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.054
Only these three buckets of rice

112
00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:57.004
Because of this

113
00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:59.766
Most people don’t realize the theft until a long time later

114
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:01.891
Even if you notice it, there aren’t many of them.

115
00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:03.316
Naturally, I am too lazy to report it to the official.

116
00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:07.522
Have any people claimed to have received things from Jitong?

117
00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:09.774
Actually not even one

118
00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:13.851
He's just a self-obsessed little thief.

119
00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.545
People don't even know this

120
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.670
There are rumors everywhere that he is a righteous thief

121
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:22.763
Such a painting

122
00:06:23.607 --> 00:06:25.029
Are there any others?

123
00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:29.057
Why did he have to keep these paintings?

124
00:06:29.218 --> 00:06:30.844
If you don’t leave the painting, no one will know about it.

125
00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.063
That's right

126
00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:34.772
Not making fun of anyone

127
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:36.179
What else could it be?

128
00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:38.897
Because this person regards stealing as a way to show off.

129
00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:40.041
Human beings originally

130
00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.699
They are animals that gain attention by showing off their abilities.

131
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.506
Just like every time you solve a case

132
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.426
Just call all the maids in the palace to show off?

133
00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:54.813
So this person is also a guy who desperately craves attention?

134
00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:56.310
Are you asking a question or accusing me?

135
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.666
I don't dare. I'm just asking.

136
00:06:58.691 --> 00:06:59.894
You are forbidden to ask questions

137
00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:03.904
I understand why you spread out these paintings.

138
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.207
Ji Tong this person

139
00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:12.075
He wanted to spread the news about his theft.

140
00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:17.078
Nowadays, there are still rumors that he is a righteous thief and a big thief.

141
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.437
He must be quite proud now

142
00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.095
Who do you think these rumors came from?

143
00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:24.292
Could it be...

144
00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:25.738
It's Ji Tong

145
00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.401
Immediately arrest those spreading rumors

146
00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:32.838
Those lies justified his theft

147
00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:34.438
Therefore there must be criminals among them

148
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:35.445
Yes

149
00:07:37.803 --> 00:07:38.938
That...sir

150
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.103
You declare the time today

151
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.585
Don’t you want to have tea with the concubine?

152
00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:44.907
Why are you saying it now?

153
00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:46.142
Didn't you just forbid me from asking questions...

154
00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:48.620
Can't you even tell the difference between "don't ask" and "don't tell"?

155
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:10.079
wake up

156
00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:11.557
wake up quickly

157
00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.317
Wake up quickly

158
00:08:15.984 --> 00:08:17.312
Sir, are you back?

159
00:08:17.337 --> 00:08:18.738
Not who you thought he was

160
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:19.795
what

161
00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:22.354
Concubine

162
00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:25.673
Does it have to be you?

163
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.923
Can't you just pretend to be presentable?

164
00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:30.848
Let me think that when I come to the appointment with the king,

165
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.763
"Our lovely Maharaja took a nap soundly."

166
00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:36.573
Let me turn around and leave and come back later

167
00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:39.292
This is why you stay here

168
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:41.731
My dear, please have mercy...

169
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.026
The Lord is staring at the Maharaja eagerly.

170
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.334
How can you people protect the king?

171
00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:58.010
Send a message to my brother

172
00:08:58.035 --> 00:08:59.654
We need to discuss marriage for Yue'er as soon as possible

173
00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:00.660
Yes

174
00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:29.804
Are they planning to let Yue'er marry Da Sijian's daughter?

175
00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:31.660
This is also a happy event

176
00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:33.198
In this way

177
00:09:33.362 --> 00:09:36.570
Will Da Si Jian protect Lord Daoyue?

178
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:40.101
Are you afraid that someone will swallow the king?

179
00:09:40.356 --> 00:09:41.573
The concubine is also true

180
00:09:41.598 --> 00:09:44.526
This is all my fault for failing to win my stepmother's trust.

181
00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:46.076
I am unethical

182
00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:48.798
Your Highness is serious

183
00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:53.851
Du Chengzhi, how should I appease my stepmother?

184
00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.739
Lord Daoyue's marriage

185
00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:01.682
I have already found a family

186
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.045
This is a family that once served as a marshal during the Goryeo Dynasty.

187
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.507
Just do whatever you want

188
00:10:06.703 --> 00:10:09.203
That's my brother's marriage. You need to worry more.

189
00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:21.670
A family of military officers in the Goryeo Dynasty

190
00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:23.045
what are you doing now

191
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.398
I'm afraid I'm growing rice in the mountains and forests.

192
00:10:27.996 --> 00:10:29.896
You are really like a cunning fox

193
00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:32.632
If I were a fox, then who are you?

194
00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:38.285
Of course I am a nine-tailed fox

195
00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:53.923
Empress of the Middle Temple

196
00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:01.051
I heard that my niece is engaged to Du Chengzhi’s son?

197
00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:02.232
Yes

198
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.624
Want to use marriage to strengthen the Ren family?

199
00:11:06.683 --> 00:11:09.971
Everyone knows that plan, but no one can stop it

200
00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:11.880
It's so heartbreaking

201
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:14.431
golden green

202
00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:22.015
Your Highness, the little girl is shy

203
00:11:23.464 --> 00:11:28.698
I have repeatedly made my empress sad, and I am truly frightened.

204
00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:31.118
Please don't worry, Madam

205
00:11:31.856 --> 00:11:33.212
Empress’ niece

206
00:11:33.237 --> 00:11:36.890
Dogs will treat each other with sincerity

207
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.568
Is this kind of thing worthy of being called a spring painting?

208
00:12:04.727 --> 00:12:05.893
Too bland

209
00:12:58.946 --> 00:12:59.577
What a coincidence

210
00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:01.627
It seems we are destined

211
00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:03.434
what

212
00:13:06.183 --> 00:13:08.330
I didn't expect to meet my fiancée here

213
00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:13.377
Could it be that the young master is...

214
00:13:13.403 --> 00:13:15.605
My father is the emperor of the current dynasty

215
00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.121
say hello

216
00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:19.984
She is my future wife

217
00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:22.846
Nice to meet you. My name is Lu Yi.

218
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:25.165
This is my future concubine, Mrs.

219
00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:27.743
No. Maybe it’s already settled?

220
00:13:28.796 --> 00:13:32.365
Judging from the order of undressing, I am the main wife.

221
00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:34.755
But it’s okay to leave it to the lady.

222
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.177
It makes me happy that my wife and my concubines are getting along well with each other.

223
00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:42.980
Since we met by chance, how about the three of us have a drink together?

224
00:13:43.127 --> 00:13:44.127
Anyway, we will be a family soon.

225
00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:45.599
What a good idea

226
00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:49.445
Brother is still waiting for me

227
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.984
I'm going to say goodbye first

228
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.148
Why don't you just get married without making the pretty lady cry?

229
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.002
Marriage is a gamble

230
00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:08.387
What I want is to double the profit. How can I say this?

231
00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:10.496
This country has gone from king to slave

232
00:14:10.803 --> 00:14:14.596
Everyone relies on marriage to buy wealth, fame and power

233
00:14:15.107 --> 00:14:16.615
Seek more benefits for yourself

234
00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:18.837
Then of course I have to find a bigger bet.

235
00:14:19.612 --> 00:14:21.345
She is the niece of the Empress of the Middle Temple

236
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.974
Is there any bigger bet than this?

237
00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:25.562
For example…

238
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.202
Admiration?

239
00:14:30.798 --> 00:14:32.446
The young master is also very old-fashioned.

240
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.237
The children of high-ranking officials are all the same

241
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.105
I'm just trying to look like the same old person.

242
00:14:39.923 --> 00:14:41.859
I can't live up to expectations

243
00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:48.359
wish you good health

244
00:14:49.604 --> 00:14:50.427
uncle

245
00:14:50.978 --> 00:14:52.680
I came to get the medicinal materials I asked you for before

246
00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:54.005
Okay, wait for me

247
00:15:10.663 --> 00:15:12.430
I'm back, Master

248
00:15:15.074 --> 00:15:15.868
Stop

249
00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:16.902
What's the matter?

250
00:15:18.214 --> 00:15:20.778
Didn't I tell you not to wear medical clothes that smell like patients?

251
00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:23.134
Are you in and out of the house?

252
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.093
I was going to change my clothes and come back

253
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.152
But the Huimin Office is really busy today

254
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.537
I'm just going to make some money and dare to act like a big name.

255
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.577
I'm just a slave of this family

256
00:15:33.602 --> 00:15:35.180
So what? So what?

257
00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:37.015
Is it reasonable for a slave to act like a celebrity?

258
00:15:39.108 --> 00:15:39.908
Of course it's unreasonable

259
00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:41.096
That's right

260
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.849
That's right

261
00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:46.177
Why are you causing trouble for me? You're so mean.

262
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.618
How dare you talk back to me

263
00:15:57.503 --> 00:15:58.624
Where did the people go?

264
00:15:59.974 --> 00:16:00.887
Mother

265
00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:24.552
When did you come back?

266
00:16:24.803 --> 00:16:25.902
not long ago

267
00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:28.827
You must be very tired. Give it to me.

268
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:32.559
Look at this

269
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:35.143
Master, these socks are so dirty

270
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.437
Could it be that he was trying to meet a woman in the dead of night, right?

271
00:16:39.637 --> 00:16:42.603
How could you say such shameful things to an unmarried man?

272
00:16:44.143 --> 00:16:46.012
I will be responsible for drying the clothes

273
00:16:46.328 --> 00:16:47.921
Just go back to your room, drink medicine and rest.

274
00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:49.896
Let's wash it together and then go home.

275
00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:52.921
The medicine should be drunk while it is hot

276
00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:54.005
Go back quickly

277
00:17:06.937 --> 00:17:08.699
Eunjo, please go inside.

278
00:17:12.749 --> 00:17:14.683
Please tell me, Lord Superintendent

279
00:17:16.074 --> 00:17:17.077
at home

280
00:17:17.648 --> 00:17:19.409
It doesn't matter if you call me daddy

281
00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.243
How dare I, a wicked daughter, match your father and daughter?

282
00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.627
Being overheard by others can damage the reputation of the Chief Superintendent.

283
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.102
What is this?

284
00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:39.146
You go to Pingyan later

285
00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:41.355
Just wear these clothes.

286
00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:45.390
Where did you get the money to buy these silk and satin clothes?

287
00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:46.955
No, not to mention...

288
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:51.068
Why do you need to wear silk clothes when you go to the Imperial Palace?

289
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.534
You should also know

290
00:17:53.983 --> 00:17:55.974
The eldest son of that family did not take a concubine

291
00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:01.109
There should be a wedding soon

292
00:18:04.703 --> 00:18:06.855
Forgive me for being bold. Please take back your life.

293
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.824
I want to stay in this home forever

294
00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:11.162
Serving Mother and the Superintendent

295
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.780
Silly boy

296
00:18:13.943 --> 00:18:17.040
Which father wants his daughter to be alone all her life?

297
00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:20.562
You should also live the life of a decent woman

298
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:23.640
I never intended to live my life as a woman

299
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:33.224
You have suffered enough in this family

300
00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:35.174
It's enough

301
00:18:40.337 --> 00:18:41.871
Although you are a naughty girl

302
00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:44.668
I still hope you will be treated well by that family

303
00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:45.837
I just gave you these

304
00:18:46.612 --> 00:18:48.145
Just accept it and wear it

305
00:19:03.384 --> 00:19:05.909
I want to hold the officer responsible for the robbery

306
00:19:08.624 --> 00:19:09.971
Then let’s go after the idle king first.

307
00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:13.202
Let's think it's the amusement park's fault

308
00:19:14.983 --> 00:19:17.255
All this is for the sake of public security in the capital.

309
00:19:18.137 --> 00:19:20.884
It’s for the sake of the common people and the mother-in-law.

310
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.080
No need to say much

311
00:19:23.044 --> 00:19:24.484
Don’t live for me in the future

312
00:19:24.737 --> 00:19:26.327
It's time for you to settle down with a woman

313
00:19:30.787 --> 00:19:32.662
Why don't you marry Da Sijian's daughter?

314
00:19:33.065 --> 00:19:35.259
That family will be helpful to you.

315
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:46.668
obey

316
00:19:48.923 --> 00:19:49.905
Do you really want to marry this person?

317
00:19:51.044 --> 00:19:53.344
But I have to pick up the eight-character post in person.

318
00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:55.484
What's her temperament like?

319
00:19:55.509 --> 00:19:56.640
How's your bearing?

320
00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:57.640
What's more important

321
00:19:58.609 --> 00:19:59.824
I want to see with my own eyes if she is beautiful

322
00:19:59.849 --> 00:20:00.727
presumptuous

323
00:20:01.165 --> 00:20:02.355
This is not etiquette

324
00:20:02.863 --> 00:20:04.265
It seems that Ji Dong is here for this

325
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.417
Then he went to loot the warehouse in Da Si Jian's house.

326
00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:11.390
Do you think there is a chance now?

327
00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:13.187
Have you caught the thief named "Jitong"?

328
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.939
I heard that he ransacked your mansion's warehouse

329
00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:16.702
I'm investigating closely

330
00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:19.202
Your Majesty, you are so troubled

331
00:20:19.228 --> 00:20:20.767
I feel relieved

332
00:20:25.418 --> 00:20:26.751
A sudden visit from an adult

333
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:29.045
I can only prepare some simple meals

334
00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:32.366
Only today did I realize that the royal family’s refreshments are so simple.

335
00:20:34.137 --> 00:20:36.739
I took a general look at the warehouse

336
00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:39.198
But the real thing to see…

337
00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:41.317
Only saw it now

338
00:20:45.813 --> 00:20:47.327
she is my daughter

339
00:20:48.408 --> 00:20:49.495
Say hello to your lord quickly

340
00:20:49.745 --> 00:20:51.198
This is Lord Daoyue

341
00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:53.686
The little girl’s surname is “Jin” and her first name is “Zhen”

342
00:20:53.803 --> 00:20:55.136
Does the word "true" mean something beautiful?

343
00:20:55.403 --> 00:20:56.152
yes

344
00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.714
My name is Li Yue, which means "joy"

345
00:20:58.902 --> 00:20:59.807
It seems that the two of us

346
00:20:59.907 --> 00:21:01.786
They are all worthy of their names

347
00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:22.395
Let’s go hunting together at the hunting ground some other time.

348
00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:25.033
I'm spoiled and I hate cruel things the most.

349
00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:27.633
Beating and killing, blood splattered all over the body

350
00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:29.220
Not pretty at all

351
00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:33.102
do you like hunting

352
00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:37.345
How can a woman like to see blood?

353
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.164
Bad

354
00:21:38.821 --> 00:21:40.877
If you want to be a lady of the house, you must know these things.

355
00:21:41.517 --> 00:21:44.105
Competition and calculation are the basic equipment of the royal family.

356
00:21:45.228 --> 00:21:46.198
Your Majesty

357
00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:47.598
Is it necessary to act stupid?

358
00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:48.998
It will only embarrass each other

359
00:21:52.197 --> 00:21:54.145
If you give birth to a great king in the future

360
00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:56.467
It will threaten the throne of the Crown Prince

361
00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:58.530
One day in the future it may be discovered that he was poisoned to death

362
00:21:58.555 --> 00:22:00.717
Or a murder disguised as a suicide

363
00:22:01.907 --> 00:22:03.490
I think you should have known this for a long time

364
00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:06.149
You may also be accused of treason...

365
00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:07.177
What you said

366
00:22:07.551 --> 00:22:09.192
Already overstepped

367
00:22:09.217 --> 00:22:10.992
And after that bloody storm, unfortunately...

368
00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:14.511
I became the foundation of the country and you became the middle temple

369
00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:16.852
You can't escape the end of being crippled either.

370
00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:20.383
Why do you say that?

371
00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:23.167
Although your family is rich

372
00:22:23.537 --> 00:22:24.855
But not a powerful house

373
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.530
I'm afraid it's a bit difficult to hold the nave.

374
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.339
Then, Your Majesty...

375
00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:32.198
A king cannot be a husband

376
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.064
The woman he wants to protect is not his own

377
00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:37.530
But that throne

378
00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:40.792
Your father should know best

379
00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:44.290
After all, he was the one who personally deposed His Highness and his mother.

380
00:22:51.252 --> 00:22:53.285
Why don't you marry Da Sijian's daughter?

381
00:22:55.725 --> 00:22:56.708
brother

382
00:22:58.992 --> 00:23:01.933
Didn't this kid tell me not to call me brother?

383
00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:03.348
I obey the prince's residence.

384
00:23:04.203 --> 00:23:05.095
But

385
00:23:05.162 --> 00:23:07.962
Why can't I call you brother?

386
00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:13.930
Because the Queen Mother is not my mother

387
00:23:15.403 --> 00:23:17.827
The abandoned concubine who was kicked out of the palace due to political struggles

388
00:23:18.388 --> 00:23:19.789
She is my biological mother

389
00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:23.636
Yue'er, do you know what this means?

390
00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:27.986
It means you and I are enemies

391
00:23:32.668 --> 00:23:33.620
So Yue'er

392
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.995
Don't let the world discover your cleverness

393
00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:38.986
Don't appear in front of me

394
00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:40.783
don't do anything

395
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.510
If you don't want to lose your mother like me

396
00:23:49.073 --> 00:23:50.473
Although I couldn't keep my mother

397
00:23:51.332 --> 00:23:53.677
But you have to protect the mother you left behind

398
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:01.180
For me, getting married

399
00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:02.989
like a mouse hole

400
00:24:03.726 --> 00:24:05.093
Do you mean to hide?

401
00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:08.473
Try not to draw attention to yourself as much as possible

402
00:24:09.462 --> 00:24:10.314
compared to this

403
00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:12.370
It is best not to be seen by the concubine today...

404
00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:15.983
will she kill me

405
00:24:16.392 --> 00:24:17.263
Will she kill me?

406
00:24:22.362 --> 00:24:23.323
OMG

407
00:24:23.908 --> 00:24:24.564
Sir

408
00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:27.560
A little fear...

409
00:24:27.937 --> 00:24:29.342
am i already dead

410
00:24:31.765 --> 00:24:33.511
This smells like hell

411
00:24:35.123 --> 00:24:37.689
Why is there a hole in Dazao?

412
00:24:37.908 --> 00:24:38.945
Is it for ventilation?

413
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.930
Because it's just a piece of shit

414
00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:43.102
What?

415
00:24:43.574 --> 00:24:44.527
This is the only piece of clothing I can borrow

416
00:24:44.552 --> 00:24:45.767
Came out in a hurry without bringing any silver.

417
00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:50.217
I can't leave here like this

418
00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:52.720
If I'm allowed to wear this rag for more than an hour

419
00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.164
I want your life

420
00:24:57.271 --> 00:24:59.037
The little one will go back to the palace right away

421
00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:24.255
Are you coming to see my grandfather?

422
00:25:25.036 --> 00:25:25.805
Yes

423
00:25:26.993 --> 00:25:28.859
Ever since you started taking care of your grandfather

424
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:31.586
His bedsores have reduced and his complexion has improved.

425
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:33.411
That's why my father likes you so much

426
00:25:34.267 --> 00:25:36.317
It was the same when I was in the Huimin Administration Bureau

427
00:25:36.342 --> 00:25:37.792
Been doing these things all the time

428
00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:41.762
Let’s pay a little more than the original salary.

429
00:25:41.787 --> 00:25:42.414
obey

430
00:25:45.227 --> 00:25:46.489
That...sir

431
00:25:50.848 --> 00:25:53.158
About marriage…

432
00:25:55.459 --> 00:25:56.236
one

433
00:25:57.344 --> 00:25:58.092
one

434
00:25:59.546 --> 00:26:00.329
one

435
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.639
one

436
00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.899
Which pariah dares to be so rude?

437
00:26:21.227 --> 00:26:23.592
How does this face look like a pariah?

438
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:26.570
Even if you are splashed with dirty water, you still exude nobility

439
00:26:27.213 --> 00:26:29.320
Wearing tattered clothes but still handsome

440
00:26:29.348 --> 00:26:31.748
It's the first time I've seen this kind of guy who deserves a beating.

441
00:26:32.443 --> 00:26:34.430
You've been calling me guy since just now

442
00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:35.939
You stinky guy

443
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.186
Do you want me to teach you a lesson before you can recognize me?

444
00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:46.770
I think you are really crazy, right?

445
00:26:46.832 --> 00:26:49.349
Go to the Robbery Hall. I will punish you with regular crimes.

446
00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:51.609
Oh, that madman

447
00:26:51.637 --> 00:26:53.408
At least I'll be beaten with a hundred sticks.

448
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:54.603
The crazy servant

449
00:26:54.603 --> 00:26:56.537
If you show off your bravery, you will have no choice but to die.

450
00:26:57.774 --> 00:26:58.907
come with me

451
00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:06.820
Let me go, I'll go ahead

452
00:27:07.311 --> 00:27:09.595
The Robbery Hall is a place I often go to.

453
00:27:10.137 --> 00:27:11.305
I'd be happy to show you the way

454
00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:15.561
It seems that you will not wake up until you die.

455
00:27:39.536 --> 00:27:40.320
Where are the people?

456
00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:43.811
who are you?

457
00:27:47.696 --> 00:27:48.467
young master

458
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.213
How can you use those precious hands of yours like this?

459
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.442
Isn't this person just a slave?

460
00:27:53.467 --> 00:27:54.167
Servant?

461
00:27:55.908 --> 00:27:57.214
It's not your turn to show up here

462
00:28:00.123 --> 00:28:02.795
That's right. This is not something a lady should do.

463
00:28:03.261 --> 00:28:06.194
This person seems not very clear, so he makes mistakes

464
00:28:06.311 --> 00:28:08.211
Please show me your magnanimity as a gentleman.

465
00:28:09.665 --> 00:28:13.077
A gentleman's magnanimity is not wasted on a slave like this.

466
00:28:15.012 --> 00:28:18.664
The slaves plowed the fields and harvested rice

467
00:28:18.978 --> 00:28:21.149
How can you wear such good clothes?

468
00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:24.352
He's tall and strong, and he looks good, right?

469
00:28:24.377 --> 00:28:25.548
That's it. Let's talk about it

470
00:28:25.573 --> 00:28:26.878
if kill him

471
00:28:26.921 --> 00:28:28.755
Who will raise the cows?

472
00:28:30.126 --> 00:28:32.127
Is he a slave of a lady's family?

473
00:28:32.493 --> 00:28:33.314
Lady?

474
00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:35.808
Ah, he is talking about me

475
00:28:36.707 --> 00:28:37.264
That's right

476
00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:39.317
he is my servant

477
00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:41.448
Who? Me?

478
00:28:42.842 --> 00:28:45.788
After our grandfather passed away, our family

479
00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:47.867
The family fell into ruin overnight

480
00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:50.006
Every slave is precious

481
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.535
But after he fell from the pear tree

482
00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:54.180
Just completely crazy

483
00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:57.354
That's why I need to take care of him like this

484
00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:02.205
Thank you so much for your hard work

485
00:29:03.412 --> 00:29:04.639
rude

486
00:29:04.664 --> 00:29:06.231
If you want to punish me, punish me.

487
00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:11.639
There's no need for this

488
00:29:11.664 --> 00:29:13.342
Of course it doesn't need to be like this

489
00:29:16.314 --> 00:29:17.730
Don’t bow your head easily without permission

490
00:29:18.638 --> 00:29:20.027
If you bow your head for me, then don’t do this even more

491
00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:25.195
No one dares to punish me rashly

492
00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:28.465
And I'm definitely not anyone's slave...

493
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:34.654
Why are my knees on the ground?

494
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.542
Who put my knees on the ground

495
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.908
Did you make me kneel down?

496
00:29:46.037 --> 00:29:47.995
Look, I'm from this country...

497
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:53.174
No, he started a few days ago

498
00:29:53.203 --> 00:29:55.736
He kept saying that he was possessed by the ghost general

499
00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:58.302
Making a lot of noise all day long

500
00:29:58.954 --> 00:29:59.942
Be quiet…

501
00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:03.333
Is he really a slave of a lady's family?

502
00:30:03.923 --> 00:30:04.658
Yes

503
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.573
He is my slave, yes

504
00:30:07.392 --> 00:30:08.583
My servant girl...

505
00:30:08.803 --> 00:30:09.742
Girl? Girl?

506
00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:10.445
boy

507
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.996
I mean boy

508
00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.186
"Boy"

509
00:30:13.587 --> 00:30:14.745
"Boy"?

510
00:30:16.422 --> 00:30:17.715
Hello Seungbaek

511
00:30:19.321 --> 00:30:20.346
Master?

512
00:30:21.127 --> 00:30:23.071
If I'm discovered to be a slave, it'll be over

513
00:30:23.835 --> 00:30:26.621
Then I'll take it as forgiven and take the first step.

514
00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:30.737
let me go

515
00:30:30.986 --> 00:30:32.796
I don't want to make you regret more

516
00:30:33.245 --> 00:30:36.046
Please, do you want me to be beaten to death with a stick together with you?

517
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.134
Will you die? Yes, let’s go quickly

518
00:30:39.572 --> 00:30:40.721
What are you arguing about?

519
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:43.762
I've never seen that kind of madman

520
00:30:45.729 --> 00:30:47.946
Her back looks familiar

521
00:31:00.778 --> 00:31:01.681
let me go

522
00:31:01.822 --> 00:31:03.012
They don't seem to be chasing me

523
00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:06.962
why are you running away

524
00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:09.090
Because my young master...

525
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.415
Having said that

526
00:31:12.635 --> 00:31:14.435
Why are you so arrogant after I saved you?

527
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.218
I spared the other person's life

528
00:31:17.532 --> 00:31:18.387
Oh my god

529
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:22.103
It seems you didn't pretend to be crazy or stupid on purpose.

530
00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:23.965
Are you pretending to be crazy?

531
00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:26.837
You're not trying to reduce the usual sins

532
00:31:26.837 --> 00:31:28.071
Are you deliberately pretending to be mentally disturbed?

533
00:31:28.612 --> 00:31:32.380
No one in that market could punish me for ordinary crimes.

534
00:31:32.773 --> 00:31:34.306
He's quite crazy

535
00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:39.040
I can't believe I look like this either

536
00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:41.031
But I refuse to explain any more

537
00:31:41.072 --> 00:31:43.006
I also refuse to meddle in other people's business.

538
00:31:43.037 --> 00:31:43.871
Goodbye

539
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.262
You need to speak clearly first

540
00:31:51.587 --> 00:31:53.877
What did you mean when you said that even you would be beaten to death with a stick?

541
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:56.322
I came here with you because of those words

542
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.918
you have to explain it to me

543
00:31:58.277 --> 00:31:59.827
What else could it mean?

544
00:32:00.003 --> 00:32:02.365
If the lies are revealed, both of us will be sentenced...

545
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:05.511
If I say now that we are both slaves

546
00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:07.271
He will definitely be even more angry

547
00:32:08.012 --> 00:32:09.727
Aren't you my slave?

548
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:12.974
I mean, I'd be held accountable for lying too.

549
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.705
So why do you have to stand up for others casually?

550
00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:17.617
What do you think about the situation just now?

551
00:32:17.641 --> 00:32:19.720
Will it be over as long as you get a spanking?

552
00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:21.439
your parents

553
00:32:21.464 --> 00:32:24.380
Even distant relatives may be implicated.

554
00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:27.137
You are really nosy

555
00:32:28.688 --> 00:32:29.805
I know it too

556
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.121
Although God has not given me anything

557
00:32:33.612 --> 00:32:36.065
But one of them is nosy

558
00:32:36.503 --> 00:32:37.580
I'm tired too

559
00:32:38.612 --> 00:32:39.987
What are the remaining items?

560
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.287
Poverty, shabbyness, downfall, tears

561
00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:48.818
Fortunately, amid these misfortunes

562
00:32:49.723 --> 00:32:50.668
And my mother is by my side

563
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:01.709
And...father

564
00:33:07.637 --> 00:33:08.277
What's going on

565
00:33:08.624 --> 00:33:10.049
Why is he looking at me like that?

566
00:33:11.036 --> 00:33:12.515
Don't answer him anymore. Let's go.

567
00:33:12.648 --> 00:33:13.627
Then I'll take my leave first.

568
00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:26.237
my satin clothes

569
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.371
Don't get caught in the rain

570
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.571
Are you very athletic?

571
00:33:46.596 --> 00:33:48.868
I have never been exposed to rain since I was born

572
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.005
You may not believe it, but it is true

573
00:33:51.503 --> 00:33:52.280
yes

574
00:33:52.596 --> 00:33:53.846
If I get cold

575
00:33:53.874 --> 00:33:56.127
There are more than one or two medical officers who have been questioned.

576
00:33:56.706 --> 00:33:58.721
You probably don’t believe this either, but it’s true

577
00:33:58.978 --> 00:33:59.743
yes

578
00:34:00.137 --> 00:34:01.021
Don't you believe it?

579
00:34:01.562 --> 00:34:02.268
Yes

580
00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:26.524
what are you doing

581
00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:29.524
Mud water will splash up.

582
00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:34.534
This is my first pair of embroidered shoes and satin clothes

583
00:34:36.055 --> 00:34:37.624
How poor is your family?

584
00:34:38.441 --> 00:34:40.641
Even so, how can a lady reveal her bare feet so easily?

585
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.696
What is this?

586
00:35:00.011 --> 00:35:01.109
what are you doing

587
00:35:01.377 --> 00:35:04.311
You've never been in the rain, so you don't know

588
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.480
when the raindrops fall on you

589
00:35:06.505 --> 00:35:09.805
The depression in my heart seems to be diluted a little.

590
00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:11.951
How is it possible

591
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:17.826
I mean it

592
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.501
But you probably don’t believe it either, right?

593
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.351
Are you sure it was rain hitting my back?

594
00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:27.105
I always feel like I've been struck by lightning

595
00:36:28.405 --> 00:36:32.036
Why was your mouth the only one not struck by lightning?

596
00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:34.964
It's really...too cold

597
00:36:35.424 --> 00:36:36.483
I can't move

598
00:36:43.912 --> 00:36:44.789
Take off your clothes

599
00:36:45.905 --> 00:36:46.970
Stop playing tricks over there

600
00:36:48.178 --> 00:36:49.567
Squeeze out the water

601
00:36:49.606 --> 00:36:51.086
The clothes can be dried faster

602
00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:58.611
Just a little rain

603
00:36:58.636 --> 00:36:59.905
Just make a fuss over there

604
00:37:00.252 --> 00:37:02.226
My body touched cold water for the first time

605
00:37:03.284 --> 00:37:06.405
I have always been exposed to hot water with floral scent

606
00:37:07.905 --> 00:37:10.451
So who told you to come over here?

607
00:37:10.954 --> 00:37:12.508
Didn't you say this is the only satin dress?

608
00:37:18.868 --> 00:37:20.558
God has not given you anything

609
00:37:22.078 --> 00:37:23.683
Wouldn't it be too painful if you were still exposed to the rain?

610
00:37:30.084 --> 00:37:30.720
That…

611
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.051
thank you

612
00:37:34.137 --> 00:37:36.203
This is more than just a thank you, it should be a holy grace...

613
00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.276
Hello

614
00:37:43.657 --> 00:37:45.330
Do you see anyone sitting here?

615
00:37:46.569 --> 00:37:47.292
Too bad

616
00:37:47.687 --> 00:37:49.273
What adults hate the most is rain.

617
00:37:59.427 --> 00:38:00.658
Don't you know how to tie it?

618
00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:04.773
My hands are not for tying clothes

619
00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.526
I have never been exposed to rain in my life.

620
00:38:17.711 --> 00:38:19.395
I haven't tied my clothes yet

621
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.808
what on earth have you done

622
00:38:21.228 --> 00:38:22.398
I mainly play

623
00:38:22.423 --> 00:38:23.730
This is my most important job

624
00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:25.783
Well, play until you go crazy

625
00:38:37.668 --> 00:38:39.436
Looks like it won't rain again

626
00:38:50.191 --> 00:38:50.939
No need

627
00:38:51.203 --> 00:38:52.158
This is what I want to throw away

628
00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:54.505
I don't like to encounter something that looks strange.

629
00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.745
Something uncomfortable

630
00:38:56.865 --> 00:38:57.851
he is crazy

631
00:38:57.932 --> 00:38:59.232
Stop talking to him

632
00:38:59.257 --> 00:39:01.648
Since you want to throw it away, I will pick it up.

633
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.176
What is your father's name?

634
00:39:08.571 --> 00:39:10.820
Even if the family falls into decline, the family will still exist.

635
00:39:10.937 --> 00:39:11.730
tell me

636
00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:14.893
Do you want to tell the truth now?

637
00:39:14.918 --> 00:39:16.626
Tell him I'm a slave like him

638
00:39:18.145 --> 00:39:19.467
Her face became very stiff

639
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.958
Is it a family that was wiped out?

640
00:39:24.493 --> 00:39:25.970
If it's hard to say, forget it

641
00:39:26.437 --> 00:39:27.189
But

642
00:39:28.518 --> 00:39:31.676
Come to Xiaoxia Valley on the day of the full moon at You hour

643
00:39:33.802 --> 00:39:35.768
why should i do this

644
00:39:36.496 --> 00:39:38.914
For your meddling, I'm going to reward you handsomely.

645
00:39:41.012 --> 00:39:42.295
These shoes are enough

646
00:39:42.537 --> 00:39:43.639
Then be careful on the road

647
00:39:45.929 --> 00:39:47.255
I think it's not enough

648
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.820
and i

649
00:39:51.146 --> 00:39:54.248
I want to see you again

650
00:39:57.634 --> 00:39:58.842
Be sure to come

651
00:40:01.237 --> 00:40:03.020
I understand

652
00:40:12.703 --> 00:40:14.139
What kind of reward are you talking about?

653
00:40:17.622 --> 00:40:18.386
Payback?

654
00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:22.251
I want to punish you for treating me like a slave

655
00:40:24.837 --> 00:40:27.117
Sir, you are here

656
00:40:27.275 --> 00:40:28.564
You've been here for more than an hour

657
00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:32.608
father

658
00:40:34.237 --> 00:40:36.645
Well, come in

659
00:40:44.688 --> 00:40:45.461
father

660
00:40:45.603 --> 00:40:46.814
Is Eunjo getting married?

661
00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:48.998
Won’t the family earn less money this way?

662
00:40:49.023 --> 00:40:50.286
We are already very poor

663
00:40:50.656 --> 00:40:51.289
Stop talking

664
00:40:51.314 --> 00:40:53.230
I heard that you also bought her some satin clothes

665
00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:54.386
Where did that money come from?

666
00:40:55.785 --> 00:40:59.901
I bought it with the money Eunjo earned during this period.

667
00:41:00.175 --> 00:41:01.842
I'll sell that satin dress right away

668
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:04.242
The money earned by this slave is my money, right?

669
00:41:05.603 --> 00:41:06.461
go out

670
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:08.671
Don't let Eunjo get married

671
00:41:08.703 --> 00:41:09.798
I told you to stand down

672
00:41:46.228 --> 00:41:47.328
sorry

673
00:41:47.403 --> 00:41:49.642
I hope the engagement can be postponed a little bit

674
00:41:50.503 --> 00:41:52.530
I also need to take care of my sick mother

675
00:41:54.232 --> 00:41:55.355
after that incident

676
00:41:55.505 --> 00:41:57.530
Life is still not rich

677
00:41:57.803 --> 00:42:00.765
I can't even cope with the money I make.

678
00:42:02.393 --> 00:42:03.674
I see what you mean

679
00:42:04.132 --> 00:42:06.231
But Grandpa doesn't have much time left

680
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:08.206
What?

681
00:42:09.013 --> 00:42:10.493
Are you talking about the great master?

682
00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:13.118
father said

683
00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:15.515
As a child, we cannot let our grandfather die alone.

684
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.621
So I plan to let you stay and serve me and take you as my concubine.

685
00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:25.879
Is the person I want to marry the eldest man?

686
00:42:27.234 --> 00:42:28.628
Why do you look so unwilling?

687
00:42:31.155 --> 00:42:31.937
Not so

688
00:42:32.262 --> 00:42:33.149
small fear

689
00:42:35.855 --> 00:42:37.812
If you dare to make that expression again

690
00:42:38.203 --> 00:42:41.670
I will kick out all your family members living in that house.

691
00:42:44.552 --> 00:42:47.685
You should be lucky that your father and my father are old friends

692
00:42:48.395 --> 00:42:49.903
I am different from my father

693
00:42:50.388 --> 00:42:52.556
If it were me, on the day of the disaster that happened in the Gengwu year

694
00:42:52.586 --> 00:42:55.131
I will kill them all together with all the mice in your house.

695
00:43:08.737 --> 00:43:09.953
calm down

696
00:43:10.377 --> 00:43:12.356
This wedding has to happen anyway

697
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.803
In North Korea, marriage is a transaction

698
00:43:16.612 --> 00:43:18.225
No matter it is a powerful king

699
00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:19.440
Or a naughty girl like me

700
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.471
So I have to calculate carefully

701
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:25.812
one

702
00:43:29.072 --> 00:43:29.809
one

703
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:33.778
one

704
00:43:35.703 --> 00:43:36.600
one

705
00:44:01.547 --> 00:44:02.653
Lord Superintendent?

706
00:44:03.937 --> 00:44:05.512
Are you saying that it’s less than one or two?

707
00:44:05.537 --> 00:44:07.931
I spent ten whole nights copying it.

708
00:44:08.003 --> 00:44:09.046
That…

709
00:44:09.612 --> 00:44:12.612
Because there are too many typos in these four volumes

710
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.893
That's it

711
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.587
I'm older

712
00:44:17.212 --> 00:44:18.759
All dazzled

713
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.718
Then get rid of these rolls and pay me.

714
00:44:22.211 --> 00:44:24.111
Sorry, I can only give you these

715
00:44:24.136 --> 00:44:25.127
don't say that

716
00:44:25.604 --> 00:44:26.555
Thank you for your hard work

717
00:44:37.278 --> 00:44:37.962
that

718
00:44:38.165 --> 00:44:39.799
I want to ask one thing

719
00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.103
The one who just left

720
00:44:42.103 --> 00:44:43.918
When did you start copying?

721
00:44:44.403 --> 00:44:46.259
About a year ago

722
00:44:46.537 --> 00:44:48.587
It actually... lasted for a year?

723
00:44:50.294 --> 00:44:52.584
This is effective for relieving coughs. Let's fry it and drink it.

724
00:44:53.881 --> 00:44:55.565
How could I accept such a valuable thing?

725
00:45:00.806 --> 00:45:03.274
That is Superintendent Hong Minzhi

726
00:45:03.737 --> 00:45:06.105
Because of his outspoken advice to the king,

727
00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.032
Only then was he involved in the disaster of the Gengwu period

728
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.796
resulting in loss of official position

729
00:45:09.837 --> 00:45:11.793
All the property was confiscated

730
00:45:15.857 --> 00:45:17.959
Lord Superintendent, I am Eunjo

731
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.780
Well, come in

732
00:45:27.336 --> 00:45:29.212
Did you just come back from Pingyan's house?

733
00:45:29.678 --> 00:45:30.471
So beautiful

734
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.599
That Mr. Superintendent

735
00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:35.937
May I ask the person who wants to be my husband...

736
00:45:35.937 --> 00:45:37.077
Do you mean carrying?

737
00:45:37.637 --> 00:45:38.643
What happened to him

738
00:45:39.146 --> 00:45:42.896
As expected, my father didn’t know that the person I was marrying was the eldest man.

739
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:47.218
I'm afraid he didn't expect it to be the eldest master at all

740
00:45:48.237 --> 00:45:49.193
nothing

741
00:45:59.036 --> 00:46:01.202
I heard that he is still living under someone else’s roof

742
00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:03.899
How could the highly respected Yangban end up like this?

743
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.252
If you dare to make that expression again

744
00:46:06.637 --> 00:46:08.990
I'll put your family in that house

745
00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:10.037
Drive them all out

746
00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:39.503
Your Majesty

747
00:46:40.543 --> 00:46:41.459
Come in

748
00:46:45.537 --> 00:46:47.027
There's a message from the Robbery Bureau

749
00:46:48.731 --> 00:46:51.097
It seems that we have found traces of Ji Dong

750
00:46:51.978 --> 00:46:52.918
Ji Tong?

751
00:46:53.565 --> 00:46:54.777
I don't know

752
00:46:55.117 --> 00:46:57.196
Just heard other people mention it

753
00:46:57.837 --> 00:47:00.427
If you don't admit who told you

754
00:47:00.452 --> 00:47:02.462
I can punish you as a criminal

755
00:47:03.378 --> 00:47:04.184
what

756
00:47:08.223 --> 00:47:09.646
Sir, you are also true

757
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.409
How can this be so

758
00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:13.533
She's even just a widow with children

759
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:16.590
I'm just saying

760
00:47:20.978 --> 00:47:24.596
I did see Ji Tong that night when I was little

761
00:47:24.621 --> 00:47:28.705
Seeing him flying over the walls

762
00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.037
Not this person. You can even see the tiger in front of you as a pig.

763
00:47:32.037 --> 00:47:32.770
What can be seen

764
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.487
What did you say?

765
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.470
Stop exaggerating and tell the truth quickly.

766
00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:43.224
It's indeed Bai Ding

767
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.899
what is that

768
00:47:53.453 --> 00:47:56.259
Even though it’s late at night, I’m sure I saw it right

769
00:47:57.365 --> 00:47:59.034
He's wearing a Baiding mask?

770
00:48:01.146 --> 00:48:01.924
Let's go

771
00:48:02.115 --> 00:48:03.602
Wait for me

772
00:48:03.627 --> 00:48:05.899
Can we really let that widow go?

773
00:48:08.363 --> 00:48:09.834
I let her go on purpose

774
00:48:12.752 --> 00:48:15.689
Even though it’s late at night, I’m sure I saw it right

775
00:48:16.463 --> 00:48:18.584
You can even see the tiger in front of you as a pig

776
00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:19.887
What can be seen

777
00:48:20.145 --> 00:48:22.390
They cleverly concealed Ji Tong's whereabouts

778
00:48:23.517 --> 00:48:25.350
They definitely know him

779
00:48:27.393 --> 00:48:28.296
What did I say to you?

780
00:48:28.512 --> 00:48:30.045
Don't use that mouth randomly

781
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.170
Hey, who am I saying that for?

782
00:48:33.783 --> 00:48:35.337
Just say wait until I leave together

783
00:48:35.669 --> 00:48:38.606
Draw a picture of Ji Tong and spy on the widow

784
00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:41.097
Wherever she touches there will be a lucky boy

785
00:48:41.337 --> 00:48:42.006
Yes

786
00:48:44.137 --> 00:48:45.428
Are you going to enter the palace then?

787
00:48:46.475 --> 00:48:48.028
I have an appointment today

788
00:48:48.537 --> 00:48:50.028
Be sure to come

789
00:48:51.703 --> 00:48:52.488
I understand

790
00:48:54.751 --> 00:48:57.369
It's time to show her some color

791
00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:04.103
Eunjo, I'm sorry, I'm late.

792
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.550
I suddenly have something urgent to deal with

793
00:49:07.028 --> 00:49:07.755
Come

794
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:10.819
The child just fell asleep

795
00:49:11.049 --> 00:49:11.928
thank you

796
00:49:12.402 --> 00:49:13.668
I'll find you later in the evening

797
00:49:13.703 --> 00:49:15.075
There is something urgent to do now

798
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.053
OK go ahead

799
00:49:27.903 --> 00:49:29.922
Are you well, your lord?

800
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.681
It's Eunjo

801
00:49:34.853 --> 00:49:36.522
I have something to say to you

802
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:43.747
Lord Superintendent

803
00:49:44.337 --> 00:49:45.728
Please come out and have a look

804
00:49:55.336 --> 00:49:57.631
These are the wedding gifts they sent to Enzu

805
00:50:02.423 --> 00:50:04.322
Are these all gifts from Pingyan?

806
00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:05.322
Yes

807
00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.619
Don't let anyone touch these items

808
00:50:09.644 --> 00:50:10.988
Just keep it organized

809
00:50:18.293 --> 00:50:19.591
I will spot the opportunity

810
00:50:20.374 --> 00:50:22.363
Ask you to hold a wedding

811
00:50:25.643 --> 00:50:29.716
Your Majesty, the wedding gifts have been delivered successfully.

812
00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:32.519
OK Got it

813
00:50:34.728 --> 00:50:36.591
Our Lord Superintendent

814
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.350
Didn't know that I was going to marry Lord Dalingjian

815
00:50:42.327 --> 00:50:44.631
It seems that the host completely misunderstood what I said.

816
00:50:45.384 --> 00:50:47.837
Although I value you as an evil girl

817
00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:50.906
You are a precious daughter to him.

818
00:50:51.478 --> 00:50:53.041
Just a slave to me

819
00:50:55.607 --> 00:50:58.041
Then please continue to let him misunderstand

820
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.100
I hope before the wedding

821
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:04.259
Can make my family think that I will become the eldest master's concubine

822
00:51:05.453 --> 00:51:06.694
why should i do that

823
00:51:07.303 --> 00:51:08.956
Because our chief supervisor

824
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.409
Not that bad of a father

825
00:51:11.567 --> 00:51:13.600
Will marry her daughter to a widower over seventy years old

826
00:51:14.799 --> 00:51:18.399
You also know his character, right?

827
00:51:19.737 --> 00:51:20.444
In addition

828
00:51:21.137 --> 00:51:22.641
If it weren’t for the incident in the Gengwu Year, my father would

829
00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:25.300
We ended up like this today

830
00:51:26.325 --> 00:51:30.025
Would you still make such a request now?

831
00:51:31.637 --> 00:51:35.922
After all, he once served as a military judge

832
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.894
Do you think I have humiliated your father?

833
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.109
Okay, keep talking

834
00:51:46.715 --> 00:51:50.115
Please say this marriage was requested by me

835
00:51:50.737 --> 00:51:52.897
Because I want to eat well and sleep well in a powerful house

836
00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:54.950
That's human nature

837
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:58.728
Your filial piety is so admirable

838
00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:02.478
Not as good as you, the Commander-in-Chief

839
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:09.122
My father will be bedridden for the rest of his life

840
00:52:10.453 --> 00:52:11.441
This means

841
00:52:12.203 --> 00:52:15.434
You can't live your whole life as a woman

842
00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.712
But do you care more about your father being sad?

843
00:52:20.593 --> 00:52:25.593
It was me who said that I would serve my parents for the rest of my life.

844
00:52:26.128 --> 00:52:27.762
Even if I can't live as a woman

845
00:52:27.787 --> 00:52:29.287
I won't feel pity either

846
00:52:30.918 --> 00:52:33.718
Why don't you refuse me with this momentum?

847
00:52:35.429 --> 00:52:37.118
When all our family property was confiscated

848
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:41.155
It was you who took our family in

849
00:52:41.445 --> 00:52:44.946
and continue to help us keep our homes.

850
00:52:45.603 --> 00:52:48.627
I'm glad that I can repay your kindness in this way

851
00:52:50.015 --> 00:52:52.358
Consider it the value of your filial piety.

852
00:52:54.307 --> 00:52:59.307
Smart children are born as concubines

853
00:53:02.403 --> 00:53:04.261
The beneficiary must be deeply regretful.

854
00:53:16.725 --> 00:53:18.525
I didn't lose out on this deal.

855
00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:23.415
First, I guarded the Chief Superintendent and his family.

856
00:53:23.903 --> 00:53:26.899
Second, I let my mother live a good life

857
00:53:27.628 --> 00:53:31.027
Third, I even married into a powerful family

858
00:53:31.574 --> 00:53:36.015
Fourth, my God, I even have adult children and grandchildren.

859
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.571
Fifth, plus the person who will become my husband...

860
00:53:41.704 --> 00:53:42.677
Enzu

861
00:53:43.712 --> 00:53:45.933
I will take good care of your mother

862
00:53:45.958 --> 00:53:47.277
Don't worry

863
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.305
Live your life as a woman

864
00:53:50.887 --> 00:53:54.249
Make love with your husband to the fullest

865
00:53:59.637 --> 00:54:01.452
Any wedding in North Korea

866
00:54:02.003 --> 00:54:03.477
I won't trade my love for you

867
00:54:05.025 --> 00:54:07.459
Especially for a slave like me

868
00:54:21.517 --> 00:54:24.202
People say they feel uneasy before a wedding.

869
00:54:24.918 --> 00:54:26.215
Is that why?

870
00:54:28.327 --> 00:54:29.283
This means

871
00:54:29.727 --> 00:54:32.927
You can't live your whole life as a woman

872
00:54:34.058 --> 00:54:36.424
What? Do you feel pity now?

873
00:54:44.296 --> 00:54:46.315
I came here without realizing it

874
00:55:19.574 --> 00:55:22.652
Why is that person here?

875
00:55:23.135 --> 00:55:25.724
Come to Xiaoxia Valley on the day of the full moon at You hour

876
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:27.446
Is it today?

877
00:55:29.262 --> 00:55:32.329
Did he wait until now?

878
00:55:35.376 --> 00:55:38.143
Then why did I come here?

879
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.647
How strange

880
00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:56.319
It happens to be today

881
00:55:58.905 --> 00:55:59.902
It just so happens that…

882
00:56:00.837 --> 00:56:01.799
now

883
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.030
It just so happens that…

884
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.833
that person

885
00:56:39.286 --> 00:56:43.219
If I can no longer live as a woman in the future

886
00:56:46.071 --> 00:56:49.299
If tonight might be the last

887
00:57:08.911 --> 00:57:09.952
Why did you come now?

888
00:57:10.337 --> 00:57:11.937
Do you know how long I have been waiting for you...

889
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:48.620
This…

890
00:57:49.103 --> 00:57:50.871
Let's consider this as compensation.

891
00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.008
Sir

892
00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:08.915
Sir, why is your face so red?

893
00:58:09.668 --> 00:58:10.596
I just...

894
00:58:12.301 --> 00:58:14.149
Something was stolen

895
00:58:15.542 --> 00:58:16.749
What did the other party steal?

896
00:58:19.292 --> 00:58:20.049
That…

897
00:58:41.982 --> 00:58:43.474
what happened to me

898
00:58:43.794 --> 00:58:45.527
I'm really crazy

899
00:58:47.321 --> 00:58:48.733
How do you plan to bear the consequences?

900
00:58:55.295 --> 00:58:56.083
Where have you gone?

901
00:59:01.645 --> 00:59:03.571
It's already so late. I won't be able to catch up.

902
00:59:03.703 --> 00:59:06.758
It’s time for people to close the gates of the capital

903
00:59:11.762 --> 00:59:14.128
Please forgive me for the crazy thing I did today

904
00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:18.668
and the business I will now mind

905
00:59:32.057 --> 00:59:32.899
Did you miss it?

906
01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:09.111
I…

907
01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:13.490
I'll definitely catch you

908
01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:11.121
It's extraordinarily tight today.

909
01:01:11.146 --> 01:01:13.879
I heard that the holder of Bai Dong's mask is Ji Dong

910
01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.274
If a woman takes the initiative to kiss

911
01:01:16.299 --> 01:01:17.945
Probably just admiration

912
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.008
The appearance of a man is indeed attractive enough

913
01:01:20.033 --> 01:01:20.983
We must find her

914
01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:24.161
Has anyone seen this woman?

915
01:01:24.186 --> 01:01:26.086
Why do you have to do this?

916
01:01:26.111 --> 01:01:28.811
Even a wicked girl dares to protect her brother as a sister

917
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.233
