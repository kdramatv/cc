﻿1
00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:09.757
why am i on the street

2
00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:11.879
Ji Tong appears

3
00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:13.935
Catch Ji Tong quickly

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.173
Ji Tong?

5
00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:18.035
What's going on

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.595
What's going on with this sound?

7
00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:30.713
Is there something wrong with my ears?

8
00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:46.663
What's going on

9
00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:53.860
Why are you the way you are?

10
00:00:56.144 --> 00:00:57.697
why your voice

11
00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:02.835
How could I become you

12
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.835
What the hell is going on

13
00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.544
How long do I have to wait?

14
00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.960
Why don't you wake up? Why is this not a dream?

15
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:32.954
Why on earth…

16
00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.785
How could I be in the body of an official?

17
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.669
Go back to where you came from

18
00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:41.994
I want to go back to my own place

19
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:45.966
But...where is this

20
00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:50.494
Please tell the Empress of the Middle Temple

21
00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:53.269
It's an urgent matter related to my marriage

22
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.132
Yes

23
00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:01.116
Could you please give me some advice?

24
00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:04.876
Meet again

25
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.075
listen to her

26
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.388
It must be a woman I know

27
00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.509
Fortunately...nice to meet you?

28
00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:12.935
This time you remember me

29
00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:15.091
Didn't you recognize it last time?

30
00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:17.432
Of course I remember

31
00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:20.779
I lost my way for a moment

32
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.901
May I ask where this is?

33
00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:24.541
This is naturally the palace

34
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.498
Ah...in the palace?

35
00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.695
Yes, Miyazato

36
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.904
In the palace? Is this in the palace?

37
00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.373
The palace where the king lives?

38
00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:35.160
Why is it in the palace?

39
00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.585
I’m not familiar with this place, and I don’t know where the exit is.

40
00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:39.329
You just said you knew me

41
00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:40.904
So can you do me a favor?

42
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.232
Good

43
00:02:45.257 --> 00:02:48.263
Of course I would be happy to receive your help last time...

44
00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:49.097
thank you

45
00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:57.154
Where is the next door?

46
00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.651
Over there is Xieshengmen

47
00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:00.463
Sorry, could you please hurry up?

48
00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:01.423
I'm in a hurry

49
00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:02.548
OK

50
00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.376
Really like two restless ponies

51
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.613
But so strange

52
00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:19.066
Why does that man look more and more like my son?

53
00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:21.576
The slave is frightened

54
00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:25.724
Invite Judge Xu to come over

55
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.119
Thanks to you, I was able to come out smoothly

56
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.004
Then you can let go now

57
00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:42.276
I was impatient. I'm sorry.

58
00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:44.757
Why are you entering the palace so late?

59
00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:46.750
It seems something big happened in the Robbery Bureau

60
00:03:47.532 --> 00:03:49.228
I think so

61
00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.182
I'll just go by myself next time

62
00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:52.507
Thank you very much today

63
00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:54.926
Hailin

64
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:57.329
My name is Hailin

65
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.857
It's the Shen family...

66
00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:07.566
My brother is the promotion officer of Huimin Department

67
00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.241
Are you the sister of Mr. Ti Tiao?

68
00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:13.982
You look nothing alike

69
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.469
you are beautiful

70
00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:17.788
I'll take my leave first

71
00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:28.785
See you next time

72
00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:31.201
hope you can remember my name

73
00:04:40.974 --> 00:04:42.185
why are you here

74
00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:44.566
Did you get the news so quickly?

75
00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:46.298
No

76
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.354
what

77
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.132
I mean... I happened to be around here on business.

78
00:04:55.664 --> 00:04:57.866
That's what I threw into the well

79
00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.369
Found it so quickly

80
00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:00.694
That's Ji Tong's thing

81
00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.966
Tonight, I will give you a lecture

82
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.826
Killed by Ji Tong

83
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:08.282
Really?

84
00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:10.816
two hours ago

85
00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.926
He sneaked into Da Sijian's mansion and escaped

86
00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:18.551
It seems that he was injured near here.

87
00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.613
Did you shed so much blood?

88
00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.310
Difficulty moving due to injury

89
00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.448
So I abandoned the Baiding mask and the Yako

90
00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:30.001
He changed back to his original appearance and ran away.

91
00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.857
He must have been unconscious for a long time

92
00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:34.213
Have you woken up?

93
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.648
Someone still took me away

94
00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:40.363
Jiang is an official. Listen carefully.

95
00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:44.116
Ji Tong was framed

96
00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:45.566
Framed?

97
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:46.879
Think about it

98
00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:48.426
last winter

99
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.784
Those gangsters from Yuncong Street were caught stealing silk

100
00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.045
Then they lied that Ji Tong stole it and gave it to them.

101
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.188
I remember

102
00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:58.180
People from the business group recognized one of the gangsters

103
00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:00.123
Ji Tong was cleared of charges

104
00:06:00.148 --> 00:06:01.219
More than that

105
00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:03.280
Rumors also say that Ji Tong is a criminal who kidnapped the bride.

106
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:05.117
Abducted the daughter-in-law of Da Si Xian Mansion

107
00:06:06.123 --> 00:06:08.133
Later it was found out that she was the daughter-in-law of Da Si Xianfu

108
00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:09.658
Eloped with the teacher

109
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.326
Is there anyone else using Ji Tong’s name?

110
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.177
Unexpectedly, he even used Ji Dong's name to kill people.

111
00:06:16.673 --> 00:06:17.438
In short

112
00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:19.566
You just need to follow the evidence and investigate

113
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:21.576
Don't be led away by fake blood letters

114
00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:23.079
obey

115
00:06:25.355 --> 00:06:27.132
Those old cases just mentioned

116
00:06:27.323 --> 00:06:29.435
I never reported to you

117
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.444
How do you know the details and even the blood letter?

118
00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:35.760
I think I heard it on the road.

119
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.067
Is that so?

120
00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:43.463
Is there anyone found unconscious nearby?

121
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:44.604
No

122
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:46.613
But…

123
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.552
did you drink

124
00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:55.554
Probably

125
00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:58.842
I heard that Dr. Hong’s wedding is today

126
00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:00.557
Is it because of this?

127
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.688
I'm leaving

128
00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:05.308
where are you going

129
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:06.400
We’ll talk about it later. Wait a minute.

130
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.188
Without Judge Xu accompanying me...

131
00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:09.235
Your Majesty

132
00:07:34.926 --> 00:07:36.148
It turns out to be here

133
00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:41.044
It seems that even the doctor has been here

134
00:07:42.097 --> 00:07:43.447
Who brought me back?

135
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.707
Only we know about this, don't let any rumors leak about it

136
00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.808
If word got out that the bride fainted outside her home

137
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:51.233
It will only make the boss even more unhappy

138
00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:52.728
Okay, got it

139
00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:54.675
Fortunately, I was discovered by the proprietress.

140
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.967
I don't know what she is doing there

141
00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:03.269
Anyway, her husband is dead, so is she planning to run away?

142
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.667
Shut up

143
00:08:07.447 --> 00:08:08.575
Hello…

144
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:10.350
Wake up

145
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.706
Why don't you wake up?

146
00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.663
My heart is still beating

147
00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:20.625
Is there anyone inside?

148
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.128
Could it be an empty shell?

149
00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:27.722
Is anyone here?

150
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.926
Is anyone home?

151
00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:36.284
What?

152
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.400
Have you changed it back?

153
00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:43.466
Sure enough, I was just dreaming

154
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:44.597
If it really comes back

155
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:46.578
Will it still look like this face?

156
00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:51.913
who are you?

157
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.553
The person who is speaking now

158
00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:56.225
Is he the owner of this face?

159
00:08:57.382 --> 00:08:58.547
Are you the ancestor of the Hong family?

160
00:08:58.757 --> 00:09:00.357
What the hell is going on

161
00:09:01.278 --> 00:09:04.469
Have we really exchanged souls?

162
00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.233
Is this reasonable?…

163
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.822
Does your head hurt?

164
00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:12.663
How did the head hurt?

165
00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:17.428
The road was too dark at night and I fell heavily when I went out.

166
00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:20.081
how did you get here

167
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.067
As soon as I opened my eyes, I fell down again

168
00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:26.469
Before that, Da Si Jian’s servants had been here.

169
00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:29.172
It seems that he doesn't know that I am Ji Dong

170
00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:32.863
Wow…

171
00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:36.188
I can actually be so unfamiliar with my face

172
00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:38.034
each other

173
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:40.691
Let’s find a way to change it back first.

174
00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:43.638
We need to get out of here first

175
00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:45.253
Are you able to walk?

176
00:09:56.553 --> 00:09:57.613
It's dawn

177
00:09:58.233 --> 00:09:59.547
Go back and take a nap

178
00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:01.300
Father is coming out soon

179
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:12.956
The little one has delivered the dinner as you asked.

180
00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.000
Let her eat enough so she can sleep well

181
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.603
Yes, the younger one retreated first.

182
00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:24.841
Looking downcast

183
00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:27.200
If this continues, something will happen to my family's ancestors as well.

184
00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:30.088
It would be better to just die

185
00:10:39.817 --> 00:10:41.042
If you disappear without a sound

186
00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:42.303
I'm afraid it will cause a commotion

187
00:10:42.499 --> 00:10:43.775
Tell the maid of this household

188
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.431
You have to go back to your parents’ house

189
00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.184
Mother’s family?

190
00:10:47.524 --> 00:10:48.781
So where is this place?

191
00:10:50.814 --> 00:10:52.291
Is it your in-laws?

192
00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:56.959
Abominable

193
00:10:56.984 --> 00:10:58.551
Why did you change to this place?

194
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.853
This is my home since yesterday

195
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:05.475
Having said that

196
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.966
Why do you help me change into mourning clothes?

197
00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:10.369
Has anyone died in this family?

198
00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:13.713
Ah that...

199
00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:16.553
What about this...

200
00:11:19.443 --> 00:11:20.343
Someone is coming

201
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:23.313
If you continue here, you will be discovered. I will hide first.

202
00:11:30.198 --> 00:11:32.664
Damn it, why is it that guy?

203
00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:37.020
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

204
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.810
Wrong

205
00:11:40.304 --> 00:11:41.854
why did you come here

206
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.576
I'll collect the body

207
00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:47.801
It seems I came too early

208
00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:49.966
It’s over. How could he be the second young master of this family?

209
00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:52.729
Corpse?

210
00:11:53.775 --> 00:11:56.475
Why do you come here to find corpses...ah?

211
00:11:58.189 --> 00:12:00.745
Aren't corpses usually placed behind the incense table?

212
00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:04.001
Why don't you go to the sarangcha to find...?

213
00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:05.966
are you kidding me now

214
00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:08.957
No...

215
00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:11.608
It seems you have come to the wrong place

216
00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:13.132
Hurry over there...

217
00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:14.807
It almost turned me off

218
00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:22.498
What should I do if I die before I get trampled?

219
00:12:23.414 --> 00:12:24.363
Hello

220
00:12:29.723 --> 00:12:30.779
What about me?

221
00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:34.122
I don’t quite understand the context of this conversation right now.

222
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:39.267
Is this what a husband who just married his wife should say?

223
00:12:41.023 --> 00:12:41.851
Husband?

224
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.338
what to do

225
00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:47.320
The newlyweds were so inseparable that it was too late

226
00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:49.004
What about trampling?

227
00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:54.541
It seems that there was a dispute between the couple last night.

228
00:12:54.576 --> 00:12:55.970
who is your husband

229
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:57.157
Who else could it be?

230
00:12:57.732 --> 00:12:58.910
You standing in front of me

231
00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:01.441
I'm going crazy, really

232
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:05.313
Your joke has gone a bit too far since just now

233
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:06.632
How does this look like a joke?

234
00:13:06.657 --> 00:13:07.488
are you crazy

235
00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:10.576
The husband you mentioned passed away last night

236
00:13:13.232 --> 00:13:14.201
How could he die?

237
00:13:19.117 --> 00:13:21.450
If this mourning dress was worn because the husband died,

238
00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:24.648
Then who are you?

239
00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:28.220
answer

240
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.085
grandson of the deceased

241
00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:33.860
Grandson?

242
00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:38.823
It's so late. Why are you here?

243
00:13:39.607 --> 00:13:41.860
Just think that I'm here to discipline the family. How about

244
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.700
So that’s when…

245
00:13:49.174 --> 00:13:50.116
wait a moment

246
00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:53.016
Since he already has grandchildren

247
00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:57.195
My husband must be at least sixty or seventy years old.

248
00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.439
Is this marriage reasonable?

249
00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.804
you are really crazy

250
00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:09.467
Still awake now

251
00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:10.916
I want to…

252
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.683
It should be the latter...right?

253
00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:23.107
I think I should have been hit hard

254
00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:25.273
will temporarily lose consciousness

255
00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:28.463
Thanks to you, I was able to figure out the situation, Mr. Sun Tzu.

256
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:31.888
Also

257
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.040
I just mistook you for my husband.

258
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:38.059
hope you can never forget

259
00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:40.281
Even if you only have that thought for a moment

260
00:14:40.637 --> 00:14:43.134
It all makes me feel extremely humiliated

261
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.296
It seems you are back to normal

262
00:14:47.272 --> 00:14:48.550
But what about this attitude?

263
00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:49.962
young master

264
00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:53.725
All of you on the list came to express your condolences.

265
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:55.343
Go quickly

266
00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:58.605
The mourner cannot leave the party for too long...

267
00:15:04.632 --> 00:15:05.668
Stop

268
00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:10.778
Are you feeling well?

269
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:13.290
Do you still remember that you were carried back last night?

270
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.518
Probably remember

271
00:15:17.408 --> 00:15:19.306
Anyway, this woman's body

272
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:21.662
There is no need to come forward to receive condolences

273
00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:25.615
Don't let anyone in or out during the funeral.

274
00:15:25.698 --> 00:15:27.265
I'm going back to my parents' house

275
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.912
Just pretend you don't know

276
00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:30.165
yes

277
00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:42.584
Hong Eun-jo, come out

278
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:56.662
Leave over the wall

279
00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.512
I don't want to stay in this home for a second

280
00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:11.518
Where are you going?

281
00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:14.140
No one will pass this path

282
00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:15.484
Just say it here

283
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.693
The marriage is just like what you just heard

284
00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:27.021
That gentleman is my nominal husband

285
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:29.765
They passed away as soon as they got married last night

286
00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:33.346
Maybe you think this is unreasonable

287
00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:35.662
But it's common for people like me

288
00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:43.984
Sorry, I lied to you and said that the second young master of that family was my husband.

289
00:16:44.716 --> 00:16:46.818
I thought it would be good for both of us to say that.

290
00:16:47.567 --> 00:16:50.200
This way you can give up sooner

291
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.175
I'll have less trouble

292
00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:02.937
Why haven't you said a word since just now?

293
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.890
You have to say something to solve the situation at hand.

294
00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:10.050
Because I don't know what to say

295
00:17:11.646 --> 00:17:13.943
I kept thinking along the way

296
00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:16.300
But can't say a word

297
00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.506
I'm nothing to you

298
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.928
Not qualified to vent this anger

299
00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:28.606
This may be a choice you made under difficulty

300
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.193
I can't blame easily

301
00:17:30.218 --> 00:17:33.003
But I don’t want to pretend to understand what you said, “This kind of marriage is very common.”

302
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:34.771
and absurdly agree with

303
00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:38.325
What makes me most angry now is

304
00:17:39.522 --> 00:17:41.078
Because I'm not in my body

305
00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:43.701
Even if I have to drag you out of that damn place,

306
00:17:43.726 --> 00:17:44.637
Can't do it

307
00:17:50.432 --> 00:17:52.837
So we have to change our bodies back first.

308
00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:56.878
I can understand it as waiting for the change to come back

309
00:17:57.375 --> 00:17:59.243
Will you carry out what you just said?

310
00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:00.768
you understand very correctly

311
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.800
I'm even thinking

312
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.109
How to destroy the family that facilitated this marriage?

313
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:07.437
Only then can I vent my anger

314
00:18:12.433 --> 00:18:14.043
What I'm most angry about is

315
00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:16.868
Don't know anything about this

316
00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:19.656
And stupidly praying for you

317
00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:23.871
Being stupid enough to put embroidered shoes into your hands

318
00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.338
So I’ll say the ugly things first.

319
00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:31.325
I will be even more ruthless next time

320
00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:34.267
Not even a moment's hesitation

321
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.243
Let’s end this topic here.

322
00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:45.400
You didn't have to get married

323
00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:49.290
You can also tell me

324
00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:51.478
I don't think I need to give up on the marriage

325
00:18:51.657 --> 00:18:54.224
Not so pitiful that he needs help from others

326
00:18:55.888 --> 00:18:57.400
Although people who are bedridden

327
00:18:57.626 --> 00:18:59.584
It is deeply regrettable to die on the wedding day

328
00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:03.078
But I want to say that at least I can be in that home from now on

329
00:19:03.103 --> 00:19:05.528
Live without worries

330
00:19:06.358 --> 00:19:08.084
Until we suddenly switch bodies

331
00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:12.353
So the first priority is to return to our respective bodies first.

332
00:19:12.378 --> 00:19:14.846
You continue to enjoy your life while I go and do whatever I want

333
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.391
If we want to successfully implement each other's goals, let's do this

334
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:19.815
Just treat it as a temporary consensus.

335
00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:23.106
Mom, are you okay?

336
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.607
If the great master passes away

337
00:19:27.632 --> 00:19:29.998
What should our Eunjo do?

338
00:19:30.023 --> 00:19:32.171
She became a widow at a young age

339
00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:34.860
Can't you take her back?

340
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:36.519
She is married

341
00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.125
Now he belongs to that family

342
00:19:38.317 --> 00:19:40.768
Even if I die, I will die in that home. What can I do?

343
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.962
Unless she wants to run far away

344
00:19:46.723 --> 00:19:48.062
Run away?

345
00:19:52.572 --> 00:19:56.439
This is something I've never seen in a book

346
00:19:56.464 --> 00:20:00.087
Not to mention legends or folktales

347
00:20:00.248 --> 00:20:03.715
No matter how you think about it, this doesn't look like something humans do.

348
00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.006
Do you mean God did it?

349
00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:08.237
That's divine punishment, right?

350
00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:10.265
At least I'm sure it's definitely not a blessing

351
00:20:15.657 --> 00:20:16.715
I won't be angry

352
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.909
You really tell me the truth

353
00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:21.112
Have you done nothing wrong recently?

354
00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:23.678
No

355
00:20:24.896 --> 00:20:26.296
Even if I did something wrong

356
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:28.353
Why do you have to be punished with me?

357
00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.466
The point is, why is it you and me?

358
00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:37.731
When is your birthday?

359
00:20:38.213 --> 00:20:40.200
Bingwu year Gengzi month Guihai day

360
00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:42.390
It’s different from my sun pillar.

361
00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:47.650
If you want to think in a superstitious direction, then be thorough.

362
00:20:48.001 --> 00:20:48.746
follow me

363
00:21:00.631 --> 00:21:02.946
You are a medical woman. Don’t you have a medical explanation?

364
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:03.893
Be quiet

365
00:21:03.918 --> 00:21:05.171
It will be taboo

366
00:21:07.522 --> 00:21:10.975
There's a virgin ghost living inside you

367
00:21:12.398 --> 00:21:13.637
can you see me

368
00:21:14.623 --> 00:21:16.134
Can you really see anything?

369
00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.433
So you are a grown man

370
00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:20.468
He understands women’s hearts better than women, right?

371
00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:23.522
This guy…

372
00:21:24.628 --> 00:21:26.416
He's a playboy, right?

373
00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:31.478
Get up

374
00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:34.660
Let’s do a ritual

375
00:21:34.685 --> 00:21:36.437
I can help you exorcise ghosts

376
00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:37.756
Hello

377
00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:40.458
I'm not trying to kick this woman out of my body

378
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:43.314
Do you want to try doing some rituals?

379
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:45.845
As long as the soul leaves the body

380
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.554
At least try other methods

381
00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:49.370
What if I never come back?

382
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.079
Are you planning to go for a walk in Huangquan?

383
00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:56.320
Could it be that it's not a soul exchange?

384
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.288
But body swap?

385
00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:01.976
So we should start with the body, right?

386
00:22:13.038 --> 00:22:14.388
sincerely

387
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.851
hold religiously

388
00:22:43.973 --> 00:22:44.816
Do you feel it?

389
00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:46.373
Not at all

390
00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.757
Didn’t you say you need to use your body?

391
00:22:49.998 --> 00:22:52.041
How can anything change if you just move your hands?

392
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.532
Otherwise, what should I do?

393
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.541
Are you sure you have no selfish motives?

394
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.216
What selfishness?

395
00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:15.108
(I don’t know when they started looking at the same place)

396
00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:17.270
Show some sincerity too

397
00:23:17.427 --> 00:23:18.016
what

398
00:23:18.746 --> 00:23:19.495
Good

399
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:25.467
(Even if you want to hide it, it will still gradually expand)

400
00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:30.282
(Want to hug you Loving you)

401
00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:34.998
(I don’t want to let go for a moment)

402
00:23:35.454 --> 00:23:40.820
(Every day is filled with us)

403
00:23:41.904 --> 00:23:44.942
(all seem to shine beautifully)

404
00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:47.033
Did you feel anything?

405
00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:49.870
Yes very loud

406
00:23:52.654 --> 00:23:54.716
Is my heartbeat so loud?

407
00:23:55.633 --> 00:23:56.626
are you kidding

408
00:23:57.882 --> 00:23:59.182
Very pleasant

409
00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:01.973
After the change comes back, you can listen to it as much as you want

410
00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.413
I don’t think I’m exchanging my body for it.

411
00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:09.549
When did we exchange?

412
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.201
Last night when people decided?

413
00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:18.638
Will it be replaced by then?

414
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:20.221
Is it all just a nightmare one night?

415
00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:22.578
It's time for people to decide

416
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.837
nightmare…

417
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.400
It seems to have become longer

418
00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:39.140
Abominable

419
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:43.708
You just said it doesn't seem to be man-made, right?

420
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:46.914
Then it’s useless no matter how hard one tries

421
00:24:47.075 --> 00:24:48.773
Doesn't it matter if we continue to live like this?

422
00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:50.598
I don’t even know when I will switch back

423
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.787
So you are here

424
00:24:56.988 --> 00:24:58.889
There's a lot of commotion happening at your place

425
00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:00.804
It's you again

426
00:25:01.675 --> 00:25:03.204
Then I won’t say much more

427
00:25:04.384 --> 00:25:06.489
You've already finished scolding with your expressions

428
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.804
what

429
00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:10.266
Anyone who looks at it can tell that it was me who was dragged out

430
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.186
why do you look like you want to blame me

431
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:14.111
If you want to scold me, I'll scold this guy who won't let me go.

432
00:25:14.475 --> 00:25:15.339
"This guy"?

433
00:25:15.538 --> 00:25:17.873
You always have to think about whose mouth this is, right?

434
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.533
As long as it's right, it doesn't matter which mouth you say it from.

435
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.217
I said...

436
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.976
Ignore him and talk to me

437
00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:27.889
What? No, I’m asking you to speak out.

438
00:25:27.933 --> 00:25:28.464
Yes

439
00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:31.814
There's a lot of commotion in the palace right now

440
00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.170
why

441
00:25:33.195 --> 00:25:35.786
The Concubine orders you to enter the palace immediately

442
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:37.207
Why is the empress like this?

443
00:25:38.907 --> 00:25:40.042
Convey to empress

444
00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:43.142
Now I am unable to enter the palace due to circumstances that do not allow it.

445
00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:45.035
Now is not the time for you to speak

446
00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:47.548
He only listens to your orders. Tell him.

447
00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:48.495
"You"?

448
00:25:49.442 --> 00:25:51.242
The empress has even been on a hunger strike since last night

449
00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:53.526
Say you won't eat anything until you come

450
00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:54.757
Because of me?

451
00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:57.173
Otherwise, who would it be because of?

452
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:00.742
What kind of trouble did this body cause?

453
00:26:03.571 --> 00:26:06.738
No dignity or character at all

454
00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:08.548
He doesn't even have the status to speak

455
00:26:08.576 --> 00:26:11.067
It happened that I revealed my identity in this body

456
00:26:16.674 --> 00:26:19.238
You first go and report to the Maharaja that your Majesty will enter the palace.

457
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.732
I said

458
00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:29.875
It seems you are going to go there

459
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.372
Your Majesty

460
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.633
Your Majesty... Your Majesty?

461
00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:39.967
Yes, it's you

462
00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.100
Your Majesty

463
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.688
So

464
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.167
Are you the second son of His Royal Highness?

465
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.210
Yes

466
00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:11.013
Is he also the younger brother of the current Lord?

467
00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:12.316
Yes

468
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.700
This means you are...

469
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:16.233
The prince of North Korea?

470
00:27:18.233 --> 00:27:20.288
you seem surprised

471
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.206
Is it because she has a good appearance as rumored?

472
00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:30.126
We woke up in the palace at that time

473
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.204
I thought you already had a idea in your mind

474
00:27:40.433 --> 00:27:41.933
Why don't you speak?

475
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.667
Because I don’t know what to say either

476
00:27:48.288 --> 00:27:51.355
The words I wanted to say but disappeared

477
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.420
It seems to be because of the intimidating effect of the word "Maharaja"

478
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.692
What's wrong with you? It doesn't look like you.

479
00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:01.233
I'm thinking about every word I've said so far

480
00:28:01.233 --> 00:28:02.900
Have I committed treason?

481
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.276
If I commit it, will you give me a chance to atone?

482
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:07.100
Just do as you originally did

483
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:09.707
Do you want me to continue to offend you so that I can be beheaded?

484
00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:11.301
are you making fun of me

485
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:17.742
I've never met anyone remotely related to the royal family.

486
00:28:17.767 --> 00:28:20.033
However, one day the core of the royal family

487
00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:22.723
Even when the highest person appears before me

488
00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:24.033
Aren't you going to panic?

489
00:28:24.033 --> 00:28:25.933
That's why I didn't say anything

490
00:28:25.963 --> 00:28:27.967
Because everyone doesn’t know how to treat me after hearing this

491
00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.632
And feel uncomfortable

492
00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:32.900
It’s not because the name “Maharaja” is so great that we hide it

493
00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:36.808
It's an order from now on

494
00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:38.300
I order you to continue to treat me as you did before.

495
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.533
You are not allowed to disobey

496
00:28:41.627 --> 00:28:43.042
Because when I woke up, I was in the palace

497
00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:45.367
I thought you were an official who came to the government office to report

498
00:28:45.367 --> 00:28:46.967
Who would have thought that it was your home?

499
00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:49.667
In this North Korea, are there more than fifteen people in the palace?

500
00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:53.560
There should be more than ten

501
00:28:53.795 --> 00:28:55.975
After all, I have something to hide, so I’m not qualified to say anything.

502
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.860
But there are still difficulties now

503
00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:00.004
If you don't want to, just refuse.

504
00:29:00.233 --> 00:29:02.900
Wait, your mother is starving in the palace.

505
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.704
But did you actually say such unfilial words?

506
00:29:05.333 --> 00:29:08.567
After all, that body is not very filial.

507
00:29:09.972 --> 00:29:11.011
So you want me to...

508
00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:14.233
Let the former mother of the country starve to death?

509
00:29:15.408 --> 00:29:17.642
It’s not that I don’t want to go, I just want you to give me an alternative.

510
00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:20.017
It's going to be daybreak, hurry up

511
00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:21.367
Just do as I say

512
00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:26.411
First put your hands behind your back

513
00:29:27.379 --> 00:29:29.061
Keep your waist straight at all times

514
00:29:29.842 --> 00:29:31.770
Look as arrogant as possible

515
00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:33.442
what

516
00:29:34.647 --> 00:29:36.676
Didn't you say he would enter the palace?

517
00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:37.867
The adults are here

518
00:29:51.023 --> 00:29:53.220
It turns out that she is the concubine.

519
00:29:58.979 --> 00:30:01.111
Don't be timid. Just do as he says.

520
00:30:01.868 --> 00:30:03.401
Anyway, the words that came out of my mouth

521
00:30:03.433 --> 00:30:04.832
None of it represents my opinion

522
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.945
The Queen Mother is getting older

523
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.292
He seems to be becoming more and more stubborn.

524
00:30:08.843 --> 00:30:10.798
Why not eat or drink?

525
00:30:11.181 --> 00:30:12.598
Wouldn't it hurt this beautiful appearance?

526
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.070
Where did you spend the night the past two days?

527
00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:16.666
What a surprise

528
00:30:16.762 --> 00:30:18.829
She actually had no reaction to my frivolous words

529
00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:23.156
It’s just a place with the sky as its home and the wind as its mattress.

530
00:30:25.117 --> 00:30:26.967
Are you also friends with that woman?

531
00:30:27.275 --> 00:30:28.111
Woman?

532
00:30:28.685 --> 00:30:31.179
Well...you never mentioned women. Who is she talking about?

533
00:30:31.467 --> 00:30:32.461
I don't know either

534
00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:33.575
Who else knows?

535
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.595
I saw it with my own eyes last night

536
00:30:35.763 --> 00:30:39.497
You hold the hand of a girl from unknown family and play in the palace

537
00:30:45.474 --> 00:30:47.235
Concubine, you misunderstood

538
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:50.060
That girl has nothing to do with me

539
00:30:50.092 --> 00:30:51.125
Yesterday was the first time we met

540
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.173
No, it shouldn’t be the first time

541
00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:54.329
Is this the second time?

542
00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:55.807
Don't let me act rashly with that face

543
00:30:55.832 --> 00:30:57.210
Keep up the good demeanor of a great king

544
00:30:57.795 --> 00:30:59.495
Now that I've seen it

545
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.270
Tell me which family you are a daughter of

546
00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:02.588
Play dumb

547
00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:04.273
I don't know. I really don't know.

548
00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:07.498
Do you want me to capture all the ladies in North Korea before you open your mouth?

549
00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:11.507
Said it was just a chance meeting and spending the night together

550
00:31:11.532 --> 00:31:12.965
Don't know her name

551
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.290
It's just a chance meeting and spending the night together

552
00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:15.526
Don't know her name

553
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:16.913
what

554
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:21.716
Have you fallen in love like a common man?

555
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:23.376
Because they are just ordinary people in the city.

556
00:31:25.772 --> 00:31:26.585
what did you say

557
00:31:28.972 --> 00:31:29.991
you guy

558
00:31:30.544 --> 00:31:32.457
I feel deeply frightened that my son has become like this.

559
00:31:34.379 --> 00:31:35.354
That's not what I meant

560
00:31:35.601 --> 00:31:37.135
I mean, as a common citizen, I feel deeply frightened.

561
00:31:38.764 --> 00:31:43.204
As a king of a country, he cannot be a model of a gentleman.

562
00:31:48.818 --> 00:31:50.573
What are you still doing standing there? Call the doctor quickly.

563
00:31:50.971 --> 00:31:54.332
You are obviously not in good health, why do you go on a hunger strike to this point...

564
00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:04.514
What to do if something goes wrong

565
00:32:04.783 --> 00:32:08.383
Your Majesty is very worried about you.

566
00:32:08.408 --> 00:32:10.810
I kept chattering all day long until my little one even memorized it.

567
00:32:11.048 --> 00:32:12.814
Yeah, that's it

568
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.007
Are you okay?

569
00:32:15.129 --> 00:32:16.529
take your hands away

570
00:32:16.681 --> 00:32:17.629
bad guy

571
00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:21.095
How could you spend one night with someone's precious daughter and then abandon her?

572
00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:23.757
I never taught you this

573
00:32:25.436 --> 00:32:27.454
If you still know how to respect me

574
00:32:27.534 --> 00:32:29.601
At least you should show some reflection.

575
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.810
I will reflect on it

576
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.035
I don’t think I’ve seen you as a palace maid before.

577
00:32:41.016 --> 00:32:41.895
Small?

578
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.600
The young one has just entered the residence of the Maharaja.

579
00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:49.173
what is your name

580
00:32:54.491 --> 00:32:55.825
Xiao Wei Hong Shi

581
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.298
Hong Shi?

582
00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:13.810
What's wrong? What's the problem?

583
00:33:21.275 --> 00:33:23.332
Please express your condolences

584
00:33:23.826 --> 00:33:26.551
It’s all because women who shouldn’t be in the house are like this.

585
00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:33.113
If you want a drink, come out

586
00:33:35.402 --> 00:33:36.298
Zai Yi

587
00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:38.735
No need for wine

588
00:33:40.275 --> 00:33:41.332
That one...

589
00:33:44.778 --> 00:33:45.920
It’s Eunjo’s mother

590
00:33:46.522 --> 00:33:48.567
I wonder if I can let her meet secretly

591
00:34:00.325 --> 00:34:03.532
She said she wanted to go back to her parents' house, so I kept silent.

592
00:34:09.301 --> 00:34:13.198
It's all my fault for making you disliked by the concubine.

593
00:34:13.615 --> 00:34:16.176
Don't take it to heart, it won't be a matter of a day or two anyway.

594
00:34:17.709 --> 00:34:19.676
We can't be together all the time

595
00:34:20.088 --> 00:34:24.379
I will also take this body back to your husband's house before tomorrow morning.

596
00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:27.996
You can also hide in another courtyard during the mourning period

597
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.285
But there's a funeral tomorrow

598
00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.379
No matter what, I have to show up.

599
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.742
can you do this for me

600
00:34:35.254 --> 00:34:36.470
Didn’t you say you must protect me?

601
00:34:37.816 --> 00:34:40.687
Although I don’t know what I can protect with this marriage.

602
00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.394
But can you do it alone?

603
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.172
Be sure to do it

604
00:34:47.463 --> 00:34:50.696
Protect each other's lives and find a way to get back on track.

605
00:34:56.152 --> 00:34:58.778
Then you have to stay up late with me today

606
00:35:04.751 --> 00:35:05.616
who is she

607
00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:07.912
Why pretend to be a palace maid?

608
00:35:07.937 --> 00:35:10.194
They have been in the room for three hours. What on earth are they doing?

609
00:35:10.219 --> 00:35:12.747
That's right. Your Majesty has an order.

610
00:35:12.772 --> 00:35:15.259
Any information leaked to outsiders will be severely punished

611
00:35:34.607 --> 00:35:36.647
The character illustrations around you should look like this.

612
00:35:36.978 --> 00:35:39.965
The rest depends on my superb adaptability.

613
00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:45.109
There's something about that...

614
00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:48.324
Is there anything else you want to explain?

615
00:35:49.076 --> 00:35:52.096
It's been hard for me to open my mouth to you during this time.

616
00:35:53.104 --> 00:35:53.815
what

617
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.140
our each other's bodies

618
00:35:56.678 --> 00:35:57.840
Just pretend you can't see it

619
00:35:58.783 --> 00:35:59.877
Ah

620
00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:02.046
Now is the time to draw the line

621
00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:03.737
You've finished watching everything you should see, right?

622
00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:06.305
No, I didn't see anything.

623
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.909
This is not what I saw

624
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.499
It’s seen by the person in front of me, so it’s you who sees it

625
00:36:10.997 --> 00:36:13.621
Sounds like I looked at it carefully once

626
00:36:14.865 --> 00:36:15.934
And my body too

627
00:36:16.135 --> 00:36:18.902
It was not you who touched it, but my own hand.

628
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:19.709
You got it

629
00:36:20.748 --> 00:36:21.843
Is that so?

630
00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.002
But I am the one who has the memory

631
00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.380
Sir, don’t you also know?

632
00:36:27.968 --> 00:36:29.190
I'm very confident

633
00:36:30.404 --> 00:36:31.409
I haven't seen it

634
00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:33.371
I said it wasn't with my eyes

635
00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:36.330
Go ask Dazao to come

636
00:36:37.521 --> 00:36:38.359
what does it mean

637
00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:40.262
Are you avoiding my question?

638
00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:47.349
I start walking back from here

639
00:36:47.383 --> 00:36:48.654
Someone might see it accidentally

640
00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:50.587
Good

641
00:36:54.262 --> 00:36:55.103
jujube

642
00:36:56.054 --> 00:36:58.516
No, Judge Xu

643
00:36:59.203 --> 00:37:02.950
Please follow the Lord at all times

644
00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:05.106
Notice if he is trembling with fear

645
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:06.850
Is the behavior reckless?

646
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.972
Did you eat on time?

647
00:37:08.997 --> 00:37:10.731
Or whether you are alone at night...

648
00:37:13.004 --> 00:37:13.975
cry secretly

649
00:37:15.284 --> 00:37:16.291
Please pay close attention to

650
00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:18.145
No need to remind you

651
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.138
This is my duty

652
00:37:19.929 --> 00:37:20.969
Just know

653
00:37:23.087 --> 00:37:25.596
Although other people's emotional affairs...

654
00:37:27.508 --> 00:37:29.593
should not interfere excessively

655
00:37:29.988 --> 00:37:32.054
But if you dare to use the Maharaja

656
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.299
Or let him get hurt

657
00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:36.002
I will definitely take action myself by then

658
00:37:36.335 --> 00:37:38.184
Have you been acting cool in private?

659
00:37:38.741 --> 00:37:39.515
what

660
00:37:40.229 --> 00:37:41.706
I was almost fascinated by you

661
00:37:55.052 --> 00:37:55.931
wait a moment

662
00:37:56.433 --> 00:37:57.577
everyone stop thinking

663
00:38:07.742 --> 00:38:08.671
Mother

664
00:38:08.746 --> 00:38:09.696
young master

665
00:38:10.852 --> 00:38:12.652
Why did you come here?

666
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.424
Where did you go, girl?

667
00:38:15.608 --> 00:38:18.471
The young master talks without thinking

668
00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.852
Even if he talks nonsense, don't pay attention to it.

669
00:38:19.877 --> 00:38:21.427
He is very kind and not a bad person

670
00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:26.634
Do you wish you were left out?

671
00:38:26.659 --> 00:38:28.162
How do you know my wish

672
00:38:28.187 --> 00:38:29.106
what

673
00:38:30.078 --> 00:38:32.393
Master, it will be good if she comes back safely

674
00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:36.993
The patient I was caring for was not feeling well, so I went to visit him.

675
00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:40.759
Thank you for taking so much trouble.

676
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.740
You're just so nosy anyway

677
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.624
Do you still want to be a medical woman now?

678
00:38:44.757 --> 00:38:46.602
The person who has passed away has passed away

679
00:38:46.742 --> 00:38:48.177
Those who are alive must live on

680
00:38:48.202 --> 00:38:49.927
I see you are not sad at all

681
00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:54.579
It's like waiting for the eldest father of this family to pass away

682
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.539
Mother, look

683
00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.314
This girl doesn't answer

684
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:02.248
I understand

685
00:39:02.518 --> 00:39:04.408
The reason why you concealed your husband's identity was that you insisted on getting married.

686
00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:05.517
It's all for a reason

687
00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:07.476
You already knew he would pass away

688
00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:11.195
No wonder you must marry even if your mother objects.

689
00:39:13.249 --> 00:39:19.104
Did I even hide this from my family?

690
00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:21.398
Still want to escape?

691
00:39:21.545 --> 00:39:24.404
Actually, you want to act like a lady from another hall, right?

692
00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:29.398
Yes, whatever you say

693
00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:33.282
Mother, let’s go

694
00:39:33.566 --> 00:39:35.301
We worry about her for nothing

695
00:39:43.842 --> 00:39:44.982
chat with me

696
00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:49.307
She is someone who only worries about me and my family.

697
00:39:52.248 --> 00:39:57.026
So I insisted on getting married against my mother’s wishes?

698
00:39:58.581 --> 00:40:02.695
Once you make up your mind, you will definitely do it

699
00:40:03.896 --> 00:40:06.692
No one can stop you, so I didn’t try to hold you back.

700
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:09.761
I understand too

701
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.186
You raised your daughter to be very stubborn

702
00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:16.176
in retrospect

703
00:40:16.533 --> 00:40:20.095
Maybe that's why I didn't stop you

704
00:40:21.269 --> 00:40:23.558
As a mother, I am really shameless.

705
00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:31.228
I'm asking this because I really don't understand.

706
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.737
Mother’s daughter…

707
00:40:35.775 --> 00:40:38.247
How should I feel now?

708
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:41.767
poor child

709
00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:45.000
Of course you won't know

710
00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:47.965
Because it's all buried

711
00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:52.719
Buried in the words "It doesn't matter"

712
00:41:01.858 --> 00:41:02.856
Your Majesty

713
00:41:07.587 --> 00:41:09.478
It has been confirmed that she has entered the house

714
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.247
Thank you for your hard work. Go and rest.

715
00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:15.472
That…

716
00:41:16.364 --> 00:41:19.204
When I followed your whereabouts, I discovered something

717
00:41:19.995 --> 00:41:23.963
Do you know that woman?

718
00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:26.454
Marrying someone?

719
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.623
In the end, it was discovered

720
00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.773
What a surprise

721
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:39.104
I was hoping at least he wouldn't know

722
00:41:40.226 --> 00:41:43.170
Your Majesty, are you okay?

723
00:41:44.667 --> 00:41:45.595
It's okay

724
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:47.645
It must be okay

725
00:41:49.567 --> 00:41:52.933
Does it mean I always put myself last?

726
00:41:54.233 --> 00:41:55.826
it's all my fault

727
00:41:57.214 --> 00:42:00.942
I only teach you to be patient and hold on.

728
00:42:05.433 --> 00:42:06.801
Sorry Eunjo

729
00:42:12.233 --> 00:42:14.479
It seems that this body should be protected the most.

730
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.673
It's my mother, right?

731
00:42:17.933 --> 00:42:20.795
No, don't do that

732
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.338
Take it

733
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.004
This is the money I borrowed from the Consul of the Art Museum.

734
00:42:31.107 --> 00:42:32.029
Why did you give me this money?

735
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.004
Although like you said

736
00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:39.317
After becoming the concubine of a powerful man, I don’t have to worry about food and clothing.

737
00:42:40.133 --> 00:42:42.500
I don’t have to worry about money and my life is very stable.

738
00:42:43.167 --> 00:42:44.551
Dan Enzu

739
00:42:45.642 --> 00:42:47.010
Even if life is good

740
00:42:47.723 --> 00:42:49.451
Even if life is really good

741
00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:52.801
If one day you feel regret and want to run away

742
00:42:53.467 --> 00:42:54.826
Just take this money and go

743
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.987
I heard that as long as you escape to the Ming Dynasty, no one will catch you.

744
00:43:03.108 --> 00:43:05.531
Leave me and the Superintendent alone

745
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:07.687
Go far away

746
00:43:09.208 --> 00:43:11.556
Promise your mother about this, okay?

747
00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:23.853
If it were the original well-behaved daughter

748
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.856
I will definitely agree

749
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.256
But now I have to make another promise

750
00:43:33.023 --> 00:43:34.103
what is

751
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.287
I won't let a drop of water get on your hands

752
00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:57.871
How did that go?

753
00:43:58.333 --> 00:44:00.512
We used the name of the thief Ji Tong

754
00:44:05.467 --> 00:44:06.559
Ji Tong?

755
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.943
They are the thieves who robbed Da Si Jian's warehouse.

756
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:10.865
Da Sijian also mentioned that person before he passed away

757
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.457
I hate that thief so much

758
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.046
No one should doubt

759
00:44:21.404 --> 00:44:22.353
black sword

760
00:44:27.475 --> 00:44:28.706
What's going on in the Robbery Hall?

761
00:44:28.803 --> 00:44:31.112
They are searching for the whereabouts of people around Da Si Jian

762
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.659
Don't leave this to anyone else

763
00:44:33.684 --> 00:44:35.031
Watch it yourself

764
00:44:35.567 --> 00:44:36.268
Yes

765
00:44:41.522 --> 00:44:45.489
Is this North Korea what you got?

766
00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:46.914
you guy

767
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.321
Aren't you afraid of divine punishment?

768
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.828
If the Lord knows

769
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.690
You will definitely be punished by the three tribes

770
00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:55.434
punished with lingchi

771
00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:58.340
If you want to live

772
00:44:58.571 --> 00:45:02.338
Give me half of the country of Korea

773
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.837
The so-called greed...

774
00:45:08.335 --> 00:45:11.502
When a fool becomes greedy, he is seeking his own death.

775
00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:18.901
Remember to engrave this lesson on your rotting flesh

776
00:46:07.775 --> 00:46:10.559
You may meet other royal families during the day

777
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:12.482
While everyone is asleep

778
00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:14.225
Memorize the location of the palace

779
00:46:23.817 --> 00:46:24.984
Zhang Shurong

780
00:46:25.318 --> 00:46:27.902
She is Jinlu who has only heard rumors

781
00:46:49.931 --> 00:46:51.258
It's medicinal

782
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.821
Where did it come from?

783
00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:06.149
First time I smell this smell

784
00:47:06.798 --> 00:47:10.799
Although inhaling smoke from burning medicinal herbs can alleviate symptoms

785
00:47:11.067 --> 00:47:14.991
If there is so much smoke that it spreads outside the house, it will be dangerous.

786
00:47:15.314 --> 00:47:16.976
Who would treat this way?

787
00:47:18.955 --> 00:47:20.148
Kangnyeongjeon

788
00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.345
His Royal Highness's sleeping quarters

789
00:47:24.567 --> 00:47:27.357
No matter what happens, I cannot see His Highness.

790
00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:29.798
No

791
00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:32.635
There's a time and a place to meddle in other people's business, right?

792
00:47:43.103 --> 00:47:44.486
Your Majesty?

793
00:47:53.907 --> 00:47:56.807
Can't let others know I've been here

794
00:47:58.605 --> 00:47:59.745
Yes

795
00:48:01.326 --> 00:48:03.560
The treatment going on in the dormitory...

796
00:48:14.223 --> 00:48:15.270
It’s so noisy…

797
00:48:15.742 --> 00:48:17.620
The little one is deeply frightened, Your Highness.

798
00:48:18.184 --> 00:48:19.417
Are you suffering from sores?

799
00:48:19.742 --> 00:48:20.832
Yes

800
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:23.398
What's the matter

801
00:48:23.664 --> 00:48:24.831
Please be quiet

802
00:48:24.856 --> 00:48:26.626
What should I do if I wake up His Highness later?

803
00:48:46.116 --> 00:48:47.051
Palace…

804
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:48.826
Next?

805
00:49:00.596 --> 00:49:02.741
Do you want to confirm the medicinal materials?

806
00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:05.804
Yes, Your Highness

807
00:49:06.084 --> 00:49:07.767
The little one goes out for a walk

808
00:49:08.775 --> 00:49:11.467
Your Highness, the smoke must be dispersed outside the house first.

809
00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:14.082
You guys come here to help. We need to ventilate it first.

810
00:49:15.175 --> 00:49:16.226
You guys move faster

811
00:49:23.103 --> 00:49:24.660
what are you doing

812
00:49:26.949 --> 00:49:29.051
Your Highness, no matter what kind of treatment

813
00:49:29.076 --> 00:49:30.898
Excessive use will cause side effects

814
00:49:30.923 --> 00:49:33.356
Do you want to refute the doctor's prescription?

815
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.182
Of course I don't dare

816
00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:35.882
But according to my experience

817
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.298
For sores, you must drink water boiled from bezoar and honeysuckle.

818
00:49:38.323 --> 00:49:40.890
Apply ointment and ventilate frequently to facilitate recovery

819
00:49:40.942 --> 00:49:42.775
I hope you don't rely on new medicinal materials

820
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.082
Existing treatments must be tried simultaneously

821
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.963
It seems you know my symptoms very well

822
00:49:52.046 --> 00:49:53.813
That makes you look so disappointed

823
00:49:54.175 --> 00:49:56.223
Because it’s not a terminal illness

824
00:49:56.767 --> 00:49:57.420
what

825
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.732
That's not what I meant by being small

826
00:49:59.773 --> 00:50:01.248
Just in the smoke

827
00:50:01.504 --> 00:50:03.363
Seeing you in pain

828
00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:05.692
what did you say

829
00:50:07.475 --> 00:50:10.401
Although the sore wound is not big, it is easy to ignore it

830
00:50:11.101 --> 00:50:13.929
However, it is easy for patients to have such minor injuries affect their daily lives.

831
00:50:14.704 --> 00:50:16.910
Over time, it will affect your life

832
00:50:17.908 --> 00:50:21.448
As a result, patients suffering from disease

833
00:50:21.973 --> 00:50:23.648
My heart will gradually become sick

834
00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.241
I just want to lighten some of your burdens

835
00:50:27.933 --> 00:50:29.976
That's out of proportion. You're meddling in other people's business.

836
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:42.067
It sounded so sincere that I almost choked up.

837
00:50:43.434 --> 00:50:44.332
Back off

838
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.517
Yes, Your Highness

839
00:50:56.438 --> 00:50:57.763
I actually saw His Highness the Lord

840
00:50:59.737 --> 00:51:01.820
Is his relationship with the Maharaja not good?

841
00:51:14.967 --> 00:51:16.504
Let's go back to the dormitory

842
00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.170
The time has come for people to decide...

843
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.917
I was so flustered that I didn’t even think about Ji Dong’s side.

844
00:51:29.007 --> 00:51:30.820
Have you caught the real culprit?

845
00:51:31.604 --> 00:51:35.036
Still in the period of confinement and unable to leave the palace

846
00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:37.267
What to do

847
00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.479
Are you saying it's not Ji Tong?

848
00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:43.173
Isn’t it written in the blood book?

849
00:51:43.198 --> 00:51:46.107
We're investigating people who have a grudge against sinners

850
00:51:46.683 --> 00:51:50.432
Do you think my adults are sinners?

851
00:51:51.288 --> 00:51:53.398
It would be unjust enough just to die.

852
00:51:53.423 --> 00:51:55.407
He actually regarded him as a sinner

853
00:51:55.432 --> 00:51:57.265
You bad guys

854
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.673
You send her home

855
00:51:58.698 --> 00:51:59.360
Yes

856
00:52:00.132 --> 00:52:02.107
let me go

857
00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:12.945
Ji Tong?

858
00:52:14.168 --> 00:52:15.023
catch up

859
00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:19.465
Ji Dong, this damn guy

860
00:52:24.097 --> 00:52:25.857
No shooting allowed, must be captured alive

861
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:38.807
Sir

862
00:52:38.832 --> 00:52:41.065
Report this matter to your Majesty immediately

863
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:41.817
obey

864
00:53:20.113 --> 00:53:22.210
I actually got a glimpse of North Korea's most traitorous official

865
00:53:23.407 --> 00:53:27.494
Du Chengzhi Ren Shiheng’s family secrets

866
00:53:35.922 --> 00:53:36.947
Zhang Shurong?

867
00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.326
Why are you here dressed like this?

868
00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.136
Lord Daoyue seems to know the truth about the medicinal materials

869
00:54:03.935 --> 00:54:05.116
Lord Daoyue?

870
00:54:06.555 --> 00:54:07.485
yes

871
00:54:08.167 --> 00:54:09.541
He took away all the incense

872
00:54:22.967 --> 00:54:23.988
What's going on

873
00:54:24.289 --> 00:54:27.453
How could they mention my banned account?

874
00:54:27.478 --> 00:54:29.638
Ji Tong was arrested

875
00:54:29.663 --> 00:54:31.297
Oops, lucky boy... lucky boy?

876
00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.063
I heard he was caught by the Robbery Hall

877
00:54:34.033 --> 00:54:36.400
What should people do?

878
00:54:38.606 --> 00:54:39.441
Enzu

879
00:54:40.618 --> 00:54:41.525
Enzu

880
00:54:42.274 --> 00:54:43.703
are you from the cemetery

881
00:54:44.016 --> 00:54:45.882
Are you feeling well?

882
00:54:46.376 --> 00:54:47.019
much better

883
00:54:47.374 --> 00:54:49.338
But what does it mean that Ji Dong was arrested?

884
00:54:49.934 --> 00:54:51.367
I just heard about it too

885
00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:54.159
I heard that Ji Tong was hit by an arrow yesterday.

886
00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:56.247
what

887
00:54:58.705 --> 00:54:59.603
Enzu

888
00:55:00.921 --> 00:55:02.821
Did the Lord disappear out of thin air again?

889
00:55:03.422 --> 00:55:05.088
Seeing that there was no movement inside, I went in to take a look.

890
00:55:05.113 --> 00:55:06.685
But found that the person was no longer there

891
00:55:09.308 --> 00:55:10.722
The case is settled

892
00:55:10.833 --> 00:55:11.666
Yes

893
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.343
Wait

894
00:55:17.195 --> 00:55:18.091
Doctor Hong

895
00:55:31.629 --> 00:55:34.231
Is this person Ji Dong?

896
00:55:40.163 --> 00:55:43.496
The adults folded the bedding and night clothes so neatly?

897
00:55:44.123 --> 00:55:45.490
Not only that

898
00:55:45.858 --> 00:55:48.503
The adults even cleaned

899
00:55:49.389 --> 00:55:50.569
Something is wrong

900
00:55:51.665 --> 00:55:53.106
Go to the Maharaja immediately

901
00:55:53.378 --> 00:55:54.342
What happened?

902
00:55:54.367 --> 00:55:55.503
scared me

903
00:55:56.035 --> 00:55:57.788
Sir, where have you run to?

904
00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.000
In the inner hospital, I went to boil the medicine and deliver it to the concubine’s palace.

905
00:56:01.056 --> 00:56:01.731
what

906
00:56:02.486 --> 00:56:05.503
I feel like this is the only way to alleviate the guilt in my heart

907
00:56:06.498 --> 00:56:08.756
Then why fold the bedding and night clothes?

908
00:56:09.644 --> 00:56:10.646
Easy to fold when you wake up

909
00:56:10.807 --> 00:56:12.272
Why didn't you tell us?

910
00:56:12.756 --> 00:56:15.423
Did you put on the clothes yourself?

911
00:56:16.098 --> 00:56:18.085
Yes, I want you to sleep more

912
00:56:20.058 --> 00:56:21.158
if we make any mistakes

913
00:56:21.183 --> 00:56:23.783
please tell us directly lord

914
00:56:23.808 --> 00:56:24.872
What's wrong

915
00:56:24.897 --> 00:56:26.806
Send the doctor in immediately. Immediately.

916
00:56:27.295 --> 00:56:28.429
What's going on with you guys?

917
00:56:28.454 --> 00:56:29.475
Your Majesty

918
00:56:30.781 --> 00:56:33.091
Officer Park from the Robbery Bureau asked for an audience.

919
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:35.560
Has the news gotten out?

920
00:56:38.808 --> 00:56:41.675
Ji Tong died on the spot after being hit by an arrow

921
00:56:43.142 --> 00:56:45.975
Ji Tong is dead?

922
00:56:47.673 --> 00:56:48.791
Where is the fake lucky boy?

923
00:56:49.342 --> 00:56:50.397
Disposed of

924
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.816
Clean it up yourself

925
00:56:53.067 --> 00:56:53.794
obey

926
00:57:04.084 --> 00:57:05.141
Buried

927
00:57:07.545 --> 00:57:09.019
Have a good trip, Ji Tong

928
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:10.923
Let's go Yes

929
00:57:18.351 --> 00:57:22.475
Maybe the real murderer will come and take away the body of the fake Ji Tong

930
00:59:15.233 --> 00:59:16.966
Still collected neatly

931
00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:17.791
This is…

932
00:59:17.816 --> 00:59:18.913
Do I really have that?

933
00:59:18.944 --> 00:59:20.311
Are they really collected neatly?

934
00:59:20.336 --> 00:59:21.860
I really can't stand it

935
00:59:21.885 --> 00:59:23.618
So what should I do?

936
00:59:23.643 --> 00:59:27.143
Is it because I don’t know how to read people’s emotions? Did I come in too early?

937
00:59:27.168 --> 00:59:29.643
From now on, count to ten at the door before coming in.

938
00:59:29.668 --> 00:59:31.201
The way you look at me

939
00:59:31.233 --> 00:59:32.571
Shaking very violently

940
00:59:32.596 --> 00:59:33.762
what do you want

941
00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:35.786
I want you not to do anything

942
00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:38.761
Your majesty keeps getting in my way for some reason

943
00:59:39.168 --> 00:59:41.355
Your Majesty's maid, please stay.
