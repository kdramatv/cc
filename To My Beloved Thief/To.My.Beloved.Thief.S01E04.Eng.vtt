﻿1
00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:11.704
That man also knows...

2
00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:14.285
Are you going to marry a septuagenarian?

3
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.910
Your expression is getting more and more interesting the more I look at it

4
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:27.935
If that kid knew, it would be more interesting

5
00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.282
Hello

6
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.942
Say it yourself

7
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.879
I am...who?

8
00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.101
Didn't you say you were an uninvited guest?

9
00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.616
Then let's take it for granted.

10
00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:07.482
This…

11
00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:11.763
Just the man I'm attracted to

12
00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:18.713
And we are getting married soon

13
00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:28.091
By the way, this is an officer from the Bureau of Robbery.

14
00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:33.763
As for the name…

15
00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:34.773
pleasure

16
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.463
this is my name

17
00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:42.085
If it goes as you said

18
00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:45.167
I have no interest in sharing my first name with you right now.

19
00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:48.422
So that’s it for introducing each other.

20
00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:54.567
It's dark. I don't know why you came here.

21
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.599
Just think of it as disciplining the family.

22
00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:07.310
Hello Eunjo

23
00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:09.604
Did you come here with my young master?

24
00:02:10.614 --> 00:02:11.407
young master

25
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.810
How much wine did you drink?

26
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.769
What's going on with the blood on your face?

27
00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:18.748
are you injured

28
00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:20.429
You stand up first

29
00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:24.657
Has Zai Yi left?

30
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.275
future in-laws

31
00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.582
Okay…

32
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.376
You stand up first

33
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:37.301
When will that guy Enzu come over?

34
00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:39.826
Didn't you say you'd come over after your shift?

35
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:43.118
Are you delaying treatment because you are helping someone again?

36
00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:44.113
Yes

37
00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:47.270
How can such a good life be without my benefactor?

38
00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:48.113
That's right

39
00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:49.517
Start with me

40
00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:52.497
Is there anyone here who has not received help from Eunjo?

41
00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.222
That's right, that's right

42
00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:55.222
no one

43
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.864
Come on…

44
00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.032
Who is Eunjo?

45
00:02:59.057 --> 00:02:59.854
She

46
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.571
It's that Dr. Hong who works at the Huimin Office.

47
00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:05.935
Welfare Department

48
00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.192
My adults should be there too.

49
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.967
Hello

50
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.101
The word "discipline"

51
00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.179
It's a word that people like me, who are law-abiding, would use.

52
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040
Is this what you should say to a woman who is about to get married?

53
00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:31.495
I'm not talking about her

54
00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:36.607
What I am controlling is the way you, the officer, look at her.

55
00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:38.201
Then you can see it quite clearly

56
00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.753
unfortunately

57
00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:42.012
She has just drawn an insurmountable line for me

58
00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:43.768
In other words

59
00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:47.093
She has always been well-behaved and has never had to be disciplined.

60
00:03:47.118 --> 00:03:48.856
This will not be possible in the future

61
00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.715
As a future husband, you should at least know this

62
00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:58.446
When are you going to punch?

63
00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:01.470
It looks like he's about to punch. I'd better get out of the way first.

64
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:03.821
I've always been more mature

65
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.059
It’s no longer the age to shake fists at every turn

66
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.812
Besides, in my capacity

67
00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:13.668
Mostly swords are used

68
00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.853
If you want to make things easier, I can also give you poisonous wine directly.

69
00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:19.924
It's scary. Should I be scared?

70
00:04:20.054 --> 00:04:21.034
if necessary

71
00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.687
Why are so many people in the world attracted to these women?

72
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:27.141
What you said has been very unpleasant since just now.

73
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.659
because that's the truth

74
00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:31.154
That girl was just sold to our house

75
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.022
She can only be regarded as a concubine at best...

76
00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.187
I really can't listen anymore

77
00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:35.925
I treated you politely just now because you are the person Hong Enzu is going to marry.

78
00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:38.544
what are you doing

79
00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:40.547
what is this doing

80
00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:41.581
get out of the way

81
00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:42.694
why do this

82
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.787
How interesting

83
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.275
Please go back

84
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.857
Thank you for your help during this time

85
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:57.691
From now on we won't meet again

86
00:04:59.283 --> 00:05:02.616
Eunjo Hong Eunjo

87
00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:07.329
Enzu

88
00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:11.916
What's going on with this triangular confrontation?

89
00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:13.925
This atmosphere…

90
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.430
We should get to know each other and leave, right?

91
00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:21.306
Everyone just took ten steps back

92
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:24.595
one two three…

93
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.872
I'm here too

94
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:27.141
I knew you were here

95
00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:28.633
As long as you know, come here

96
00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:29.625
What's wrong? Isn't the person there?

97
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.609
wait a moment

98
00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:36.547
I will go back with you as an officer.

99
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:43.028
That's what I meant

100
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.437
Go ahead and ask

101
00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.247
Aren't you the right-hand man of the great king?

102
00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:07.605
Aren't you also the confidant of the great king?

103
00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:12.237
Sir

104
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.966
What happened between you and Dr. Hong?

105
00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:22.369
Sir…

106
00:06:29.498 --> 00:06:32.175
I apologize to you on his behalf for what happened just now.

107
00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:34.755
Looks like I'm not an uninvited guest

108
00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.287
Instead, I helped you.

109
00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:37.959
It actually has both

110
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:39.769
Then your expression should be happier, right?

111
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.400
At least I helped you keep it

112
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:45.025
The last self-esteem you don’t want to be seen through by a man who likes you

113
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:52.000
So they were so happy

114
00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:53.397
live for a long time

115
00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:56.806
Even as a wicked girl

116
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.634
Maybe I’d also imagine being remembered like this.

117
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:06.644
I didn't mean anything else, but that's it

118
00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.272
It's okay for you to tell him now

119
00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:10.384
If you want to trample even that point...

120
00:07:15.192 --> 00:07:17.237
I will take this debt back today fiercely.

121
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:19.106
please

122
00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:46.859
Those two gentlemen

123
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:50.103
It seems like there was a big fight over Eunjo.

124
00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:52.500
Who is that young man next to you?

125
00:07:52.963 --> 00:07:55.715
What a mystery

126
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.653
You are here

127
00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:58.721
Looking at his posture, he looks like he is the son of a wealthy family.

128
00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:00.759
Did Dr. Hong ever tell me who he was?

129
00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:02.850
She never mentioned it

130
00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.415
When I saw her in the morning, her face was quite gloomy.

131
00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:08.559
What about our senior official?

132
00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:09.468
He is absent from work today

133
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:11.243
Having said that

134
00:08:11.538 --> 00:08:15.187
Have you heard anything about Ji Dong?

135
00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:16.834
What happened to Ji Tong?

136
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.743
Could it be because of that rumor?

137
00:08:21.988 --> 00:08:22.800
Rumor?

138
00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:25.990
End it quickly

139
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.812
Have you checked it out?

140
00:08:32.706 --> 00:08:34.200
This is Lord Du Chengzhi’s eldest son

141
00:08:34.225 --> 00:08:36.725
Items brought back from the Ming Dynasty to be transported to the palace

142
00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:40.137
Isn't this a seed?

143
00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:42.190
where is this to be used

144
00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:55.365
I've been feeling extremely sleepy and weak lately

145
00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:57.937
The weather is getting warmer, so you will be so sleepy, right?

146
00:08:59.383 --> 00:09:00.064
Right

147
00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:03.993
Where did Lord Daoyue get that document?

148
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.944
It is said that I picked it up by accident.

149
00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.259
Your Highness will not believe this statement, right?

150
00:09:10.263 --> 00:09:12.490
As long as my stepmother is alive

151
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.290
It seems like there are some fun old stories between the brothers.

152
00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:19.443
I'm sleepy

153
00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.000
All agree

154
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.387
Now that it's over, what else can there be to say in response?

155
00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:31.196
No, it seems that I am overly worried.

156
00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:39.506
The position of Da Sijian is still vacant.

157
00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:42.187
Who should be put in this position...

158
00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:45.925
Hong Minzhi

159
00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:48.671
He is an old friend of yours, right?

160
00:09:52.995 --> 00:09:55.131
Even now, I am still looking for Superintendent Hong Minzhi.

161
00:09:55.623 --> 00:09:57.375
It’s really hard to understand the Lord’s thoughts

162
00:09:58.184 --> 00:10:00.350
He wants them all

163
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:02.803
The force of tyrants and the achievements of saintly kings

164
00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:03.900
Don't miss anything

165
00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:06.593
Superintendent Hong’s so-called blunt advice

166
00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:08.765
They are all threatening my father.

167
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.071
If the father cannot decide, then leave it to the child.

168
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:17.581
Didn’t Superintendent Hong stay ill for many years after he collapsed in the Gengwu year?

169
00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:19.440
Didn't wake up until a year ago?

170
00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:22.462
Even if he died today and tomorrow, no one would be suspicious...

171
00:10:23.693 --> 00:10:25.537
Be careful with your words

172
00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:28.581
He is my best friend in this life

173
00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.071
Please inform His Highness on my behalf

174
00:10:32.207 --> 00:10:35.390
I still don't have full freedom of movement

175
00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:37.718
Are you refusing?

176
00:10:38.122 --> 00:10:40.275
If I sit back in the position of chief minister again,

177
00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:42.425
Sooner or later my family will

178
00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:45.421
Will we encounter disaster like the Gengwu Year again?

179
00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:48.778
I can't let that child Eunjo

180
00:10:49.037 --> 00:10:51.456
Bear that pain again

181
00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:55.378
Why are you so sure of the outcome?

182
00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:59.328
Because I am a person who cannot bend down

183
00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:09.415
How about taking a teaching position in a college?

184
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.534
I can write a recommendation letter for you

185
00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:16.259
That salary is enough to support the family.

186
00:11:18.046 --> 00:11:19.615
Always take care of you

187
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.178
Pingyan thank you

188
00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.275
It's my turn to thank you

189
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.274
Save me from being the shameless person who takes the life of my best friend

190
00:11:50.767 --> 00:11:52.174
Should we ask them to retreat first?

191
00:11:53.517 --> 00:11:56.017
I heard that the empress had an uneasy sleep at night

192
00:11:58.423 --> 00:12:03.056
My night sleep has long been dedicated to my only child

193
00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:08.826
On the other hand, the face of Zhongdian is not very good either.

194
00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:12.763
I am also because of my only husband...

195
00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:16.160
Please forgive me for omitting the following

196
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.754
Fortunately, there is still a nave in this deserted palace.

197
00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:29.654
Not long ago, the king entered Kangnyeong Palace

198
00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.969
You should have heard about it

199
00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:32.191
yes

200
00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:36.613
What on earth was he thinking that he went to see the Lord alone?

201
00:12:38.498 --> 00:12:40.663
Although the inside story is unknown

202
00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:42.569
But judging from the results, we are brothers who are of the same mind

203
00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:44.872
Eliminate corrupt officials

204
00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:47.116
Just treat it as such

205
00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:50.447
The Lord’s temptation must have a reason

206
00:12:50.868 --> 00:12:52.535
Have you forgotten what happened in the Gengwu Year?

207
00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:54.760
Then wait for the tragedy...

208
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:58.666
How could it be forgotten so easily

209
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:03.866
I said unnecessary things

210
00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.613
Let's not talk about politics here.

211
00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:09.491
Right

212
00:13:09.886 --> 00:13:12.682
I'm also inquiring about Maharaja's marriage.

213
00:13:14.068 --> 00:13:15.016
Really?

214
00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:19.491
Concubine

215
00:13:24.756 --> 00:13:26.229
Is the Maharaja inside?

216
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.413
I must finalize the marriage today...

217
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.866
Why is the imperial doctor also there...

218
00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:34.116
Is Yue'er sick?

219
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.113
No other symptoms

220
00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:37.454
Just these few days...

221
00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.976
Feeling extremely restless

222
00:13:56.699 --> 00:13:57.729
It’s really…

223
00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.660
Why is this music so sad?

224
00:13:59.685 --> 00:14:00.951
Didn’t I tell you to boost your spirits?

225
00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:05.344
My stomach hurts

226
00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:06.435
Don't you think it's funny?

227
00:14:06.806 --> 00:14:08.147
Why is it funny

228
00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:10.395
Because I'm laughing

229
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.997
I already said I want to laugh, can't you agree with me?

230
00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:13.545
How about grabbing it?

231
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.651
Spot the mole first, then take revenge

232
00:14:17.663 --> 00:14:18.601
what do you think

233
00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:20.040
Sir

234
00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:22.601
I am the king of this country

235
00:14:22.943 --> 00:14:24.443
If you want to grab it, are you afraid that you won't be able to grab it?

236
00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:27.969
I'll show you

237
00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:29.501
What is omnipresent power?

238
00:14:32.522 --> 00:14:34.022
She was completely unmoved

239
00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:36.888
The wealth and power I have

240
00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.985
status, bearing, appearance

241
00:14:41.365 --> 00:14:43.754
Most people are tempted by just one of these items

242
00:14:46.657 --> 00:14:50.185
She just won't be tempted by anything.

243
00:14:51.622 --> 00:14:53.038
This is from the Royal Medical Clinic

244
00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:55.397
A document recording the illness of your Majesty

245
00:14:55.422 --> 00:14:57.926
The Empress ordered that the disease be spread to medical clinics across the country

246
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:00.751
Gathering everyone’s wisdom to find out the name of the disease

247
00:15:01.737 --> 00:15:02.491
Fire sickness?

248
00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:04.141
Could it be madness?

249
00:15:10.533 --> 00:15:11.988
do you have any ideas

250
00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:16.163
Are you asking me?

251
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:17.029
Now we need everyone to come up with ideas

252
00:15:17.054 --> 00:15:18.820
Even just one person’s idea is important

253
00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:21.116
Don't worry too much. Let's listen.

254
00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:27.382
Happy, Angry, Worry, Thought, Sadness, Fear, Surprise

255
00:15:28.697 --> 00:15:31.204
From the point of view of disorder of the seven emotions

256
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.307
I'd venture to guess that I might be suffering from depression.

257
00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:38.709
Don’t you think that Maharaja’s symptoms are very similar to lovelorn?

258
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:40.988
Lovelorn?

259
00:15:41.996 --> 00:15:43.116
Is that so?

260
00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:54.022
From today on we won't meet again

261
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.085
That's what I meant

262
00:15:58.148 --> 00:15:59.138
Lovelorn…

263
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.219
Is it such a painful thing?

264
00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:05.235
what did you say

265
00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:07.779
nothing

266
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:10.707
How can anyone dare to get rid of the Maharaja?

267
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.494
On the contrary, I think it was a wise move for the medical woman to reject you.

268
00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:27.488
Meet and separate rashly

269
00:16:27.513 --> 00:16:29.704
Wouldn't it be of no use to her?

270
00:16:32.273 --> 00:16:34.172
Who said I was rash?

271
00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:35.635
Are you planning to take her as your concubine?

272
00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:36.912
Not married yet

273
00:16:36.937 --> 00:16:37.737
If the concubine knew about it

274
00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:39.029
There will definitely be a fuss afterwards

275
00:16:39.054 --> 00:16:41.116
You made your wishful thinking too early

276
00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.626
Not to mention it was a trick, it didn't even start.

277
00:16:43.724 --> 00:16:44.735
That's right

278
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.757
Since it hasn't started yet

279
00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:47.166
Of course there is nothing to forget

280
00:16:49.097 --> 00:16:49.801
Yes

281
00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:52.982
Her face is still imprinted in my mind

282
00:16:55.028 --> 00:16:56.819
Your expression is getting more and more interesting the more I look at it

283
00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:00.791
To put it bluntly, I really don’t like that medical woman.

284
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:01.876
They already have fiancés

285
00:17:01.901 --> 00:17:03.207
Why did I do that to you that night?

286
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:08.669
Here we go again, I really can’t stand it

287
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:11.976
what's going on

288
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.754
Destroyed?

289
00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:17.710
Are you praying for their relationship to break up now?

290
00:17:30.422 --> 00:17:31.435
Lord Superintendent

291
00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:32.919
Are you ready to leave the palace?

292
00:17:33.232 --> 00:17:35.832
Do you want to walk back together?

293
00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:39.372
are you waiting for me

294
00:17:39.538 --> 00:17:41.216
can't i do this

295
00:17:43.222 --> 00:17:44.297
Of course that's good

296
00:17:52.332 --> 00:17:53.685
what are you thinking

297
00:17:56.216 --> 00:17:58.104
This scene feels strange to me

298
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.569
Until a year ago you were still bedridden

299
00:18:02.001 --> 00:18:05.232
I never thought I'd be able to walk with you like this

300
00:18:06.978 --> 00:18:10.332
Pingyan recommended a position to me

301
00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:14.438
He said there is an academy in Nanyuan that needs teachers

302
00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.879
I agreed

303
00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:21.279
Do you actually have to go that far away?

304
00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:24.510
With your current physical condition, it should be difficult for you to bear the burden.

305
00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:27.003
Not too forced

306
00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:30.292
Instead of wasting time here

307
00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:31.682
Maybe it wouldn't be so hard to teach there.

308
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.866
When do you plan to leave?

309
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:36.385
I'm leaving in a few days

310
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:39.891
Should arrive on the day classes start

311
00:18:40.844 --> 00:18:44.054
So will you set off before the wedding?

312
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.066
Yeah, what a pity

313
00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:50.504
It turns out that the adults made this trip because they couldn’t let go.

314
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.960
Leaving before the wedding might be a good thing

315
00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:59.400
How I want to see your rouged face

316
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:03.656
I will cheer up

317
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.172
Have a good wedding

318
00:19:16.796 --> 00:19:19.896
Then let me help you prepare the medicinal materials you need to take on the way.

319
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.985
You don't have to worry

320
00:19:22.316 --> 00:19:24.044
If you want to find good medicinal materials

321
00:19:24.069 --> 00:19:26.078
You have to start looking for it now

322
00:19:36.749 --> 00:19:38.038
Even as a wicked woman

323
00:19:38.353 --> 00:19:40.397
Maybe I’d also imagine being remembered like this.

324
00:19:41.155 --> 00:19:42.897
Are you planning how to break off the engagement again?

325
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.403
Don't use admiration as a pretext

326
00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:50.413
What's the real reason you want to ruin your marriage?

327
00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.741
where are you going

328
00:19:58.917 --> 00:19:59.950
to ruin this marriage.

329
00:20:04.498 --> 00:20:06.913
The king actually had a relationship with a medical woman

330
00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:09.940
Other than that, there is nothing unusual

331
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.444
However, the young master met the Maharaja at the Huimin Office before going back.

332
00:20:22.204 --> 00:20:24.213
Now I can finally see my father.

333
00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:28.053
I've been here several times but all failed, and I feel deeply disappointed.

334
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.428
Who did you just go see?

335
00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:38.250
What's going on with this concern-filled question?

336
00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:41.241
I don't seem to deserve this kind of treatment

337
00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:43.291
Yes

338
00:20:44.862 --> 00:20:48.799
Your only advantage is that you know how many layers you have

339
00:20:53.065 --> 00:20:54.086
Dad

340
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.077
I overheard your conversation with your mother

341
00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.040
Am I not my mother’s biological flesh and blood?

342
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.993
Is he the son of a prostitute from a humble background?

343
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:03.699
so stupid

344
00:21:04.313 --> 00:21:05.824
If you pretend not to hear

345
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.311
At least I can deceive myself

346
00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.427
Then why do you want me to grow up as your eldest son?

347
00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.908
Is it because dad only has one son, his elder brother?

348
00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:16.833
you don't need to be disappointed

349
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.280
To seal the mouth of your prostitute mother

350
00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:21.361
I paid a lot of price

351
00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:25.183
So you are not worthless

352
00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:29.005
The livestock sold cost a lot of money.

353
00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:31.836
Are you taking credit from me?

354
00:21:39.236 --> 00:21:42.115
I have already helped you get the number one scholar that your government is so eager for.

355
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.727
In the future, I will also get you the official position you want.

356
00:21:44.838 --> 00:21:46.799
Now it's my turn to take some credit

357
00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:50.274
Please cancel your marriage to the Zhongdian family

358
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.899
I don't want to be a stud who just sows seeds

359
00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:54.965
It's a pity that your usefulness only ends here

360
00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:59.602
I don't want to imitate someone

361
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.843
Let any defective products come out

362
00:22:08.021 --> 00:22:12.427
So you just want to ruin my good deeds?

363
00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:16.036
See you are so angry

364
00:22:18.322 --> 00:22:20.608
It seems that I should have succeeded

365
00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:25.502
are you injured

366
00:22:26.271 --> 00:22:27.502
This guy...

367
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.440
What happened to him

368
00:22:38.955 --> 00:22:41.515
Have you mentioned the secret record to Zai Yi?

369
00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:42.693
No

370
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.340
Didn’t you say it’s not yet time?

371
00:22:54.397 --> 00:22:55.983
This is the medicine we adults need to take

372
00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:57.274
Please take more trouble

373
00:22:57.308 --> 00:22:58.502
No problem

374
00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:02.318
Come

375
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.533
she is smiling again

376
00:23:05.136 --> 00:23:06.461
What's so funny

377
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.880
Uncle, please give me a pound of Huang Qi.

378
00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:14.868
what are you doing

379
00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:19.974
Didn’t I say I would ask you to repay me twice as much?

380
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:23.624
Let me go, I tell you to let me go

381
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:30.590
Are you like this because of what happened last time?

382
00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:34.343
I think you are an eyesore

383
00:23:35.523 --> 00:23:36.599
What happened to me

384
00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:38.855
A mere evil girl dares to act like a younger sister

385
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.280
What else does Shen Qing sacrifice for his blind father?

386
00:23:41.305 --> 00:23:44.561
He even dreamed of being happy until old age

387
00:23:44.586 --> 00:23:46.855
All this is an eyesore to me

388
00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.536
It's better to live a miserable life

389
00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.700
Don't just smile when nothing happens

390
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.455
Even if it’s crying, getting angry, or being resentful, that’s fine

391
00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:57.245
Because in real life

392
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.805
There is no emperor who will come forward to rescue Shen Qing

393
00:24:04.432 --> 00:24:05.811
So what is your conclusion?

394
00:24:06.523 --> 00:24:08.680
Do you want me to break off the engagement again?

395
00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:11.392
This marriage…

396
00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:12.851
No

397
00:24:14.292 --> 00:24:16.180
It should be a transaction

398
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.411
This deal…

399
00:24:18.543 --> 00:24:19.614
as you said

400
00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:21.539
She's just a naughty girl like me

401
00:24:21.913 --> 00:24:25.030
Just a struggle to survive

402
00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:27.358
So I can't give up easily

403
00:24:29.517 --> 00:24:31.148
thank you for your charity

404
00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:53.945
Why are you so careless?

405
00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:01.567
What's going on? What's your expression?

406
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:11.914
I asked you what happened

407
00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:14.114
Is something wrong?

408
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:22.595
Of course I would be frightened if you appeared out of nowhere.

409
00:25:23.094 --> 00:25:24.036
Why are you here...

410
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.723
Are you here to find me?

411
00:25:29.648 --> 00:25:30.714
Don't be sentimental

412
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.520
I originally wanted to answer you like this

413
00:25:33.707 --> 00:25:34.486
But you were right

414
00:25:35.264 --> 00:25:36.230
I went to the Huimin Office

415
00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:37.433
I heard you were looking for a medicine dealer

416
00:25:37.939 --> 00:25:39.298
So I chased after him relentlessly.

417
00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:58.526
why are you looking for me

418
00:25:58.551 --> 00:25:59.629
when are you going to get married

419
00:25:59.654 --> 00:26:01.161
Next year? Or the year after tomorrow?

420
00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:03.642
It's no good if we keep bumping into each other

421
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.223
It's better not to give him hope

422
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.948
Ten days later

423
00:26:07.703 --> 00:26:08.545
Ten days…

424
00:26:09.814 --> 00:26:12.181
I'm afraid we don't have time to flirt or laugh.

425
00:26:12.222 --> 00:26:14.017
Enjoy the atmosphere and get to know each other better

426
00:26:14.435 --> 00:26:14.998
what

427
00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:16.961
what do you like

428
00:26:16.986 --> 00:26:19.736
Food, scenery, jewelry, paintings, or musical preferences?

429
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.948
No. Where is a better place to start?

430
00:26:22.949 --> 00:26:25.126
That... where is the nearest cloth shop?

431
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:26.408
We need to go there first

432
00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:28.067
Wait, wait a moment

433
00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:32.326
Are you kidding me now?

434
00:26:32.552 --> 00:26:33.652
If I just wanted to make a joke

435
00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:35.342
Will I cling to you like this without respecting myself?

436
00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:39.498
Am I the only one who thinks this is sudden?

437
00:26:39.523 --> 00:26:40.308
Me too

438
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.936
This kind of behavior is no different from that of a lunatic.

439
00:26:45.657 --> 00:26:47.179
It turns out that on the day we first met

440
00:26:47.464 --> 00:26:49.264
I didn't make a mistake

441
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.573
Just think of the fool part as prescient.

442
00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:53.776
Have you forgotten?

443
00:26:53.801 --> 00:26:54.729
What about me?

444
00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:57.408
My fiancé is the only one in my heart

445
00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:58.533
That guy treats you...

446
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.342
Why are so many people in the world attracted to these women?

447
00:27:07.268 --> 00:27:08.236
So disgusting

448
00:27:09.764 --> 00:27:10.767
Very annoying

449
00:27:12.104 --> 00:27:14.386
Are you sure it's the same person as the one from a few days ago?

450
00:27:14.931 --> 00:27:18.633
Or are you just so unreasonable?

451
00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:21.191
If I am really being unreasonable

452
00:27:21.216 --> 00:27:22.183
You can't do anything to me at all

453
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.358
The reason why I didn’t ask about your fiancé’s family background

454
00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.345
It's because I want to use all the coercive means I can use

455
00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:28.098
Saved until the last moment

456
00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:29.873
I don't want to become a mean person

457
00:27:30.194 --> 00:27:31.708
I hope you can endure it as much as possible

458
00:27:32.047 --> 00:27:33.867
I'm trying to make you change your mind.

459
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.223
I really can't understand

460
00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:43.845
How many times have you met me?

461
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.295
How many times do we need to see each other again?

462
00:27:45.603 --> 00:27:46.883
If I want you to understand why I do this

463
00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:50.189
No…

464
00:27:51.297 --> 00:27:52.779
I won't bother to understand

465
00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:54.473
I'm leaving first

466
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:56.298
Be careful on your way

467
00:27:57.189 --> 00:27:58.379
You'd better be honest

468
00:27:59.223 --> 00:28:01.289
Are you trying to run away from me now?

469
00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:06.714
because you are scared

470
00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:21.279
Afraid?

471
00:28:22.977 --> 00:28:24.086
What does this mean?

472
00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:25.158
You know it well yourself

473
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.547
I reiterate

474
00:28:30.964 --> 00:28:32.197
Me to my fiancé…

475
00:28:32.222 --> 00:28:33.294
You must not be in love, right?

476
00:28:35.218 --> 00:28:36.101
If that's the case

477
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:37.688
Then how come you did that night...

478
00:28:42.838 --> 00:28:46.016
I originally planned to go along with your improvised lie.

479
00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:47.897
When you draw the line and push me away

480
00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:49.547
I also thought about simply pretending not to know and turning around.

481
00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:50.941
But I don't want to do that

482
00:28:54.128 --> 00:28:54.895
So…

483
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.635
Good

484
00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:58.004
I'll tell you the truth

485
00:29:00.471 --> 00:29:02.766
That's right, that night

486
00:29:03.672 --> 00:29:05.251
I decided that night that I was going to have a

487
00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.822
People like me in North Korea

488
00:29:07.644 --> 00:29:09.657
Most people choose marriage

489
00:29:13.295 --> 00:29:14.226
for me

490
00:29:14.522 --> 00:29:17.154
wealth, success, fame

491
00:29:17.854 --> 00:29:19.497
My family and even myself

492
00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:22.076
Among the many things that people value

493
00:29:22.454 --> 00:29:24.957
What I thought was the least relevant to me

494
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.147
It's love

495
00:29:28.904 --> 00:29:31.104
But the night I made up my mind to get married

496
00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:32.985
This is the first time I asked myself

497
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.257
If I…

498
00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:39.226
What should I do if I miss something important?

499
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:43.863
This question makes me very uneasy

500
00:29:45.762 --> 00:29:48.422
It seems that I have also made myself very unlucky.

501
00:29:52.112 --> 00:29:54.122
That's when I saw you

502
00:29:55.995 --> 00:29:59.654
I saw a man who had been waiting for me for more than two hours

503
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:05.130
Suddenly I felt like I had become the protagonist in a folk legend

504
00:30:07.878 --> 00:30:09.008
That's it

505
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:12.802
escape reality

506
00:30:14.236 --> 00:30:15.771
Run to you

507
00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.682
Blinded by self-pity

508
00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:21.843
casually to a strange man

509
00:30:23.391 --> 00:30:25.265
pour out one's misfortune

510
00:30:35.183 --> 00:30:38.624
But I don't want to be stuck with that story now

511
00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:39.977
lie

512
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:46.568
Please stop following me

513
00:30:58.451 --> 00:30:59.493
I'm the one who got dumped

514
00:30:59.721 --> 00:31:00.877
Why are you angry instead?

515
00:31:01.939 --> 00:31:03.130
I just need one sentence

516
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:06.202
I just need your permission

517
00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:10.174
Why is he so serious?

518
00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:13.805
I'm different from my dad

519
00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:14.790
if it were me

520
00:31:14.815 --> 00:31:15.968
As early as the day when the disaster occurred in the Gengwu year

521
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.727
I'll kill all the rats in your house.

522
00:31:23.056 --> 00:31:24.471
Although I don't want to hurt him

523
00:31:24.842 --> 00:31:25.986
But I have to be cruel

524
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:32.330
I have already answered you

525
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.758
Because of my low status

526
00:31:34.853 --> 00:31:36.905
So even rejection is insignificant?

527
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.571
That's not what I meant

528
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.283
Did you misinterpret it or did it on purpose?

529
00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:41.218
What about me?

530
00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:43.774
Not the kind of person who can freely say whatever he thinks

531
00:31:44.223 --> 00:31:48.689
Unilateral display of any emotional identity

532
00:31:51.024 --> 00:31:53.461
I must endure, hold on, hide

533
00:31:54.834 --> 00:31:56.980
Nothing can be shown

534
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.271
Therefore

535
00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:04.021
I won't be swayed by a moment of childishness

536
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.693
This…

537
00:32:11.092 --> 00:32:11.865
it's me

538
00:32:14.026 --> 00:32:15.574
the gap between you

539
00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:22.483
Childish?

540
00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:25.499
That's right

541
00:32:26.163 --> 00:32:27.715
Just like you said, I don't need to look at people's faces

542
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.173
Growing up in an environment without any scruples

543
00:32:30.133 --> 00:32:30.961
I admit what I said casually

544
00:32:30.986 --> 00:32:32.686
It’s because you didn’t consider the other party’s confession

545
00:32:33.372 --> 00:32:35.255
It is also a kind of love that is not respectful enough.

546
00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:38.693
I'm not curious at all about the gap you mentioned.

547
00:32:39.652 --> 00:32:41.015
Because I don't need to understand

548
00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:45.274
I don’t want to pretend to understand just now

549
00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:46.133
But

550
00:32:47.247 --> 00:32:48.374
Even with this status

551
00:32:49.064 --> 00:32:50.496
Before appearing in front of the woman you like

552
00:32:50.521 --> 00:32:52.165
I will also practice it dozens or hundreds of times in my mind

553
00:32:53.395 --> 00:32:55.662
My steps are always heavy and hesitant

554
00:32:57.316 --> 00:32:58.483
Usually this kind of thing

555
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.798
everyone calls it courage

556
00:33:03.563 --> 00:33:04.283
But you are so heartless

557
00:33:07.097 --> 00:33:09.064
(You're my everything to me)

558
00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:09.880
I'm leaving

559
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:14.190
(The one that attracted me)

560
00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:21.722
(named your dazzling sunshine to me)

561
00:33:21.722 --> 00:33:25.281
(The moment I see you again)

562
00:33:25.355 --> 00:33:29.789
(My heart is calling you)

563
00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:35.686
(We Again Again)

564
00:33:36.489 --> 00:33:40.075
(You're my everything to me)

565
00:33:40.155 --> 00:33:43.884
(The one that attracted me)

566
00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:50.687
(named your dazzling sunshine to me)

567
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:54.915
(You're my everything to me)

568
00:33:54.948 --> 00:33:58.614
(The moment I see you again)

569
00:33:58.642 --> 00:34:05.409
(Being with you like a dream again)

570
00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:12.106
Mother

571
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:13.835
I'm so hungry

572
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.893
You stay

573
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:16.350
I'm going to get snacks

574
00:34:21.317 --> 00:34:23.817
Smelly girl, leave this house quickly.

575
00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:25.462
Do that to me...

576
00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:31.472
Are you saying that our Eunjo is going to marry your grandfather?

577
00:34:32.026 --> 00:34:33.793
What are you talking about?

578
00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.334
what memory is this

579
00:34:36.797 --> 00:34:39.068
The guy who sold his evil daughter to make ends meet

580
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.690
The wine went smoothly.

581
00:34:40.863 --> 00:34:42.172
Damn...

582
00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:46.793
Mother

583
00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:48.226
When is Eunjo's marriage scheduled?

584
00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:50.428
There are only ten days left now

585
00:34:51.144 --> 00:34:52.400
When did father say he was going there?

586
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.375
five days later

587
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.490
Damn it, don't care

588
00:34:56.685 --> 00:34:57.803
No matter what she wants

589
00:34:58.297 --> 00:34:59.340
None of my business

590
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.325
none of my business

591
00:35:01.225 --> 00:35:02.709
I heard you were looking for me

592
00:35:02.899 --> 00:35:05.833
The marriage to the Middle Temple family will not be withdrawn.

593
00:35:06.912 --> 00:35:09.189
Husband and wife should be of one mind

594
00:35:09.597 --> 00:35:12.162
I should also let my wife know that I exist

595
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.365
If she knew I was a beast

596
00:35:17.722 --> 00:35:19.759
That lady from a highly respected scholar-bureaucrat's family

597
00:35:19.832 --> 00:35:21.565
How many tears will you shed?

598
00:35:24.881 --> 00:35:27.278
That despicable evil girl is willing to do it for her father

599
00:35:27.303 --> 00:35:30.028
Became the old man's concubine

600
00:35:31.168 --> 00:35:33.768
Why are you mentioning that girl's name now?

601
00:35:33.793 --> 00:35:36.006
You should follow that boy Eunjo's example

602
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:37.693
You want me to shut up and be sold

603
00:35:38.337 --> 00:35:39.518
Just like that girl?

604
00:35:42.843 --> 00:35:44.210
You thought that as long as it was as you said

605
00:35:45.471 --> 00:35:47.138
Refuse to be a sowing stallion

606
00:35:47.163 --> 00:35:49.263
Can you keep your self-esteem?

607
00:35:49.805 --> 00:35:51.539
Enzu, that kid knows it very well

608
00:35:51.564 --> 00:35:54.297
Lowly people don't deserve that kind of thing in the first place

609
00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:56.569
You cannot ask the daughter of the Middle Temple family

610
00:35:56.594 --> 00:35:57.175
No

611
00:35:57.617 --> 00:36:00.328
You can't identify yourself to anyone

612
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:02.806
I give you name, wealth and fame

613
00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:05.965
None of you...

614
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.703
Can't give up

615
00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:12.703
That's the real you

616
00:36:16.148 --> 00:36:17.481
Be careful on the road

617
00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:20.147
I heard that the environment there is good and the scenery is beautiful

618
00:36:20.172 --> 00:36:21.528
enjoy it

619
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:23.987
But that…

620
00:36:28.613 --> 00:36:30.690
At least watch Eun Jo's marriage before leaving.

621
00:36:32.898 --> 00:36:33.828
now

622
00:36:34.134 --> 00:36:35.703
You are the head of this family

623
00:36:36.238 --> 00:36:38.434
Take good care of them for me

624
00:36:38.795 --> 00:36:40.628
Why do you put the responsibility on me?

625
00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:41.989
You guy, now you also...

626
00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:42.912
Really

627
00:36:44.316 --> 00:36:45.043
Hello

628
00:36:45.432 --> 00:36:46.497
Don't you have anything to say?

629
00:36:49.854 --> 00:36:51.847
It's up to you to decide your fate.

630
00:36:52.188 --> 00:36:52.937
Abominable

631
00:36:54.488 --> 00:36:56.772
That guy looked like this even on the day I left.

632
00:37:00.605 --> 00:37:01.509
I'm so sorry

633
00:37:02.348 --> 00:37:03.214
No

634
00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:05.555
Medicinal materials prepared for you

635
00:37:05.555 --> 00:37:08.143
Please ask the wine lady at the inn to cook it for you and drink it.

636
00:37:12.543 --> 00:37:16.043
I'm sorry for leaving you alone to prepare for the wedding.

637
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.784
No need to worry

638
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.353
As long as you arrive safely

639
00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.729
I heard you've been looking for me

640
00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:50.359
Has everyone else quit?

641
00:37:57.223 --> 00:37:59.156
Can't give you much time

642
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:03.064
Does the Lord also know?

643
00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:06.148
The incense you brought into your bedroom

644
00:38:06.812 --> 00:38:08.253
What is its origin

645
00:38:14.145 --> 00:38:16.245
Keep smelling that fragrance

646
00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:19.031
will cause confusion

647
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:21.707
Loss of ability to discern things

648
00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:26.633
In the end, it will become an empty shell that is no different from the corpse.

649
00:38:27.461 --> 00:38:30.637
Be your guy's leader

650
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.600
Lord thought it was a painkiller

651
00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:43.834
Let me know if you have symptoms of poisoning

652
00:38:45.112 --> 00:38:46.174
All agree

653
00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:49.882
Is this North Korea what you got?

654
00:38:50.405 --> 00:38:51.770
you guy

655
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:54.733
Aren't you afraid of divine punishment?

656
00:39:18.691 --> 00:39:19.645
You said he has been doing this for several days

657
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.442
Are you all just focusing on fishing?

658
00:39:21.467 --> 00:39:23.780
Has your Majesty ever dreamed of becoming a fisherman?

659
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:26.229
If you can’t catch a woman, then catch something else.

660
00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:27.680
This should be the mentality

661
00:39:28.155 --> 00:39:31.108
To gossip behind the person's back is to stir up trouble.

662
00:39:31.457 --> 00:39:33.036
If you want to say something, I will not be able to see or hear you.

663
00:39:33.061 --> 00:39:34.049
Don't make me upset

664
00:39:34.443 --> 00:39:36.143
If you want to stir up trouble, you should also show some sincerity.

665
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.151
This is pretense of gossiping.

666
00:39:39.363 --> 00:39:40.997
How long do you plan to do this?

667
00:39:41.022 --> 00:39:42.229
I need to know the answer to this

668
00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:44.373
Tell me when you know it too

669
00:39:46.483 --> 00:39:47.373
Really

670
00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:48.264
Your Majesty

671
00:39:48.444 --> 00:39:50.483
Actually, I came to you to report something.

672
00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:53.955
Rumors about a lucky boy are spreading in the market

673
00:39:55.253 --> 00:39:56.008
What rumors

674
00:39:56.173 --> 00:39:58.940
I heard about the person who stole the secret record of the great minister's remonstrance on corruption.

675
00:39:59.104 --> 00:40:00.273
It's Ji Tong

676
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.795
That's not a rumor, it's a fact

677
00:40:02.826 --> 00:40:03.926
That's right

678
00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:05.151
I'm also confused

679
00:40:05.781 --> 00:40:08.017
Didn't you say that only the three of us know?

680
00:40:08.146 --> 00:40:09.842
There is indeed someone who knows

681
00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:11.667
Who?

682
00:40:13.532 --> 00:40:14.673
Ji Tong

683
00:40:16.254 --> 00:40:17.701
Didn't he ever ask for help hiding it?

684
00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:20.176
What is the origin of the things you stole?

685
00:40:20.526 --> 00:40:22.126
Maybe it's because the incident became too big

686
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:23.967
This also gave him the desire to strive for fame and credit.

687
00:40:24.142 --> 00:40:24.976
Or rather

688
00:40:25.276 --> 00:40:27.667
He was taking advantage of the Maharaja from the beginning

689
00:40:30.572 --> 00:40:32.405
We need to investigate in a different direction

690
00:40:32.462 --> 00:40:33.270
Change direction?

691
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.123
Track down the secret records

692
00:40:36.022 --> 00:40:36.745
I understand

693
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:39.917
When looking for the owner of the secret record, you will naturally find Ji Tong

694
00:40:39.963 --> 00:40:41.951
Since it records the fact that Da Si Jian was involved in corruption,

695
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.361
person who writes secret records

696
00:40:43.386 --> 00:40:45.689
It's very possible that they are people who want to seize Da Si Jian's weakness.

697
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:47.936
You go see Da Sijian and find out what he says.

698
00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:50.170
He is too hostile to me, so he will definitely not speak.

699
00:40:57.775 --> 00:40:59.673
Today's treatment has ended

700
00:41:00.303 --> 00:41:01.404
Come again next time

701
00:41:02.007 --> 00:41:03.676
They are the children of Guangtong Bridge

702
00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:04.598
Come here

703
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.420
Isn’t it your wedding tomorrow?

704
00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:10.548
Go and have some rest, and take a shift with someone else.

705
00:41:10.573 --> 00:41:12.373
Why are you like this lately?

706
00:41:12.632 --> 00:41:14.965
I'll sort out the rest. You can go back.

707
00:41:30.455 --> 00:41:32.088
When did you have dinner?

708
00:41:38.353 --> 00:41:40.320
If you were born as a rice insect

709
00:41:40.345 --> 00:41:42.020
I'm afraid the whole year will be a drought.

710
00:41:53.997 --> 00:41:56.298
There is nothing to give now

711
00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:00.201
Is this also possible?

712
00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.879
Is it for me?

713
00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:24.195
This gift is too good, right?

714
00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:39.954
So beautiful

715
00:42:57.286 --> 00:42:58.167
Use this to support

716
00:43:03.361 --> 00:43:04.926
This little monk is quite smart.

717
00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:10.098
This is enough to re-pave the floor of the Buddhist hall.

718
00:43:27.793 --> 00:43:28.526
What about me?

719
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.139
This is the bracelet that authenticates me as a big benefactor.

720
00:43:31.321 --> 00:43:32.717
Your one tael of silver is not worthy of it

721
00:43:34.782 --> 00:43:36.389
The kids these days don’t even reply.

722
00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:38.733
He is practicing silently

723
00:43:57.595 --> 00:43:59.129
It happened to rain

724
00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:09.008
Your Majesty

725
00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:10.539
You'll catch a cold like this

726
00:44:11.906 --> 00:44:13.495
It seems like the rain won't stop tomorrow, right?

727
00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.845
It seems

728
00:44:26.002 --> 00:44:26.723
But…

729
00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:29.186
what are you looking at

730
00:44:31.162 --> 00:44:32.142
muddy water

731
00:45:05.419 --> 00:45:07.864
It rained even on the wedding day

732
00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:13.526
Even the weather is gloomy and gloomy

733
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.117
The rain stopped in the early morning

734
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.926
Do you think it will rain again?

735
00:45:27.092 --> 00:45:28.176
Abominable

736
00:45:29.241 --> 00:45:31.139
What's wrong? What happened?

737
00:45:31.924 --> 00:45:33.754
Why are you so beautiful?

738
00:45:33.894 --> 00:45:35.898
It would be a pity even if I granted you the title of Zhongdian

739
00:45:36.675 --> 00:45:37.308
What?

740
00:45:37.699 --> 00:45:39.179
Damn it, hey

741
00:45:39.843 --> 00:45:41.433
you are so beautiful

742
00:45:41.458 --> 00:45:43.458
What do you want me to do?

743
00:45:46.197 --> 00:45:47.314
Mother

744
00:45:47.892 --> 00:45:49.123
Come out immediately

745
00:45:55.048 --> 00:45:58.276
Don't even think about breaking off the engagement, don't even say anything.

746
00:45:59.163 --> 00:46:01.141
Let me also live a life of power

747
00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:02.599
As a concubine of a powerful minister's family

748
00:46:03.504 --> 00:46:07.271
With a 70-year-old man who doesn’t know when he will die?

749
00:46:07.296 --> 00:46:08.497
My life has changed for the better

750
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:11.615
He might lie somewhere and die without saying a word.

751
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.169
I don't even need to cater to him

752
00:46:14.194 --> 00:46:15.735
There is no need to observe words and expressions

753
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.207
What happens after that?

754
00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:20.398
You plan to be a widow for the rest of your life

755
00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:23.026
Have you never experienced love even once?

756
00:46:26.852 --> 00:46:27.757
So what

757
00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:29.510
Can that be eaten?

758
00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:30.488
Can I get a house in exchange?

759
00:46:30.859 --> 00:46:32.626
It just makes people upset for no reason.

760
00:46:32.715 --> 00:46:34.378
My heart is churning

761
00:46:34.615 --> 00:46:36.678
Feeling depressed all day long, feeling flustered and feeling like vomiting

762
00:46:37.634 --> 00:46:39.234
I hate that. I don't want it.

763
00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:41.613
shut up

764
00:46:41.816 --> 00:46:43.385
The Superintendent also...

765
00:46:44.232 --> 00:46:47.575
No, I don't agree

766
00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:49.200
Call off this marriage immediately

767
00:46:51.238 --> 00:46:52.219
What about after regretting the marriage?

768
00:46:52.755 --> 00:46:54.122
Want us kicked out of this room

769
00:46:54.147 --> 00:46:55.238
And then sleep on the street?

770
00:46:56.379 --> 00:46:58.391
Then who will suffer next?

771
00:46:58.851 --> 00:46:59.950
Is it my sick mother?

772
00:47:00.344 --> 00:47:01.225
Still young master

773
00:47:06.407 --> 00:47:10.435
You want me to struggle alone in the quagmire again

774
00:47:11.451 --> 00:47:13.076
Don't you think it's too cruel?

775
00:47:26.162 --> 00:47:27.341
I will relax and leave

776
00:47:41.494 --> 00:47:42.782
it's my fault

777
00:47:44.456 --> 00:47:45.906
It's all my fault

778
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.387
sorry

779
00:47:51.644 --> 00:47:54.003
Eunjo, I'm sorry

780
00:47:57.019 --> 00:47:59.693
I'm sorry too

781
00:48:01.989 --> 00:48:03.459
Enzu

782
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.520
Why did you come to my house?

783
00:48:19.545 --> 00:48:21.112
Sorry, you are a lady who has not yet left the government.

784
00:48:21.137 --> 00:48:23.422
I, a strange man, call you out casually

785
00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:25.722
Come first

786
00:48:25.988 --> 00:48:26.988
Since you are my fiancé

787
00:48:27.013 --> 00:48:28.713
He's not a strange man either

788
00:48:28.755 --> 00:48:30.447
You will soon regard me as a strange man

789
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:33.184
Because we will break off the engagement

790
00:48:37.398 --> 00:48:39.725
I don't understand what you are saying

791
00:48:44.683 --> 00:48:45.806
Reason for breaking off the engagement...

792
00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:49.989
Refuse to be a sowing stallion

793
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:52.222
Can you keep your self-esteem?

794
00:48:54.526 --> 00:48:56.697
The reason is... The name I gave you

795
00:48:56.795 --> 00:48:58.537
wealth and fame

796
00:48:59.423 --> 00:49:01.047
You are the same...

797
00:49:01.777 --> 00:49:02.753
Can't give up

798
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.487
That's the real you

799
00:49:11.445 --> 00:49:13.145
Despicable bastard

800
00:49:17.307 --> 00:49:19.781
If you can't let go of your friendship with that prostitute Lu Yi

801
00:49:20.602 --> 00:49:22.102
Then I don't care

802
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.657
If you keep insisting that you don’t care

803
00:49:25.682 --> 00:49:27.662
At that time, I’m afraid it will really show its ugly face.

804
00:49:32.211 --> 00:49:33.725
The bride must take the initiative to terminate the engagement

805
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.868
It will not cause any trouble to you in the future

806
00:49:38.357 --> 00:49:39.416
please stay

807
00:49:45.084 --> 00:49:47.115
You didn't hesitate to come in the rain

808
00:49:47.347 --> 00:49:50.380
Are you really determined to solve it as soon as possible?

809
00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:55.018
Just think of it as me struggling.

810
00:50:01.006 --> 00:50:02.847
It's raining harder again

811
00:50:02.872 --> 00:50:04.406
It's almost time to leave

812
00:50:04.653 --> 00:50:05.628
Good

813
00:50:10.038 --> 00:50:11.006
what is this

814
00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:12.218
Those are embroidered shoes

815
00:50:14.795 --> 00:50:17.915
I told you that it would get stained by muddy water, so I won’t wear embroidered shoes.

816
00:50:23.477 --> 00:50:25.553
These are not my embroidered shoes

817
00:50:34.033 --> 00:50:37.125
That was what a young man put up together with the embroidered shoes just now.

818
00:50:37.591 --> 00:50:40.278
It seems that I am worried that you will get married wearing wet shoes.

819
00:50:44.185 --> 00:50:45.387
Could it be...

820
00:51:03.314 --> 00:51:04.980
when the raindrops fall on you

821
00:51:05.005 --> 00:51:08.322
The depression in my heart seems to be diluted a little.

822
00:51:09.769 --> 00:51:10.700
How is it possible

823
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:14.297
I mean it

824
00:51:28.142 --> 00:51:29.287
How is it possible

825
00:52:10.988 --> 00:52:12.755
Enzu, that kid knows it very well

826
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:15.590
Lowly people don't deserve that kind of thing in the first place

827
00:52:15.788 --> 00:52:17.234
She must persist

828
00:52:39.414 --> 00:52:40.780
what are you doing

829
00:52:44.023 --> 00:52:44.890
what is this doing

830
00:52:44.922 --> 00:52:46.422
I'm going to treat you like an animal

831
00:52:46.447 --> 00:52:48.090
How could you be so extravagant?

832
00:52:56.088 --> 00:52:57.655
Do you have to sell yourself?

833
00:53:21.915 --> 00:53:25.206
Master

834
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:42.681
The old man passed away

835
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.581
I'm an officer of the Bureau of Robbery

836
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:57.918
Take me to see the prisoner

837
00:54:04.045 --> 00:54:05.856
What happened? What happened?

838
00:54:07.427 --> 00:54:08.709
Call the other officers

839
00:54:08.734 --> 00:54:10.156
Go quickly Yes

840
00:54:21.531 --> 00:54:22.689
Ji Tong?

841
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.912
Sir

842
00:54:42.714 --> 00:54:43.409
what is that

843
00:54:43.474 --> 00:54:44.381
It's liquor

844
00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:46.325
You look needy tonight

845
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:56.443
Enzu

846
00:55:02.937 --> 00:55:04.237
Uncle Shi

847
00:55:05.937 --> 00:55:08.322
You haven't eaten anything all day, right?

848
00:55:09.769 --> 00:55:10.956
This is for you

849
00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:12.690
come on

850
00:55:17.083 --> 00:55:19.759
How did you get in here?

851
00:55:19.958 --> 00:55:21.897
How else could he get in? Of course he was sold.

852
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.431
Aren’t we all the property of two classes of nobles?

853
00:55:24.535 --> 00:55:26.006
After the owner’s house was confiscated and his family was exterminated

854
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.864
All property confiscated

855
00:55:27.889 --> 00:55:30.189
Yesterday, I was sold to this family again.

856
00:55:33.316 --> 00:55:36.618
Master Da Si Jian will go to the place of exile soon, right?

857
00:55:39.137 --> 00:55:41.137
He is gone now

858
00:55:43.564 --> 00:55:46.493
Did he pass away? How could it be so sudden?

859
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.047
I'm also surprised

860
00:55:49.072 --> 00:55:52.693
But what’s even more surprising is the news coming from the market

861
00:55:53.424 --> 00:55:54.724
What's the news?

862
00:55:57.979 --> 00:56:01.784
It is said that my father was killed by Ji Tong

863
00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.468
What is Ji Tong?

864
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.930
What do you mean Ji Tong killed someone?

865
00:56:10.955 --> 00:56:12.190
What's going on?

866
00:56:17.657 --> 00:56:21.457
Anyway, no one will enter the other courtyard tonight.

867
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.054
Are you hunting for Ji Dong?

868
00:56:27.089 --> 00:56:28.487
Already investigating

869
00:56:28.732 --> 00:56:30.847
What else to investigate?

870
00:56:30.988 --> 00:56:33.153
On my master’s blood book

871
00:56:33.178 --> 00:56:37.137
They all wrote the name Jitong

872
00:56:37.162 --> 00:56:38.297
A blood letter?

873
00:56:38.684 --> 00:56:40.253
Does that mean he left a last message?

874
00:56:40.278 --> 00:56:42.343
before having clear evidence

875
00:56:42.368 --> 00:56:43.468
Please wait a little longer

876
00:56:48.269 --> 00:56:50.309
No evidence was found

877
00:56:50.334 --> 00:56:51.437
Go to the Robbery Hall

878
00:56:52.101 --> 00:56:53.931
Let's go Yes

879
00:57:05.713 --> 00:57:06.709
It's Ji Tong

880
00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:08.978
Ji Tong appears

881
00:57:09.457 --> 00:57:10.723
Ji Tong appears

882
00:57:12.197 --> 00:57:14.364
Ji Tong? Did someone call Ji Tong just now?

883
00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:15.531
that way

884
00:58:22.006 --> 00:58:23.865
You have to get up

885
00:59:18.712 --> 00:59:20.697
How long have I been in coma?

886
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:22.811
Wine table?

887
00:59:24.354 --> 00:59:26.872
I was clearly being chased by patrol officers and soldiers just now.

888
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:30.684
What's going on with this satin? Wait a minute.

889
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.866
How did my hands become like this?

890
00:59:41.101 --> 00:59:42.443
Why is my head so dizzy?

891
00:59:43.501 --> 00:59:44.609
What's going on

892
00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.540
why am i on the street

893
00:59:46.565 --> 00:59:48.493
Ji Tong appears

894
00:59:48.729 --> 00:59:50.281
Catch Ji Tong quickly

895
00:59:51.017 --> 00:59:51.990
Ji Tong?

896
00:59:54.301 --> 00:59:55.212
What's going on

897
01:00:03.448 --> 01:00:04.418
This face…

898
01:00:06.717 --> 01:00:07.712
What's going on

899
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.593
Are you an official?

900
01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:47.873
Is anyone here?

901
01:00:47.898 --> 01:00:49.647
Is anyone here?

902
01:00:49.672 --> 01:00:52.387
Did we really exchange souls?

903
01:00:52.412 --> 01:00:54.822
In the palace? Is this in the palace?

904
01:00:54.847 --> 01:00:55.714
Is this a dream?

905
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.739
Because this is my home from yesterday

906
01:00:57.764 --> 01:01:00.742
It seems that there was a dispute between the couple last night

907
01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.100
who is your husband

908
01:01:02.777 --> 01:01:03.798
what makes me angry is

909
01:01:03.823 --> 01:01:07.001
I'm so useless that I even gave you embroidered shoes.

910
01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:08.881
Since none of the adults got up, I came in to take a look.

911
01:01:08.922 --> 01:01:10.585
But the person is no longer inside

912
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.794
What does it mean that Ji Tong was arrested?

913
01:01:11.994 --> 01:01:13.460
Go find an adult immediately
