﻿1
00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:09.484
Found it

2
00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:11.790
Found your flower

3
00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:14.759
He didn't come with Ji Tong

4
00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:17.921
Then why did you come here?

5
00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:20.852
notice board

6
00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.718
If it is me or someone who knows this person

7
00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:28.818
Please inform Dr. Hong of the Hui People's Department

8
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.112
The point now is not how he got here.

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.774
Calm down and take a deep breath

10
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.203
That person is an official

11
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.034
If I were like this, I would look even more suspicious.

12
00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.126
Your back looks confused

13
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:43.215
Is it my imagination?

14
00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:49.327
Oh my god

15
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:51.762
It's you

16
00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.009
No wonder the voice sounds so familiar

17
00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.705
With the speed of turning around, it doesn't look like you didn't recognize me.

18
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:03.634
You're too worried. There's no reason to pretend you don't recognize him after you recognize him.

19
00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:06.337
Just because it's too dark

20
00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:09.302
The moon is as bright as day

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.637
Having said that

22
00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:16.403
Even though the moon is bright and clear, a man suddenly breaks in late at night

23
00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:18.595
Of course I avoided it subconsciously

24
00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:22.667
After all, it’s not suitable for a man and a woman to live together at this time, right?

25
00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:23.890
Oh

26
00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:26.005
Now you know how to avoid suspicion?

27
00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:29.421
What about that night?

28
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.502
about that night

29
00:01:42.232 --> 00:01:44.184
About that day... The briefest explanation

30
00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:45.665
convince me as much as possible

31
00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:48.859
Even if I just can't help it

32
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:51.340
I also accept

33
00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:03.268
As you can see, lying conceals one's identity

34
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.014
I have no way to defend myself based on this alone

35
00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:11.670
Therefore, it is a common crime to offend the two doctors.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.817
It's not just a few words that can solve the problem.

37
00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:19.176
Let’s talk about that night

38
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.770
I also teased the person in front of me...

39
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:22.555
Teasing?

40
00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:30.589
I know you can't be forgiven just by apologizing

41
00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:34.286
What else are you talking about about the lady and servants?

42
00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:38.036
So you ran away that night after learning my identity?

43
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.470
Not so

44
00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:43.326
The day we first met in the market, I was also wearing silk

45
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.784
That's why What?

46
00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.842
If so, then why

47
00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:52.220
Oh…

48
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.989
Just...

49
00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:00.154
Under the impulse of various twists and turns,

50
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.070
You mean a mistake?

51
00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:04.433
Yes, it turns out that these two words can be used to explain it.

52
00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:06.658
No matter what, you shouldn’t use these two words to explain it.

53
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:10.061
small fear

54
00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.814
If you want to accuse me

55
00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:14.999
I must be willing to be punished

56
00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.308
What should I do?

57
00:03:17.372 --> 00:03:19.833
What I want to ask about is not sin

58
00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.352
Do you want me to have the consciousness to go to the Robbery Hall?

59
00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:26.643
Aren't you going yet?

60
00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:28.520
Yes, I will go there now

61
00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:32.811
Although it was a misunderstanding

62
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.364
But it was you who saved the silly boy's life

63
00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:37.780
The favor owed that day will be written off today.

64
00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:42.604
Strictly speaking, that was actually my mistake.

65
00:03:44.353 --> 00:03:45.379
what happened to your hand

66
00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:46.664
Are you injured?

67
00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:48.079
Nothing serious

68
00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:49.264
Wait let me take a look

69
00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.064
Didn't you agree to just take a look?

70
00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:56.304
I'm afraid I can't just look at this injury.

71
00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:09.726
Just help me stop the bleeding

72
00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:11.557
That's why I came here originally

73
00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:17.599
Didn't you come here after seeing the article on the bulletin board?

74
00:04:17.884 --> 00:04:19.650
What article? It’s okay

75
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.602
So is today also a coincidence?

76
00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:28.630
hard to say

77
00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:31.255
The so-called accident refers to an inadvertent encounter

78
00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:33.624
But in comparison, I seem too eager

79
00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:36.877
I can only say that sincerity leads to spirituality.

80
00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.365
what does this mean

81
00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.162
Think about it from another perspective

82
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.540
I must be very serious about keeping you, right?

83
00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:04.175
But you ran away like that

84
00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:12.164
This looks like a cut. How did you get hurt?

85
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.074
wounded by an arrow

86
00:05:17.228 --> 00:05:20.049
How could he be stabbed by an arrow at such a late hour?

87
00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:23.199
I was injured while helping someone escape.

88
00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:27.040
Help someone escape?

89
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:30.071
There was an accident and someone was hunted down instead.

90
00:05:31.324 --> 00:05:34.091
Anyway, it looks so peaceful tonight

91
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.540
Presumably that person must have managed to escape.

92
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.258
within my control

93
00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:42.952
Did I misunderstand him?

94
00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:43.965
Stop

95
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:45.671
Maybe those words were not meant for Jitong

96
00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.171
But he said it to the patrolman

97
00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:50.412
Then this injury

98
00:05:51.858 --> 00:05:53.021
Was it born because of me?

99
00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:55.365
What's wrong with you

100
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:57.468
What happened to me?

101
00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:58.883
I have been looking at the wound since just now

102
00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:02.352
It's because I can't see the wound clearly

103
00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:03.415
Could you please come over a little bit?

104
00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.702
Although I don't know the whole story

105
00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:15.527
But the person being helped should be very grateful to you

106
00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:16.790
No way

107
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.112
He should be complaining now, "That guy actually lied to me."

108
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:25.105
It won't take long to complain.

109
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.821
No

110
00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:28.033
I always feel like I heard it vaguely

111
00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:30.412
Swear words

112
00:06:30.888 --> 00:06:32.480
No, I don’t know how to swear.

113
00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.933
Probably

114
00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:39.421
If it were me I wouldn't do this

115
00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:43.039
You don't need to comfort me

116
00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:45.712
How could he be hit by an arrow?

117
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:46.908
Did you see it with your own eyes?

118
00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:49.666
A soldier accidentally let go of the string

119
00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:51.001
this is serious

120
00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.562
Hurry up and find your Majesty, yes

121
00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.996
Although the wound is not deep, it may leave scars

122
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.108
Wait until daybreak. Please go to the hospital.

123
00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:08.596
There are not many medicinal materials in the Huimin Administration Department. The medicine may not be enough.

124
00:07:09.524 --> 00:07:11.468
Do you lack a lot?

125
00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:14.662
It’s overcrowded here every day

126
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.540
When there is no shortage of medicinal materials

127
00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:20.902
That's it

128
00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:31.908
From the look on your face, you thought I was seriously hurt.

129
00:07:32.737 --> 00:07:36.337
All I can repay is to take good care of you.

130
00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:37.524
Yes

131
00:07:38.095 --> 00:07:40.989
My intentions are indeed no less than this

132
00:07:41.014 --> 00:07:42.564
This kind of intention is not very good

133
00:07:43.776 --> 00:07:45.477
You make me want to be hurt more seriously

134
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:50.631
How can you say you want to be hurt more seriously?

135
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:52.814
Such jokes are not allowed in the Huimin Department

136
00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.158
I mean it, always have

137
00:07:57.113 --> 00:08:00.558
Since that night, I have been waiting for someone abnormally

138
00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:06.986
You seemed flustered at the time

139
00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:12.443
So it makes me curious

140
00:08:13.002 --> 00:08:16.368
I even want to panic with you

141
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.646
But I never dreamed that it was just an unintentional mistake on your part.

142
00:08:34.766 --> 00:08:37.566
I apologize to you again about that matter.

143
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:38.324
Forget it

144
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:40.149
are you angry

145
00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:41.330
I'm not angry

146
00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:43.137
But he looks very angry

147
00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:44.243
I'm really not angry...

148
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:51.486
I'm angry about your apology

149
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:55.127
You stay

150
00:08:55.858 --> 00:08:57.843
It seems that by chance it only ends today.

151
00:09:05.604 --> 00:09:07.951
Even his back looks very angry.

152
00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:11.696
Is there something wrong with the way I apologize?

153
00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:16.044
Where are people?

154
00:09:18.886 --> 00:09:19.785
Sir

155
00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:23.222
The subordinates are scared that the woman has not been found yet.

156
00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:27.103
What do you mean by apologizing?

157
00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:29.828
I'm really scared. I will definitely find her tomorrow.

158
00:09:29.853 --> 00:09:33.710
This means that you made a serious mistake and need to apologize twice, right?

159
00:09:34.293 --> 00:09:36.260
What, still have to say it three times?

160
00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:38.562
No need to apologize in the future.

161
00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:41.385
Sir, so you are here

162
00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:44.237
Is your injury serious?

163
00:09:44.262 --> 00:09:45.528
As you can see I'm fine

164
00:09:45.528 --> 00:09:46.588
are you injured

165
00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:48.910
Who dares to... Put it away

166
00:09:49.293 --> 00:09:50.715
Where did Ji Tong go?

167
00:09:50.828 --> 00:09:52.600
Left without looking back

168
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.450
callously

169
00:09:58.143 --> 00:10:00.178
This is the first time we have met

170
00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:02.625
If this continues, I will have feelings.

171
00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:05.185
Enzu

172
00:10:05.687 --> 00:10:06.675
Come here quickly

173
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.466
It's so cold. Why did you run out and wait?

174
00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:12.258
Today because of Ji Tong's incident

175
00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:14.378
The Robbery Bureau called me for questioning. What?

176
00:10:14.403 --> 00:10:15.603
Let me see, are you okay?

177
00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:18.044
I'm fine. That's not the point.

178
00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:20.753
Come and have a look

179
00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:28.866
You said these were sent by officers from the Bureau of Thieves, right?

180
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.016
Right

181
00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:33.748
Do you have any impression of what he looks like?

182
00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:37.091
Face as white as snow

183
00:10:37.366 --> 00:10:40.451
Eyes as clear and translucent as jade beads

184
00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.910
He is truly a handsome man who has captivated the whole country.

185
00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:47.016
That's it

186
00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:49.328
Is it the same person I saw?

187
00:10:50.113 --> 00:10:51.045
what did you say

188
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:55.232
Nothing. Sounds like a good guy.

189
00:10:55.595 --> 00:10:57.229
Even the child's part has been thought of

190
00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.895
Oops

191
00:11:05.285 --> 00:11:06.523
so good

192
00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:09.316
Fortunately it was just a misunderstanding

193
00:11:14.844 --> 00:11:15.876
what did you say

194
00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:18.435
These are His Highness’s exact words

195
00:11:18.926 --> 00:11:22.688
The remonstrances submitted by the remonstrators recently made me very ashamed.

196
00:11:22.952 --> 00:11:25.352
It's all nonsense

197
00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:28.707
Therefore, I need to submit the remonstrance to His Highness.

198
00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:31.829
Do you want to review it first?

199
00:11:33.366 --> 00:11:35.169
are you crazy

200
00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:42.916
Even if you want to flatter yourself, you need some wisdom.

201
00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:47.919
Come and take a look

202
00:11:48.837 --> 00:11:50.932
These are your desires, sir

203
00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:59.766
extorted tribute

204
00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:02.362
Please give me some more time

205
00:12:02.387 --> 00:12:04.451
Invading people's land

206
00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:09.007
And the slaves who died under the stick

207
00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:13.895
All your desires, sir, are recorded here one by one.

208
00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:18.512
I've long heard that you have bad intentions

209
00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:21.438
Collected the excuses of the ministers

210
00:12:21.855 --> 00:12:23.501
You have now confirmed it yourself

211
00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:28.147
Last time, thanks to Lord Daoyue, I couldn't let you see it.

212
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:29.997
are you threatening me

213
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.919
It should be said that it is the mutual care between peers.

214
00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:43.217
After all, I want you in your position more than anyone else.

215
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.029
so

216
00:12:47.376 --> 00:12:48.704
Father, you brought so many wedding supplies

217
00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:51.410
Are they all returned to Du Chengzhi Mansion?

218
00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:53.116
Or even carry the pole yourself?

219
00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:54.603
Why?

220
00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.728
Those are related to Eunjo’s net worth

221
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.047
People must understand etiquette, justice and integrity

222
00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:00.904
Don’t you feel any guilt towards Eunjo?

223
00:13:01.158 --> 00:13:04.429
She also left home early today to treat women

224
00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:06.187
Superintendent, please stop blaming him.

225
00:13:06.364 --> 00:13:10.151
Eunjo should be the eldest son of this family, not me

226
00:13:10.328 --> 00:13:12.919
A stupid person like me deserves to be born into slavery

227
00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:15.337
Master, why are you like this?

228
00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:17.600
The imperial examination list was announced today

229
00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:19.312
Of course I'm not on the list

230
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.247
Nor will I shamelessly seek comfort from you

231
00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.484
Is it a red card?

232
00:13:39.497 --> 00:13:40.930
No need to congratulate me

233
00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:46.640
He's the top pick

234
00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:50.169
you guy

235
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:52.915
I thought you only knew how to eat, drink and have fun

236
00:13:59.142 --> 00:13:59.972
what are these

237
00:14:00.144 --> 00:14:02.875
It's the money that Mr. Hong Minzhi returned.

238
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.613
Old Man Hong is pretending to be aloof again.

239
00:14:09.103 --> 00:14:09.814
Are you pretending to be noble?

240
00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:13.136
You have studied abroad since you were a child

241
00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.433
Don’t you understand Mr. Hong?

242
00:14:14.742 --> 00:14:17.305
It is clear that the family has only four walls, but it is very self-reliant.

243
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.758
I thought he was my father's best friend, so I took care of his face.

244
00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:21.855
But he really makes me sick

245
00:14:22.227 --> 00:14:23.721
That girl from the Hong family

246
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.169
If she comes into my house another day, I will trample her hard.

247
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:29.791
Isn't it too mean to treat your wife and concubines like this?

248
00:14:32.118 --> 00:14:33.141
who is she

249
00:14:34.217 --> 00:14:37.132
She didn't come to be my side wife, but was sold to my grandfather.

250
00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:38.976
I must be responsible for taking care of his daily life.

251
00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:40.626
what

252
00:14:41.062 --> 00:14:45.607
I heard that the girl begged us not to let her father know.

253
00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:54.664
How dare you block the way of the scholar-bureaucrats?

254
00:14:55.262 --> 00:15:00.635
small fear

255
00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:04.657
small fear

256
00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:09.832
small fear

257
00:15:25.384 --> 00:15:27.257
Everyone prepares gifts

258
00:15:42.488 --> 00:15:43.601
What's going on

259
00:15:44.203 --> 00:15:46.813
I heard that the royal family gave medicinal materials

260
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:48.832
Which member of the royal family

261
00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:50.991
Daoyue Dajun

262
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.560
There are so many medicinal materials, enough for the Human Rights Administration to use for a whole year.

263
00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:56.830
So generous

264
00:15:57.905 --> 00:15:59.238
I heard the medical lady from the inner hospital say

265
00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:02.029
Your Majesty is an extremely handsome man

266
00:16:02.714 --> 00:16:04.414
I really envy the medical ladies in the inner hospital

267
00:16:04.439 --> 00:16:06.305
I can see the Maharaja in the palace.

268
00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:10.788
It's pretty good

269
00:16:11.913 --> 00:16:13.847
But don’t you think it’s a little sudden?

270
00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:23.213
The empress will not see any guests today

271
00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:29.341
Tell the queen for me that I will come back tomorrow

272
00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:38.082
Continue the topic just now

273
00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:41.372
Are all the medicinal materials sent to the Huimin Administration for medical treatment?

274
00:16:41.827 --> 00:16:42.719
Yes

275
00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:47.044
I heard that there are many patients in the Huimin Administration Department and there is a shortage of medicinal materials.

276
00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:48.363
That makes sense, right?

277
00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:50.069
That would be great

278
00:16:50.528 --> 00:16:51.172
How to say

279
00:16:51.197 --> 00:16:54.569
The doctor who treated you must be shocked now.

280
00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:55.544
why

281
00:16:56.526 --> 00:16:59.478
"It turns out that the person I treated a few days ago was your Majesty."

282
00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:00.238
She will definitely think so

283
00:17:01.317 --> 00:17:03.319
Didn’t I tell you to donate anonymously?

284
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.910
All given in my name?

285
00:17:05.084 --> 00:17:05.679
yes

286
00:17:06.227 --> 00:17:07.973
My lord, we have enough strange rumors.

287
00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:09.432
At least this should be spread widely.

288
00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:10.338
It’s not your rumor

289
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.896
Now that the matter has come to this, why not go to the Huimin Office to inspect it in person?

290
00:17:13.004 --> 00:17:14.016
Condolences by the way

291
00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:17.494
That’s all

292
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.437
If the concubine knows about it in the future

293
00:17:19.462 --> 00:17:21.516
Maybe it will calm down

294
00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:24.835
This name is good

295
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:28.731
Then go to Sipu Temple and fetch the most handsome horse.

296
00:17:28.762 --> 00:17:29.562
So sudden?

297
00:17:29.562 --> 00:17:30.928
On the way to Shangyiyuan

298
00:17:30.953 --> 00:17:33.395
I ordered someone to make a kuaizi using the silk sent by the Ming Dynasty envoy.

299
00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.435
Bring it here along the way

300
00:17:34.466 --> 00:17:35.541
Do you have to do this?

301
00:17:35.628 --> 00:17:37.710
Your questions and answers are quite smooth.

302
00:17:37.735 --> 00:17:38.594
small fear

303
00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:44.344
That's right, even apologizing is forbidden, right?

304
00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:46.885
I'm talking to myself

305
00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:51.273
Run quickly

306
00:18:01.172 --> 00:18:03.007
People who are getting married should not buy hair ties

307
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.744
It’s time to buy hairpins

308
00:18:06.249 --> 00:18:09.332
This way you can put your hair up after the wedding night

309
00:18:10.362 --> 00:18:11.560
Are you making fun of me?

310
00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:13.470
How to say this

311
00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:16.328
Aren't you so keen on research that you even look at erotic pictures?

312
00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:20.576
I'm trying to understand

313
00:18:20.644 --> 00:18:23.644
I want to say that after understanding it, I might not be so disgusted.

314
00:18:25.293 --> 00:18:27.266
Where is your lord?

315
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:28.857
what where

316
00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:31.163
If we are caught going out without permission

317
00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:32.128
Both the lady and I will be punished

318
00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:33.528
Kneel down and beg for mercy

319
00:18:33.528 --> 00:18:34.737
Since ancient times, as long as you admit your mistakes first...

320
00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:35.697
Run away quickly

321
00:18:35.722 --> 00:18:36.594
Escape?

322
00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:37.676
Where to escape

323
00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:39.702
where to escape

324
00:18:53.843 --> 00:18:54.685
stop

325
00:18:57.167 --> 00:18:58.800
Go around it Yes

326
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.838
Have I been discovered?

327
00:19:15.219 --> 00:19:16.723
Dead

328
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.360
Last time…

329
00:19:29.097 --> 00:19:30.091
please stay

330
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.213
please save my life

331
00:19:50.467 --> 00:19:51.866
I don’t know whose daughter she is.

332
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:53.726
I'm afraid my family will be worried.

333
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.057
You seem to have passed the crisis without fear of your life

334
00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:15.088
saved

335
00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:19.745
Could it be the messenger from the underworld?

336
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:22.423
That's my brother

337
00:20:22.534 --> 00:20:25.310
He thinks it's dangerous for women to go out

338
00:20:26.195 --> 00:20:27.931
Thank you for your help today

339
00:20:32.987 --> 00:20:33.881
Be careful on the road

340
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:35.919
jujube

341
00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:48.719
Miss

342
00:20:50.563 --> 00:20:51.387
Playful

343
00:20:52.308 --> 00:20:53.800
Am I inconspicuous?

344
00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:55.725
what

345
00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:00.153
He doesn't remember me

346
00:21:01.334 --> 00:21:04.884
It means I didn't leave any impression on him.

347
00:21:11.597 --> 00:21:13.002
give me some medicine

348
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.841
Is anyone here?

349
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.555
please wait a moment

350
00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:22.585
Can I receive medical treatment just by waiting in line?

351
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.801
Actually you don't have to wait

352
00:21:25.378 --> 00:21:27.045
Just show that you are the Maharaja

353
00:21:27.095 --> 00:21:27.907
quiet

354
00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:30.965
If you're not here to inspect, then why are you here?

355
00:21:30.996 --> 00:21:33.160
Inspecting something will only get in the way

356
00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:36.406
What's wrong with you

357
00:21:38.973 --> 00:21:40.641
Help her take a look

358
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:44.688
No

359
00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:45.510
Enzu

360
00:21:47.162 --> 00:21:48.082
Do you want to carry it away?

361
00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:49.673
Don't let her calm down first

362
00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:51.351
Moving now will only make the situation worse

363
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.732
Go and ask the doctor to come over quickly.

364
00:21:52.757 --> 00:21:53.741
Got it

365
00:21:54.162 --> 00:21:55.244
aunt

366
00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:58.113
Can you hear me?

367
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.337
Don't hold on

368
00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:04.962
Relax your body and lean on me

369
00:22:13.193 --> 00:22:14.994
Just hold on until the doctor comes.

370
00:22:19.328 --> 00:22:20.451
aunt

371
00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:22.340
Breathe with me

372
00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:23.235
Come

373
00:22:23.867 --> 00:22:25.201
One…

374
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.404
One…

375
00:22:28.328 --> 00:22:29.807
well done

376
00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:30.732
again

377
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:31.972
One…

378
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:35.647
One…

379
00:22:38.053 --> 00:22:39.222
One…

380
00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:43.544
One... What's going on?

381
00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:47.643
She just had an attack and is just calming down

382
00:22:47.668 --> 00:22:48.603
carry inside

383
00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:49.312
Yes

384
00:22:51.362 --> 00:22:52.732
Scared me to death

385
00:22:55.402 --> 00:22:56.066
Let's go

386
00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:58.513
Oops

387
00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:19.457
Have you gone?

388
00:23:29.337 --> 00:23:30.610
Are you looking for me?

389
00:23:32.767 --> 00:23:34.385
Thanks to you, patients can hold on

390
00:23:37.837 --> 00:23:40.182
The dust was dusted off

391
00:23:40.207 --> 00:23:42.122
But what if such a good fabric is damaged?

392
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.597
If compensation is needed…

393
00:23:44.622 --> 00:23:45.666
That's not necessary

394
00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:48.469
It's having a tantrum again

395
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.976
i know

396
00:23:52.219 --> 00:23:54.763
Aren't these hands used for tying clothes?

397
00:24:13.984 --> 00:24:15.969
What are you doing? I just tied it up.

398
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.685
No need

399
00:24:24.174 --> 00:24:26.158
At least this is a hand that can be used to bandage people.

400
00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:29.390
I can do it myself later

401
00:24:32.557 --> 00:24:35.227
Just think of it as repayment for treating my wounds a few days ago.

402
00:24:36.536 --> 00:24:39.065
After all, in my position, owing favors will be criticized.

403
00:24:42.362 --> 00:24:44.577
Okay, let's make it even

404
00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:47.030
He didn't even know he was injured

405
00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:49.315
Are you so slow to begin with?

406
00:24:51.398 --> 00:24:53.168
You also saw that the situation was urgent

407
00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:56.377
It's only when you relax that you feel the pain.

408
00:24:57.305 --> 00:24:58.271
what's your name

409
00:24:58.528 --> 00:24:59.549
Hong family enzu

410
00:25:03.228 --> 00:25:04.390
Why are you asking this?

411
00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.355
Just curious

412
00:25:07.997 --> 00:25:10.224
why are you here

413
00:25:13.877 --> 00:25:15.293
I'm also curious about this

414
00:25:16.762 --> 00:25:19.028
Are you asking for an apology for what happened last time?

415
00:25:19.028 --> 00:25:19.740
No

416
00:25:20.906 --> 00:25:23.546
Didn't I say I'm not interested in impulse?

417
00:25:24.128 --> 00:25:24.905
I understand

418
00:25:26.962 --> 00:25:28.483
This seems to be expensive silk

419
00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:30.671
I will return it to you later

420
00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:34.830
what is that

421
00:25:36.803 --> 00:25:39.203
There are some medicinal materials rewarded by Lord Daoyue

422
00:25:39.228 --> 00:25:40.843
I'm sorting out a list

423
00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:44.043
Lord Daoyue?

424
00:25:46.528 --> 00:25:47.802
In fact, that's exactly why I came here

425
00:25:56.737 --> 00:25:59.443
Tell everything that can discredit Ren Shiheng

426
00:25:59.468 --> 00:26:00.708
Dig them all out

427
00:26:00.862 --> 00:26:01.824
Yes, my lord

428
00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:21.826
What's wrong with you to make such a scene?

429
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.671
How valuable are these things?

430
00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:26.518
Say something

431
00:26:29.637 --> 00:26:31.246
I'm talking to you

432
00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:33.577
where are you going

433
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:37.490
My head hurts madam

434
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.040
tidy up

435
00:26:40.228 --> 00:26:41.015
Yes

436
00:26:55.095 --> 00:26:59.179
Those are all medicinal materials sent by Lord Daoyue.

437
00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:02.345
I will inform the Maharaja that the items have been successfully delivered.

438
00:27:03.295 --> 00:27:04.323
Just keep busy

439
00:27:07.137 --> 00:27:09.403
You seem to know the Maharaja very well?

440
00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:12.095
He also conducted secret inspections on his behalf

441
00:27:12.395 --> 00:27:14.095
Our relationship can be said to be very close

442
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:16.651
I heard that the Maharaja is a handsome man

443
00:27:18.058 --> 00:27:18.944
What do you think?

444
00:27:19.275 --> 00:27:20.145
what

445
00:27:21.011 --> 00:27:22.795
I didn't expect the rumors to be so reliable

446
00:27:23.695 --> 00:27:25.845
Tell me what else you heard

447
00:27:27.478 --> 00:27:28.845
I heard he wanders around all day

448
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.570
He's an idle loser

449
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:35.373
You should travel around the world to expand your knowledge.

450
00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:38.000
what else

451
00:27:38.025 --> 00:27:40.625
I heard he is a playboy who changes women every day

452
00:27:40.662 --> 00:27:41.954
That's really not

453
00:27:42.162 --> 00:27:43.098
is the first time

454
00:27:46.228 --> 00:27:47.436
First time?

455
00:27:49.762 --> 00:27:51.654
Am I trying to defend myself?

456
00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.232
I'm not thinking carefully

457
00:27:57.762 --> 00:27:59.442
I should have thought more before speaking out.

458
00:28:00.364 --> 00:28:03.810
Justifying means that you actually care in your heart.

459
00:28:04.503 --> 00:28:06.803
You are so close, of course you will care.

460
00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:07.463
No

461
00:28:08.295 --> 00:28:09.688
i never cared

462
00:28:11.062 --> 00:28:12.301
no matter what others say

463
00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:14.470
what

464
00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:16.473
What's going on

465
00:28:19.228 --> 00:28:20.542
Have you sorted everything out?

466
00:28:22.528 --> 00:28:24.867
This is the king's wish

467
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.076
Not to be used at will

468
00:28:27.362 --> 00:28:28.657
Yes, Mr. Tiao Tiao

469
00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:31.485
Ti Tiao really understands the Maharaja’s thoughts

470
00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:35.679
Messenger of the underworld?

471
00:28:37.335 --> 00:28:38.232
who is he

472
00:28:40.628 --> 00:28:41.695
This is...

473
00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:42.448
That’s all

474
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.117
in broad daylight

475
00:28:44.162 --> 00:28:46.228
Hold someone else's precious daughter in your arms

476
00:28:46.228 --> 00:28:47.829
wandering playboy

477
00:28:48.228 --> 00:28:49.873
I'm not interested in saying hello

478
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.198
Playboy?

479
00:28:57.395 --> 00:28:58.788
Although it's not clear

480
00:28:58.934 --> 00:29:03.256
But there are hidden scenes that you absolutely cannot discover

481
00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:04.775
In short, it's a misunderstanding

482
00:29:05.721 --> 00:29:06.954
Where is the misunderstanding?

483
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:08.600
Because it’s not an upright relationship

484
00:29:08.728 --> 00:29:11.240
That's the kind of woman who covers her face, right?

485
00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:12.897
It doesn't matter how much misunderstanding you want to raise the tone.

486
00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:14.437
But I have nothing to do with her

487
00:29:15.628 --> 00:29:16.403
That's it

488
00:29:17.681 --> 00:29:18.681
I recognize this expression

489
00:29:18.728 --> 00:29:19.678
I've seen

490
00:29:19.703 --> 00:29:20.784
Don't you believe me?

491
00:29:22.228 --> 00:29:24.200
This isn't important now, is it?

492
00:29:24.225 --> 00:29:26.419
It became important from now on

493
00:29:27.795 --> 00:29:28.653
what

494
00:29:32.612 --> 00:29:35.459
I don’t know about women’s issues

495
00:29:36.003 --> 00:29:38.694
But I hope you won’t make a conclusion based on what you see.

496
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.503
I just received help from him

497
00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:43.194
Even if you don't believe what I say

498
00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:45.397
He works in the Bureau of Robbery

499
00:29:45.428 --> 00:29:47.497
Reputation is also worthy of trust

500
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.506
I also want to say where have you been?

501
00:29:54.548 --> 00:29:55.178
Hey

502
00:29:55.403 --> 00:29:57.822
It is said that one knows ten after hearing one.

503
00:29:59.962 --> 00:30:03.199
You are not allowed to enter or leave my Huimin Office

504
00:30:06.381 --> 00:30:07.124
Banned?

505
00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:14.406
Forbidden?

506
00:30:15.903 --> 00:30:17.512
How did you put up with me before?

507
00:30:17.897 --> 00:30:19.278
I can't help it

508
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.537
I will inform the promotion

509
00:30:21.562 --> 00:30:23.406
Make him responsible for this

510
00:30:23.595 --> 00:30:24.399
That’s all

511
00:30:25.637 --> 00:30:26.231
what

512
00:30:26.256 --> 00:30:27.289
Come forward now

513
00:30:27.314 --> 00:30:29.268
There will only be two dudes

514
00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.187
Yes

515
00:30:35.728 --> 00:30:37.862
But the medical woman just now

516
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.031
Looks strangely familiar

517
00:30:43.115 --> 00:30:45.082
He works in the Bureau of Robbery

518
00:30:46.028 --> 00:30:47.890
Did I mention Robbery Hall?

519
00:30:56.128 --> 00:30:58.174
Hung King Jiedu Powder sent by the envoy

520
00:30:58.495 --> 00:30:59.962
It should be effective

521
00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:11.718
Your sores are really difficult to cure

522
00:31:14.071 --> 00:31:15.393
I'm tired

523
00:31:42.636 --> 00:31:43.969
this is painkiller

524
00:31:46.545 --> 00:31:47.912
Get some sleep

525
00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:24.143
when did you come

526
00:32:25.362 --> 00:32:27.056
I came here directly after getting off work from the Huimin Office.

527
00:32:27.985 --> 00:32:30.618
Because adults need to drink soup and medicine

528
00:32:34.659 --> 00:32:35.859
what are these

529
00:32:35.884 --> 00:32:38.315
Didn't the Lord lose his temper?

530
00:32:38.442 --> 00:32:40.627
So I picked out some things that were still usable and brought them back

531
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:46.484
Where do you want to use the book that was burned by fire?

532
00:32:47.706 --> 00:32:48.715
Take it to the toilet

533
00:32:50.452 --> 00:32:51.305
like this

534
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.384
Was this originally placed in the sarangcha?

535
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.730
I heard

536
00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:19.096
You rewarded medicinal materials to the Huimin Administration

537
00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:20.471
Well, it's just a coincidence

538
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.905
The same thing happened with Ji Tong before

539
00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:27.634
I didn’t expect you to be so considerate of the people.

540
00:33:29.053 --> 00:33:29.887
Common people?

541
00:33:30.443 --> 00:33:31.637
I will for that reason

542
00:33:31.924 --> 00:33:32.618
Just do this?

543
00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:34.138
Otherwise, for what purpose?

544
00:33:34.163 --> 00:33:36.080
Because I'm handsome

545
00:33:38.912 --> 00:33:40.230
It's time for me to go

546
00:33:41.341 --> 00:33:43.680
The thief hall game is slowly becoming boring.

547
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:45.887
Do you want to go to Hucao from tomorrow?

548
00:33:46.703 --> 00:33:49.290
Aren't you tired of always thinking about having fun?

549
00:33:50.224 --> 00:33:52.640
People who are idle are the most diligent

550
00:33:53.103 --> 00:33:54.774
Sir, I thought of it

551
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:56.302
That medical lady just now

552
00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:59.309
Is he the thief you were looking for that night?

553
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:01.015
You know so quickly

554
00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.873
Since I mentioned it all, let me ask by the way

555
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.820
I'm always looking for excuses...

556
00:34:13.373 --> 00:34:15.339
You stay here, I'll go check it out

557
00:34:23.026 --> 00:34:24.312
Cotton arrows?

558
00:34:26.055 --> 00:34:27.005
Ji Tong

559
00:34:32.431 --> 00:34:34.518
It seems you want to meet me alone

560
00:34:51.523 --> 00:34:53.040
This is the advice of the great commander...

561
00:34:53.232 --> 00:34:55.615
Was this originally placed in the sarangcha?

562
00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.922
It was originally put in the stove to burn, so I quickly took it out.

563
00:35:05.698 --> 00:35:07.065
How could this happen?

564
00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:12.442
Can I afford it if I expose these things?

565
00:35:13.453 --> 00:35:15.502
If you are not careful, you may put everyone in danger

566
00:35:16.106 --> 00:35:18.277
What's wrong? What's written on it?

567
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:22.149
It's just right for use in the toilet.

568
00:35:32.205 --> 00:35:35.134
You can take care of others in your own way

569
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.326
In fact, I have wanted to read this book since before

570
00:35:41.351 --> 00:35:42.667
can you give it to me

571
00:35:44.173 --> 00:35:46.998
It is all about Da Si Jian when he was serving as an observer on Ping'an Road.

572
00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:49.167
and recent corruption.

573
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.039
The records are really detailed

574
00:35:55.865 --> 00:35:57.501
I understand your intention in giving this to me.

575
00:35:58.377 --> 00:35:59.970
But didn’t I make it very clear at the time?

576
00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:02.087
I won't cover up your theft

577
00:36:02.128 --> 00:36:05.082
Nor will we blame North Korea for condoning corrupt officials.

578
00:36:05.432 --> 00:36:06.442
This means

579
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.882
i can't do anything

580
00:36:10.704 --> 00:36:13.871
It seems that I was kind-hearted for a moment, so you just think of me as a good person.

581
00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:14.601
you misunderstood

582
00:36:15.081 --> 00:36:18.054
I'm not the kind of person who talks about justice

583
00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:20.459
So if you want to live peacefully

584
00:36:20.484 --> 00:36:23.445
Just keep being a thief and help your neighbor

585
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.437
Even if you catch a corrupt official, you won't be able to change North Korea.

586
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.295
who is

587
00:36:33.701 --> 00:36:34.498
Stop chasing

588
00:36:35.675 --> 00:36:36.823
who is that person

589
00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:38.714
Ji Tong

590
00:36:44.762 --> 00:36:47.064
Was this note given by Ji Tong?

591
00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.798
It seems to be written for you

592
00:36:54.815 --> 00:36:56.307
thank you very much last night

593
00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.432
This document fell into my hands by chance and is now handed over to you.

594
00:37:10.581 --> 00:37:12.181
He was just kind-hearted

595
00:37:12.206 --> 00:37:13.939
I think too much

596
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:16.779
Compared to a mere thief like me

597
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:19.045
I believe this book would be more useful if given to an officer

598
00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:23.142
Just a thief?

599
00:37:24.415 --> 00:37:25.392
What's wrong?

600
00:37:26.746 --> 00:37:28.379
Didn't he say he was just a thief?

601
00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:29.614
what

602
00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:31.717
Why are you working so hard?

603
00:37:32.997 --> 00:37:35.298
Why do you always treat other people’s affairs as your own?

604
00:37:35.323 --> 00:37:36.739
Just a thief

605
00:37:37.846 --> 00:37:38.961
It's really annoying

606
00:37:45.455 --> 00:37:46.451
what is that

607
00:37:48.393 --> 00:37:49.407
I'm going to meet someone

608
00:37:50.314 --> 00:37:51.729
Why do you show that look?

609
00:37:52.064 --> 00:37:53.564
Who are you going to see?

610
00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:55.342
brother

611
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.126
I've come to say hello to you, Your Highness.

612
00:38:13.453 --> 00:38:15.695
welcome my brother

613
00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:23.036
How long have we not seen each other

614
00:38:23.928 --> 00:38:25.801
The last time we met was the night of Gengwu Year

615
00:38:28.714 --> 00:38:30.542
The day you drew your sword against me

616
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.392
It still feels like it happened a few days ago

617
00:38:39.976 --> 00:38:40.679
good

618
00:38:42.795 --> 00:38:44.442
What did you come here for today?

619
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.795
This is a handwritten book

620
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:12.861
I got it by chance while killing time in the Robbery Hall.

621
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:15.786
The crime recorded above has been confirmed to be true by the officer

622
00:39:17.395 --> 00:39:19.532
This can be handled by the Robbery Bureau

623
00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:22.367
If it is a memorial, during the public deliberation process

624
00:39:22.745 --> 00:39:24.370
Da Si Jian will definitely intervene

625
00:39:25.354 --> 00:39:27.786
So you want me to personally order severe punishment?

626
00:39:31.637 --> 00:39:33.629
What if I don't do what you expect?

627
00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:34.886
i don't have any expectations

628
00:39:35.671 --> 00:39:36.829
Nor should there be

629
00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:39.173
you should know very well

630
00:39:41.637 --> 00:39:42.739
Really cold

631
00:39:43.791 --> 00:39:46.358
After all, that's the house where I once discussed marriage with you.

632
00:39:46.395 --> 00:39:48.695
If a person with deep greed is regarded as his father-in-law

633
00:39:48.923 --> 00:39:50.036
It will only lead to self-destruction

634
00:39:51.096 --> 00:39:54.123
Just use the reason that things must be done right

635
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.851
but what do you really think

636
00:40:01.406 --> 00:40:02.304
Damn it

637
00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:05.164
Just that kind of guy

638
00:40:05.901 --> 00:40:08.601
I don't want to be looked down upon by him

639
00:40:11.095 --> 00:40:11.879
what did you say

640
00:40:12.062 --> 00:40:14.470
Yes, although very childish

641
00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:16.611
But my pride was hurt by some guy

642
00:40:27.483 --> 00:40:29.389
Why did you go to see the Lord?

643
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.286
Even the concubine’s palace won’t let me take a step closer.

644
00:40:36.313 --> 00:40:37.532
It seems that I will meet my mother-in-law in the future.

645
00:40:37.557 --> 00:40:39.423
I'm going to Kangnyeongjeon

646
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.448
You're the real deal

647
00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:45.293
tell me

648
00:40:45.425 --> 00:40:47.376
What did the Lord say?

649
00:40:48.194 --> 00:40:49.976
tell me quickly

650
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:52.106
Do you have to see me dying before you are willing to do it?

651
00:41:09.948 --> 00:41:11.042
See you like this

652
00:41:11.749 --> 00:41:13.582
I have to be more diligent in my idleness.

653
00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.598
Have you been looked down upon?

654
00:41:25.862 --> 00:41:29.057
Then protect your brother's humble self-esteem.

655
00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:32.036
After all, my brother is also dignified.

656
00:41:34.664 --> 00:41:35.682
Enzu

657
00:41:38.502 --> 00:41:40.742
All of us are illiterate

658
00:41:41.062 --> 00:41:42.495
Coming

659
00:41:42.495 --> 00:41:43.662
Eunjo is here

660
00:41:45.528 --> 00:41:46.528
wait for me

661
00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:52.651
what is written on it

662
00:41:54.862 --> 00:41:56.514
Come on, read it to us.

663
00:41:59.254 --> 00:42:00.120
OK

664
00:42:04.043 --> 00:42:05.932
Chief Admonished Jinde Khan

665
00:42:08.411 --> 00:42:13.417
Taking advantage of bad harvest years to plunder the property of poor people

666
00:42:13.815 --> 00:42:15.182
what are you doing

667
00:42:22.886 --> 00:42:26.526
Take away their land with cruel usury

668
00:42:26.762 --> 00:42:29.257
Eventually, the people were forced into desperation

669
00:42:30.456 --> 00:42:33.251
It’s really against human ethics

670
00:42:35.616 --> 00:42:38.154
Fields plundered by sinners

671
00:42:39.227 --> 00:42:42.501
Return all to their original owners to redress grievances

672
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.111
Remove his official position and confiscate his property

673
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:47.954
Exile according to law

674
00:42:51.594 --> 00:42:52.460
Take this

675
00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:57.311
Punish corrupt officials who steal people’s granaries

676
00:42:58.612 --> 00:42:59.904
Oops

677
00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:03.398
This is simply the rain that comes after a long drought

678
00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:07.076
It seems that God is not so heartless

679
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.420
What's going on

680
00:43:22.557 --> 00:43:25.023
Isn't that a momentary kindness?

681
00:43:45.614 --> 00:43:46.448
you guy

682
00:43:46.473 --> 00:43:47.567
How dare you do this

683
00:43:47.592 --> 00:43:51.101
I asked you how that document fell into the hands of the Maharaja

684
00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.754
You stabbed me in the back

685
00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:54.761
Do you still want to frame me now?

686
00:43:57.734 --> 00:44:00.467
Isn't it Da Sijian who gave the secret records to Lord Daoyue?

687
00:44:02.576 --> 00:44:05.757
No matter how foolish you are, the great minister will not bring about your own destruction if you give him advice.

688
00:44:06.859 --> 00:44:07.839
But that secret record

689
00:44:08.034 --> 00:44:10.432
No one knows the content except my father and me.

690
00:44:10.907 --> 00:44:13.179
Why don't you test the maharaja a little bit?

691
00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:18.328
Your majesty probably still doesn’t know that the secret record comes from me.

692
00:44:18.362 --> 00:44:19.389
If you know

693
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:22.542
He wouldn't just depose the chief minister

694
00:44:24.562 --> 00:44:27.317
First, send someone secretly to keep an eye on the Maharaja.

695
00:44:27.875 --> 00:44:29.604
Who did he meet and where did he go?

696
00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:31.689
Get it all clear

697
00:44:39.128 --> 00:44:40.117
what is this

698
00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:42.045
It must be delicious

699
00:44:42.537 --> 00:44:43.920
Shi San, come here quickly

700
00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:45.395
I'm coming Oops

701
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.320
Shi San is here

702
00:44:48.345 --> 00:44:50.012
what are you doing come here

703
00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:52.767
Come on, come on

704
00:44:52.895 --> 00:44:54.857
take a drink

705
00:44:54.882 --> 00:44:56.261
I'll drink this bottle directly

706
00:44:56.762 --> 00:44:57.476
come on

707
00:44:57.501 --> 00:44:59.267
Let's have a drink together

708
00:44:59.295 --> 00:45:00.039
Cheers

709
00:45:01.624 --> 00:45:03.898
Please take the time to go over and have a drink.

710
00:45:03.923 --> 00:45:05.523
The adults think you are an official

711
00:45:05.562 --> 00:45:06.957
to say thanks to you

712
00:45:06.982 --> 00:45:09.592
Even though the situation is tight, I still have food prepared and waiting for you.

713
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.867
Although I have always believed that if I do something, I have to let people know about it.

714
00:45:15.118 --> 00:45:16.411
but i'm busy tonight

715
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:24.314
Dazao, please go there for me

716
00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:24.954
Me?

717
00:45:24.979 --> 00:45:27.154
Then make an appointment to meet at the gate of the palace at Xu time.

718
00:45:27.262 --> 00:45:27.998
and you

719
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.770
Starting tomorrow, we will start tracing Ji Dong’s whereabouts again.

720
00:45:30.903 --> 00:45:32.017
What's wrong?

721
00:45:32.336 --> 00:45:34.401
The crimes of Da Si Jian recorded in the secret records

722
00:45:35.187 --> 00:45:37.551
It's not information that ordinary thieves can easily collect, right?

723
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:40.604
Do you think there is someone behind Ji Tong?

724
00:45:40.974 --> 00:45:42.311
Was there anyone who instigated it?

725
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.632
Or, as the letter says, I just got it by chance.

726
00:45:44.965 --> 00:45:46.257
It is necessary to confirm clearly

727
00:45:46.388 --> 00:45:47.114
Yes

728
00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:50.461
And I started to get curious

729
00:45:52.174 --> 00:45:53.198
What that guy looks like

730
00:46:22.028 --> 00:46:24.061
She was sold to her grandfather

731
00:46:24.086 --> 00:46:25.853
I must be responsible for taking care of his daily life.

732
00:46:29.663 --> 00:46:30.920
It seems that your life is really good

733
00:46:33.911 --> 00:46:34.797
I…

734
00:46:36.034 --> 00:46:39.570
I didn't know you were the son of this family before.

735
00:46:39.647 --> 00:46:40.714
How rude

736
00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:41.704
very sorry

737
00:46:47.027 --> 00:46:48.389
That girl from the Hong family

738
00:46:48.912 --> 00:46:51.823
If she comes into my house another day, I will trample her hard.

739
00:46:54.363 --> 00:46:57.167
I'll take it as you accepting my apology.

740
00:46:57.192 --> 00:46:57.879
farewell

741
00:47:00.262 --> 00:47:01.167
Cancel the marriage

742
00:47:03.206 --> 00:47:04.432
My marriage?

743
00:47:08.795 --> 00:47:09.882
Why should I do this?

744
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.832
Something not worthy of being a human being

745
00:47:11.857 --> 00:47:13.590
Struggling and running around in this house, living with me

746
00:47:13.615 --> 00:47:14.411
upsetting

747
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.332
I will consider it

748
00:47:21.832 --> 00:47:24.401
In North Korea, children born to concubines are defective

749
00:47:24.569 --> 00:47:25.426
This means

750
00:47:25.656 --> 00:47:28.139
In this family you can only be regarded as half an animal

751
00:47:28.981 --> 00:47:31.442
To this extent...I know it too

752
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.820
No

753
00:47:33.328 --> 00:47:34.245
you don't know

754
00:47:35.232 --> 00:47:36.742
Remember the shame of today

755
00:47:37.428 --> 00:47:38.854
The moment you step into this home

756
00:47:38.879 --> 00:47:40.286
The pain will be ten times greater than now

757
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.754
Don't forget that my brother's temper is crueler than anyone else's

758
00:47:47.653 --> 00:47:48.895
Is this a warning?

759
00:47:49.557 --> 00:47:50.504
It's a good deed, right?

760
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.951
Sometimes you have to pretend to be good.

761
00:47:54.262 --> 00:47:55.342
Why do you do this to me?

762
00:47:55.507 --> 00:47:58.179
Because Mr. Hong actually returned the coins

763
00:47:58.494 --> 00:48:00.926
It seems that I am sincere towards you, a naughty girl...

764
00:48:02.637 --> 00:48:05.182
Are you talking about us... Lord Superintendent?

765
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.061
You already look like this, why are you pretending to have deep love between father and daughter?

766
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.676
Look at what kind of behavior this is at home

767
00:48:13.315 --> 00:48:15.526
I said I want to see the Superintendent

768
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:17.504
Enzu

769
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.495
Don't do this to you too

770
00:48:19.823 --> 00:48:21.182
Master is right

771
00:48:21.207 --> 00:48:22.979
It can be collected in full

772
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.237
So what if it's a little shameless?

773
00:48:25.262 --> 00:48:27.895
If you just pretend to be stupid and accept it, won't you be able to live a more comfortable life?

774
00:48:27.942 --> 00:48:29.575
Is it so difficult?

775
00:48:33.395 --> 00:48:35.770
He doesn't want you to leave home with a heavy burden anymore.

776
00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:39.817
Just to find your mother's slave documents

777
00:48:41.009 --> 00:48:42.939
Just keep this home safe

778
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:45.582
It's already too heavy

779
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.832
He will repay even these kindnesses one after another

780
00:48:49.964 --> 00:48:52.092
This is what he told Du Cheng Edict Supervisor

781
00:48:55.287 --> 00:48:56.511
Don't say anything

782
00:48:57.529 --> 00:48:59.042
If you want to scold, just scold that one...

783
00:49:00.379 --> 00:49:02.345
The mother who was extremely happy after receiving the betrothal gift, right?

784
00:49:03.295 --> 00:49:04.126
too late

785
00:49:04.429 --> 00:49:06.139
It's time to prepare dinner

786
00:49:12.071 --> 00:49:13.919
I really can't stand it

787
00:49:17.754 --> 00:49:19.828
How do you want me to hold a wedding?

788
00:49:45.902 --> 00:49:46.779
Is anyone there?

789
00:49:59.709 --> 00:50:00.819
Where is it?

790
00:50:26.628 --> 00:50:27.641
What are you doing there?

791
00:50:30.062 --> 00:50:31.462
Why are you here?

792
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:33.869
Just passing by

793
00:50:34.497 --> 00:50:35.891
The moon just rises

794
00:50:36.423 --> 00:50:37.219
Just right

795
00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:39.966
Come and get what should be returned to me

796
00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.216
By the way, belt

797
00:50:43.137 --> 00:50:44.557
I washed it and left it at home

798
00:50:45.428 --> 00:50:47.110
Please wait a moment. I'm going down.

799
00:50:47.165 --> 00:50:47.779
No

800
00:50:48.346 --> 00:50:49.247
You stay there

801
00:50:57.203 --> 00:50:58.516
What are you looking at?

802
00:50:59.095 --> 00:51:01.325
Just...night

803
00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:03.775
i hate night

804
00:51:04.358 --> 00:51:06.091
Because it looks like nothing happened

805
00:51:06.495 --> 00:51:07.904
calm alone

806
00:51:09.728 --> 00:51:11.369
This is why I like the night

807
00:51:15.662 --> 00:51:17.997
The night seen from the roof

808
00:51:18.262 --> 00:51:19.160
even more so

809
00:51:20.722 --> 00:51:21.891
Look out from here

810
00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:23.703
People will become small

811
00:51:24.149 --> 00:51:25.594
The house will also become smaller

812
00:51:27.158 --> 00:51:28.975
Even the palace in the distance has become smaller

813
00:51:30.325 --> 00:51:32.782
It feels like my sadness has also shrunk.

814
00:51:34.696 --> 00:51:35.804
What are you worried about?

815
00:51:36.115 --> 00:51:37.985
Maybe I can be merciful and help you

816
00:51:40.362 --> 00:51:41.794
I want to refuse

817
00:51:42.728 --> 00:51:44.260
If anyone is on my side

818
00:51:45.128 --> 00:51:47.310
I might want to let go

819
00:51:48.037 --> 00:51:49.166
Then let it go

820
00:51:49.862 --> 00:51:50.972
no matter what

821
00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:52.857
I think you can let go once

822
00:51:56.862 --> 00:51:57.688
if necessary

823
00:51:58.025 --> 00:51:59.141
I can also make you let go

824
00:52:05.125 --> 00:52:08.122
Talk like you know something

825
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.838
Because even if I don’t know what happened

826
00:52:11.863 --> 00:52:12.860
but whatever that is

827
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.882
Someone who can make you let go

828
00:52:22.479 --> 00:52:26.175
Do I have a strong backer now?

829
00:52:28.628 --> 00:52:29.466
Compared to just now

830
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.191
I'm a little sad

831
00:52:31.216 --> 00:52:32.241
became smaller

832
00:52:33.031 --> 00:52:33.760
That’s all?

833
00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.816
This should be the only thing left, right?

834
00:52:42.228 --> 00:52:42.932
Right

835
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.188
I heard it from others

836
00:52:46.744 --> 00:52:48.660
Matters concerning the chief minister’s admonishment to the supervisor’s family

837
00:52:49.575 --> 00:52:51.513
I heard it was investigated by the Robbery Bureau.

838
00:52:53.995 --> 00:52:55.788
I was surprised since last time

839
00:52:56.462 --> 00:52:58.419
How did you know I was in the Robbery Hall?

840
00:53:00.265 --> 00:53:02.529
I have no memory of mentioning this at all

841
00:53:10.193 --> 00:53:10.913
That…

842
00:53:15.338 --> 00:53:17.185
So sweet, so sweet

843
00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.032
What's the matter with you

844
00:53:19.315 --> 00:53:21.504
Didn’t you just say that we won’t meet each other again before passing the imperial examination?

845
00:53:22.463 --> 00:53:23.600
Congratulations on winning the top prize

846
00:53:23.625 --> 00:53:25.558
We are like men. Forget what happened last time.

847
00:53:27.248 --> 00:53:28.819
It seems like nothing happened at your house?

848
00:53:29.128 --> 00:53:29.844
What's going on

849
00:53:30.187 --> 00:53:31.263
That evil girl of yours

850
00:53:32.004 --> 00:53:33.841
Don't mention that girl anymore

851
00:53:33.866 --> 00:53:34.960
The wine has become bitter

852
00:53:34.985 --> 00:53:35.947
Really

853
00:53:36.293 --> 00:53:39.877
You were still in our Enzu's head before, and Enzu's was short.

854
00:53:41.665 --> 00:53:43.224
Why does your face look so ugly?

855
00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:53.211
Patients who came to the Huimin Department because they were shot by arrows in the middle of the night

856
00:53:54.654 --> 00:53:57.083
Nine times out of ten, they are officers from the Bureau of Robbery on patrol.

857
00:53:58.362 --> 00:53:59.274
indeed

858
00:53:59.305 --> 00:54:02.008
That's why I always thought you were an officer of the Bureau of Robbery

859
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:08.293
I also heard about you sending rice to the proprietor's aunt

860
00:54:08.437 --> 00:54:09.736
Do you know the widow too?

861
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.077
How could it be?

862
00:54:11.409 --> 00:54:13.924
Because Mr. Da Si Jian often takes action

863
00:54:13.949 --> 00:54:17.311
Their slaves had no choice but to come to the Huimin Office frequently.

864
00:54:19.062 --> 00:54:20.899
Sure enough, this is such a pedantic thing again.

865
00:54:23.443 --> 00:54:24.382
thank you

866
00:54:26.224 --> 00:54:27.005
Why do you want to thank me?

867
00:54:28.181 --> 00:54:28.905
Just…

868
00:54:29.462 --> 00:54:31.774
Because I'm familiar with those people too

869
00:54:34.128 --> 00:54:36.805
This is not a thank you that someone like me should accept.

870
00:54:37.281 --> 00:54:38.936
You have someone else to thank

871
00:54:40.103 --> 00:54:40.955
Who is it?

872
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:42.180
There is one

873
00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:45.852
A nosy guy like you

874
00:54:46.911 --> 00:54:48.614
Are you talking about Ji Tong?

875
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:50.539
I just convey his thoughts

876
00:54:51.093 --> 00:54:52.124
Just changed hands again

877
00:54:55.035 --> 00:54:58.939
Your determination to convey the other person’s feelings

878
00:54:59.387 --> 00:55:00.439
It’s also a heartfelt thought

879
00:55:00.896 --> 00:55:02.208
Just say no

880
00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.224
In my opinion, you are a very good person.

881
00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.336
But you don’t seem to know it very well yourself.

882
00:55:09.862 --> 00:55:11.208
Are you still pretending not to know?

883
00:55:14.091 --> 00:55:15.914
You've only met me a few times and you can make such an assertion?

884
00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:20.637
You could say it’s the intuition I’ve developed over the years in society.

885
00:55:22.662 --> 00:55:24.150
Anyway, this matter

886
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.575
I'm really glad that you can help me solve it.

887
00:55:29.696 --> 00:55:30.453
Are you glad?

888
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:33.122
What does this mean?

889
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:35.365
Just...

890
00:55:37.018 --> 00:55:39.344
Say you are smart

891
00:55:39.612 --> 00:55:41.846
I'm glad that everything went well

892
00:55:41.962 --> 00:55:43.209
Don't say this casually

893
00:55:44.062 --> 00:55:44.659
what

894
00:55:44.896 --> 00:55:47.869
poverty, shabbiness, misery, tears

895
00:55:48.381 --> 00:55:50.444
It sounds like in the midst of all this misfortune

896
00:55:51.362 --> 00:55:53.303
I have also become one of your few blessings

897
00:56:00.299 --> 00:56:01.778
I just think this is the greatest blessing among misfortunes

898
00:56:03.014 --> 00:56:03.965
follow me

899
00:56:04.488 --> 00:56:07.434
I'll help you change into cotton cloth that can replace the belt and bandage the wound.

900
00:56:08.997 --> 00:56:10.940
Before you are kicked out by Lord Titiao

901
00:56:12.462 --> 00:56:13.795
Who will be driven away?

902
00:56:15.383 --> 00:56:16.647
Hello

903
00:56:16.939 --> 00:56:17.787
Zai Yi

904
00:56:18.724 --> 00:56:21.206
Let's just have another drink

905
00:56:23.812 --> 00:56:24.640
let go

906
00:56:30.394 --> 00:56:31.053
Oh?

907
00:56:32.628 --> 00:56:33.890
It's the Hui People's Administration

908
00:56:35.948 --> 00:56:36.875
Good

909
00:56:37.516 --> 00:56:41.434
I'm going to finish it off with this stinky girl today.

910
00:56:48.991 --> 00:56:50.197
Although I have said it many times

911
00:56:50.318 --> 00:56:52.584
prohibit command permission rescue

912
00:56:52.803 --> 00:56:54.197
These are usually what I do

913
00:56:54.575 --> 00:56:56.128
I'm just kidding

914
00:56:56.153 --> 00:56:58.444
Even if I come again, I won’t drive you away. Don’t worry.

915
00:56:59.437 --> 00:57:00.800
I won't worry about this kind of thing

916
00:57:01.678 --> 00:57:04.284
I'm just worried if the Tie Tiao here knows

917
00:57:04.321 --> 00:57:06.940
He should be so scared if he prohibits anyone from entering or exiting here.

918
00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:09.300
It's been like this since just now

919
00:57:10.462 --> 00:57:12.887
It seems that you come from a very prominent family?

920
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:14.556
It is one of the few in North Korea

921
00:57:14.758 --> 00:57:16.291
Just know this much first

922
00:57:16.404 --> 00:57:17.771
Also remember first that I am sympathizing with you

923
00:57:17.796 --> 00:57:19.465
I'm afraid you'll be scared if you know too much at once

924
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.828
I actually treat such a powerful person as a fool

925
00:57:24.046 --> 00:57:25.340
You must be feeling aggrieved

926
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.425
I feel very strange

927
00:57:29.928 --> 00:57:32.128
A strange woman less than half my size

928
00:57:33.215 --> 00:57:34.856
The way you rush forward and stand up for me

929
00:57:35.283 --> 00:57:38.178
This person seems not very clear, so he makes mistakes

930
00:57:38.294 --> 00:57:40.628
Please show me your magnanimity as a gentleman.

931
00:57:41.612 --> 00:57:43.109
That’s why I’m curious about you

932
00:57:48.597 --> 00:57:49.787
Did it start from that time?

933
00:57:56.533 --> 00:57:57.506
That's outrageous

934
00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:00.197
Is there such a thing?

935
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:03.197
What's going on

936
00:58:14.051 --> 00:58:15.418
why are you looking at me like this

937
00:58:15.462 --> 00:58:16.550
How alarming

938
00:58:16.899 --> 00:58:17.894
Me too

939
00:58:18.284 --> 00:58:19.503
I also feel panic about me like this

940
00:58:20.328 --> 00:58:21.022
what

941
00:58:22.662 --> 00:58:24.831
What I'm about to say next will be even more alarming.

942
00:58:26.112 --> 00:58:27.362
Do you have a favorite man?

943
00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:32.653
That... why do you ask?

944
00:58:32.785 --> 00:58:33.900
Even if there is, it's none of my business

945
00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:35.628
Are you free tomorrow?

946
00:58:35.734 --> 00:58:36.522
give me some time

947
00:58:37.526 --> 00:58:39.493
what are you doing

948
00:58:39.602 --> 00:58:40.734
seducing you

949
00:58:45.404 --> 00:58:46.687
from now on

950
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.012
I plan to seduce you more seriously

951
00:58:58.232 --> 00:58:59.622
That...that

952
00:59:04.467 --> 00:59:06.906
I'm about to get married...

953
00:59:13.395 --> 00:59:14.653
why did you come here

954
00:59:23.597 --> 00:59:24.465
What's going on?

955
00:59:25.493 --> 00:59:26.719
This is midnight

956
00:59:28.056 --> 00:59:28.837
A man and a woman alone here?

957
00:59:31.695 --> 00:59:32.740
Who is that man?

958
00:59:32.856 --> 00:59:34.469
You should probably identify yourself first.

959
00:59:40.563 --> 00:59:41.675
please wait a moment

960
00:59:44.918 --> 00:59:46.084
What's the matter?

961
00:59:50.168 --> 00:59:51.012
Are you panicking?

962
00:59:51.808 --> 00:59:52.750
so interesting

963
00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:57.928
It seems like I bumped into something I shouldn't have seen?

964
00:59:59.543 --> 01:00:00.334
what

965
01:00:03.254 --> 01:00:05.762
As soon as you look at it, you will know that we are having a tryst.

966
01:00:06.264 --> 01:00:08.653
What a coincidence. Uninvited guests show up.

967
01:00:11.397 --> 01:00:12.681
That man also knows...

968
01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:15.781
Are you going to marry a septuagenarian?

969
01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:28.394
Your expression is getting more and more interesting the more I look at it

970
01:00:30.415 --> 01:00:32.819
If that kid knew, it would be more interesting

971
01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:36.575
Hello

972
01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:49.959
Say it yourself

973
01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:54.337
I am...who?

974
01:01:02.895 --> 01:01:07.228
(Want to hug you Loving you)

975
01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:12.462
(I don’t want to let go for a moment)

976
01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:17.028
(Looking as dreamy as ever)

977
01:01:17.028 --> 01:01:21.195
(Even if time passes, will you stay with me?)

978
01:01:21.195 --> 01:01:26.537
(Come to me now Loving you)

979
01:01:26.634 --> 01:01:31.244
(Just take one step closer to me)

980
01:01:31.303 --> 01:01:37.425
(Every day is filled with us)

981
01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:41.522
(all seem to shine beautifully)

982
01:01:52.728 --> 01:01:53.690
from now on

983
01:01:53.962 --> 01:01:55.300
Let's not meet again

984
01:01:55.325 --> 01:01:56.322
How about grabbing it?

985
01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:57.680
I am the king of this country

986
01:01:57.775 --> 01:01:59.356
If you want to grab it, are you afraid that you won't be able to grab it?

987
01:01:59.381 --> 01:02:01.881
Is falling out of love so painful?

988
01:02:01.975 --> 01:02:03.184
Please cancel the marriage

989
01:02:03.259 --> 01:02:04.759
Do you have to sell yourself?

990
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:05.857
as you said

991
01:02:05.895 --> 01:02:07.495
She's just a naughty girl like me

992
01:02:07.595 --> 01:02:10.362
Just a struggle to survive

993
01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:11.603
You'd better be honest

994
01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.528
Are you trying to run away from me now?

995
01:02:13.553 --> 01:02:15.020
How many times have you met me?

996
01:02:15.062 --> 01:02:16.640
How many times do we need to see each other again?

997
01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.228
If I want you to understand why I do this

998
01:02:18.253 --> 01:02:19.587
All I need is this sentence

999
01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:21.747
I just need your permission
