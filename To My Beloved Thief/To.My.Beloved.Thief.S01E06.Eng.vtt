﻿1
00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:19.523
When did you come here?

2
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.551
half an hour ago

3
00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:26.964
But compared to this…

4
00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.954
Shouldn't you be asking me why I'm here?

5
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.800
You already knew that

6
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:40.633
from that day on

7
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.308
How could I become you

8
00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:55.045
What the hell is going on

9
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.179
I have to go back to the palace first

10
00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:17.698
That's...

11
00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.133
White mask

12
00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.289
Black clothes

13
00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.179
medical clothes

14
00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.026
Eunjo, who was also present at the time, should have seen it more clearly than me.

15
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:36.554
Is Dr. Hong also present?

16
00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.448
How did you know I worked in the Robbery Bureau?

17
00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:40.001
That…

18
00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:45.672
Anyway, luckily it was you who took the initiative to resolve this matter.

19
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:02.869
It turned out to be you

20
00:02:04.544 --> 00:02:05.854
Ji Tong

21
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:07.965
Where is the lucky boy?

22
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.050
Not here

23
00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.129
Go look for it over there

24
00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:17.708
Will it go this way?

25
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:18.969
You are also a real person

26
00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.125
If it was Ji Tong, he would have escaped without a trace long ago.

27
00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:22.379
That's good

28
00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:27.675
Isn't this Eunjo?

29
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.429
what

30
00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.000
That…

31
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.176
Please help me...

32
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.357
Eunjo Eunjo

33
00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:34.715
What should I do?

34
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.729
Eunjo Eunjo

35
00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:36.747
OMG

36
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.704
Why didn't you ask me in the first place?

37
00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.632
Because I want to hide it for you

38
00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:49.122
that night

39
00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:52.294
I heard the patrol talking about the reasons for hunting Ji Dong

40
00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.607
Although Ji Tong’s name appears on the blood book,

41
00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.116
But you were having a wedding at that time

42
00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:00.382
It is impossible to kill Da Sijian

43
00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.816
Even if that's true

44
00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.104
I will also choose to hide it

45
00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.247
See you appear here

46
00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:10.597
Sure enough, he was wronged

47
00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:14.154
We should come here for the same reason, right?

48
00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:19.094
Everyone thought that someone would come to clean up the fake Jitong's body.

49
00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.772
I'm sorry for hiding from you during this time

50
00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:25.844
You don't need to apologize

51
00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:29.141
You stepped forward as a woman to help those people

52
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.154
It should have received applause

53
00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:38.926
So don't put that look on my face

54
00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:15.957
Buried right there

55
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.741
Just let me give these sacrificial meals to Ji Tong

56
00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:23.241
Who is over there

57
00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.147
What's going on

58
00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.192
Could it be a wild beast in the mountains?

59
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:30.319
Auntie proprietor, don’t worry

60
00:04:30.634 --> 00:04:32.185
I think you are the beast

61
00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:33.738
What kind of trick are you trying to play?

62
00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:51.660
Do you know why he stopped?

63
00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.722
That road is where tigers and other wild animals will appear.

64
00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:57.100
That's the person who caused you to be wronged

65
00:04:57.135 --> 00:04:58.153
I must know who he is

66
00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.488
It's too dangerous. Let's catch up here today.

67
00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:01.506
i don't care

68
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:02.800
i care

69
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.200
I don't want you to get hurt because of this.

70
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.478
You seem to have forgotten that your body is mine

71
00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:13.533
Go now and if you encounter a wild beast

72
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:14.650
I was the one whose limbs were dismembered

73
00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:18.472
Yeah, I forgot about it for a moment

74
00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:24.522
Do you have anyone you doubt?

75
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:26.838
The murderer of Da Sijian

76
00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:31.389
Someone who has a grudge against that adult

77
00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.841
It probably occupies half of the entire capital city.

78
00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.447
In other words, people who want Da Si to remonstrate to death

79
00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.122
It takes up half of the capital.

80
00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:41.635
I'm afraid it won't be easy to find the murderer now.

81
00:05:41.668 --> 00:05:44.419
After tonight, he won't show his true colors again.

82
00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:47.075
Why did he pretend to be a lucky boy and show up at the Robbery Hall?

83
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.133
Probably trying to take advantage of the death of the suspect Ji Dong

84
00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:50.900
Let this case come to an end

85
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.479
So he needs a suspect who can convince the people

86
00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:54.874
And that person is Ji Dong, right?

87
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.745
People will think Ji Dong is really dead

88
00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:04.876
He's just a thief

89
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:08.605
Now he has a name and the rumors are out of control

90
00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:11.364
Although I feel sorry for the person who died,

91
00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.227
But it’s right that the name Gildong should disappear like this

92
00:06:16.171 --> 00:06:17.214
Wait

93
00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:27.149
What do you mean now

94
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.533
Will you continue to be a thief in the future?

95
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.400
This is the default

96
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.374
I just can't answer that you won't do it anymore

97
00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:44.352
I knew you were a lucky boy, but I still hid it for you

98
00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:45.975
Because at least during the body swapping period

99
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.967
You can't steal again

100
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.086
Of course, don't worry

101
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.721
Do you think I'm worried about myself?

102
00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:57.065
I said that as a woman, I would stand up and help those people.

103
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.561
It should have received applause

104
00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:01.192
But that's in the past, I can think of it this way

105
00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:02.508
But it's different now

106
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.980
That woman is you

107
00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:08.783
Burglary, fall and homicide charges

108
00:07:08.808 --> 00:07:10.999
All threats fall on you

109
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.702
You know when I went to identify the body of the fake Ji Tong

110
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.221
How do I feel inside?

111
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.305
Could it be because I hid it for you?

112
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.799
It's because I failed to stop you that things became like this

113
00:07:19.927 --> 00:07:21.517
I have complained and hated myself

114
00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.121
Nothing like that

115
00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:24.672
I've never been caught before...

116
00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:27.349
Haven't you been caught by me?

117
00:07:34.117 --> 00:07:35.011
I warn you

118
00:07:35.808 --> 00:07:37.464
Whether it's your body or my body

119
00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:39.402
As long as you dare to come out and steal things again

120
00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:41.436
Will definitely be caught

121
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.328
It will still fall into my hands when the time comes

122
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.792
I didn’t expect to be seen through again

123
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.139
I'm going back first

124
00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:11.555
stop

125
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:14.736
Why is that girl here at this time?

126
00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:17.721
Men?

127
00:08:18.643 --> 00:08:20.005
Look at this girl

128
00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:33.270
Miss

129
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.942
Your Majesty is coming. Hurry up.

130
00:08:36.207 --> 00:08:37.974
Good

131
00:08:39.695 --> 00:08:42.336
Miss, are you back?

132
00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:48.205
Even if you are only going out temporarily, you should check your appearance.

133
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.011
What Miss?

134
00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:51.333
shoes

135
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.295
I want to see you as soon as possible

136
00:08:57.527 --> 00:08:58.674
You want to use me as an excuse again?

137
00:09:01.646 --> 00:09:02.355
to you

138
00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:04.274
Give it to your fiancé

139
00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:07.761
I just finished the funeral and my body must be very damaged.

140
00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:11.236
My marriage...

141
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.873
I'm afraid your marriage will be postponed.

142
00:09:14.108 --> 00:09:19.070
It should be difficult for that company to do two major events this year.

143
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.055
You guys look nothing alike. You are beautiful.

144
00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:24.873
Miss

145
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:30.939
why are you laughing

146
00:09:31.632 --> 00:09:33.595
I'm not laughing. He said he doesn't look like his brother.

147
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.630
Not...

148
00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:39.617
Not like this

149
00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:41.224
No

150
00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:43.705
Miss

151
00:09:49.733 --> 00:09:50.877
You look nothing alike

152
00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:52.623
you are beautiful

153
00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:56.174
Why do you remember that sentence?

154
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.773
Am I so beautiful?

155
00:10:01.023 --> 00:10:02.707
Could it be just an interjection?

156
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:04.927
Just like when you see a mountain, you will praise its majesty

157
00:10:04.952 --> 00:10:07.633
Like praising the beauty of flowers when you see them?

158
00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.974
Oh my God, when were you there?

159
00:10:14.694 --> 00:10:15.989
Start by asking and answering your own questions

160
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.192
So you heard it all?

161
00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:22.517
This is for you

162
00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.486
My brother asked me to give it to you

163
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:26.861
He also regards you as my fiancé

164
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:35.717
I will definitely tell him about breaking off the engagement within today.

165
00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:37.133
Just do it

166
00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:42.114
You still look bad

167
00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:46.396
Laodun came in the rain the day before

168
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:48.949
It seems it hasn't faded yet.

169
00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:54.702
It's you who got it wrong. I'll take my leave first.

170
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:01.814
I read that right

171
00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:05.608
Oh my god

172
00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:07.005
Eunjo, you dress like this

173
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.295
Are you really just like the lady from another hospital?

174
00:11:09.624 --> 00:11:12.624
How to tie this belt?

175
00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:16.889
I'm upset enough. Who is looking for me?

176
00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:24.211
Du Chengzhi’s eldest son

177
00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:30.108
Do you have a problem with me...

178
00:11:30.762 --> 00:11:33.212
Did you go fool around with a man last night?

179
00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:34.281
Men?

180
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:37.078
Did he see me with him yesterday?

181
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.334
I don't know what you are talking about...

182
00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:45.806
He looks shameless, just like your father.

183
00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.841
What are you arguing about?

184
00:11:54.052 --> 00:11:54.788
Dad

185
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.222
I saw that stinky girl fooling around with a man yesterday

186
00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:01.563
Take this seriously

187
00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:04.194
Even Du Chengzhi was involved.

188
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.328
Wait

189
00:12:06.488 --> 00:12:09.522
Du Chengzhi's eldest son goes in and out of the palace's official offices every day

190
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.031
There's no way you don't recognize my face.

191
00:12:15.197 --> 00:12:18.234
Do I have to answer such a base suspicion?

192
00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.350
How dare you...

193
00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:22.588
As a gentleman, even if you are suspicious

194
00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.622
We should first ask clearly the cause and effect of the matter.

195
00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:30.325
The person I met last night was the young master of my house

196
00:12:30.634 --> 00:12:32.359
Who did you mistake for him?

197
00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:35.656
Have you not even confirmed who it is?

198
00:12:37.037 --> 00:12:38.659
I didn't have time to confirm this.

199
00:12:39.112 --> 00:12:41.977
But this stinky girl ran outside in the middle of the night and I just...

200
00:12:42.002 --> 00:12:43.112
Who are you calling a stinky girl?

201
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.021
Although I have a low status, I am your elder in the family tree.

202
00:12:48.203 --> 00:12:49.721
This is too much to say

203
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.353
Not to mention humiliating me like this

204
00:12:54.378 --> 00:12:57.112
It's disrespectful to the deceased

205
00:12:57.798 --> 00:13:00.112
As a scholar-official, you must know better than me, right?

206
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:05.040
Even in the royal family of this country

207
00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:07.534
If the evil girl enters the harem

208
00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:10.775
He will also receive the title and courtesy he deserves.

209
00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:12.875
What is your attitude?

210
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.471
You have no sense of proportion, woman

211
00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:16.100
Don't act rashly

212
00:13:17.469 --> 00:13:18.381
ok dad

213
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.100
That's absolutely right

214
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.078
Observe due etiquette

215
00:13:32.795 --> 00:13:35.265
The sincerity that should have shown filial piety by the father's side

216
00:13:35.742 --> 00:13:39.045
Just spend the rest of your life living up to his virtues.

217
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.795
Cheng Cheng, hurry up and prepare to enter the palace with me.

218
00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:44.423
Yes

219
00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:48.910
Just wait and see

220
00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:51.932
Just let your horse come over

221
00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.117
Do you dare to move this body and give it a try?

222
00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:58.701
Once that happens, you're waiting to be beheaded.

223
00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:24.667
what do you want to do

224
00:14:26.028 --> 00:14:28.345
I want to talk to my grandson

225
00:14:29.538 --> 00:14:30.882
Because the men in the house

226
00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:34.574
They don’t seem to understand the ethical norms that should be applied to elders

227
00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:38.079
So I'm here to teach you. Listen to me clearly.

228
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:41.726
If I dare to say it to this face in the future,

229
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:44.826
"She's just an evil girl", "She's just a concubine"

230
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:48.167
Or trample or threaten life

231
00:14:48.563 --> 00:14:50.604
If you dare to say any of the above

232
00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:52.079
Will cause trouble

233
00:14:53.447 --> 00:14:55.260
I was going to trample on you severely

234
00:14:56.418 --> 00:14:58.079
But you don’t even have that value

235
00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:00.307
what did you say

236
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.217
I understand

237
00:15:02.314 --> 00:15:04.207
The reason why you concealed your husband’s identity and insisted on getting married

238
00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:05.297
It's all for a reason

239
00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:07.947
You already knew he would pass away

240
00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:10.719
Actually, you want to act like a lady from another hall, right?

241
00:15:11.113 --> 00:15:12.913
Yes, whatever you say

242
00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:14.542
Shen Qing makes a deal with himself

243
00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:17.073
It’s not for the sake of my father’s 300 shi as an offering of rice.

244
00:15:17.462 --> 00:15:19.529
It's the name of the wife of Du Chengzhi's house.

245
00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:22.135
His wealth and fame

246
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.960
Just want to jump up the status

247
00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:27.792
Too cliche and boring

248
00:15:28.869 --> 00:15:30.192
Listen, grandson

249
00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:32.763
I'm not talking about identity

250
00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:35.273
It's about the etiquette of treating people.

251
00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:38.567
Why can’t you understand such a simple truth?

252
00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:44.493
Forget it, my thoughts about my grandson

253
00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:48.201
Not interested, let alone admonishing

254
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:51.348
Just follow basic etiquette from now on.

255
00:15:56.843 --> 00:15:58.379
You will eventually be like them

256
00:15:59.467 --> 00:16:01.948
Just dress up like this and show it to that man.

257
00:16:02.454 --> 00:16:05.110
It might make him more impressed with you

258
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:08.376
Men?

259
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.532
What's going on

260
00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:15.710
Are there other men?

261
00:16:25.056 --> 00:16:26.585
Help me pass it on to the concubine

262
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:28.129
Also say hello to me by the way

263
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:32.101
The Concubine has given you orders today. Please come to the atrium to say hello.

264
00:16:43.392 --> 00:16:45.151
Compared with sweets like medicine and fruit

265
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:46.654
It would be better to eat some jujubes

266
00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:49.807
My mother's constitution is cold, eating this will help.

267
00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:04.272
I heard that you go to the inner hospital every morning

268
00:17:04.297 --> 00:17:05.873
Are you still making medicine for me?

269
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.548
yes

270
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.751
What ridiculous thing do you want to do again?

271
00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:15.717
I just want to completely clear up your misunderstanding

272
00:17:16.007 --> 00:17:17.104
Misunderstanding?

273
00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:18.263
About the son...

274
00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.288
No, I mean the misunderstanding about me

275
00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:23.338
I'm not as depraved as you fear, nor am I a scoundrel.

276
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.017
Although I always like to fool around

277
00:17:26.148 --> 00:17:28.042
Occasionally bluffing

278
00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:30.567
Once you become obsessed with something, you will become stubborn and have a bit of a prince's disease.

279
00:17:33.195 --> 00:17:35.013
But I am a prince, and strictly speaking, it is not a disease.

280
00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:36.448
All in all

281
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.332
I also know how to show generosity to the poor

282
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:42.194
Occasionally, I am willing to show kindness

283
00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:46.757
Able to accept rejection from others calmly

284
00:17:47.747 --> 00:17:51.247
Will also pray for the other person’s well-being

285
00:17:52.808 --> 00:17:56.008
He also knows how to hide his difficulties for others and...

286
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.867
You really know how to praise yourself

287
00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:03.732
After all, complimenting yourself is the same as complimenting you, right?

288
00:18:05.176 --> 00:18:07.742
All thanks to the great concubine’s teachings.

289
00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:09.333
Only in this way can we raise such an excellent son

290
00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:12.470
Do you know it now?

291
00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.600
So annoying

292
00:18:15.218 --> 00:18:18.285
It seems that the mood of being a mother is the same.

293
00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.582
That’s the end of the grounding.

294
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:26.157
Will you also accept morning greetings from your children in the future?

295
00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:35.767
Jinshang Palace

296
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.051
Immediately order Judge Xu to bring the child

297
00:18:39.426 --> 00:18:41.133
Who does empress refer to?

298
00:18:41.964 --> 00:18:44.298
Palace Maid Hong Shi

299
00:18:52.897 --> 00:18:54.729
Can't we say that Hong Shi has been expelled from the palace?

300
00:18:54.754 --> 00:18:56.775
If the empress uses her wife to find her,

301
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.185
things will get more complicated

302
00:18:58.219 --> 00:19:00.035
I'd better leave the palace and bring him here.

303
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:00.904
No

304
00:19:01.238 --> 00:19:03.186
It's an emergency. Let's act together.

305
00:19:07.487 --> 00:19:08.388
Sir

306
00:19:09.658 --> 00:19:10.925
She doesn't seem to be in another courtyard

307
00:19:11.665 --> 00:19:13.232
Where did he go?

308
00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:16.370
Dazao, go to the Huimin Office and have a look

309
00:19:16.395 --> 00:19:17.428
yes

310
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.197
The young master will not return until the garrison period

311
00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:30.504
Is it okay for you to stay so late?

312
00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.110
It's okay. Everyone in the house has gone out.

313
00:19:33.392 --> 00:19:35.363
I have some things that I want to discuss with the young master

314
00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:38.101
Is anyone here?

315
00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:40.413
This voice…

316
00:19:47.392 --> 00:19:48.529
what are you doing here

317
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.117
Are you?

318
00:19:53.262 --> 00:19:54.707
I'm Dayi's school friend

319
00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:57.294
So that's it

320
00:19:57.319 --> 00:20:00.063
What should we do? Our young master is out.

321
00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:04.103
He should be here to find me

322
00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:06.957
How did you find this place?

323
00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:08.138
Enzu

324
00:20:08.263 --> 00:20:10.296
How can you address the young master's friends as "you"?

325
00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:13.176
It doesn't matter. We always get along casually.

326
00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:14.788
What?

327
00:20:14.873 --> 00:20:17.079
You'll scare people if you say that.

328
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.838
Because I often go in and out of the Huimin Office

329
00:20:19.863 --> 00:20:21.116
We are old acquaintances with her

330
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:22.798
That's it

331
00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:25.044
What's the matter with you coming to me?

332
00:20:26.361 --> 00:20:29.057
Sir, someone is looking for Hong Shi

333
00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:30.932
Who is Hong Shi?

334
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:33.772
Is the palace maid Hong Shi?

335
00:20:34.497 --> 00:20:36.251
I'll come to your door for this name.

336
00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:38.197
You should be able to guess who is looking for her, right?

337
00:20:42.446 --> 00:20:44.213
What should I do? It’s time for me to go.

338
00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:46.829
Okay, let’s eat old hens next time

339
00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:49.466
Wait

340
00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:52.057
Just wait for me and bring this with you

341
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.243
Why is the Queen Mother looking for me?

342
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.922
How would I know?

343
00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:04.335
Instead, why did you come to my house to catch the old hen?

344
00:21:04.644 --> 00:21:07.091
Mom insists on catching the old hen and giving it to me

345
00:21:07.116 --> 00:21:07.944
how can i refuse

346
00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:10.369
Don't call it so smoothly, okay?

347
00:21:12.107 --> 00:21:14.779
Why is such a good thing put in the cabinet and not taken away?

348
00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:16.657
Still collected neatly

349
00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:19.967
No

350
00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:22.194
Wait

351
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.697
This is…

352
00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:28.678
Oops

353
00:21:29.598 --> 00:21:30.626
Do I really have that?

354
00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:32.084
Are they really collected neatly?

355
00:21:32.133 --> 00:21:33.919
Mom...that's not right

356
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.001
This should be something your daughter left intentionally

357
00:21:37.033 --> 00:21:38.582
Why take it out?

358
00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:39.316
Really?

359
00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:41.401
Take it well. Give it to me.

360
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.812
I want to wear

361
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:46.301
I really don’t know who picked it.

362
00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:47.997
You really have a first-class vision

363
00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:51.392
Where are the lotus leaves put aside?

364
00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:58.975
Are even the lotus leaves carefully dried and preserved?

365
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.713
I feel like it’s something you cherish, so I didn’t throw it away and kept it.

366
00:22:06.296 --> 00:22:07.431
No matter how you look at it, right?

367
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:11.091
My mother also thinks I cherish it, right?

368
00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:12.079
Not really

369
00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:13.991
That comes with the embroidered shoes

370
00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:15.859
Why are you shouting with that straight face?

371
00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:17.646
Didn’t you see that my mother was scared by you?

372
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:18.769
Apologize immediately

373
00:22:19.247 --> 00:22:20.297
Sorry

374
00:22:20.597 --> 00:22:22.272
It doesn't matter

375
00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:23.757
Why is your child like this?

376
00:22:24.584 --> 00:22:27.041
Just keep this lotus leaf

377
00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:29.700
After all, it seems to be an extremely precious thing

378
00:22:30.383 --> 00:22:31.132
That…

379
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.457
Why don't you go out first?

380
00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:35.838
Is it convenient for me to take a step to talk?

381
00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:39.457
do you have anything to say to me

382
00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:42.638
It's our first time meeting. It's a little offensive to say this.

383
00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:44.872
It may also be a little abrupt

384
00:22:46.397 --> 00:22:47.347
But for now you...

385
00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:49.482
Is it better to keep distance from Ling Qianjin?

386
00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:53.870
Is it because a married daughter is an outsider after all?

387
00:22:53.979 --> 00:22:54.588
What?

388
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:57.501
Yes exactly so

389
00:22:58.633 --> 00:23:00.004
If she always runs to her parents’ house

390
00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:02.054
What would your in-laws think?

391
00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:04.697
That's right

392
00:23:05.222 --> 00:23:06.997
I'm too greedy

393
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.182
I didn't notice it when she stayed with me before

394
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:14.497
Now that I'm married, I want to keep her by my side even more.

395
00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:18.169
me too

396
00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:20.101
What?

397
00:23:21.647 --> 00:23:23.119
I mean, Ling Qianjin probably thinks the same way.

398
00:23:25.773 --> 00:23:28.840
Anyway, I will follow your advice

399
00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:31.313
Keep a little more distance from her

400
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.707
Just temporarily, just all of a sudden

401
00:23:42.553 --> 00:23:43.797
I'm so sorry

402
00:23:44.308 --> 00:23:45.710
I suddenly thought of my mother

403
00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:47.966
Really?

404
00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:50.644
By the way, never kill any old hen casually.

405
00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:52.579
Give it to your daughter

406
00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:03.494
Come back, that's mine

407
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.633
Really, there is no difference between you and me.

408
00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:10.442
what is our relationship

409
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.423
This is the current situation

410
00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:13.998
What's mine is yours

411
00:24:14.023 --> 00:24:15.345
What's yours is mine

412
00:24:17.758 --> 00:24:19.526
After changing the body

413
00:24:19.601 --> 00:24:21.170
There is always a feeling of treasure hunting

414
00:24:21.342 --> 00:24:22.964
What this body hides

415
00:24:22.989 --> 00:24:25.622
I dug them out one by one

416
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.117
What's next?

417
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:30.823
There is no such thing

418
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.314
And those embroidered shoes

419
00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:34.120
I just thought it was a pity to lose it, so I put it away.

420
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.695
I think so too

421
00:24:38.354 --> 00:24:40.236
I want to go back to the place now

422
00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:42.392
It's up to you to decide whether you want to go to the atrium or not.

423
00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:52.758
bow your head

424
00:24:53.385 --> 00:24:54.567
Damn it, Your Majesty

425
00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:59.176
Du Chengzhi, long time no see

426
00:25:00.425 --> 00:25:01.661
How are you doing?

427
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.761
I have heard that your father passed away

428
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.251
He must have been exhausted after being bedridden for many years.

429
00:25:08.534 --> 00:25:11.261
I sincerely hope that he will no longer be tortured

430
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:16.382
have you ever met my father

431
00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:22.358
I just heard that he was ill

432
00:25:23.664 --> 00:25:25.089
I can't thank you enough

433
00:25:27.383 --> 00:25:30.094
I heard that your Majesty entered His Majesty’s bedroom last night.

434
00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:32.707
Correct excessive use of medicinal materials

435
00:25:32.966 --> 00:25:34.151
There is such a thing

436
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.488
I am the deputy promotion officer of the internal hospital and have great responsibilities.

437
00:25:36.513 --> 00:25:37.713
The imperial doctor will be interrogated strictly

438
00:25:37.738 --> 00:25:39.876
It doesn't have to be that way. I didn't mean it.

439
00:25:39.901 --> 00:25:42.726
It's not a big deal. Just ask.

440
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:46.066
obey

441
00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:47.626
So be it

442
00:25:48.832 --> 00:25:50.066
I'm leaving first

443
00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:59.088
Your Majesty's maid, please stay.

444
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.657
Yours fell off

445
00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:26.204
give it to me

446
00:26:26.232 --> 00:26:27.865
Why do you need adults to help you...

447
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.623
maid

448
00:26:29.248 --> 00:26:30.632
Didn't you hear us?

449
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.635
The golden palace lady will go to the concubine's palace immediately to see you if there is something urgent.

450
00:26:48.248 --> 00:26:49.060
Yes

451
00:26:53.643 --> 00:26:54.726
Please go back to the dormitory

452
00:26:54.952 --> 00:26:56.241
good

453
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.184
The Maharaja seems not to know much about the incense.

454
00:27:13.755 --> 00:27:14.594
All agree

455
00:27:20.752 --> 00:27:23.819
Can you tell me the names of the medicinal materials introduced from the Ming Dynasty?

456
00:27:24.962 --> 00:27:27.794
Why do you ask this?

457
00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:30.157
I want to understand and learn about it by the way

458
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.891
Maybe it will be useful in the future

459
00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:35.950
That's madder, the seed of a flower

460
00:27:36.532 --> 00:27:38.518
It is a medicinal material that was only available in the Ming Dynasty

461
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:39.829
madder

462
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.738
thank you

463
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.060
I heard that you have something to do with your little girl

464
00:27:59.567 --> 00:28:02.385
I came to you to praise you for your efforts last time.

465
00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:04.445
By the way...

466
00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:07.707
I think you have another topic.

467
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.185
Not bad

468
00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:12.367
Not only are you quick with your hands and feet, you are also quite sharp.

469
00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:16.435
From now on, you can monitor the Maharaja for me.

470
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.373
Surveillance?

471
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:26.810
Then you really found the right person.

472
00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:29.600
Especially his relationship with women

473
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:30.942
Also help me investigate secretly

474
00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.020
A grown-up woman?

475
00:28:34.367 --> 00:28:37.026
Follow your orders, I will observe closely and pay more attention

476
00:28:37.775 --> 00:28:40.600
This incident makes me very uneasy

477
00:28:41.373 --> 00:28:42.754
I'm worried about him hanging out all day

478
00:28:43.023 --> 00:28:46.201
Will you meet some untouchables with no family background or background?

479
00:28:50.272 --> 00:28:51.223
Concubine

480
00:28:51.908 --> 00:28:53.564
What you just said

481
00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:56.257
I hope you are in front of the Maharaja

482
00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:58.298
Never mention

483
00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:00.276
what did you say

484
00:29:04.975 --> 00:29:05.988
Right

485
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:08.810
That child is rebellious

486
00:29:08.835 --> 00:29:11.320
The more forbidden it is, the more he wants to resist

487
00:29:14.337 --> 00:29:17.232
You know Maharaja very well

488
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.591
one more thing

489
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.998
Find out who is the woman holding hands with him in the courtyard

490
00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.504
If I tell my brother

491
00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:30.395
This confirms the impression that women are thoughtless and act rashly.

492
00:29:31.809 --> 00:29:34.053
Please also ask the empress of the middle temple to help me.

493
00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:40.031
It just so happens that I am also opposed to marrying into the Du Chengzhi family.

494
00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:42.325
Things take a turn for the better

495
00:29:42.742 --> 00:29:44.713
I will find another time to tell him

496
00:29:45.067 --> 00:29:46.313
thank you

497
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:50.338
Hailin, have you really decided?

498
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.895
A woman regrets her marriage

499
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.091
But I will be tortured by the rumors for a long time

500
00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:01.042
I'm willing to suffer the consequences

501
00:30:08.841 --> 00:30:10.501
Why hasn't he come yet?

502
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.004
Your Majesty, Hong Shi is back

503
00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:16.107
Let her in quickly

504
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:28.348
What did the concubine say?

505
00:30:30.408 --> 00:30:32.085
Let’s talk later. I’m so tired.

506
00:30:32.133 --> 00:30:33.742
You didn't make any mistake with my face, right?

507
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.688
what do you know

508
00:30:35.713 --> 00:30:38.146
Use your little body to run around all day long

509
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.567
This is really no ordinary tiredness

510
00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:41.595
That's my body and I know it, okay?

511
00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:45.133
Stop pretending and get up quickly

512
00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:55.282
Falling asleep so quickly?

513
00:30:59.176 --> 00:31:00.538
It seems that he is really tired

514
00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:18.117
This…

515
00:31:19.332 --> 00:31:20.735
I accepted it

516
00:31:22.233 --> 00:31:25.376
(when hands are put together)

517
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:30.839
(The moment you longed for came true)

518
00:31:33.423 --> 00:31:36.411
(I'll call again)

519
00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:42.886
(What I miss, what I treasure)

520
00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:46.051
(your love)

521
00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:50.026
(Those are very beautiful)

522
00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:54.811
(A day that cannot be erased)

523
00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:58.345
(going against time)

524
00:31:58.792 --> 00:32:04.075
(Come to the place where we first met)

525
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.567
(You're my everything to me)

526
00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:11.036
(The one that attracted me)

527
00:32:11.423 --> 00:32:18.833
(named your dazzling sunshine to me)

528
00:32:18.858 --> 00:32:22.520
(The moment I see you again)

529
00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:27.833
(My heart is calling you)

530
00:32:27.833 --> 00:32:33.267
(We Again Again)

531
00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:36.410
Don't move

532
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.039
My face turns out to be so pretty

533
00:32:39.308 --> 00:32:40.483
Don't interrupt my appreciation

534
00:32:51.968 --> 00:32:53.476
at least this moment

535
00:32:54.248 --> 00:32:56.336
I don't think soul swapping is that bad

536
00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:02.358
that night

537
00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:04.973
I said I would catch you with my own hands

538
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.992
not sincere

539
00:33:11.167 --> 00:33:12.176
No

540
00:33:13.167 --> 00:33:14.470
you have to mean it

541
00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:19.051
the things i did

542
00:33:20.044 --> 00:33:23.676
Just because I care too much

543
00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:29.376
Watching those patients starving, medicine doesn’t work

544
00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:33.267
I couldn't sit back and watch, so I started doing it.

545
00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:38.542
You must not understand

546
00:33:38.943 --> 00:33:40.439
Me too

547
00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:44.493
Why am I like this?

548
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.681
I can't think of an answer even if I try hard.

549
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.024
so i decided

550
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.687
Just think that God asked me to mind my own business.

551
00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:59.393
This way I don't have to look for reasons anymore

552
00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:01.990
I feel more comfortable

553
00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:04.484
not for anyone

554
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.037
Just to make myself feel better

555
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:09.093
Very selfish, right?

556
00:34:11.034 --> 00:34:11.978
maybe

557
00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:14.356
It's a kind of vanity, right?

558
00:34:15.663 --> 00:34:16.831
That's what you want

559
00:34:19.296 --> 00:34:20.381
you really mean it

560
00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:27.700
About what you promised me before

561
00:34:28.455 --> 00:34:32.346
Please stay within my range from now on.

562
00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:36.246
within my control

563
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.846
But if you go beyond this range

564
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.171
Moving to the foundation of North Korea

565
00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:43.380
I will definitely catch you

566
00:34:46.244 --> 00:34:48.715
But we can't usher in that day

567
00:34:51.004 --> 00:34:51.990
How could there be

568
00:34:52.342 --> 00:34:54.509
A little thief who steals things everywhere

569
00:34:54.933 --> 00:34:57.700
Why should we shake the foundation of this country?

570
00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:03.115
I promise you too

571
00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:06.412
If one day I have to be captured

572
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.100
It will definitely be done by the Maharaja himself

573
00:35:23.167 --> 00:35:25.678
Your Majesty, Judge Xu requests an audience.

574
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.537
let him in

575
00:35:29.133 --> 00:35:29.981
Quick position change

576
00:35:41.029 --> 00:35:44.729
Is it because I don’t know how to observe words and emotions? Did I come in too early?

577
00:35:44.817 --> 00:35:47.365
Well, from now on, count to ten at the door before coming in.

578
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.737
Yeah

579
00:35:51.904 --> 00:35:53.565
What did Du Chengzhi say just now?

580
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.112
Have you entered His Highness's bedroom?

581
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.081
Right

582
00:35:57.133 --> 00:35:58.512
When we met a few days ago

583
00:35:58.537 --> 00:36:00.331
I forgot to tell you this

584
00:36:07.229 --> 00:36:09.662
Dad, do you think the Maharaja wants to test you?

585
00:36:09.975 --> 00:36:11.671
It seems not to me

586
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.553
I think the same thing as you

587
00:36:13.723 --> 00:36:15.650
Then why are you so concerned

588
00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:18.884
Lord Daoyue…

589
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.146
This title is interesting

590
00:36:23.727 --> 00:36:25.328
Did you let them take the medicinal materials?

591
00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:31.571
No wonder Du Chengzhi and Zhang Shurong mentioned my title last time

592
00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:34.008
Because His Highness was not angry

593
00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:35.515
I think we should get through this smoothly.

594
00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:36.812
That's how those people talk

595
00:36:37.108 --> 00:36:38.442
Even if the speaker has no intention

596
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.303
But people around me always think there is something more than what is meant.

597
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:44.634
It seems that being a king is not an easy task.

598
00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:46.033
Just fold a quilt

599
00:36:46.033 --> 00:36:47.340
It will alarm everyone in the house

600
00:36:47.508 --> 00:36:48.937
Just asking for the name of the medicine

601
00:36:48.962 --> 00:36:50.884
We need to bring in those imperial doctors for interrogation.

602
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.846
We are all the same. We cannot be willful in our words and deeds.

603
00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.100
You shouldn't say that in front of someone who is suddenly a young widow.

604
00:37:03.104 --> 00:37:04.012
Not necessarily

605
00:37:04.557 --> 00:37:07.493
My husband’s family is kinder than expected

606
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:08.678
Really?

607
00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:10.981
Impossible

608
00:37:11.989 --> 00:37:14.681
I will enjoy the treatment that a lady deserves in another courtyard

609
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:16.318
don't worry about me

610
00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:19.778
Let’s not mention this first

611
00:37:20.442 --> 00:37:22.481
His Highness must be in a panic.

612
00:37:23.504 --> 00:37:25.390
His younger brother suddenly showed great concern for him

613
00:37:28.285 --> 00:37:30.471
What kind of medicine did you just say?

614
00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:32.037
That's called madder

615
00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:37.565
Is His Highness also getting old?

616
00:37:38.762 --> 00:37:40.499
Looks like he's getting sicker and sicker

617
00:37:49.124 --> 00:37:51.090
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

618
00:37:53.077 --> 00:37:55.328
The body suddenly becomes very heavy

619
00:37:55.705 --> 00:37:57.637
how can you get sick

620
00:37:57.662 --> 00:37:59.924
Lately, every day has been no different from usual.

621
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.093
Except that I haven’t lit any incense these past few days.

622
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:11.887
Light up the incense

623
00:38:14.353 --> 00:38:16.799
The Lord gradually began to show symptoms of addiction

624
00:38:17.242 --> 00:38:19.315
Since the king entered the bedroom on purpose,

625
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.173
Your Majesty won't sit idly by and ignore it, right?

626
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.109
Since the day when the secret records were handed over to His Highness,

627
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.943
Your majesty keeps getting in my way for some reason

628
00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:28.459
Do you want to get rid of him quietly?

629
00:38:32.334 --> 00:38:34.693
If you are not careful, all your efforts will be wasted.

630
00:38:36.362 --> 00:38:40.129
After all, His Highness believes that the royal family is sacred and inviolable

631
00:38:44.495 --> 00:38:45.499
Reason

632
00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:47.859
I need a reason

633
00:38:50.267 --> 00:38:52.609
It seems that we need to carefully search the whereabouts of the Maharaja.

634
00:38:52.814 --> 00:38:54.780
Can't let go of even the slightest sound of wind

635
00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:56.513
I understand

636
00:38:56.538 --> 00:38:58.506
I'm not ordering you

637
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.467
Since we want to force the king to submit,

638
00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.346
It might be dangerous. You'd better stay out of it.

639
00:39:02.371 --> 00:39:04.171
Then who should be responsible for this matter?

640
00:39:21.608 --> 00:39:22.781
I obviously want to enter Si Xian Mansion

641
00:39:22.806 --> 00:39:24.684
But he was sent to Yijin Mansion

642
00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:27.862
It is said that Du Chengzhi made some moves

643
00:39:29.189 --> 00:39:30.353
Si Xianfu?

644
00:39:31.177 --> 00:39:34.608
Are you there to supervise the corruption of high-ranking officials?

645
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:37.900
Or do you want to capture the country’s scholar-bureaucrats?

646
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.633
Above them?

647
00:39:42.342 --> 00:39:43.909
It seems that I really should do this

648
00:39:43.968 --> 00:39:47.618
You don't have that qualification

649
00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:52.692
Because I never gave you this qualification

650
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.534
You'd better not chat with the beast for too long

651
00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.171
If you have something to say, just say it.

652
00:40:04.618 --> 00:40:05.990
what do you think i want to say

653
00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:07.596
Since I was sent to Yijin Mansion

654
00:40:13.086 --> 00:40:15.778
Is it the royal family?

655
00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:31.753
Move them all to Yijin Mansion. Don’t leave out any one.

656
00:40:31.778 --> 00:40:32.678
Yes

657
00:40:34.341 --> 00:40:36.109
what is this doing

658
00:40:39.508 --> 00:40:41.418
I told you just tell me what you're searching for

659
00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.590
I will submit the report

660
00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:44.743
you don't have to know

661
00:40:44.957 --> 00:40:46.084
Because it's confidential

662
00:40:49.807 --> 00:40:50.906
Complete the move before the deadline

663
00:40:50.931 --> 00:40:51.997
Yes

664
00:41:07.868 --> 00:41:08.784
Ji Tong?

665
00:41:12.009 --> 00:41:13.031
so interesting

666
00:41:17.798 --> 00:41:19.278
Why is there a line of people there?

667
00:41:20.036 --> 00:41:21.712
It is said that Ji Tong is dead

668
00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:24.075
Everyone said they wanted to give him some money so he could go on the road.

669
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.067
It's been like that for more than ten days

670
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:33.234
Take it and leave it there

671
00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:38.862
This is real money. Will the beggars pick it up?

672
00:41:38.887 --> 00:41:39.971
Just let them pick it up

673
00:41:41.808 --> 00:41:43.075
If you meet someone who is hungry

674
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.109
Even if it’s money for traveling, Ji Tong will donate generously

675
00:41:47.024 --> 00:41:47.809
Condolences?

676
00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:49.334
This is what the people in the market said

677
00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:50.890
Don't you go and have a look?

678
00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:53.453
Are they even mourned by the people?

679
00:41:54.191 --> 00:41:57.591
Ji Tong is not so great that he deserves to be mourned

680
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:14.216
Although I am very ashamed of the deceased

681
00:42:14.608 --> 00:42:16.403
But please go with that legendary reputation

682
00:42:16.739 --> 00:42:18.172
Go farther

683
00:43:26.407 --> 00:43:27.773
They are all in Yijin Mansion as well.

684
00:43:27.836 --> 00:43:30.666
But you are the experience and I am everything

685
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.016
You are the son of the current Du Chengzhi

686
00:43:33.086 --> 00:43:35.407
And I am the son of a former college student, right?

687
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:36.810
speak clearly

688
00:43:37.279 --> 00:43:39.046
I am the top scholar in the imperial examination

689
00:43:39.071 --> 00:43:41.288
You are Yin Xu who came in through the back door because of your family background.

690
00:43:43.313 --> 00:43:45.260
But why do you keep hanging around here?

691
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:49.034
I want to see first what the king of this country looks like

692
00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.347
Go pick him up again

693
00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:52.650
He has been staying in his residence for several days without coming out.

694
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:53.716
On the contrary, it is more imaginable

695
00:43:54.582 --> 00:43:55.463
Then go and meet

696
00:43:56.941 --> 00:43:58.009
Wouldn't it be better if we went directly to see him?

697
00:43:58.174 --> 00:43:59.788
A mere experience in Yijin Mansion

698
00:43:59.813 --> 00:44:02.697
It’s not that easy to meet the king who is a royal family

699
00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:09.191
Didn't he even go to the Robbery Hall these days?

700
00:44:09.804 --> 00:44:12.960
The Maharaja has recently been studying the Four Books and Five Classics again at his residence.

701
00:44:12.985 --> 00:44:13.610
four…

702
00:44:15.708 --> 00:44:18.272
That child hasn't touched a book since he was ten years old

703
00:44:18.297 --> 00:44:19.725
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

704
00:44:20.792 --> 00:44:23.238
It's not that he doesn't read, he just pretends not to read...

705
00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:28.922
Could this be the case? Maybe it's just my delusion.

706
00:44:30.779 --> 00:44:32.688
Let's go and see how he looks, little one.

707
00:44:46.698 --> 00:44:47.819
Are they just people who look alike?

708
00:45:50.354 --> 00:45:51.594
why are you here

709
00:45:54.675 --> 00:45:57.575
The empress of the middle hall will arrive at noon

710
00:45:57.698 --> 00:46:01.425
The empress ordered all the ladies to have a chat here first.

711
00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:02.888
Yes Yes

712
00:46:09.127 --> 00:46:11.241
It’s been a long time since this party

713
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:12.963
nice to meet you all

714
00:46:12.988 --> 00:46:14.078
Yes Yes

715
00:46:15.107 --> 00:46:18.451
By the way, let's comfort Lady Shen.

716
00:46:18.679 --> 00:46:20.632
I heard she will break off the engagement soon

717
00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:24.307
Didn't we agree to keep it a secret?

718
00:46:24.332 --> 00:46:27.698
The more unfortunate something happens, the more we should all comfort each other

719
00:46:27.733 --> 00:46:28.860
Oh my god

720
00:46:29.362 --> 00:46:31.688
How could this happen? You must be feeling very uncomfortable.

721
00:46:33.646 --> 00:46:36.346
I'm fine

722
00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:37.844
Say it now

723
00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:39.694
What is the reason for breaking off the engagement?

724
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:41.038
That…

725
00:46:41.063 --> 00:46:42.730
If you don't explain it clearly at this time,

726
00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:45.279
In the end it will all be the woman’s fault

727
00:46:45.304 --> 00:46:47.638
It's not that you're hiding other men

728
00:46:47.663 --> 00:46:49.596
That is to say, he is too ugly

729
00:46:49.633 --> 00:46:52.329
Or the face is covered with pockmarks

730
00:46:52.354 --> 00:46:53.357
Isn't it?

731
00:46:57.574 --> 00:47:01.226
Lord Daoyue arrives

732
00:47:07.643 --> 00:47:08.972
Is he the Maharaja?

733
00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:11.847
As the name suggests, a marriage contract is just an agreement

734
00:47:12.292 --> 00:47:13.885
Not an unbreakable taboo

735
00:47:14.576 --> 00:47:16.743
So it's just breaking the agreement

736
00:47:16.768 --> 00:47:18.219
It can't be said to be anyone's fault.

737
00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:22.172
Sorry for interrupting the ladies' chat.

738
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.294
It's just that when I passed by, it sounded really harsh.

739
00:47:27.392 --> 00:47:29.779
Long time no see, Your Majesty

740
00:47:30.398 --> 00:47:31.244
do you know me

741
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:34.779
We met once before in Dafei Palace

742
00:47:35.098 --> 00:47:35.791
That's it

743
00:47:36.362 --> 00:47:37.757
I have no impression

744
00:47:39.055 --> 00:47:40.188
rude

745
00:47:41.412 --> 00:47:42.276
don't say that

746
00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:47.144
That Miss Shen Hailin

747
00:47:48.831 --> 00:47:49.441
what

748
00:47:49.522 --> 00:47:52.810
If you don't mind, could you spare a moment?

749
00:47:53.947 --> 00:47:56.035
are you talking about me

750
00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:07.594
Wasn't that the kind of scenario just now?

751
00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:10.997
The prince who appears at the moment when the heroine is in dire straits

752
00:48:11.724 --> 00:48:12.419
what

753
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:15.304
It turns out this is really what it feels like

754
00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:16.866
It seems that I am suitable to be a prince

755
00:48:17.573 --> 00:48:19.010
Should I come to your rescue more often?

756
00:48:21.927 --> 00:48:23.297
It seems you don't read folktales

757
00:48:24.117 --> 00:48:26.269
No I like it very much

758
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:28.429
"The Story of Shutong" and "The Story of Princess Pinggang"

759
00:48:28.454 --> 00:48:29.788
"The Biography of the Pheasant" and "The Biography of Shuxiang"

760
00:48:29.813 --> 00:48:31.335
"The Biography of Li Chunfeng" and "The Biography of Jin Shangshu"

761
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.579
"Jin Shangshu Biography"?

762
00:48:32.722 --> 00:48:34.525
That's a hard to find book

763
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.466
When Xueping separated from her fiancé, who had made a century-old promise

764
00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.197
I still cried like tears

765
00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.894
I am the reincarnation of the dead Xueping

766
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.782
When I return to my fiancé’s house again

767
00:48:43.998 --> 00:48:45.669
Can't help but cheer

768
00:48:45.694 --> 00:48:47.635
But the real essence of that book is

769
00:48:48.075 --> 00:48:50.791
Xueping, who disguised herself as a man, won a great victory in the war

770
00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:51.979
You really are a book lover

771
00:48:52.004 --> 00:48:53.301
It turns out you also love reading

772
00:48:58.528 --> 00:49:00.528
Are you really the Maharaja?

773
00:49:08.468 --> 00:49:11.110
This face says it all. It's amazing.

774
00:49:15.162 --> 00:49:18.610
Previously, the little girl didn’t know the Maharaja.

775
00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:20.066
I'm really sorry

776
00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:21.079
don't say that

777
00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:23.529
I just happened to pass by

778
00:49:23.759 --> 00:49:26.538
Seeing that you seemed to be in trouble, I came to help you.

779
00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:27.957
Is it too rash?

780
00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:29.610
No

781
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.179
you are at the right time

782
00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:35.082
Come at the right pace

783
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.485
Actually, I also have something to apologize to you for.

784
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.207
I unintentionally gave you a bad reputation

785
00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.376
Don't you ask what it is?

786
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:53.344
you will at the right time

787
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.060
Give me an appropriate explanation

788
00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.613
thank you for your understanding

789
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.354
I will tell you everything later

790
00:50:03.747 --> 00:50:04.847
let me go

791
00:50:05.708 --> 00:50:07.226
I tell you to let go

792
00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:14.987
Who is this?

793
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.901
Abominable

794
00:50:16.926 --> 00:50:18.997
Meet here again

795
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.947
Does Your Majesty also know Master Zai Yi?

796
00:50:24.632 --> 00:50:25.454
That…

797
00:50:27.504 --> 00:50:28.316
Maharaja?

798
00:50:32.916 --> 00:50:35.626
I finally understand why you show up here dressed like this

799
00:50:37.108 --> 00:50:38.310
That's a misunderstanding

800
00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:40.291
Experience from the Fourth Rank Yijin Mansion

801
00:50:40.316 --> 00:50:42.276
Facing a monarch who is not restricted by official rank

802
00:50:42.301 --> 00:50:44.157
But he still stood still. Is that disloyal to the court?

803
00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:45.916
shut up

804
00:50:45.941 --> 00:50:48.816
If I hadn't been wearing this face now, you would have died a long time ago

805
00:50:52.261 --> 00:50:53.950
what's going on

806
00:50:58.907 --> 00:51:01.269
The experience of Yijinfu Ren Zaiyi

807
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:03.185
Meet Your Majesty

808
00:51:08.663 --> 00:51:10.204
soon after

809
00:51:10.816 --> 00:51:12.385
We will definitely meet again

810
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:20.991
I want to go back and take care of my family first

811
00:51:21.016 --> 00:51:22.260
I'll take my leave now.

812
00:51:23.575 --> 00:51:24.476
You follow me

813
00:51:31.406 --> 00:51:32.332
Just wait and be patient

814
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:33.476
Don't make a big deal out of it

815
00:51:43.662 --> 00:51:46.057
Sir, who is the person who left with Hong Shi?

816
00:52:07.532 --> 00:52:09.966
Sure enough, it's still somewhat useful.

817
00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:22.507
Sir

818
00:52:23.616 --> 00:52:26.807
Calculating the time, Hong Shiying has arrived at Du Chengzhi's residence.

819
00:52:27.233 --> 00:52:28.388
if i come forward

820
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.107
things will get trickier

821
00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:32.897
It's right to stay away now

822
00:52:34.333 --> 00:52:35.282
Stay away?

823
00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:37.782
Although I can understand

824
00:52:37.807 --> 00:52:39.797
But I feel like Hong Shi will be sad.

825
00:52:41.267 --> 00:52:42.344
Probably

826
00:52:43.779 --> 00:52:45.410
I feel like a beating with a cane is inevitable.

827
00:52:46.026 --> 00:52:47.722
According to his fiery temper

828
00:52:48.028 --> 00:52:49.357
Lynching is also reasonable

829
00:52:49.889 --> 00:52:53.556
It seems... at least I will have to lose my arms and legs.

830
00:52:58.403 --> 00:53:00.754
It feels like adults' mood is different from before

831
00:53:01.298 --> 00:53:02.272
You were still the same person on your wedding day

832
00:53:02.767 --> 00:53:05.426
Are they chasing the sedan chair Hong Shi is riding in?

833
00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:10.169
Did I...do this?

834
00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:12.273
Did you forget so quickly?

835
00:53:18.767 --> 00:53:19.779
rainy day

836
00:53:20.298 --> 00:53:22.429
Are you worried that Hong Shi's sedan chair will fall over?

837
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.601
He also specially asked people to wait on every street where the sedan chair passed.

838
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:28.489
They are all covered with a lot of dry sand, straw bales, and gravel.

839
00:53:28.916 --> 00:53:30.492
Isn't it?

840
00:53:30.775 --> 00:53:33.386
What's the difference between this and chasing the sedan in person?

841
00:53:35.567 --> 00:53:38.332
Are you still afraid that she will be upset because she got her embroidered shoes wet?

842
00:53:38.357 --> 00:53:39.923
Obviously he pities her so much

843
00:53:41.433 --> 00:53:44.586
Why on earth did your master do this?

844
00:53:44.873 --> 00:53:47.023
Are you still worried about whether her sedan chair is shaking?

845
00:53:47.076 --> 00:53:50.292
Will it fall?

846
00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:53.986
I really can't stand it

847
00:53:55.843 --> 00:53:57.570
So what should I do?

848
00:54:09.504 --> 00:54:10.576
Are you going to find Hong Shi?

849
00:54:11.267 --> 00:54:12.073
jujube

850
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.817
Go to Sipu Temple and fetch a horse.

851
00:54:18.346 --> 00:54:20.017
From here, go in by yourself

852
00:54:21.335 --> 00:54:23.401
I was very curious on the way here

853
00:54:23.982 --> 00:54:26.423
Why is my grandson so angry?

854
00:54:27.221 --> 00:54:29.836
What? I really don’t want to talk about it again.

855
00:54:30.579 --> 00:54:31.564
But others saw it

856
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:33.470
I thought you were my husband in this body

857
00:54:33.495 --> 00:54:34.420
Did you forget so quickly?

858
00:54:34.886 --> 00:54:36.311
I am disciplining my family. In my opinion

859
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.417
This is like an excuse

860
00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:52.679
The way you look at me

861
00:54:53.145 --> 00:54:54.676
Shaking very violently

862
00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:00.923
what do you want

863
00:55:01.499 --> 00:55:03.670
I want you not to do anything

864
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.920
This is a warning

865
00:55:09.365 --> 00:55:10.289
Experience adults

866
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.320
I have ordered the prisoner to look for you

867
00:55:15.926 --> 00:55:16.726
you go

868
00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.817
It seems your father is looking for you in a hurry

869
00:55:31.845 --> 00:55:34.776
Look how anxious this guy's eyes are looking at this body

870
00:55:36.495 --> 00:55:38.795
It turns out that he has always had this intention in his heart

871
00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:41.216
Anyway

872
00:55:41.241 --> 00:55:43.598
He dares to touch a hair on this body and try it

873
00:55:45.833 --> 00:55:47.886
Enzu

874
00:55:49.276 --> 00:55:52.209
Your young master waited for you for a long time before leaving

875
00:55:53.489 --> 00:55:54.214
Really?

876
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:20.126
What's going on

877
00:56:20.151 --> 00:56:21.636
They seem to be Yijinfu soldiers

878
00:56:22.672 --> 00:56:24.548
What are you still doing? Give way

879
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:37.651
Goodbye again, Your Majesty

880
00:56:42.908 --> 00:56:45.242
Now that everyone is here, at least wait for one meal.

881
00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:46.739
I can't even sit still for this little time

882
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.842
So tired, so sleepy

883
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:00.111
Who is coming?

884
00:57:03.567 --> 00:57:04.986
Are you Ji Tong?

885
00:57:07.801 --> 00:57:11.801
Suspected murderer Ji Dong will be released today

886
00:57:11.826 --> 00:57:13.076
Arrest Your Majesty

887
00:57:42.367 --> 00:57:43.367
What's going on

888
00:57:58.367 --> 00:57:59.392
Changed back

889
00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:03.817
Finally changed back...

890
00:58:08.461 --> 00:58:11.133
So now Hong Enzu...

891
00:58:15.845 --> 00:58:16.891
who are you

892
00:58:17.716 --> 00:58:18.804
jujube sword

893
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.392
Sir

894
00:58:44.133 --> 00:58:48.979
(Want to hug you Loving you)

895
00:58:49.004 --> 00:58:54.120
(I don’t want to let go for a moment)

896
00:58:54.145 --> 00:58:58.645
(Looking as dreamy as ever)

897
00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:02.642
(Even if time passes, will you stay with me?)

898
00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:08.195
(Come to me now Loving you)

899
00:59:16.651 --> 00:59:19.175
The royal family actually sided with the thieves

900
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.867
This has never happened since ancient times

901
00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.812
I see your expression as if you want to rush and surrender.

902
00:59:24.837 --> 00:59:27.170
When we first met, I should have taken off my mask to confirm my appearance.

903
00:59:27.195 --> 00:59:28.450
This way we can avoid these incidents

904
00:59:28.475 --> 00:59:30.642
I can also protect you from the beginning.

905
00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.234
Why are your ideas so extreme?

906
00:59:32.267 --> 00:59:33.815
I'm just worried

907
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.540
Don't make me think about this damn home

908
00:59:35.567 --> 00:59:37.390
generate feelings

909
00:59:37.415 --> 00:59:39.853
Hong Eun-jo is a married woman

910
00:59:40.013 --> 00:59:42.113
It seems to me that you haven't figured out the situation yet

911
00:59:42.138 --> 00:59:44.534
That's why I have to put things right
