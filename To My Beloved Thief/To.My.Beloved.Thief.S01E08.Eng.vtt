﻿1
00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:11.145
i am a widow

2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.913
i know

3
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:13.469
You are the king of this country

4
00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:14.328
i don't care

5
00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.597
People will scold me and ridicule me for being unruly.

6
00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:18.744
Whatever they say

7
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.106
Let's go

8
00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:39.991
Don't hold that hand

9
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.369
you can't go

10
00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:49.153
until death

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.134
You can only stay at this home

12
00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:54.656
get out of the way

13
00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:58.397
Different from the noble Maharaja

14
00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:00.666
It's easy for me to be mean

15
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.481
She is the woman of this family

16
00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:05.262
I won't be able to leave this house until I die.

17
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.155
if i become mean

18
00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:10.922
Except for Hong Eun-jo, this family

19
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.500
I will kill them all to get her out of this house.

20
00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.056
jujube sword

21
00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:22.205
Let's have a try

22
00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:25.247
Forget about official rank and identity

23
00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:26.580
Put away the gift

24
00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:29.944
Are you a good fighter?

25
00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:31.203
You talk too much

26
00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:33.391
What are you doing? Come on.

27
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.987
If someone creates trouble, I will stay with you till the end.

28
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:44.393
I'm quite satisfied with this

29
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.500
Judge Xu, are you just going to stand by and watch?

30
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.684
Men grow up fighting

31
00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:50.869
if i win

32
00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.994
Hong Eun-jo will die at my house

33
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.322
if i win

34
00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:58.125
Hong Enzu will live forever in my house

35
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.516
So childish

36
00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:00.543
I said two

37
00:02:00.568 --> 00:02:03.002
It's up to me where I want to die.

38
00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:04.609
Agree?

39
00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:07.137
Agree

40
00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:10.633
If either of you dares to swing a sword...

41
00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.328
Swordsmanship is good

42
00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:24.544
Good strength

43
00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.187
what is this doing

44
00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.299
Lord Superintendent

45
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.712
How come you are here...

46
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.412
Eunjo, come with me

47
00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:46.500
Oh my god

48
00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:49.012
What to do

49
00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:50.980
what is this sound

50
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:52.684
Is dad back?

51
00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.643
Master, go and persuade him.

52
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.716
Dad…

53
00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:08.062
You…

54
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.987
I knew it would be like this

55
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.656
After all, you still treat Dad...

56
00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:14.822
Dad

57
00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:18.381
Please stop in moderation

58
00:03:18.777 --> 00:03:20.453
It's all my fault as a father who is incompetent

59
00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:22.316
Father?

60
00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:25.772
It's because you treat evil girls as your own children

61
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:28.050
That's why she would act so wantonly

62
00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:30.853
She is the one who once got married without telling us

63
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.947
Even now

64
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.809
I will discipline her well

65
00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:36.566
treat her as a slave

66
00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:39.859
Come out

67
00:03:41.633 --> 00:03:42.681
Come out

68
00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:10.821
Do you think I can't do it?

69
00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.049
get out of the way

70
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:27.527
Really useless

71
00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:29.597
I've had enough

72
00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:05.840
When did you start standing there?

73
00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:07.191
Been there from the beginning

74
00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:09.112
You go

75
00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:10.847
I don't want to look so close to you

76
00:05:11.494 --> 00:05:12.072
Agree

77
00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.166
Won't you leave?

78
00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:15.966
This is my home

79
00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:20.066
Please think about who is more reasonable to stand next to the wall

80
00:05:20.648 --> 00:05:25.178
You should also think about who is more handsome standing next to the wall

81
00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:29.165
The duel is not over yet

82
00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.721
This victory or defeat does not depend on the sword, it is left to the judges to decide.

83
00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:33.265
You chose the wrong opponent

84
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.634
Really? My strength has never failed.

85
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:37.640
I never give up

86
00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:41.000
Sorry to interrupt the fight between you two.

87
00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:44.168
You have to stand here until one of them leaves.

88
00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:47.646
Could this be some kind of self-esteem contest?

89
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.403
Of course not

90
00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:49.509
Absolutely not

91
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.712
The two of you have been standing here for more than half an hour. Your feet must be numb.

92
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.603
My back must be hurting too, right?

93
00:05:58.981 --> 00:06:00.525
Okay, so be it

94
00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:03.880
I counted to three and we both left at the same time.

95
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.946
Okay one

96
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.675
Two

97
00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:09.803
three

98
00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:11.128
three point five

99
00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:12.915
Four

100
00:06:16.622 --> 00:06:18.931
They actually refused to give in to each other and didn't leave until four.

101
00:06:19.622 --> 00:06:21.371
Childish showdown ends in a draw

102
00:06:22.093 --> 00:06:23.159
Oops, my hands are so sore

103
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:28.208
After learning the truth on the wedding day, I was the one who still asked her to get married.

104
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.056
Please blame me

105
00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.087
where is eunjo

106
00:06:37.247 --> 00:06:38.625
I let her go out

107
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.795
I asked her to go outside to calm down her restless heart.

108
00:07:18.147 --> 00:07:23.913
(empty streets the lights are low)

109
00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:29.464
(shadows play a quiet show)

110
00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:30.556
Come and see

111
00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:33.558
Let's take a look at the accessories before leaving.

112
00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:34.226
Miss

113
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:36.314
This way please

114
00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:40.151
Oops, how about this?

115
00:07:40.277 --> 00:07:41.533
Come and see

116
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.818
Oh my God, my face has brightened up.

117
00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:47.408
Simply made for you

118
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.001
So beautiful

119
00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.739
My complexion has improved.

120
00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:57.658
Oh, it’s like a fairy descended to earth

121
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.530
(I've seen the scene)

122
00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:12.222
(played it back in every dream)

123
00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:14.536
Want to play?

124
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:16.889
Swing very, very high

125
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.026
Leave all your worries and sorrows in heaven and come back again

126
00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:22.672
I don't want to play

127
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.794
(seen the scene)

128
00:08:43.484 --> 00:08:49.476
(echoes in the hallway light)

129
00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:56.064
(memories that won't feel right)

130
00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:04.955
(I stay quiet you fade slow)

131
00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:12.214
(same old scene I used to know)

132
00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:21.358
Hong Shi seems to be fine

133
00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:23.207
Not so

134
00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:25.451
Because it's all buried

135
00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:29.764
Buried in the words "It doesn't matter"

136
00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:31.967
She just buries it

137
00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.988
All buried under the expression "It doesn't matter"

138
00:09:36.013 --> 00:09:39.247
(I've seen the scene)

139
00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.847
(everything is gone)

140
00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:49.680
(and still it speaks)

141
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.213
(seen the scene)

142
00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:55.064
(seen the scene)

143
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.611
Go look elsewhere

144
00:09:56.747 --> 00:09:58.780
(seen the scene)

145
00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:03.508
(seen the scene)

146
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.351
why do you follow me

147
00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:22.308
I want to say…

148
00:10:23.214 --> 00:10:26.605
If you fall into a ditch, I'll pull you up

149
00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:29.420
If you drink I'll pour you a drink

150
00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:32.486
If you cry I will pat you

151
00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.701
when did you discover

152
00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:49.370
How can you hide if you are so tall?

153
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.151
I bent over hard

154
00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.270
Still discovered?

155
00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:59.836
I wrote to Supervisor Hong Minzhi because...

156
00:11:03.493 --> 00:11:04.424
for what reason

157
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.071
I am just a king of a country

158
00:11:08.507 --> 00:11:10.527
Correct a wrong marriage

159
00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:13.196
Just to correct the unethical customs

160
00:11:15.155 --> 00:11:17.902
You are so righteous and awe-inspiring, but you are sending a letter in my name?

161
00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:20.364
Is there any

162
00:11:20.693 --> 00:11:23.455
When I write this letter, my soul is in your body

163
00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:26.302
I probably wrote your name accidentally.

164
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:30.052
I wrote my name with my hands

165
00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:32.786
i know

166
00:11:33.555 --> 00:11:34.861
I made my own decision again

167
00:11:35.584 --> 00:11:37.683
Punch me. I'm very durable.

168
00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:39.280
But be a little lighter

169
00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:42.724
Forget it

170
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.305
i can understand

171
00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:49.661
You were so close to living as a widow forever in this body.

172
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.527
Of course I have to find a way to leave that home.

173
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:58.705
Anyway, I should face this matter sooner or later

174
00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:00.874
But how lucky

175
00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:02.689
Fortunately, my body recovered in time

176
00:12:05.032 --> 00:12:06.214
Are you really okay?

177
00:12:13.426 --> 00:12:14.296
That's good

178
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.461
This is my marriage proposal

179
00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:26.768
And…

180
00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:27.880
Since you said it's okay

181
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.793
That's enough for today

182
00:12:39.414 --> 00:12:42.164
I'm short on money. Sorry I can't help.

183
00:12:43.402 --> 00:12:46.174
I am the one who made the unkind request and apologized.

184
00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:55.187
Wait a minute, my lord

185
00:12:58.225 --> 00:13:00.399
Isn't this my cousin?

186
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.936
I originally planned to visit your home after finishing my business in Seoul.

187
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:08.577
I didn't expect to meet you here

188
00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:20.711
If you delay any longer, it will be too late.

189
00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:25.752
thank you

190
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.099
This is to repay the favor of saving lives on the battlefield.

191
00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:35.577
You are Eunjo, right?

192
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:37.408
Yes

193
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.055
No need to send far

194
00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:44.018
Tell the benefactor thank you for his hospitality

195
00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:44.914
OK

196
00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:52.793
Enzu

197
00:13:54.392 --> 00:13:55.761
It's all over now

198
00:13:57.863 --> 00:13:59.277
what does this mean

199
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.433
I have followed my instructions and said it was the money earned from selling the land.

200
00:14:07.887 --> 00:14:09.158
This matter must be kept confidential

201
00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:12.274
Can you please tell me the reason?

202
00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:16.493
I hope that person feels better

203
00:14:17.665 --> 00:14:18.355
what

204
00:14:20.123 --> 00:14:21.049
I heard that the year of Gengwu

205
00:14:21.713 --> 00:14:25.511
All the property of Eunuch Hong Minzhi was confiscated by the royal family

206
00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.552
Just think of it as returning it now.

207
00:14:43.113 --> 00:14:44.108
Lord Superintendent

208
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.958
where have you been

209
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.464
sorry

210
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.621
Could it be...

211
00:14:58.296 --> 00:15:00.730
You took the land given by Luozhou elders during the day

212
00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:03.811
Have you given them all to Mr. Du Chengzhi?

213
00:15:08.622 --> 00:15:09.774
Please take it back

214
00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:11.496
That marriage was my choice...

215
00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:12.983
it's not your choice

216
00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:14.913
It's not your responsibility

217
00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:19.786
Not your marriage

218
00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:22.524
it's my fault

219
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:28.427
That piece of land is enough to provide you with food and clothing for the rest of your life...

220
00:15:28.452 --> 00:15:29.161
enough

221
00:15:29.647 --> 00:15:31.280
Stop humiliating yourself

222
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.018
I never looked at you that way

223
00:15:35.213 --> 00:15:38.833
If you really think about me

224
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.277
Just value yourself first

225
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.186
Forget everything that happened in that home

226
00:15:56.147 --> 00:15:57.380
forgive me

227
00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:00.161
Forgive your stupid father

228
00:16:12.129 --> 00:16:13.363
Since you told me to forget

229
00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:16.098
I have forgotten everything

230
00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.445
Are you hungry?

231
00:16:22.993 --> 00:16:25.226
I'm going to help my mother prepare dinner

232
00:17:16.093 --> 00:17:17.438
Daoyue Dajun

233
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.873
Are you the one who summoned Superintendent Hong Minzhi?

234
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.295
He was once the military judge of this country

235
00:17:28.874 --> 00:17:32.435
It is said that countless battles have been won in the north.

236
00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:35.829
As a gentleman living in the land he protects

237
00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:37.373
Pray that he is okay

238
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:39.941
Pray for his family’s safety

239
00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:41.841
It's a matter of course

240
00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.723
Isn’t it because of Hong Shi?

241
00:17:44.988 --> 00:17:47.085
I'm just praying that the daughter of the military judge is safe

242
00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:48.441
It happens to be Hong Eun-jo

243
00:17:49.448 --> 00:17:51.470
I mean, it’s for Dr. Hong.

244
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.801
what to do how to

245
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.288
Hong Minzhi Supervisor

246
00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:57.876
He was the one who was ruthlessly abandoned by His Highness in the year of Gengwu.

247
00:17:58.066 --> 00:18:01.148
When it comes to the relationship between families, it is no different from a feud

248
00:18:18.144 --> 00:18:19.391
thank you

249
00:18:22.637 --> 00:18:23.907
Came back just in time

250
00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:25.251
Go to work

251
00:18:25.463 --> 00:18:26.088
Yes

252
00:18:29.703 --> 00:18:31.935
That damn marriage fell through

253
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.691
I feel relieved both physically and mentally

254
00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:36.916
From now on, I can have a glass of wine at ease when I’m on duty.

255
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:39.508
What is there to be happy about?

256
00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:41.166
I happen to want to have a drink with you, madam.

257
00:18:41.255 --> 00:18:42.532
What ma'am?

258
00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:44.063
What's wrong, you kid?

259
00:18:44.338 --> 00:18:45.554
madam boy

260
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:46.979
madam boy

261
00:18:47.013 --> 00:18:48.213
Madam

262
00:18:48.213 --> 00:18:49.213
Man... son...

263
00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:50.307
It's so noisy

264
00:18:52.347 --> 00:18:54.713
Eunjo, that's great

265
00:18:57.335 --> 00:19:00.132
Have you two seen a doctor?

266
00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:01.948
Oh…

267
00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:07.249
I have a dull pain in my stomach. I'm afraid it's because of the epidemic.

268
00:19:07.274 --> 00:19:08.960
That's because I have stomachache due to constipation.

269
00:19:09.313 --> 00:19:13.524
I was so dizzy that I thought I had an epidemic.

270
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:14.577
That's a hangover

271
00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:16.962
You saw it last time, right?

272
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:19.359
Half of the recent patients are like this

273
00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:22.180
Unfounded rumors are really rampant in the capital.

274
00:19:23.377 --> 00:19:26.331
Speaking of which, it’s really serious outside the city.

275
00:19:26.847 --> 00:19:28.006
There was an epidemic

276
00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:37.668
If the epidemic spreads to the capital, people's morale will be in chaos

277
00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:41.062
Don’t epidemics happen every year?

278
00:19:41.364 --> 00:19:44.046
Just let it go and it will disappear naturally

279
00:19:45.174 --> 00:19:48.808
Compared with that, every time His Highness goes to Wenyang Palace for hunting,

280
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.690
The court remains vacant for longer and longer periods of time

281
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:55.587
I'm thinking it's better to open a hunting ground near the capital.

282
00:19:57.137 --> 00:20:00.122
The area around the capital city is full of people’s residences and cultivated land.

283
00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:01.352
Absolutely not

284
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.671
Please make an appointment before coming over

285
00:20:06.778 --> 00:20:09.037
Your Majesty has left the palace

286
00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:13.971
Please tell your majesty that I am seeking to see you about my little daughter.

287
00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:21.718
I've been coughing all day

288
00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:24.537
You should go to the inner hospital

289
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:28.590
My exclusive doctor went to the palace with me

290
00:20:29.452 --> 00:20:32.168
I've had asthma for a long time, I've had it since I was a child

291
00:20:34.682 --> 00:20:36.915
I've used that body, so I know it clearly

292
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.559
That's a healthy physique with nothing wrong with it

293
00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.100
It started a few days ago

294
00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:50.909
You were injured in the last fight, right?

295
00:20:50.934 --> 00:20:51.734
Let me see

296
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.747
No injuries

297
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:54.069
Just a little itchy

298
00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:55.546
I'm more worried about that guy

299
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:56.622
I'm so hurt

300
00:20:56.647 --> 00:20:59.609
He probably took a walk on Huangquan Road.

301
00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:01.865
So why fight?

302
00:21:02.188 --> 00:21:03.906
Encountering someone who is deliberately looking for trouble

303
00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:05.340
Ignoring him is the right thing to do

304
00:21:06.981 --> 00:21:09.587
That person is so twisted that it makes people feel pitiful

305
00:21:10.148 --> 00:21:12.115
So you think the Ren family didn't let you go on purpose?

306
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.731
Otherwise?

307
00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:17.012
The more you know, the more twisted things will become

308
00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:18.819
Do you want to go to dinner?

309
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.256
So suddenly?

310
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.847
Didn't you work all day?

311
00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:24.478
There are no patients here

312
00:21:24.503 --> 00:21:25.725
You don't have a family either

313
00:21:27.165 --> 00:21:28.434
No more husband

314
00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:30.269
Your stomach is empty, right?

315
00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:32.665
It turns out that he came here because he knew I had broken off the engagement.

316
00:21:36.412 --> 00:21:37.459
Could it be...

317
00:21:37.803 --> 00:21:38.812
Your Majesty?

318
00:21:41.423 --> 00:21:42.627
I thought I saw it wrong

319
00:21:43.784 --> 00:21:45.428
I can actually see you here

320
00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:48.703
Have you used my body to meet other women?

321
00:21:50.013 --> 00:21:51.225
Not me

322
00:21:52.902 --> 00:21:54.736
You really don’t remember

323
00:21:54.827 --> 00:21:57.737
I am the daughter of Han Seung-rok, the leader of the Council. My name is Ji-yeon.

324
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:01.781
Ah, I saw you in the palace last time

325
00:22:02.365 --> 00:22:03.522
yes

326
00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:06.022
I also heard that the Maharaja

327
00:22:06.047 --> 00:22:08.472
Rejected all the ladies in the capital

328
00:22:12.255 --> 00:22:13.397
How come you are here?

329
00:22:13.913 --> 00:22:15.744
I heard there is an epidemic

330
00:22:15.863 --> 00:22:19.106
My father asked me to send some medicinal materials to the Huimin Department

331
00:22:20.912 --> 00:22:21.962
As expected of the Prime Minister

332
00:22:23.237 --> 00:22:24.325
Say hello to him for me

333
00:22:25.368 --> 00:22:26.515
I will

334
00:22:35.013 --> 00:22:36.475
Why is it so heavy?

335
00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:38.156
give it to me

336
00:22:42.923 --> 00:22:44.256
Along the way

337
00:22:45.056 --> 00:22:47.890
How about we catch the old hen we made last time?

338
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.044
what

339
00:22:50.315 --> 00:22:53.050
Are you going to see my mother?

340
00:22:53.213 --> 00:22:54.022
Yes

341
00:22:54.577 --> 00:22:56.643
Anyway, I called her "Mother" for a while.

342
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.271
Then she can be considered my mother, right?

343
00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:01.032
Reply to the marriage request letter…

344
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.202
This shouldn't be said here

345
00:23:02.546 --> 00:23:03.296
Talk about it later

346
00:23:04.221 --> 00:23:05.615
Let's go eat first

347
00:23:06.021 --> 00:23:06.796
No

348
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.146
you listen to me

349
00:23:10.252 --> 00:23:13.249
Find someone suitable to be the king of this country.

350
00:23:13.412 --> 00:23:15.102
Why would you look for someone else if you didn't look for someone with intact limbs?

351
00:23:16.022 --> 00:23:17.071
Who are you looking for?

352
00:23:18.046 --> 00:23:19.987
Don't pretend you don't understand

353
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.118
Someone like the lady who led the administration

354
00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:25.099
are you jealous

355
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:26.699
Not really

356
00:23:26.903 --> 00:23:29.777
Because of my mother-in-law, I had no choice but to meet her once.

357
00:23:29.802 --> 00:23:30.856
Just once

358
00:23:31.784 --> 00:23:33.771
I didn't ask you

359
00:23:33.915 --> 00:23:35.415
At least pretend to be curious.

360
00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:39.649
I'm saying these things for your own good

361
00:23:39.817 --> 00:23:41.402
If it's really for my own good

362
00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:43.571
Just go catch the old hen

363
00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:47.418
If you want to catch an old hen, go and ask the chef from the Royal Kitchen to catch him.

364
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.924
Wait, where are you going?

365
00:23:49.949 --> 00:23:51.396
This thing hasn't been taken away yet

366
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.015
If you keep arguing like this again

367
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.490
Let alone a family feud.

368
00:23:56.515 --> 00:23:58.159
They should probably become enemies directly.

369
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:01.743
Love affairs between men and women often end up becoming enemies.

370
00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.452
That would be more natural

371
00:24:04.265 --> 00:24:05.971
Are you inciting me to do this?

372
00:24:08.284 --> 00:24:09.334
Jealousy?

373
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.621
It's nonsense

374
00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:15.084
If you want to talk about old hen again, just go away.

375
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.246
I'm really...oh my god

376
00:24:19.047 --> 00:24:20.277
Doctor Hong, it’s me

377
00:24:20.343 --> 00:24:22.480
Uncle scared me

378
00:24:22.512 --> 00:24:25.468
If you want to enter the city, you must wear this cloak.

379
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.174
If recognized by others

380
00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:28.746
On the contrary, it will cause unnecessary commotion...

381
00:24:32.207 --> 00:24:33.020
who are you

382
00:24:35.062 --> 00:24:36.736
It's someone I know

383
00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:39.265
Why should a man disguise himself as a woman and follow her?

384
00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:45.418
Something happened at the medical clinic. I want to ask Dr. Hong for help.

385
00:24:48.308 --> 00:24:49.262
Medical clinic?

386
00:24:52.306 --> 00:24:54.702
You said that the epidemic started in the treatment center?

387
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.921
Disease?

388
00:24:55.946 --> 00:24:59.509
Yesterday, the doctor from the Human Resources Department took a few casual glances and said this

389
00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:02.959
Several people have already developed symptoms of vomiting and high fever.

390
00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:04.568
What's the exact name of the disease?

391
00:25:04.897 --> 00:25:05.793
Don't know

392
00:25:06.462 --> 00:25:08.593
Does it mean it wasn't properly diagnosed?

393
00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:10.881
This is to respond to the epidemic and help the people.

394
00:25:10.906 --> 00:25:11.877
Only then did we set up the Department of Living Persons

395
00:25:13.755 --> 00:25:15.759
Doctors also reject medical clinics

396
00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:17.888
For sick family members like me

397
00:25:17.913 --> 00:25:20.490
The same goes for people who have to live together

398
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:24.387
No one is willing to take care of us except Doctor Hong.

399
00:25:26.245 --> 00:25:27.259
Let's go quickly

400
00:25:32.123 --> 00:25:34.134
Uncle, wait for me

401
00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:40.493
What's wrong

402
00:25:42.428 --> 00:25:45.337
Here is a cure for all the risks of infection

403
00:25:45.487 --> 00:25:47.822
And I am a medical woman who specializes in medicine

404
00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:50.640
It's also my responsibility to restrict access here.

405
00:25:51.534 --> 00:25:52.434
Please listen to her

406
00:25:57.834 --> 00:25:58.737
I'm leaving

407
00:26:06.611 --> 00:26:07.321
jujube

408
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:09.777
Go and check if you have been to a medical clinic.

409
00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.462
Who is the doctor at the Department of Living Human Beings?

410
00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:11.971
Yes

411
00:26:16.987 --> 00:26:19.021
I take people who seem to have the same symptoms

412
00:26:19.046 --> 00:26:20.096
They were all placed separately

413
00:26:21.157 --> 00:26:22.643
Let me take a look

414
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.349
delicious

415
00:26:34.163 --> 00:26:34.968
Oops

416
00:26:35.567 --> 00:26:38.062
Very dirty, spit it out quickly

417
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:42.177
This is our meal

418
00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:45.031
Brother, are you hungry too?

419
00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:46.493
Do you want to share it with you?

420
00:26:55.912 --> 00:26:56.806
This…

421
00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:26.844
The young master who came with you

422
00:27:26.869 --> 00:27:28.262
On the hillside over there

423
00:27:29.813 --> 00:27:31.509
thank you

424
00:27:47.855 --> 00:27:48.789
right

425
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.377
On the right?

426
00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:52.424
come on

427
00:27:52.562 --> 00:27:55.368
There are many here Yes

428
00:28:31.452 --> 00:28:33.174
Jinshi, come down quickly

429
00:28:37.969 --> 00:28:38.903
how is the situation

430
00:28:38.947 --> 00:28:40.184
Let's talk as we go

431
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:41.665
I will be back soon

432
00:28:42.947 --> 00:28:44.890
Brother will come again, right?

433
00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:45.834
Good

434
00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:47.743
Brother?

435
00:28:50.775 --> 00:28:53.231
Has the water taken from the valley gone bad after being left for too long?

436
00:28:53.556 --> 00:28:54.849
The people at the medical center didn’t know

437
00:28:54.874 --> 00:28:57.343
After drinking it, a group of people contracted dysentery.

438
00:28:57.562 --> 00:28:58.988
Notify the Huimin Administration to get the medicinal materials

439
00:28:59.013 --> 00:29:00.527
I'm afraid it will take some time

440
00:29:04.107 --> 00:29:05.268
Lord Superintendent

441
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.147
It seems that you came to the Huimin Office for something urgent.

442
00:29:10.147 --> 00:29:11.996
Eunjo, go get busy.

443
00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:16.487
I want to talk to this young master

444
00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:21.774
I won't get into trouble

445
00:29:22.464 --> 00:29:23.843
Patients at the clinic are waiting

446
00:29:26.193 --> 00:29:27.446
Then I'll leave first

447
00:29:39.955 --> 00:29:43.820
I wanted to grab the rope your brother gave me and enter the court.

448
00:29:44.013 --> 00:29:46.148
As a result, it was completely ruined by my father.

449
00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:48.342
I just ruined the wedding

450
00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:50.432
Then I watched her run to the Huimin Office

451
00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:52.820
Did she go to the Huimin Administration Bureau?

452
00:29:52.845 --> 00:29:55.985
Oh, she must be a doctor again and mind her own business.

453
00:29:56.268 --> 00:29:57.901
Instead of worrying about others

454
00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.542
Why isn't she worried about me?

455
00:30:00.091 --> 00:30:01.285
Bad girl

456
00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:04.310
Isn't it pretty good?

457
00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:06.523
what

458
00:30:07.848 --> 00:30:09.364
Know how to worry about others

459
00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:24.291
you are back

460
00:30:26.984 --> 00:30:28.142
help me prepare tea

461
00:30:28.947 --> 00:30:29.804
Yes

462
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.345
I'll send it over quickly

463
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.685
Yes

464
00:30:38.382 --> 00:30:39.382
I previously…

465
00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:43.682
I failed to recognize you as the adult Maharaja.

466
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.457
please forgive me for being rude

467
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.880
No need to be so formal

468
00:31:01.722 --> 00:31:04.998
Please don’t come to Eunjo again.

469
00:31:07.622 --> 00:31:08.955
If it is because of Your Highness...

470
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.107
please don't try to convince me

471
00:31:11.373 --> 00:31:13.073
I apologize to you for what happened between you and His Highness.

472
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.232
I am sincere every moment...

473
00:31:14.263 --> 00:31:16.014
I don’t want that sincerity

474
00:31:16.627 --> 00:31:19.426
Your people will be His Highness's hostages

475
00:31:19.913 --> 00:31:24.432
If you are sincere, Your Highness will make the best use of it.

476
00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.298
I will not send Eunjo to a palace where only one person can die

477
00:31:30.323 --> 00:31:31.913
If it is through marriage

478
00:31:33.179 --> 00:31:34.282
It goes without saying

479
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.320
If it is for this reason

480
00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:39.955
Even if I have to leave the palace, I will protect...

481
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.917
No

482
00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:42.754
Please don't do anything

483
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:46.759
As long as you protect Eunjo, that's enough

484
00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:54.047
If I insist on getting married

485
00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:58.804
If I ignore everything and still insist on getting married

486
00:31:58.829 --> 00:32:03.189
If you insist, I will threaten Eunjo

487
00:32:04.002 --> 00:32:05.607
My father will kill himself

488
00:32:06.314 --> 00:32:08.739
If you persist regardless of everything

489
00:32:09.047 --> 00:32:13.620
I would kill myself to stop you.

490
00:32:17.585 --> 00:32:21.945
I don’t want me to hurt Eunjo too

491
00:32:23.769 --> 00:32:25.473
Please help me

492
00:32:46.081 --> 00:32:47.510
You are still there

493
00:32:53.813 --> 00:32:54.813
Where is the medical clinic?

494
00:32:55.813 --> 00:32:57.680
All the more urgent treatments are over

495
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.170
Because the Huimin Administration Department sent enough medicinal materials.

496
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.685
Fortunately

497
00:33:02.551 --> 00:33:03.951
Sir Ti Tiao said

498
00:33:04.114 --> 00:33:07.754
I used the medicinal materials given by Lord Daoyue to save my shirt.

499
00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:09.922
Thousands of instructions and instructions

500
00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:11.373
You must be grateful to the royal family

501
00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:13.433
thank you

502
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.517
That…

503
00:33:22.813 --> 00:33:25.880
What did you and the Superintendent talk about?

504
00:33:29.713 --> 00:33:30.482
Greetings

505
00:33:30.807 --> 00:33:32.559
He said he had seen me as a child in the palace before

506
00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:33.823
Although I have no impression

507
00:33:34.913 --> 00:33:37.167
So does he also know that you are the Maharaja?

508
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.980
he knows very well

509
00:33:42.956 --> 00:33:44.085
So that's it

510
00:33:45.938 --> 00:33:46.770
Right

511
00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:49.721
Jinshi calls you brother and is looking for you

512
00:33:49.747 --> 00:33:51.180
What exactly did you say to him?

513
00:33:53.383 --> 00:33:55.157
Maybe I exude too much charm

514
00:33:57.213 --> 00:33:59.542
It seems like you are spreading your charm everywhere.

515
00:33:59.815 --> 00:34:01.535
Yes, so that you can receive it

516
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.951
The person who discharged it should come back and take it back personally.

517
00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:08.913
Can you take it back? It’s too much after all.

518
00:34:11.947 --> 00:34:14.907
Where does your confidence come from?

519
00:34:14.932 --> 00:34:17.013
What I learned from royal education courses

520
00:34:18.696 --> 00:34:20.101
It turns out you learned your bluff.

521
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:23.379
what are you laughing at

522
00:34:25.264 --> 00:34:26.980
why you keep laughing

523
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.792
No reason

524
00:34:28.223 --> 00:34:29.782
I just want to continue laughing with you

525
00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:33.986
I want to laugh as much as I can today

526
00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:58.364
Master, you are here today too

527
00:35:02.714 --> 00:35:03.429
What's wrong

528
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:08.047
The eldest young master wants me to burn everything in this room

529
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.426
Don't burn

530
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.051
After all, there is still some warmth left

531
00:35:18.355 --> 00:35:19.163
Yes

532
00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:52.232
Oops

533
00:35:52.547 --> 00:35:53.507
marriage invitation letter

534
00:36:00.913 --> 00:36:02.592
Where did I fall?

535
00:36:03.207 --> 00:36:04.439
What a careless

536
00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:10.301
what did you lose

537
00:36:11.913 --> 00:36:12.980
nothing

538
00:36:14.737 --> 00:36:19.710
I heard that you and the Maharaja met at the Huimin Office

539
00:36:21.401 --> 00:36:23.604
That adult has a warm personality

540
00:36:23.647 --> 00:36:25.476
I have been helped by him many times

541
00:36:25.775 --> 00:36:29.271
That's what a royal family should do

542
00:36:31.813 --> 00:36:32.515
Yes

543
00:36:34.147 --> 00:36:36.706
you should still remember

544
00:36:36.822 --> 00:36:38.188
I want to stay in this home forever

545
00:36:38.213 --> 00:36:40.778
Serving Mother and the Superintendent

546
00:36:41.555 --> 00:36:43.581
I never intended to live my life as a woman

547
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.006
Do you still think so now?

548
00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:53.740
Yes

549
00:36:56.813 --> 00:36:57.878
be sure to do that

550
00:37:16.842 --> 00:37:18.642
Miss, I'm going in

551
00:37:21.334 --> 00:37:22.900
A letter from the palace?

552
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.240
Was it written by the Empress of the Middle Temple?

553
00:37:31.913 --> 00:37:32.590
What's wrong

554
00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:36.158
The concubine said she wanted to see me

555
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:41.631
Where is the Maharaja?

556
00:37:41.862 --> 00:37:44.230
Someone has been sent to his dormitory. He will be there soon...

557
00:37:45.747 --> 00:37:46.959
The adults have arrived

558
00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:57.253
what do you want to say

559
00:38:01.325 --> 00:38:03.053
Look at your neat and tidy posture

560
00:38:03.523 --> 00:38:04.972
That's right

561
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.047
Who is coming?

562
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.281
I'm not in the mood to see anyone today

563
00:38:13.659 --> 00:38:15.234
not human

564
00:38:15.947 --> 00:38:19.159
He's the only one left in a pair of flighty dogs

565
00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.337
Hailin of the Shen family has arrived

566
00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:24.537
Remember it later

567
00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:27.447
This name is the woman you broke up with after a one-night fling.

568
00:38:31.453 --> 00:38:34.247
The younger one is Shen Jia Hailin, the eldest concubine.

569
00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:37.943
I shouldn’t need to introduce my son, right?

570
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.584
Yes

571
00:38:41.202 --> 00:38:42.122
sit down

572
00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:51.853
I apologize to you first

573
00:38:53.188 --> 00:38:55.515
Queen Mother, there is some misunderstanding here

574
00:38:55.662 --> 00:38:57.459
I heard she's Nave's niece

575
00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:01.068
Are you a lady from the in-laws?

576
00:39:04.062 --> 00:39:05.681
Don't you know?

577
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.959
you two

578
00:39:11.813 --> 00:39:13.718
I heard that your engagement was broken off not long ago

579
00:39:14.684 --> 00:39:17.751
Is the Maharaja the reason for breaking off the engagement?

580
00:39:20.735 --> 00:39:21.353
what

581
00:39:21.378 --> 00:39:22.478
you don't have to answer

582
00:39:24.165 --> 00:39:25.718
The question raised by the empress is very rude.

583
00:39:25.978 --> 00:39:28.200
She had just been divorced and it was too late to comfort her.

584
00:39:28.247 --> 00:39:29.487
what are you doing

585
00:39:29.944 --> 00:39:32.434
What happened before was just me bragging

586
00:39:34.678 --> 00:39:36.628
It was me who caused you to do something disgraceful

587
00:39:36.847 --> 00:39:38.450
I'll explain it to you separately. Please get up.

588
00:39:42.487 --> 00:39:43.259
Yes

589
00:39:44.353 --> 00:39:45.278
sit down

590
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.780
Yes

591
00:39:48.047 --> 00:39:49.259
I'll keep it short.

592
00:39:49.675 --> 00:39:51.809
Now that you two have enjoyed it together,

593
00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:53.780
Just don't blame who is responsible

594
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.906
Have a wedding

595
00:39:55.902 --> 00:39:58.397
Since this is a marriage between in-laws, it is a great joy for the royal family.

596
00:40:04.118 --> 00:40:06.037
I'm worried that my mother-in-law is holding on to useless hopes

597
00:40:06.393 --> 00:40:08.747
Making things difficult for the innocent in-laws

598
00:40:10.275 --> 00:40:12.393
I just deliberately said this here

599
00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:16.556
I already belong

600
00:40:22.647 --> 00:40:24.747
Just forget her

601
00:40:25.263 --> 00:40:26.593
I will never forget it in my life

602
00:40:28.813 --> 00:40:30.147
this is my answer

603
00:40:44.778 --> 00:40:47.131
Go find out when Hong Shi will take sick leave.

604
00:40:47.647 --> 00:40:49.759
As soon as she recovers, ask her to come see me immediately

605
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.453
Yes

606
00:40:58.337 --> 00:41:01.721
You said before that you gave me a stigma

607
00:41:03.578 --> 00:41:04.765
Is that this?

608
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.515
maybe

609
00:41:09.622 --> 00:41:10.547
previous stigma

610
00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:12.265
and today's events

611
00:41:13.343 --> 00:41:14.197
I'm all sorry

612
00:41:19.047 --> 00:41:21.280
It turns out that it’s the look in the eyes of another woman that already exists in my heart.

613
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.850
Who could it be?

614
00:41:24.787 --> 00:41:28.362
Who is the woman who shines in his eyes?

615
00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:42.043
It's getting better gradually

616
00:41:43.116 --> 00:41:44.159
thank you

617
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.787
It's really hard work

618
00:41:47.715 --> 00:41:48.553
sister

619
00:41:51.947 --> 00:41:53.613
What exactly is there

620
00:41:55.047 --> 00:41:56.780
Look there

621
00:41:58.726 --> 00:41:59.768
What exactly is there

622
00:42:00.574 --> 00:42:01.278
what is that

623
00:42:04.844 --> 00:42:05.802
It's rice

624
00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:10.840
Our chestnut trees are really producing rice

625
00:42:14.524 --> 00:42:16.406
These will last at least a year

626
00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:18.478
Who gave us such a precious thing

627
00:42:23.847 --> 00:42:25.147
Could it be the Maharaja?

628
00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:28.003
Can I really accept it directly?

629
00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:31.478
Of course you have to eat well and cheer up quickly

630
00:42:31.503 --> 00:42:33.656
The person who sent the rice should also hope so.

631
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:35.412
It’s Ji Tong…

632
00:42:35.437 --> 00:42:37.359
What? Ji Tong?

633
00:42:37.642 --> 00:42:39.281
It seems that he is really a lucky boy

634
00:42:39.325 --> 00:42:42.009
Is it Lord Yoshito who takes care of us?

635
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:44.503
It is said that he is a thief who steals thousands of stones in one day.

636
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.600
It seems to be true. It can't be wrong.

637
00:42:47.647 --> 00:42:51.550
Oops, everyone got it wrong

638
00:42:51.575 --> 00:42:54.775
Ji Tong is a thief who knows how to steal food.

639
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.247
And…

640
00:42:57.297 --> 00:42:58.697
I heard Ji Dong is dead

641
00:42:59.162 --> 00:43:02.913
Everyone... are you listening to me?

642
00:43:05.713 --> 00:43:09.313
Sister, has the dead Jidong been resurrected?

643
00:43:11.611 --> 00:43:13.153
I am a medical woman, so I know very well

644
00:43:13.178 --> 00:43:15.113
If you're dead, you're dead. There's no way you can come here.

645
00:43:15.113 --> 00:43:18.056
No, Ji Dong will never die.

646
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.581
Now even immortal

647
00:43:22.478 --> 00:43:23.637
What should I do?

648
00:43:24.284 --> 00:43:25.988
The rumors have become like this again

649
00:43:26.013 --> 00:43:30.780
I thought everyone in the world wanted us dead

650
00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:33.287
It turns out that there are people who encourage us to live like this

651
00:43:34.393 --> 00:43:35.525
Just like you, Dr. Hong

652
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.590
what

653
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.784
I didn't do anything

654
00:43:52.412 --> 00:43:53.397
Medical clinic?

655
00:43:54.197 --> 00:43:55.922
Move the clinic here

656
00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:57.459
Plus the mountains here

657
00:43:57.647 --> 00:43:59.300
Set up as a hunting ground

658
00:43:59.644 --> 00:44:00.962
Only in this way can the damage to the houses be minimized.

659
00:44:01.585 --> 00:44:02.787
I think so too

660
00:44:02.922 --> 00:44:04.747
Does the king need a new hunting ground?

661
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.262
Whenever the Lord goes out hunting

662
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.080
Dad has to go to Wenyang Palace for inspection

663
00:44:10.145 --> 00:44:11.259
So much trouble

664
00:44:12.334 --> 00:44:14.981
Is it because it would be difficult to manage the court if you are too far away from the palace?

665
00:44:15.913 --> 00:44:18.247
You kid has grown up

666
00:44:20.231 --> 00:44:22.803
By the way, why did it happen when dad was not around?

667
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.128
A Hong Minzhi appeared and caused this situation

668
00:44:27.813 --> 00:44:30.213
Where did the land he used to pay off his debts come from?

669
00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.034
He said it was his cousin's land

670
00:44:33.612 --> 00:44:36.047
We should really leave that evil girl in our house

671
00:44:36.713 --> 00:44:38.181
why do that

672
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.200
Dad is warning Hong Minzhi

673
00:44:41.703 --> 00:44:43.659
That girl is like a hostage

674
00:44:45.748 --> 00:44:47.712
So as long as he's not his grandfather, that's fine, right?

675
00:44:49.118 --> 00:44:49.997
what does it mean

676
00:44:51.905 --> 00:44:53.847
As long as he promises what he thinks, that's all

677
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.953
What did he think

678
00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.053
You want me to take that vicious girl as my concubine?

679
00:44:59.078 --> 00:45:00.178
are you crazy

680
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.856
Wait a minute

681
00:45:06.323 --> 00:45:07.359
if not for me

682
00:45:08.713 --> 00:45:09.880
How about you come

683
00:45:13.755 --> 00:45:15.962
I think you won’t be able to see adults for the time being.

684
00:45:16.308 --> 00:45:18.643
It was difficult for him to leave the palace because of his religious beliefs

685
00:45:20.433 --> 00:45:21.609
So that's it

686
00:45:23.362 --> 00:45:26.378
Is the rice for the medical center sent by the Maharaja?

687
00:45:28.988 --> 00:45:30.822
I'm here to say thank you

688
00:45:30.847 --> 00:45:31.947
Please convey it to me

689
00:45:32.613 --> 00:45:33.703
Did you hear this?

690
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.747
Ji Tong is resurrected

691
00:45:36.747 --> 00:45:38.713
Did he really come back from the dead?

692
00:45:38.713 --> 00:45:40.213
What's going on? He is immortal.

693
00:45:40.213 --> 00:45:41.813
Oops... hello...

694
00:45:41.968 --> 00:45:42.880
Are the rumors true?

695
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.438
What rumors

696
00:45:43.463 --> 00:45:45.172
I heard that he even sent rice to the medical clinic

697
00:45:46.328 --> 00:45:49.809
Eunjo has been going to the medical clinic frequently recently.

698
00:45:49.834 --> 00:45:51.543
I wonder if she has ever met Ji Dong

699
00:45:51.568 --> 00:45:52.737
what did i say

700
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.190
Our Lord Gildong’s helping hand

701
00:45:55.215 --> 00:45:58.915
Across every corner of North Korea

702
00:45:58.947 --> 00:46:02.380
Oh, Lord Yoshidong

703
00:46:12.362 --> 00:46:14.296
Ji Tong…

704
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.250
Are you leaving after praying?

705
00:46:50.956 --> 00:46:53.118
Lord Superintendent returns safely

706
00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:55.065
We thank you for coming

707
00:46:55.724 --> 00:46:57.547
You said before that you really wanted to meet my daughter

708
00:46:57.572 --> 00:46:58.990
She is my daughter

709
00:47:02.947 --> 00:47:04.153
I am Hong Eunjo

710
00:47:06.987 --> 00:47:09.700
Can you write down your family's names for me?

711
00:47:10.091 --> 00:47:11.775
I want to pray for you

712
00:47:14.013 --> 00:47:16.503
thank you so much

713
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.431
thank you for your thoughts

714
00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.155
I heard that before the Gengwu Year

715
00:47:39.222 --> 00:47:42.276
All the people have benefited from the great eunuch Hong Minzhi

716
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:44.442
I am one of them

717
00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:54.080
Do you know what kind of person the current king is?

718
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.551
I don't know much about people in high positions.

719
00:48:03.385 --> 00:48:05.654
I'm just a common man running for a living

720
00:48:06.367 --> 00:48:07.445
you should understand

721
00:48:08.101 --> 00:48:10.920
Because that person once had a knife

722
00:48:11.479 --> 00:48:13.104
Put it on the neck of Hongminzhi Superintendent

723
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.251
Knife?

724
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.051
Just in the year of Gengwu...

725
00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:21.888
that bloody year

726
00:48:23.355 --> 00:48:25.588
Those people can be punished just by being superior

727
00:48:25.613 --> 00:48:28.445
It will definitely become a big trouble for His Highness in the future.

728
00:48:29.114 --> 00:48:32.820
Superintendent Hong Minzhi's advice almost cost him his life

729
00:48:33.647 --> 00:48:36.313
Punishment with the Book of Disobedience

730
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.760
It's a smart move

731
00:48:39.248 --> 00:48:41.245
Ren Shiheng, who was just an admonisher at that time,

732
00:48:41.659 --> 00:48:43.313
Survive on flattery

733
00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:46.898
A king who is flattered by treacherous ministers

734
00:48:47.643 --> 00:48:52.309
Brutally eradicate those officials who are unwilling to submit to them

735
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.398
And in the name of threatening the throne

736
00:48:57.995 --> 00:49:01.582
Persecution of the late king’s harem and half-brothers

737
00:49:01.619 --> 00:49:03.767
Rather than live with this humiliation...

738
00:49:07.537 --> 00:49:08.298
Mother

739
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.760
that year

740
00:49:15.113 --> 00:49:17.192
The king who dyed his court red with blood

741
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:20.757
and his puppet, the treacherous minister Ren Shiheng

742
00:49:21.788 --> 00:49:23.741
And those bureaucrats who are like clones

743
00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:25.813
Take control of the main hall

744
00:49:25.838 --> 00:49:28.826
Step by step, today's North Korea is pushed to destruction

745
00:49:31.522 --> 00:49:35.804
I only know that he angered His Highness by speaking outright.

746
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.226
I didn’t expect to experience that kind of thing in the palace.

747
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:41.138
Don't know if it's normal

748
00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:44.551
After all, both the royal family and the scholar-bureaucrats kept silent.

749
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.013
So the Superintendent also...

750
00:49:57.521 --> 00:50:00.120
Why are you telling me this?

751
00:50:01.468 --> 00:50:02.988
as children

752
00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:05.685
You should know your father’s history

753
00:50:12.164 --> 00:50:14.407
Supervisor Hong went through that incident

754
00:50:14.607 --> 00:50:16.682
Now living a stable life

755
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.479
I feel lucky and respect this

756
00:50:22.713 --> 00:50:23.467
Yes

757
00:50:43.942 --> 00:50:46.060
I have met Ji Dong in person

758
00:50:58.364 --> 00:51:02.538
Rumors of Ji Tong's resurrection spread among the people

759
00:51:08.679 --> 00:51:10.304
God-like existence…

760
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:12.163
Maybe

761
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.657
Really need a god

762
00:51:18.345 --> 00:51:21.035
You go and collect all the rumors about Ji Tong

763
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.052
I can't rashly ask the eunuch about the Gengwu Year, right?

764
00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.799
Let's eat

765
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.171
Why are you eating chicken all of a sudden?

766
00:51:49.043 --> 00:51:51.799
Don’t you really want to eat the old hens that I slaughtered with my own hands?

767
00:51:52.066 --> 00:51:52.631
what

768
00:51:53.899 --> 00:51:55.609
Oops, scared me

769
00:51:56.427 --> 00:51:57.237
What's wrong

770
00:51:57.833 --> 00:52:00.165
Is it because I only had half left after I gave it to the Superintendent?

771
00:52:02.818 --> 00:52:04.462
It’s the old hen again

772
00:52:04.783 --> 00:52:08.602
When did I ask you to kill the old hen?

773
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.446
What you said last time

774
00:52:11.747 --> 00:52:14.112
Why do you seem to be a different person?

775
00:52:14.153 --> 00:52:15.040
Because that’s really not the case...

776
00:52:17.662 --> 00:52:18.512
It's okay

777
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:19.918
Oops

778
00:52:20.731 --> 00:52:23.699
You haven't looked good since just now

779
00:52:23.791 --> 00:52:25.112
What happened?

780
00:52:26.593 --> 00:52:27.659
I'm fine

781
00:52:27.918 --> 00:52:29.012
don't worry

782
00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.634
OK I'm not worried

783
00:52:32.855 --> 00:52:35.768
After all, you said you didn't want me to worry about you at all.

784
00:52:36.714 --> 00:52:39.002
Does that person want you not to worry about me at all?

785
00:52:39.526 --> 00:52:40.590
what else did he say

786
00:52:41.747 --> 00:52:43.149
That person is you

787
00:52:43.747 --> 00:52:44.827
have you forgotten

788
00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.743
You also personally promised not to let my hand go

789
00:52:49.813 --> 00:52:51.262
any drop of water

790
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:54.381
You just accepted that promise like that?

791
00:53:00.695 --> 00:53:03.274
Why do you climb on the roof at night these days?

792
00:53:03.837 --> 00:53:07.155
I want to say that looking out from here might relieve my worries.

793
00:53:07.368 --> 00:53:10.433
What is the reason for sending Hong Shi back through Zongxue?

794
00:53:13.494 --> 00:53:14.824
don't do anything

795
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.288
That's the only way to protect Eunjo

796
00:53:18.313 --> 00:53:19.687
don't do anything

797
00:53:19.906 --> 00:53:21.962
You have to protect the mother you left behind.

798
00:53:23.327 --> 00:53:26.815
I understand my situation

799
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:30.671
Aren't you going to go to a medical clinic?

800
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.802
I heard that you witnessed the epidemic in the clinic

801
00:53:40.438 --> 00:53:41.165
Is this serious?

802
00:53:41.508 --> 00:53:42.161
Yes

803
00:53:43.246 --> 00:53:46.637
Is the source of the epidemic outside the capital a medical clinic?

804
00:53:46.662 --> 00:53:47.215
No

805
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:48.965
It cannot be concluded that

806
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:50.752
It’s up to me to judge

807
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.121
A disease, right?

808
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.630
What a good excuse

809
00:54:04.809 --> 00:54:07.180
Not a drop of water on my hands?

810
00:54:08.847 --> 00:54:10.768
You actually said such words through my mouth

811
00:54:35.313 --> 00:54:36.255
Enzu

812
00:54:36.947 --> 00:54:37.674
Oops

813
00:54:39.714 --> 00:54:41.247
did you forget to get something

814
00:54:41.437 --> 00:54:42.868
I think you should know this

815
00:54:42.893 --> 00:54:44.126
Walked halfway and turned back

816
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:47.790
In short

817
00:54:47.956 --> 00:54:51.290
I heard this when I was drinking with the maid of the Department of Human Beings.

818
00:54:51.908 --> 00:54:52.749
What's going on

819
00:54:54.736 --> 00:54:57.674
I heard that the medical center will be closed tonight

820
00:54:57.813 --> 00:55:00.402
Everything will be bulldozed and burned to the ground

821
00:55:01.105 --> 00:55:02.871
It's so pitiful. What should I do?

822
00:55:10.324 --> 00:55:11.137
Doctor Hong?

823
00:55:11.162 --> 00:55:12.855
She said all she had to do was come to the officer for help.

824
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.008
You'll know who to report to

825
00:55:16.047 --> 00:55:17.058
Good

826
00:55:21.227 --> 00:55:22.721
Everyone, get up quickly

827
00:55:23.047 --> 00:55:24.143
Get up quickly...

828
00:55:24.168 --> 00:55:25.022
Hurry up

829
00:55:25.382 --> 00:55:26.196
Doctor Hong

830
00:55:26.446 --> 00:55:28.671
We need to move the patients outside. Act quickly.

831
00:55:28.795 --> 00:55:29.562
gold stone

832
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:30.753
You go out and wake everyone up

833
00:55:30.778 --> 00:55:32.408
Everyone needs to escape from here

834
00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:46.121
Is this okay?

835
00:55:48.149 --> 00:55:49.812
I am an animal and I am not responsible for judgment.

836
00:55:50.219 --> 00:55:51.439
Just obey orders

837
00:55:52.246 --> 00:55:53.690
Can you move?

838
00:55:54.062 --> 00:55:55.168
come out with me

839
00:55:55.193 --> 00:55:56.860
what happened

840
00:55:56.885 --> 00:55:57.918
I'll explain to you later

841
00:55:57.943 --> 00:55:59.187
Let’s get the patient to the hospital quickly…

842
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:01.790
Uncle Shi, your feet...

843
00:56:01.815 --> 00:56:03.649
I was injured while hunting yesterday

844
00:56:03.674 --> 00:56:04.599
I'm fine

845
00:56:08.633 --> 00:56:10.065
Soldiers so quickly...

846
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:11.068
wait for me

847
00:56:19.155 --> 00:56:19.983
What's going on?

848
00:56:20.008 --> 00:56:21.774
An order has been issued that patients here are to be shot

849
00:56:21.799 --> 00:56:23.699
and a total blockade

850
00:56:26.164 --> 00:56:27.764
Run away quickly

851
00:56:39.894 --> 00:56:40.733
Run to the back door

852
00:56:59.847 --> 00:57:02.880
Shunshi…

853
00:57:06.788 --> 00:57:07.588
You stay where you are, Shun Shi

854
00:57:07.613 --> 00:57:08.362
danger

855
00:57:18.967 --> 00:57:19.737
Dispose of them all

856
00:57:48.113 --> 00:57:49.036
catch me

857
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:49.796
You go quickly

858
00:57:49.821 --> 00:57:51.222
As long as the child can survive

859
00:57:51.247 --> 00:57:52.371
catch me quickly

860
00:57:52.396 --> 00:57:54.280
If this continues, everyone will die.

861
00:57:54.577 --> 00:57:56.105
please leave quickly

862
00:57:57.065 --> 00:57:58.977
I'll be back. Just wait for me.

863
00:58:28.247 --> 00:58:30.280
Doctor Hong

864
00:59:03.047 --> 00:59:03.971
Hong Eun-jo

865
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:03.849
Can you still laugh?

866
01:00:03.947 --> 01:00:05.618
Your family is doing it for your own selfish reasons

867
01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:07.608
The lives of so many people hang on a thread

868
01:00:07.888 --> 01:00:09.758
You know where this place is

869
01:00:09.783 --> 01:00:11.217
How dare you act so boldly?

870
01:00:11.247 --> 01:00:12.674
But I just can't control myself

871
01:00:12.713 --> 01:00:13.990
with you

872
01:00:14.015 --> 01:00:15.248
I always forget fear

873
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.346
Ji Tong is still alive

874
01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.521
See how protective you are of Ji Tong

875
01:00:19.546 --> 01:00:22.574
He must be a very important person to you.

876
01:00:22.712 --> 01:00:25.112
Everything about Ji Tong will be kept confidential

877
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.446
You look after me from behind

878
01:00:26.698 --> 01:00:27.999
What about you?

879
01:00:28.039 --> 01:00:28.833
Are you leaving?

880
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.177
Where to go?
