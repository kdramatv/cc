﻿1
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.751
An hour has passed since Youshi.

2
00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.655
If you haven't come after waiting for so long, you must have forgotten the promise, right?

3
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.814
Let's go

4
00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:17.164
Yes

5
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:24.717
What if I didn't forget the promise but something unexpected happened?

6
00:00:24.828 --> 00:00:26.726
What? According to common sense

7
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.579
My face is not so easily forgotten, right?

8
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.867
I can't help it, I'm a big-hearted person

9
00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:33.176
Just wait a little longer

10
00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:36.392
Didn't you say that she regards you as a mentally abnormal slave?

11
00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:38.465
She should have realized that this was not a reward, but a punishment.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.776
So run away

13
00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.645
I'm going to make a convenience. I'll be back soon.

14
00:01:00.407 --> 00:01:02.870
God has not given me anything

15
00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:07.724
Poverty, shabbyness, downfall, tears

16
00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:10.983
Where is the punishment?

17
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.442
I just want to give her this

18
00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:21.214
I've only had a few misfortunes in this life

19
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:24.804
I hope this can be her little luck

20
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.476
Dazao, move faster

21
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.358
I'm really leaving this time

22
00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:50.301
If I can no longer live as a woman in the future

23
00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:55.201
If tonight might be the last

24
00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:02.986
Exactly now

25
00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:09.026
It's that person

26
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.595
Why did you come just now?

27
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:29.254
Do you know how long I have been waiting for you...

28
00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:03.529
This…

29
00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:05.986
Let's consider this as compensation.

30
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:14.254
Sir

31
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.848
Sir, why is your face so red?

32
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:22.561
I just...

33
00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:26.020
Something was stolen

34
00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:28.845
What did the other party steal?

35
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.276
That…

36
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.429
Have you seen what the thief looks like?

37
00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:40.216
Well, what does that guy look like?

38
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:45.501
very beautiful

39
00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.120
Very beautiful

40
00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:50.526
What? Is the thief beautiful?

41
00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:53.520
We must find her

42
00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.283
Am I crazy?

43
00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:58.274
what am i doing

44
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:02.254
Even I am so panicked

45
00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.213
How speechless that person must be

46
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.758
Go back and explain it to him.

47
00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:33.073
Are you leaving?

48
00:04:34.783 --> 00:04:35.748
what to do

49
00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:39.201
I won't see you again after today

50
00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.491
So say

51
00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.749
Why are you going crazy on this moonlit night?

52
00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:49.224
Oh, it's true

53
00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.073
where has she gone

54
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:02.445
It's already so late. I won't be able to catch up.

55
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.208
The people have arrived, close the capital gate

56
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:17.333
Why exactly?

57
00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:26.933
I…

58
00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:29.333
I'll definitely catch you

59
00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.026
Sir

60
00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:34.864
I've searched and found no one.

61
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.573
It's time to go back to the palace

62
00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:39.651
Go back first

63
00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:40.442
Yes

64
00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.601
By the way, we can't miss this

65
00:06:09.644 --> 00:06:10.951
All the food is empty?

66
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.558
We didn't steal it

67
00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:14.773
This must be the work of thieves

68
00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.204
What? Please look at this

69
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.630
The thief stole something and left a painting behind

70
00:06:18.655 --> 00:06:20.208
This guy is so brave...

71
00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:30.220
Ji Tong is really not a simple guy.

72
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:31.701
That's right

73
00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:40.826
Who is over there

74
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:55.883
It's night time

75
00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:58.439
Please show your pass

76
00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.251
Officer Park?

77
00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:11.301
scared me

78
00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.276
it's me

79
00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:14.679
It turns out to be Eunjo

80
00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:18.104
Didn't you see a man in black just now?

81
00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:22.726
I was looking for shoes. I didn’t look carefully.

82
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.081
What's wrong

83
00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:26.995
By the way, the night ban pass...

84
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.679
Oops... no need

85
00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:30.367
Why do we need to see that between us?

86
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:35.270
It's extraordinarily tight today.

87
00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:37.926
Just know it yourself

88
00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:41.362
I heard that the holder of Bai Dong's mask is Ji Dong

89
00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:47.923
Jiang Yunfu is an official. Did he even investigate this kind of thing?

90
00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:48.898
No, it’s big…

91
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:53.126
Anyway, there is such a person

92
00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:55.473
He is a newly appointed officer

93
00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:57.636
A person who looks radiant and good-looking

94
00:07:58.792 --> 00:07:59.659
Really?

95
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:00.770
listen to that person

96
00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.376
It was the suspect who spread the rumors about Ji Tong

97
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.882
The main subject has already been interrogated

98
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.151
Who is it?

99
00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:13.456
She's the proprietor, you know that, right?

100
00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:24.395
If, as usual, I come to my door as a lucky boy

101
00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:25.524
Almost got caught

102
00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:47.464
aunt

103
00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:48.888
Coming

104
00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:52.645
Why can't this kid always fall asleep?

105
00:08:53.393 --> 00:08:55.057
It should be because of malnutrition

106
00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:56.354
Let me help you take a look

107
00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:09.866
This is a personal item found in an adult's going out clothes.

108
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.494
I took back the embroidered shoes

109
00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:30.661
Why are you running away?

110
00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:33.444
It's natural for thieves to escape

111
00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:34.185
No

112
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.816
Not that guy

113
00:09:40.222 --> 00:09:41.082
It's this woman

114
00:09:46.723 --> 00:09:47.772
Tomorrow's time

115
00:09:47.998 --> 00:09:50.454
Summon all the maids in the palace, including Shang Gong.

116
00:09:57.891 --> 00:09:59.216
I accept the remonstrance

117
00:09:59.624 --> 00:10:00.651
please start

118
00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:07.488
Your Highness's merits are immeasurable, and the world is becoming more peaceful and prosperous day by day.

119
00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:10.304
Isn’t this also your contribution?

120
00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:11.846
Yes

121
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:17.435
Please, Your Highness, cherish your jade body even more to protect the country.

122
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.851
People will pay attention

123
00:10:22.898 --> 00:10:25.332
Let’s save the kind words we say every day for tomorrow.

124
00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.382
Nothing interesting?

125
00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:29.435
I'm so bored in the palace

126
00:10:29.668 --> 00:10:31.369
I want to hear interesting things happening outside

127
00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.799
In the past year, including Weichen

128
00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:40.038
Thieves are often encountered in the warehouses of ministers' homes

129
00:10:40.132 --> 00:10:44.647
That guy pretends to be a righteous thief and walks around

130
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.201
There is such a thing

131
00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:49.699
Then he should be arrested

132
00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:51.185
Just a thief

133
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.807
Why are you so angry?

134
00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:56.347
This kind of thing has been common since ancient times

135
00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:58.707
So…

136
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.183
You should be more careful

137
00:11:04.974 --> 00:11:06.907
What does this mean?

138
00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:11.894
Lin Juzheng cut open more than just rice bags

139
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.838
Aren’t the bellies of corrupt officials also cut open?

140
00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:24.994
What's the thief's name?

141
00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:26.985
Yes Your Highness

142
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:29.213
I heard it was taken from "fellow travelers on the road"

143
00:11:29.782 --> 00:11:32.232
Therefore, it is called "lucky boy"

144
00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:36.142
Isn't it "poop on the roadside"?

145
00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:38.189
"Shit"?

146
00:11:52.927 --> 00:11:54.954
The increasing number of remonstrances from remonstrators

147
00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:56.772
Now it sounds just embarrassing

148
00:11:58.122 --> 00:11:59.691
I thought it was quite interesting.

149
00:12:00.117 --> 00:12:00.982
don't you like it

150
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.793
Those are just lies

151
00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:07.166
Aren't these people more despicable than Hong Min?

152
00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:26.332
The Chief Admonishes Hong Minzhi. I order you to say it again.

153
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.269
This is an unprecedented tampering with the record

154
00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:32.708
Those people can be punished just by being superior

155
00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:35.666
It will definitely become a big trouble for His Highness in the future.

156
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:45.729
Come and remonstrate with me too

157
00:12:47.704 --> 00:12:50.338
Punishment with the Book of Disobedience

158
00:12:53.703 --> 00:12:55.394
It's a smart move

159
00:12:57.495 --> 00:12:58.863
Your Highness…

160
00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:02.957
is correct

161
00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:09.863
Really?

162
00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:23.560
Are you missing Hong Minzhi?

163
00:13:25.943 --> 00:13:27.601
Although he is unpleasant and embarrassing,

164
00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:30.257
But at least Hong Minzhi still has some sincerity

165
00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:40.194
What's wrong with you

166
00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:42.503
I also have sincerity here

167
00:13:47.064 --> 00:13:47.854
Really?

168
00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:52.529
Let me see where your sincerity lies

169
00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:04.332
Dad, are you going to retire now?

170
00:14:05.598 --> 00:14:06.998
I'm going to see the benefactor

171
00:14:25.954 --> 00:14:26.760
That…

172
00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:28.306
If you don’t want to eat, give it to me.

173
00:14:28.348 --> 00:14:29.682
I'm waiting for it to cool down

174
00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:32.185
If you don't like brothels, go home

175
00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:41.104
This is my bribe for asking you to take care of Eunjo.

176
00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:44.502
She's nothing like you

177
00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:47.032
丝毫不软弱

178
00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:52.188
She looks docile but is actually very strong

179
00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:57.007
Just think this marriage is because of my greed.

180
00:14:57.426 --> 00:15:00.517
Because I want to eat well and sleep well in a powerful house

181
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.632
That's human nature

182
00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:04.132
sorry

183
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.851
what do you mean

184
00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:11.645
I always feel guilty for you

185
00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:14.457
So boring

186
00:15:15.338 --> 00:15:19.088
By the way, I will return the coins you sent me.

187
00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:22.329
Don't refuse. This is what the child deserves.

188
00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:24.909
If you accept it, it will become a heavy burden for my daughter.

189
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.050
Gave money worth a big house

190
00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:29.762
How far do you plan to use our family's ancestors?

191
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.881
You embarrassed me again

192
00:15:36.856 --> 00:15:38.881
You came to see me this time

193
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.853
Is there any other reason?

194
00:15:44.212 --> 00:15:45.469
No

195
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:47.725
Just say hello

196
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.994
frown all day

197
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:27.903
what's going on

198
00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:28.891
what

199
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:32.988
Just remembering the book I read yesterday

200
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:35.631
What is the content

201
00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.871
Let me, my illiterate sister, have some fun too

202
00:16:42.798 --> 00:16:46.562
It's just... there is a woman...

203
00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:48.782
I heard that the Maharaja summoned everyone

204
00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:49.773
Is it something interesting?

205
00:16:49.798 --> 00:16:50.963
Are you talking about heroic deeds again?

206
00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:52.510
Come on over

207
00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:56.475
I... I...

208
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.847
That's you over there

209
00:17:00.332 --> 00:17:02.854
If a woman takes the initiative to kiss

210
00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:04.963
Probably just admiration

211
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:06.778
Admiration?

212
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:11.263
No, that night was the first time we met

213
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:14.019
So it was love at first sight.

214
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:20.597
The appearance of a man is indeed attractive enough

215
00:17:21.232 --> 00:17:23.765
It seems that the woman in the book fell in love with the man at first sight

216
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.247
Nothing

217
00:17:25.272 --> 00:17:26.631
Then why run away

218
00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:28.959
Uh...

219
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:32.081
Maybe he was frightened by the stupid thing he did.

220
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.909
When he came to his senses, he had already escaped.

221
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:43.141
He just wanted to test it out and run away.

222
00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:45.919
If it was love at first sight, why would you run away by yourself?

223
00:17:45.944 --> 00:17:48.072
We should run away together to be truly in love.

224
00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:50.676
That makes sense

225
00:17:52.164 --> 00:17:53.315
Why do you think he ran away?

226
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:56.781
Probably after trying it out, I thought it was not interesting.

227
00:17:57.527 --> 00:17:58.622
Maybe so

228
00:17:58.671 --> 00:18:01.704
I kissed you with great expectations

229
00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:05.481
You should hear the wonderful sound of gongs in your ears

230
00:18:05.658 --> 00:18:08.058
Who knows I feel nothing

231
00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:10.034
I only feel the other person's cold breath

232
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.856
This situation is really uncomfortable

233
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:19.350
You are prohibited from answering in the future

234
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:21.197
why

235
00:18:21.222 --> 00:18:22.812
Questions were banned a long time ago

236
00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:25.300
Really, then why do you want to kiss me?

237
00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:28.687
Even he himself was very curious about this part

238
00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:32.000
I don't even have the slightest clue when I think about it.

239
00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:34.856
At this time

240
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.462
You have to understand it carefully

241
00:18:39.582 --> 00:18:40.462
Do you understand with your heart?

242
00:18:42.916 --> 00:18:45.025
This is what is called love

243
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.766
It's absolutely impossible to figure it out with your brain

244
00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.944
What kind of admiration? It's definitely not like this

245
00:18:53.477 --> 00:18:54.744
You can't have this idea either

246
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.031
Because he has a fiancé

247
00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:02.982
Even if it's the content of the book, that woman is too hateful.

248
00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:05.747
He needs to be arrested and punished.

249
00:19:06.866 --> 00:19:08.929
That's how it's supposed to be...right?

250
00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:10.232
Right

251
00:19:17.126 --> 00:19:19.438
Don't even think about hitting a few big boards, right?

252
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.379
That…

253
00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:26.069
Could it be a woman kissing with admiration?

254
00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:28.157
But knowing full well that I can’t achieve positive results with that man

255
00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:30.941
What about forbidden love?

256
00:19:32.383 --> 00:19:33.338
Forbidden love?

257
00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.710
This kind of love is what makes people unable to extricate themselves

258
00:19:36.994 --> 00:19:39.335
For example, the lady and the slave

259
00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:42.785
Master and valet?

260
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:46.722
Footman?

261
00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:47.507
boy

262
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:50.241
I mean boy "boy"

263
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.247
She only knows me as a brat

264
00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:56.259
So I don’t think I can achieve positive results through cultivation with me.

265
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.171
Then let me ask you

266
00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:00.468
if found out later

267
00:20:01.278 --> 00:20:04.124
That manservant is a young master from a famous family.

268
00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:10.221
Or a Maharaja?

269
00:20:16.199 --> 00:20:18.043
Your reactions are all the same.

270
00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:19.784
Is it good or bad?

271
00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.418
The story of the manservant I just told

272
00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.074
Probably not an adult’s friend...

273
00:20:24.362 --> 00:20:26.509
I'm thinking about it

274
00:20:27.054 --> 00:20:28.409
Where did my friend come from?

275
00:20:28.822 --> 00:20:29.915
Of course I'm talking about myself

276
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.787
Then it was your lips that were stolen last night...

277
00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:38.894
From now on, I will go to the Robbery Hall by myself

278
00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:40.974
What about me...

279
00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:42.684
I'm thinking about it

280
00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:45.284
You have a very important errand to run

281
00:20:57.795 --> 00:21:00.771
Because my good looks have eclipsed this piece of fabric

282
00:21:01.397 --> 00:21:02.171
Are you right?

283
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:06.465
Isn't it because of the dark clouds floating over the lady's head?

284
00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:09.302
What's wrong? Is there anything else that makes you unhappy?

285
00:21:11.248 --> 00:21:13.534
Just...everything

286
00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:15.815
everything dissatisfied me

287
00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:18.912
This is the woman who will become my wife

288
00:21:19.072 --> 00:21:21.012
No, is it already?

289
00:21:22.594 --> 00:21:25.646
Just wait, I'll replace them all for you

290
00:21:26.444 --> 00:21:29.274
Forget it, I don't have the guts

291
00:21:29.608 --> 00:21:31.106
Defy the fate that my brother has arranged for me

292
00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:33.452
Just use this

293
00:21:33.477 --> 00:21:34.977
Maybe you will develop feelings after wearing it for a long time

294
00:21:35.024 --> 00:21:37.349
After looking at it for a long time, there will be something good to see, right?

295
00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:40.202
Boss, where is the satin dress I ordered last time?

296
00:21:44.882 --> 00:21:47.715
I'm afraid the lady will feel inconvenienced. I'll come back later.

297
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:49.290
Let's take a step to speak.

298
00:21:53.048 --> 00:21:54.427
can you avoid it

299
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:55.593
Yes

300
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:06.284
I just put my hair up in a bun not long ago

301
00:22:07.144 --> 00:22:10.156
I would be grateful if you could pull it off a little lighter.

302
00:22:16.108 --> 00:22:18.577
You just said...do you want to cheer for me?

303
00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:21.599
That's what it means literally

304
00:22:21.887 --> 00:22:24.299
I plan to have a lot of affection for my future husband and you

305
00:22:24.324 --> 00:22:25.402
Take care of everything together

306
00:22:25.788 --> 00:22:28.176
Because I learned that this is also the character a wife should have

307
00:22:28.204 --> 00:22:30.569
Who taught you that this is the moral character a wife should have?

308
00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:32.094
Is it your father or your mother?

309
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:34.319
I lost my parents when I was five years old

310
00:22:34.878 --> 00:22:36.194
The moral character I just mentioned

311
00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:38.587
Yes...I learned it from books

312
00:22:39.617 --> 00:22:40.453
From the book

313
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.669
So you didn't plan on slapping me

314
00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:49.506
Or pulling my hair or something?

315
00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:53.687
reward...what

316
00:22:54.651 --> 00:22:55.781
Look, Master

317
00:22:56.053 --> 00:22:57.341
I have been a prostitute for ten years and this is the first time I have met

318
00:22:57.366 --> 00:22:59.547
The lady who said that there is a kind of fate between wives and concubines

319
00:22:59.692 --> 00:23:00.341
Oops

320
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:04.087
It turns out that my fiancée sees bad luck as fate.

321
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:06.678
You are a Bodhisattva who considers your bad life to be a blessing.

322
00:23:06.703 --> 00:23:08.870
Whether you want to break off the engagement or regret it, it's up to you.

323
00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:11.700
Anyway, young master, don’t play your little tricks on me in the future.

324
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:15.747
Why is Lu Yi so angry?

325
00:23:17.428 --> 00:23:19.587
Because the person who should be angry has already become a Buddha.

326
00:23:20.593 --> 00:23:22.509
Rather than making things difficult for our Bodhisattva,

327
00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:23.978
Would the bitterness one be more useful?

328
00:23:30.591 --> 00:23:32.569
Damn it. You missed. Accept the punishment.

329
00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:36.119
Why can't I hit even a single arrow?

330
00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:38.306
Isn't your father a military attaché?

331
00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:40.125
What about you? You obviously can’t hit it.

332
00:23:40.229 --> 00:23:43.329
Our family’s elders have been studying at university for generations.

333
00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:45.447
Can you all use your brush as a knife?

334
00:23:46.963 --> 00:23:47.663
That's right too

335
00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:50.162
Your father just couldn't keep his mouth shut, so he ended up like that.

336
00:23:50.314 --> 00:23:51.350
What did you say, brat?

337
00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:53.916
If we Eunjo had come, we would have shot them all, okay?

338
00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.181
To compare with a concubine's daughter

339
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:03.606
It's so noisy

340
00:24:03.678 --> 00:24:05.397
It was this guy first...

341
00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:11.639
Anyway, we Eunjo have been playing with bows as dolls since we were little.

342
00:24:11.664 --> 00:24:13.248
Many times stronger than you

343
00:24:13.273 --> 00:24:15.489
She's just a stinky girl. Stop lying.

344
00:24:15.514 --> 00:24:16.929
Do you want to bet? Okay, come on

345
00:24:16.954 --> 00:24:18.742
You guys are so naive.

346
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:22.279
What to bet on?

347
00:24:23.014 --> 00:24:25.126
Since ancient times, the battle between men and women can only be understood by comparing

348
00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:34.432
Are you here? I received your message

349
00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:36.566
I heard that Ji Tong stole something during this time, right?

350
00:24:36.594 --> 00:24:37.364
Yes

351
00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:39.358
However

352
00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:42.389
Why did you come here alone?

353
00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:44.126
Are you asking about jujube?

354
00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:47.279
Has anyone seen this woman?

355
00:24:48.254 --> 00:24:53.117
I have to find this woman before I can go home.

356
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.742
Dazao is looking for embroidered shoes

357
00:24:55.615 --> 00:24:58.048
Are you interested in...embroidered shoes?

358
00:24:58.617 --> 00:25:01.645
This one has beautiful colors and beautiful patterns.

359
00:25:02.041 --> 00:25:02.911
The most important thing is

360
00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:04.961
Also very kind-hearted

361
00:25:05.464 --> 00:25:07.945
They are embroidered shoes, but they are kind-hearted

362
00:25:08.948 --> 00:25:10.082
It turns out to be a human being

363
00:25:11.098 --> 00:25:12.839
It seems from the way you keep praising him

364
00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:14.346
She must be a beautiful member of the opposite sex, right?

365
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:15.933
Pay less attention to other people’s opposite sex

366
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.658
Use your rationality in handling the case

367
00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:23.125
Is this the painting Ji Tong left behind this time?

368
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:23.745
yes

369
00:25:24.931 --> 00:25:28.080
What kind of thief? The types of things he steals are not fixed.

370
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.455
That's right

371
00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:30.727
Actually stole kelp

372
00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:34.049
It seems that his wife has given birth to a baby.

373
00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:40.589
You are here. Are you looking for me?

374
00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:43.199
Officer Park said that on the night of Ji Dong's theft

375
00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:45.364
Did you see a suspicious person?

376
00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:47.439
Although I’m not sure if it’s a lucky boy or not

377
00:25:47.464 --> 00:25:48.843
But he moved very quickly

378
00:25:50.258 --> 00:25:51.152
than me

379
00:25:51.177 --> 00:25:53.593
Eunjo, who was present together, should have seen it more clearly.

380
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:55.886
Is Dr. Hong also present? Yes

381
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.093
Is she the medical woman you know?

382
00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:00.321
According to regulations, female corpses must be examined by someone who is also a female.

383
00:26:00.346 --> 00:26:02.061
So when Tea Mother is short of manpower,

384
00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:03.371
Occasionally I would ask Dr. Hong to come over and help me.

385
00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:07.289
Where is that doctor girl now?

386
00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.389
Hong Eun-jo

387
00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:16.236
young master

388
00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:17.808
What's wrong

389
00:26:18.495 --> 00:26:20.411
You need to go to a place with me quickly

390
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.861
Bet? Yes

391
00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:26.464
Just shoot this apple that's smaller than the bull's-eye

392
00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:33.786
Master, do you still have time to do this kind of thing now?

393
00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:35.927
When do you plan to take the imperial examination?

394
00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:39.721
Do you hang out with those young masters every day?

395
00:26:41.758 --> 00:26:43.224
Since falling behind in family life

396
00:26:43.224 --> 00:26:44.606
They are the only friends who want to associate with me

397
00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:47.781
It's like a family relationship now

398
00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:59.399
Then I will win this bet, but make a promise to me

399
00:27:01.191 --> 00:27:03.478
Why does that evil girl look so familiar?

400
00:27:03.643 --> 00:27:05.081
It’s really an eyesore

401
00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:09.168
A mere evil girl actually thinks of herself as his sister.

402
00:27:09.767 --> 00:27:11.006
It’s really an eyesore

403
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.990
Didn’t your evil daughter refuse just now?

404
00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:27.546
Why did you change your mind again?

405
00:27:28.182 --> 00:27:29.518
Because I made an agreement with him

406
00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:30.581
Agreement?

407
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:32.599
He said that if he shot, he would ask me to take the imperial examination before

408
00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:33.771
Don't hang out with you guys

409
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.015
That's it

410
00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:43.256
you

411
00:27:44.418 --> 00:27:45.603
Do you really not know me?

412
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.846
It really looks more familiar the more you look at it.

413
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.468
Don't know

414
00:27:49.714 --> 00:27:51.778
I see you for the first time today

415
00:27:53.773 --> 00:27:54.818
Can I cum now?

416
00:27:56.504 --> 00:27:57.375
wait a moment

417
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.425
I think the rules need to be changed.

418
00:28:06.322 --> 00:28:07.881
It was you who made the matter big

419
00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:09.812
what

420
00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:12.975
You actually want your brother to agree to such an important agreement

421
00:28:13.824 --> 00:28:15.278
You should also gamble with something.

422
00:28:19.474 --> 00:28:21.578
You're going there instead of Bullseye Station.

423
00:28:25.835 --> 00:28:27.312
Zai Yi: What?

424
00:28:29.259 --> 00:28:30.021
Don't you want it?

425
00:28:31.254 --> 00:28:32.533
Why is this necessary?

426
00:28:33.502 --> 00:28:34.740
Have I made you unhappy?

427
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:37.178
Not yet. Stand over.

428
00:28:54.017 --> 00:28:55.459
you can do it

429
00:29:07.482 --> 00:29:08.290
Enzu

430
00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:10.336
please

431
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.784
please

432
00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:36.150
I just hope that he can do it before taking the imperial examination

433
00:29:36.373 --> 00:29:38.300
Just concentrate on reading

434
00:29:39.547 --> 00:29:42.581
If I ask the young master to make a promise that makes you unhappy

435
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:44.040
Then please punish me

436
00:29:44.488 --> 00:29:45.365
I'm doing it

437
00:29:47.087 --> 00:29:49.165
Do you think I’m bullying Dayi now?

438
00:29:51.124 --> 00:29:53.321
Dayi is trembling more and more

439
00:29:54.845 --> 00:29:56.815
Your fingertips will also tremble more.

440
00:29:58.968 --> 00:30:01.150
It seems that this punishment is perfect

441
00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:06.068
Why…

442
00:30:07.778 --> 00:30:08.981
To do this

443
00:30:10.866 --> 00:30:13.262
Even a wicked girl dares to protect her brother as a sister

444
00:30:13.287 --> 00:30:14.924
really unpleasant

445
00:30:15.597 --> 00:30:17.050
Children in the side room

446
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.034
Isn't this against etiquette?

447
00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:24.990
I don't want to stand out as my sister

448
00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:29.440
I just really want to do this

449
00:30:30.758 --> 00:30:33.146
If this intention is against etiquette

450
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:36.909
I'm sorry

451
00:31:03.991 --> 00:31:07.628
I knew how a woman dared to show off in archery

452
00:31:10.756 --> 00:31:11.459
what

453
00:31:14.358 --> 00:31:16.143
I am willing to accept punishment

454
00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:18.784
I also ask the young master to abide by the agreement.

455
00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:32.312
It's terrible this time

456
00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:35.000
I bet on my treasured belt

457
00:31:35.362 --> 00:31:36.503
Tie him back

458
00:31:43.392 --> 00:31:46.040
Did you shoot a sparrow flying in the sky?

459
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.930
Really excellent

460
00:31:48.584 --> 00:31:50.599
He actually hit a target smaller than the far target

461
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:52.075
Perfect victory

462
00:31:57.756 --> 00:31:58.621
Wow

463
00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:00.937
It shot through the heart accurately

464
00:32:03.602 --> 00:32:06.669
That woman who almost became your second sister-in-law is really cruel.

465
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:09.702
Second sister-in-law?

466
00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:10.652
don't you know

467
00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.399
She is the evil daughter of the Dayi family that your brother wants to take as his concubine.

468
00:32:16.022 --> 00:32:17.945
The second son of Master Ren Shiheng?

469
00:32:18.058 --> 00:32:19.661
Why are you saying it now?

470
00:32:19.686 --> 00:32:21.433
Didn't I say that our relationship is as close as family?

471
00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:24.039
To be precise, they are my in-laws and your young master.

472
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.195
To be more precise, it’s grandson, okay?

473
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.427
Things are getting more complicated

474
00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:33.430
Why is everyone gathered there?

475
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.199
You go back first

476
00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.779
I want to go to Da Si Jian’s house before the end of the day to treat my wife.

477
00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:43.504
good

478
00:32:58.158 --> 00:33:00.514
No other clues have been found except Bai Dong's mask.

479
00:33:00.817 --> 00:33:02.658
before the investigation is concluded

480
00:33:02.683 --> 00:33:04.951
I'd better stay out of my own business for the time being.

481
00:33:16.017 --> 00:33:18.673
By the way, there's that thing

482
00:33:52.602 --> 00:33:54.220
Sir, the Robbery Hall is now...

483
00:33:54.245 --> 00:33:55.383
Is that doctor girl here?

484
00:33:58.523 --> 00:33:59.392
Concubine

485
00:34:02.154 --> 00:34:04.969
Why did the Queen Mother come here?

486
00:34:07.466 --> 00:34:09.689
Are you working as an official Jiang Yunfu?

487
00:34:09.768 --> 00:34:11.547
Yes, exactly small

488
00:34:11.998 --> 00:34:14.532
If I were allowed to step into the Robbery Hall again

489
00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:17.956
At that time, I will also bring you the decree to detain you.

490
00:34:22.258 --> 00:34:23.445
Back off

491
00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:36.464
Why did you reject the advice of the great minister?

492
00:34:37.773 --> 00:34:39.404
Because she really doesn't suit me

493
00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:46.173
The Robbery Hall is not the place you should be.

494
00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:50.213
Acting as an officer has been approved by His Highness and is also my pastime.

495
00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:52.492
How far do you plan to fall?

496
00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:54.973
degenerate, libertine, scoundrel

497
00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.733
These are not titles that everyone can get.

498
00:34:57.866 --> 00:34:59.963
At least be a great king like me...

499
00:35:05.124 --> 00:35:06.188
Do you want to...

500
00:35:07.324 --> 00:35:09.298
How much more do you want to disappoint me?

501
00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:12.579
Nothing will ever disappoint you again

502
00:35:14.092 --> 00:35:15.207
As long as the Queen Mother...

503
00:35:16.058 --> 00:35:17.507
Stop expecting me

504
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:20.282
You…

505
00:35:22.448 --> 00:35:23.557
You are so...

506
00:35:47.991 --> 00:35:49.307
The queen looks very angry

507
00:35:49.635 --> 00:35:51.342
Should you do something?

508
00:35:52.791 --> 00:35:53.832
i can't do anything

509
00:35:54.334 --> 00:35:57.000
Don't let the world discover your intelligence

510
00:35:57.658 --> 00:35:59.126
Don't appear in front of me

511
00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:00.917
don't do anything

512
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.007
I won't do anything

513
00:36:04.701 --> 00:36:07.895
I always feel that you are particularly ruthless towards the concubine.

514
00:36:09.878 --> 00:36:11.448
Because being unfilial is filial

515
00:36:12.763 --> 00:36:15.985
Don't pay too much attention to what the Queen Mother said just now

516
00:36:16.624 --> 00:36:18.624
She just has nowhere to vent the anger in her heart

517
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:23.267
Sorry for making you hear that.

518
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:25.176
don't say that

519
00:36:26.838 --> 00:36:28.520
It's so boring to wait like this

520
00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:32.191
I want to see the Hong family doctor in person

521
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.020
Miss, are you watching?

522
00:36:45.598 --> 00:36:46.369
What's wrong

523
00:36:46.492 --> 00:36:47.657
Is it so interesting?

524
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.654
Why on earth should you read this kind of book?

525
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:52.848
Even the man who will become my husband

526
00:36:52.873 --> 00:36:55.865
I really can't understand his thoughts

527
00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:58.491
Oh my god, it's so exciting

528
00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:01.424
Turn to the next page

529
00:37:02.939 --> 00:37:04.366
Is it really Ji Tong?

530
00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:06.113
I heard Jitong is Baiding

531
00:37:06.138 --> 00:37:07.113
Ji Tong?

532
00:37:07.263 --> 00:37:08.273
That's right

533
00:37:09.715 --> 00:37:10.779
I want to go down

534
00:37:10.804 --> 00:37:13.604
Get out of the way, get out of the way

535
00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:22.010
Really charming

536
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:25.951
Can the lady see Bai Ding's face behind the mask?

537
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:27.867
I can see

538
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:30.267
It's not the face, it's the person's heart

539
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:37.945
Who is this person?

540
00:37:38.463 --> 00:37:39.826
Unknown name

541
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.835
Characterized by being like a fool

542
00:37:42.232 --> 00:37:44.867
Make a fuss and call the cold water a lightning strike

543
00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:47.170
A disrespectful person who does not respect the dignity of superiors and inferiors

544
00:37:47.424 --> 00:37:49.091
Stop looking. Let's go.

545
00:37:49.091 --> 00:37:50.824
You still need to go to the Huimin Office?

546
00:37:50.824 --> 00:37:51.629
Good

547
00:37:53.546 --> 00:37:54.448
Just keep watching

548
00:38:00.242 --> 00:38:02.076
I think my brother might be hungry

549
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:03.417
So I took a detour and bought some.

550
00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:05.548
The patients' portions are also well prepared.

551
00:38:05.573 --> 00:38:06.635
Call everyone over

552
00:38:08.376 --> 00:38:10.751
Buying snacks is just an excuse, but actually I want to go shopping

553
00:38:10.776 --> 00:38:11.970
Do you think I don't know your tricks?

554
00:38:11.995 --> 00:38:13.429
This is against the right principles

555
00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:16.479
That's not what I meant

556
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:17.773
Still talking back

557
00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:23.617
Go home before the sun goes down

558
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:25.354
Good

559
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.979
Oh, is that the idiot?

560
00:38:49.658 --> 00:38:51.023
why look at me

561
00:38:52.581 --> 00:38:54.081
That…

562
00:38:54.724 --> 00:38:55.824
Please…

563
00:38:55.824 --> 00:38:57.345
Look, she's calling you

564
00:38:58.234 --> 00:38:59.401
What's wrong

565
00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:01.067
Please…

566
00:39:02.094 --> 00:39:05.171
Is that guy next to you a fool?

567
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:07.429
I heard it all

568
00:39:09.879 --> 00:39:11.866
You read it wrong. This is...

569
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.054
I am an official

570
00:39:14.194 --> 00:39:15.526
I'm really sorry

571
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.901
Because you look like the fool someone is desperately looking for

572
00:39:18.073 --> 00:39:19.566
That's why I ask

573
00:39:19.663 --> 00:39:20.685
It doesn't matter

574
00:39:21.301 --> 00:39:24.348
It's surprising, but this isn't the first time I've been called a fool.

575
00:39:25.662 --> 00:39:27.398
Yes, then I'll take my leave first.

576
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.101
be careful

577
00:39:47.024 --> 00:39:49.988
But why did the Hong family doctor appear that night?

578
00:39:50.507 --> 00:39:52.335
That's not the time for women to hang out.

579
00:39:52.629 --> 00:39:55.158
I don’t know that either. You might as well ask her yourself.

580
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:04.258
Come on over here

581
00:40:06.582 --> 00:40:07.607
Where is Dr. Hong?

582
00:40:07.835 --> 00:40:09.651
Eunjo is off today

583
00:40:10.198 --> 00:40:11.054
Really?

584
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.792
So where is she now?

585
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.532
During her break, she would go to various places to treat patients.

586
00:40:16.572 --> 00:40:17.935
There's no way to know where she is

587
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.001
So I can’t see her today?

588
00:40:20.642 --> 00:40:22.591
This medical lady is really worrying

589
00:40:23.158 --> 00:40:23.876
Sir

590
00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.248
These were the people who visited the widow's house during this period

591
00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:30.899
The woman next door

592
00:40:30.924 --> 00:40:32.124
The woman opposite

593
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:33.417
The housewife in the back

594
00:40:33.529 --> 00:40:34.654
The woman next door

595
00:40:34.956 --> 00:40:36.623
witch, medicine woman

596
00:40:37.947 --> 00:40:39.879
Does that mean there are only women and no men?

597
00:40:40.058 --> 00:40:40.742
yes

598
00:40:41.624 --> 00:40:42.773
Didn't you go out alone?

599
00:40:42.798 --> 00:40:44.573
I don’t know if this counts as going out.

600
00:40:44.666 --> 00:40:47.129
About an hour ago, all her belongings were taken away

601
00:40:47.433 --> 00:40:49.033
The person was dragged to the owner's house

602
00:40:49.058 --> 00:40:49.823
Take it away?

603
00:40:50.224 --> 00:40:51.161
who is her master

604
00:40:51.186 --> 00:40:52.639
The master of the Da Si Jian family

605
00:40:53.391 --> 00:40:54.217
Wait

606
00:40:55.088 --> 00:40:58.022
Ji Dong also stole the warehouse of Da Si Jian's family yesterday, right?

607
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:00.842
Could it be...

608
00:41:01.354 --> 00:41:03.061
Is there smoke coming from the widow's chimney?

609
00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:03.820
Yes

610
00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:07.229
I heard that she went back to her room after cooking in the morning

611
00:41:10.438 --> 00:41:11.767
Why do you ask?

612
00:41:14.422 --> 00:41:17.822
Immediately take the dragged widow to the Robbery Hall

613
00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:28.951
Oh my god

614
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:32.648
My shoulders can finally move

615
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:36.545
How's your insomnia going lately?

616
00:41:36.691 --> 00:41:37.629
Alas

617
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.491
It seems I have to wait until I die before I can sleep.

618
00:41:42.183 --> 00:41:45.476
Master, the child is innocent

619
00:41:48.158 --> 00:41:49.511
what happened?

620
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.323
Really, look at this kid

621
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:57.964
The child seems to have gained weight

622
00:41:58.054 --> 00:42:01.201
It means his mother still has milk to feed him

623
00:42:02.933 --> 00:42:06.101
A slave who cannot pay his wages to his master

624
00:42:06.345 --> 00:42:08.192
There is still food to eat?

625
00:42:09.391 --> 00:42:11.454
These are things from the proprietor's house

626
00:42:24.872 --> 00:42:26.801
Where does this rice come from?

627
00:42:27.694 --> 00:42:31.286
That's what I took last night

628
00:42:31.932 --> 00:42:33.793
Could it be that he has a mistress?

629
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:36.308
Yes, eat it

630
00:42:37.004 --> 00:42:37.839
Eat

631
00:42:38.833 --> 00:42:40.708
Eat, eat quickly

632
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.736
I told you to eat

633
00:42:48.828 --> 00:42:51.189
Confiscate the property and let her leave cleanly

634
00:42:51.214 --> 00:42:52.745
yes obey

635
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.746
Master

636
00:43:00.796 --> 00:43:02.029
Little girl is scared

637
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:05.058
But the child and the aunt had nothing to eat.

638
00:43:05.058 --> 00:43:07.417
Recurrent jaundice

639
00:43:07.723 --> 00:43:11.292
Can you at least let them get some rice?

640
00:43:12.058 --> 00:43:16.076
My wife says you are a capable medical woman

641
00:43:16.592 --> 00:43:18.483
I thought you were a rare talent

642
00:43:21.319 --> 00:43:23.152
But you don't know how to measure

643
00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:26.642
I am a medical woman

644
00:43:26.745 --> 00:43:29.366
Those two are my patients

645
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:30.889
That's why I ask you so much

646
00:43:31.545 --> 00:43:34.678
You need to eat some food for the medicine to take effect.

647
00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:43.767
Once the animals have been used to their full potential, they die.

648
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.104
此乃天理

649
00:44:10.591 --> 00:44:11.833
Go home first

650
00:44:12.398 --> 00:44:13.986
I'll find you again tonight

651
00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:30.761
I originally planned to avoid the limelight for a while.

652
00:44:39.232 --> 00:44:41.033
Are you going to the warehouse of Da Si Jian's family?

653
00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:55.095
who is this

654
00:44:58.307 --> 00:44:59.292
don't worry

655
00:45:00.137 --> 00:45:01.276
your burial place

656
00:45:01.758 --> 00:45:02.729
Not here

657
00:45:07.244 --> 00:45:07.917
What?

658
00:45:09.428 --> 00:45:10.042
How

659
00:45:10.544 --> 00:45:11.348
You want to jump over?

660
00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:14.576
Boy?

661
00:45:16.366 --> 00:45:17.395
Just stay there

662
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.083
I want to keep a proper distance

663
00:45:21.332 --> 00:45:23.592
Maybe I saw it wrong

664
00:45:23.617 --> 00:45:24.689
what do you do

665
00:45:24.964 --> 00:45:26.658
That's the right voice

666
00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:27.958
I read that right

667
00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:28.998
Oops

668
00:45:30.124 --> 00:45:31.791
Why is the boy here?

669
00:45:33.879 --> 00:45:36.270
I already knew you were no ordinary person

670
00:45:36.899 --> 00:45:38.770
But you're weirder than I thought

671
00:45:39.296 --> 00:45:42.504
Wait, he knows I'm going to the warehouse in Da Si Jian's mansion.

672
00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:43.548
Ji Tong

673
00:45:44.624 --> 00:45:45.629
Does he know me?

674
00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:47.179
How could it be

675
00:45:47.524 --> 00:45:50.733
No, how did the boy return to normal?

676
00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:53.148
It seems that he was frightened by my cleverness in setting up the formation in advance.

677
00:45:55.858 --> 00:45:57.273
Why are you nodding?

678
00:45:57.704 --> 00:45:58.998
What went wrong

679
00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:00.786
I can't believe how I look now either

680
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:02.273
Although it’s unbelievable, it’s true

681
00:46:02.298 --> 00:46:03.773
Although it's unbelievable

682
00:46:04.192 --> 00:46:06.698
Is it because I don’t have enough faith?

683
00:46:07.604 --> 00:46:09.004
Wait then...

684
00:46:10.229 --> 00:46:12.558
I also wanted to say that he borrowed silk clothes to wear that night.

685
00:46:12.654 --> 00:46:14.592
So he is really not a slave?

686
00:46:14.824 --> 00:46:16.192
Since you are a thief

687
00:46:16.433 --> 00:46:19.001
You should know a few of the officers coming and going, right?

688
00:46:19.252 --> 00:46:20.519
Why are you so surprised?

689
00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:23.629
Become an official?

690
00:46:23.891 --> 00:46:25.724
He is a newly appointed officer

691
00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:27.386
A person who looks radiant and good-looking

692
00:46:27.591 --> 00:46:28.633
That's outrageous

693
00:46:29.192 --> 00:46:30.726
Now is not the time to be surprised

694
00:46:30.758 --> 00:46:32.326
I want to run away first, stop

695
00:46:32.591 --> 00:46:33.851
I won't chase you

696
00:46:35.007 --> 00:46:36.183
If I want to catch you

697
00:46:36.944 --> 00:46:39.264
I have been following you for a long time and found out your identity.

698
00:46:57.913 --> 00:47:00.061
You know where the criminal is, but you still don’t chase him

699
00:47:00.879 --> 00:47:02.423
If the captain of the robbers knows about it later...

700
00:47:03.923 --> 00:47:06.586
Take the widow to the robber hall immediately

701
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:07.264
Yes

702
00:47:10.645 --> 00:47:11.298
Wait

703
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:13.826
We don't have enough evidence. Why did you do that?

704
00:47:14.267 --> 00:47:16.761
a poor widow

705
00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:18.279
Where does her rice come from?

706
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:23.098
Could it be that Ji Tong gave it to her?

707
00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:26.345
Maybe the rumor that Gildong is a righteous thief is true

708
00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:29.470
What if that's the case

709
00:47:30.924 --> 00:47:32.136
How much did she steal?

710
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.395
Where will it go again?

711
00:47:50.791 --> 00:47:53.424
Yes I received it

712
00:48:03.057 --> 00:48:04.083
Also ate

713
00:48:08.753 --> 00:48:09.895
because i'm hungry

714
00:48:11.285 --> 00:48:16.023
Everyone who has been helped by Ji Dong should also do the same.

715
00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:19.039
This is something stolen

716
00:48:19.067 --> 00:48:20.464
Never be discovered

717
00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:26.367
The rumors started because of me

718
00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:28.708
In such a miserable life of mine

719
00:48:28.923 --> 00:48:30.673
This thing is like a dream

720
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.857
So I forgot Ji Dong’s instructions and didn’t keep my mouth shut.

721
00:48:34.216 --> 00:48:35.639
But I won't hurt her again

722
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.320
I filled my stomach with stolen rice

723
00:48:41.282 --> 00:48:42.423
Take me away

724
00:49:01.595 --> 00:49:03.561
You say these things

725
00:49:03.751 --> 00:49:05.954
Are they all sent by the officer responsible for investigating me?

726
00:49:07.078 --> 00:49:09.079
He said he would be very grateful to you if you accepted it.

727
00:49:14.324 --> 00:49:16.126
Your Majesty, tell me

728
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.639
"How can you accuse a widow and a child of being hungry?"

729
00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:25.967
Because I can't bear to see the widow and her children starving.

730
00:49:26.999 --> 00:49:28.714
Ji Tong who was moved by compassion

731
00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:31.111
How could I possibly accuse her?

732
00:49:36.574 --> 00:49:38.342
I can't answer you right now

733
00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:48.679
why don't you catch me

734
00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:51.979
But I won't cover up your theft because of this.

735
00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:56.345
Nor will we blame North Korea, which keeps its corrupt officials alone.

736
00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.029
But…

737
00:49:57.858 --> 00:49:58.661
But?

738
00:49:59.891 --> 00:50:03.786
You can take care of others in your own way

739
00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.895
Does he mean to tell me to continue stealing?

740
00:50:08.526 --> 00:50:09.314
Right

741
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.673
That widow has something to tell you

742
00:50:12.445 --> 00:50:13.914
Ji Tong doesn’t know why

743
00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:19.611
Always come to our door when we are hungry or sick

744
00:50:21.858 --> 00:50:23.620
among the people I know

745
00:50:24.076 --> 00:50:26.479
She is the smartest person

746
00:50:33.195 --> 00:50:35.429
It's already hard to be hungry

747
00:50:36.053 --> 00:50:38.117
He will also be beaten by his master

748
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:43.386
Why is it so difficult to live?

749
00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:47.851
Although I have been a medical woman for 5 years

750
00:50:48.283 --> 00:50:50.476
But it was only during the process of seeing a doctor that I gradually understood

751
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:55.001
A man who is hungry and suffering from illness

752
00:50:55.467 --> 00:50:58.170
The most painful place is actually the heart

753
00:51:00.289 --> 00:51:01.123
Right?

754
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.986
If your heart is hurt too much

755
00:51:06.485 --> 00:51:09.970
No matter how good the medicine is, it's useless

756
00:51:13.016 --> 00:51:14.901
No matter how precious the medicinal materials are

757
00:51:15.289 --> 00:51:17.258
I can't even touch my hurt heart

758
00:51:17.702 --> 00:51:18.895
Can't heal a wounded heart

759
00:51:20.029 --> 00:51:21.289
she said

760
00:51:22.227 --> 00:51:23.836
"Compared to expensive medicinal materials"

761
00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:26.314
"Some people just need a bowl of hot rice"

762
00:51:26.339 --> 00:51:28.273
"You can cheer up"

763
00:51:30.182 --> 00:51:31.551
I am one of them

764
00:52:00.176 --> 00:52:04.767
The bowl of rice passes through the throat

765
00:52:12.949 --> 00:52:15.983
healed my heart

766
00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:19.214
This makes me very happy

767
00:52:20.246 --> 00:52:23.814
It's enough that she comes to visit you occasionally

768
00:52:29.342 --> 00:52:30.892
She wants me to tell you

769
00:52:32.491 --> 00:52:33.551
She is very happy. Thank you very much.

770
00:52:35.624 --> 00:52:38.851
I'm pretty sure you're going to the warehouse in Da Si Jian's mansion tonight.

771
00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:41.104
All because of that widow

772
00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:43.764
If it's you she talks about

773
00:52:44.523 --> 00:52:46.917
I should take care of her again

774
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.614
The mother and son who were robbed by Da Sijian today?

775
00:52:54.691 --> 00:52:57.173
Sure enough, everything was within the range I expected.

776
00:52:58.359 --> 00:53:02.583
Please stay within my range from now on.

777
00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:08.789
within my control

778
00:53:10.975 --> 00:53:11.736
What are you doing?

779
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.623
Is he sincere?

780
00:53:15.124 --> 00:53:16.879
But if you go beyond this range

781
00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:19.811
If you touch the foundation of North Korea, I will definitely arrest you.

782
00:53:21.685 --> 00:53:22.411
Remember clearly

783
00:53:23.468 --> 00:53:27.698
Just because I don’t arrest you doesn’t mean I’ll let you go.

784
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:37.662
Isn't that Ji Tong?

785
00:53:39.496 --> 00:53:40.711
The facial features all match

786
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.686
Ji Tong is there. Ji Tong appears.

787
00:53:44.514 --> 00:53:45.442
Abominable

788
00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:49.404
Turns out it was just a little trick to delay time?

789
00:53:49.429 --> 00:53:50.142
wait a moment

790
00:53:51.926 --> 00:53:52.757
Stop

791
00:53:55.397 --> 00:53:56.195
here

792
00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:10.044
Wasn't there an order to cancel the pursuit?

793
00:54:10.071 --> 00:54:11.204
The incident occurred suddenly, and the patrolmen had already set out for inspection.

794
00:54:11.229 --> 00:54:13.783
So it seems that the message was not conveyed in time

795
00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:17.198
The arrow is replaced by cotton

796
00:54:17.894 --> 00:54:19.401
Stop pretending to be in pain. Get up quickly.

797
00:54:21.247 --> 00:54:23.976
If a pursuit is launched, adults may be in danger.

798
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.760
Protect the adults first

799
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:30.739
No movement allowed

800
00:54:37.318 --> 00:54:38.413
stop attack

801
00:54:52.742 --> 00:54:54.386
What kind of fate is this?

802
00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:58.304
Please stay within my range from now on.

803
00:54:59.241 --> 00:55:02.441
within my control

804
00:55:05.492 --> 00:55:07.101
I almost believed it

805
00:55:16.861 --> 00:55:18.370
She should have managed to escape.

806
00:56:17.885 --> 00:56:19.492
What the hell? Why is he here?

807
00:56:20.511 --> 00:56:22.458
Are you here to find Ji Tong?

808
00:56:29.027 --> 00:56:32.067
I saw the light was on... so I came in

809
00:56:33.507 --> 00:56:35.458
What should I do?

810
00:56:38.477 --> 00:56:41.536
The Human Rights Office is closed. Please come back.

811
00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:45.061
is it you

812
00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:52.773
Is that you?

813
00:56:53.714 --> 00:56:55.420
Should I run away now?

814
00:57:04.972 --> 00:57:05.711
You are right

815
00:57:13.413 --> 00:57:14.223
embroidered shoes

816
00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:16.783
Embroidered shoes?

817
00:57:18.255 --> 00:57:19.126
Rain of petals

818
00:57:20.558 --> 00:57:21.433
Rain of petals?

819
00:57:46.037 --> 00:57:46.892
Found it

820
00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:51.164
Found your flower

821
00:57:58.199 --> 00:58:02.895
(Want to hug you Loving you)

822
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.883
(I don’t want to let go for a moment)

823
00:58:07.998 --> 00:58:12.358
(Looking as dreamy as ever)

824
00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:16.580
(Even if time passes, will you stay with me?)

825
00:58:16.608 --> 00:58:21.911
(Come to me now Loving you)

826
00:58:21.973 --> 00:58:26.640
(Just take one step closer to me)

827
00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:32.436
(Every day is filled with us)

828
00:58:33.124 --> 00:58:37.191
(all seem to shine beautifully)

829
00:58:59.733 --> 00:59:00.633
what happened to your hand

830
00:59:00.658 --> 00:59:01.458
Are you injured?

831
00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:03.202
Didn't you agree to just take a look?

832
00:59:03.227 --> 00:59:05.160
I'm afraid I can't just look at this injury.

833
00:59:05.191 --> 00:59:07.355
You seem to know the Maharaja very well

834
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.055
Our relationship can be said to be very close

835
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.380
I heard he is a playboy who changes women every day

836
00:59:10.411 --> 00:59:12.111
Didn’t I tell you to donate anonymously?

837
00:59:12.136 --> 00:59:13.836
My lord, we have enough strange rumors.

838
00:59:13.861 --> 00:59:15.328
At least this should be spread widely.

839
00:59:15.358 --> 00:59:16.255
It’s not your rumor

840
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.847
First, send someone secretly to keep an eye on the Maharaja.

841
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:20.774
Who he met and where he went is all clear.

842
00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.295
He didn't even know he was injured

843
00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:23.449
Are you so slow to begin with?

844
00:59:23.624 --> 00:59:24.799
That man also knows...

845
00:59:24.899 --> 00:59:27.036
Are you going to marry a septuagenarian?

846
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.607
If that kid knew, it would be more interesting

847
00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.674
what are you doing

848
00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:32.839
seducing you

849
00:59:32.924 --> 00:59:34.142
Do you have a favorite man?
