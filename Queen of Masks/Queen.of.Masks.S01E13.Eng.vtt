00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.090
{\an8}[Junghyun] About Attorney Do Jae-i

4
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.050
{\an8}You have something to say...

5
00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.427
{\an8}[Ilgu] First

6
00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.806
{\an8}The hotel CCTV that day
The person who told me to turn it off

7
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.850
{\an8}I am

8
00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.565
{\an8}Why did you tell me to turn it off?

9
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.151
{\an8}It's a shameful thing to say, but

10
00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.528
{\an8}I have a child out of wedlock.

11
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.323
{\an8}I called that extramarital child to the hotel.

12
00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.659
{\an8}That record
This is so as not to leave anything behind.

13
00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.954
But the employee in charge

14
00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.541
You turned it on too fast, like a fool.

15
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.251
Hey, wait a minute.

16
00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:44.920
Who is that extramarital child?

17
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.380
- if…
- [Ilgu] Yes

18
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.886
[Ilgu] Right here
This is lawyer Do Jae-i.

19
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.307
That day at the hotel

20
00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.727
You were with me, right?
in my office

21
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.607
Jay, let’s not hide it anymore.

22
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.985
[Ilgu takes a deep breath]

23
00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.570
But it is

24
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:12.656
I that day

25
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.075
I think I saw something

26
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.414
Can I tell you, Jay?

27
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.627
[Ilgu] You still
Does the truth matter?

28
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.171
sometimes the truth
I could hurt you

29
00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:31.091
On the contrary, to find your truth

30
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.760
Your loved ones may get hurt

31
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.099
[Junghyun] What did you see?

32
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.767
Even if it's a suspicious person...

33
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.644
Wouldn’t it be better to tell you?

34
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.022
[Ilgu] Something that could be a clue
I have to tell you everything

35
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:50.735
Detectives quickly
Won't you find out the truth?

36
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.779
[Soaring music]

37
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.156
[Junghyun] Please tell me

38
00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.366
What did you see that day?

39
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:02.080
A little after 10 o'clock that day
I went to the hotel

40
00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:13.758
"Grand Gangbo"

41
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:18.555
[Ilgu] I just got on the elevator

42
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.224
far behind a pillar

43
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:24.519
wearing black clothes and a black hat

44
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.771
I saw a man

45
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.528
Was there an English letter N on the hat?

46
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.407
The figure hiding behind the wall is suspicious.

47
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.451
It was memorable

48
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.453
Did you see the face too?

49
00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.840
right away
As the elevator door closed

50
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.343
I haven't seen any more than that.

51
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.220
[secret music]

52
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.680
- Black clothes, black hat
- [keyboard hitting sound]

53
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.433
English initial N on hat

54
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.770
[Junghyun] Then, to Attorney Do Jae Yi.
I'll ask you again

55
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.189
Yesterday morning around 04:11

56
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.942
Attorney Jae-i Do
I went to the Grand Gangbo Hotel.

57
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.736
And it came out around 04:31.

58
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.322
Meanwhile, in the president's office

59
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.783
With Chairman Kang Il-gu
Are you sure they were together?

60
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.333
[A group of coughing]

61
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.675
[A group of people cough continuously]

62
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.225
- [Soaring music]
- [Ilgu’s hard sound]

63
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.157
[dark music]

64
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.829
- [Yuna, Yujeong] Oh my
- [Haemi’s surprised gasp]

65
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:09.582
[Sound of stretcher being dragged]

66
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.211
Jay

67
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.296
[Yuna] Jay!

68
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.468
If you follow the chairman now
Your relationship will become known.

69
00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.304
[Junghyun] Is that okay?

70
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.388
[siren sound]

71
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.107
- [Birdsong]
- [Jay] That’s right

72
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:37.193
You guys guess

73
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.909
Kangbo Group Chairman Kang Il-gu

74
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.620
He's my biological father

75
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.044
[Yuna] So, Gangbo Hotel
You were able to turn off the CCTV.

76
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.796
Because the hotel owner is your father.

77
00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.256
[absurd gasping sound]

78
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.384
That's why you hid him, right?

79
00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:05.388
Hey, you're secretly sad.

80
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.849
No, why is your father still
The term chaebol chairman

81
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:08.933
Didn't you do it to us?

82
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.394
[Haemi] Isn’t that actually a boast?

83
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.354
[Jay] I’m not bragging

84
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.273
It's a wound

85
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.901
I am that person

86
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.112
Not even for a moment
I never thought of him as my father

87
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.032
[Calm music]

88
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.121
yes you can

89
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.710
[Yuna] But
Why did that CCTV come back on?

90
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.837
Turned on?

91
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:38.922
[Haemi] No, why?

92
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.423
Since when?

93
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:41.508
don't worry

94
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.636
[Jay] I was the only one caught on that CCTV

95
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.264
And rather because of that
Yuna was cleared of the charges.

96
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.475
[Haemi sighs]

97
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.227
I'm not going into the hotel

98
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.354
Just following me
Because it was confirmed

99
00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.526
But your father…

100
00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.822
[Yoojeong] No

101
00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.990
Chairman Kang Il-gu

102
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.368
Why did you come to the police station?

103
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.329
It's obvious, I'm trying to get Jay out.

104
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.415
[Yuna] You know that person
Even if you don't think of me as your father

105
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.709
I guess he thought of you as his daughter.

106
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.295
Even 10 years ago

107
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.214
This time too

108
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.926
Anyway, Dojae
Did you realize that you have a lot of secrets?

109
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.388
you?

110
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.266
- [Meaningful music]
- Me what?

111
00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.395
[Yoojeong] My husband and Haemi?

112
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.733
Haemi is my friend
It's also very friendly

113
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.904
But
Are you saying you have a relationship with my husband?

114
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.282
According to Song Je-hyuk’s memo,

115
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.285
Song Je-hyuk said to Yoon Hae-mi:
I handed over the money

116
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.245
[Detective] That’s a lot of money too.

117
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.417
Did you really know nothing?

118
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.420
Maybe

119
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.508
the amount of money

120
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.886
Is it about 10 billion?

121
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.931
Oh, did you know?

122
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.021
Are you hiding anything from me?

123
00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:24.861
In your Mariela
Investment given to our foundation

124
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.947
Didn't you take it back?

125
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.701
[Haemi’s exasperated breathing]

126
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.329
[Haemi] What kind of thing?
Nonsense!

127
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.539
No, that guy

128
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.333
That person

129
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.251
Aren't you on drugs?

130
00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.046
I heard that drugs were found at the scene?

131
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:47.592
[Detective] Details of important money transactions
Why would you make a joke?

132
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.555
If Song Je-hyuk's autopsy results are
If there is a finding of homicide

133
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:56.309
From then on, Hae-mi Yoon
You become a suspect.

134
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:57.852
More than a sexual relationship

135
00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.730
money relationship
Because it is a strong motive for murder.

136
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.861
Hey, your husband is my Leo
Did you forget that you set it in a trap?

137
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.198
Even though I was threatened
You didn't get any money?

138
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.283
[Haemi] What are you?
Aren't you guessing wrong?

139
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.790
[Yujeong] Otherwise, I’m sorry.

140
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.254
That person is clearly
I hid the money somewhere

141
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.968
I will definitely find that money

142
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.303
Only then will we protect our fortune.

143
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.722
Ah, whatever.

144
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:38.768
Oh, I feel bad too

145
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.270
[Haemi] I have to go first

146
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.189
- [Sound of bag clanking]
- I'll go first.

147
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.440
[Jay] Haemiya

148
00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.317
Haemi!

149
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.737
What about the police?

150
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.781
-Haemi received money?
- [Sound of door opening]

151
00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.408
- [Door lock operating sound]
- [Yoojeong] Uh

152
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.368
- [Sound of door closing]
- That too in cash.

153
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.329
Would the police say something unnecessary?

154
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.499
No, still

155
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.960
Hae-mi takes that guy’s money
There's no way I can get it

156
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.920
There must be some error

157
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.090
- Gil Man-ok?
- [Yujeong’s Sigh]

158
00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:10.216
[Meaningful music]

159
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.969
If you are Gil Man-ok, are you Hae-mi’s mother?

160
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.055
[Yuna] That money

161
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.141
Haemi's mom might have gotten it

162
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.185
Haemi’s mom, is this money laundering or slush fund?

163
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.979
The big guys take care of everything.

164
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.190
[Jay] No matter what

165
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.276
I'm Hae-mi's mom.

166
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:29.777
[cell phone vibrates]

167
00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:35.450
It's my aunt

168
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.910
They said I was discharged from the hospital and coming home.

169
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.373
[Yuna] Then, for now,
Can I stay here with Nana?

170
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.834
- Then
- [Yuna’s light smile]

171
00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.005
[Jay] I have to go now too.

172
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.883
[Yoojeong] Why? You go see me too

173
00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:53.217
[Jay] Hmm

174
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.720
I have somewhere to go

175
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.810
Drinking again in the morning?

176
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:08.900
[Haemi] Mom, wake up

177
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.362
wake up

178
00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.574
- [Loudly] Oh, wake up!
- [Manok’s surprised voice]

179
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:19.535
[sigh]

180
00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.580
[Manok’s Lament]

181
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.375
[sigh]

182
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.961
I'm going crazy, you bitch.

183
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.090
- [Manok] Oh, oh, hey
- [Haemi] If you drink like this every day

184
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.217
- [Haemi] There is no way to fall
- [Man-ok’s labored breathing]

185
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.927
Ah, why on earth are you doing this?

186
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.136
I'm not even going home

187
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.099
[Manok] Because I’m scared of being alone

188
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.435
You know

189
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.480
I suffered something bad from that guy.

190
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.275
[Haemi] My mother is a godmother in the entertainment industry.
I lived 30 years

191
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.569
Is that kind of mom just doing that?

192
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.031
Because I'm afraid of something else
Isn't it like that?

193
00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.076
I received money from Song Je-hyuk.
Are you afraid of being exposed?

194
00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:01.869
[uneasy music]

195
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.706
I went to the police station

196
00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.962
Mom in my name
You got money from Song Je-hyuk, right?

197
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.380
That too in cash

198
00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.048
Ah, nonsense!

199
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.926
Why am I taking money from that guy?

200
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.886
That's a lot of money, as much as 10 billion

201
00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.183
I never said 10 billion?

202
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.566
mom

203
00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:34.861
[Haemi] No way, my mom

204
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:39.115
Did you kill Song Je-hyuk to take that money?

205
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.867
[surprised] Are you crazy?

206
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.244
[Manok] Not me

207
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.874
Boy, I'm not, really.

208
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:53.588
Oh, he just said it was an election or something.

209
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:58.217
I'm afraid my property details will be stolen.
I asked you to take care of it for a while, so I took care of it for you.

210
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.344
[Blubbering] But
Why did you get it in my name!

211
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.096
Oh, he asked for it.

212
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.556
[Manok] If I don’t vomit it up

213
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.683
I'm saying I'll take it from you.

214
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.478
[Sighing] Oh, my head.

215
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.149
- Mom, then let Yujeong give you the money.
- [Calm music]

216
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.943
Yujeong is looking for that money now.

217
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.987
Yoo-jeong took that money to the police.
If you tell me it's money you know...

218
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.405
no! That's never

219
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.998
I lost all that money

220
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.169
[Manok] Quit the fairy
You were trying to open a hotel

221
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.962
I was scammed by investment

222
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.091
mom

223
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.135
[Haemi] If I do something wrong

224
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.847
I could be a murderer

225
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.018
My mom gave it to me in my name
Because of that money!

226
00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.020
Is it okay though?

227
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.068
Just insist!

228
00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:58.903
[Man-ok] It’s money I don’t know about.

229
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.656
The guy who gave me the money died.
Where do you prove it?

230
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.117
However, if you are discovered

231
00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.122
don't get involved with me

232
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.709
If I get caught by the police, it's over.

233
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.474
[siren sound]

234
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.240
[Bodyguard] Officials and others
Access is prohibited.

235
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.827
I came here because I was wondering if you were okay.

236
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.162
At least that
Could you please let me know?

237
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.206
I can't tell you anything

238
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.291
Let's go back

239
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.542
[Sound of shoes again and again]

240
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:57.962
[Aeran] Is that you?

241
00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:04.719
[Aran’s sigh]

242
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.596
[Sound of a bag being put down]

243
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.265
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?

244
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.518
They say my lungs are hardening

245
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.981
[Aeran] A man who doesn’t even smoke
I don't know if I have some kind of disease.

246
00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:18.900
Mom too

247
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.277
[Yunhee] What do you do if you don’t smoke?

248
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.946
Father, the dirty air of this world

249
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.407
You're the type of person who drinks everything, right?

250
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.452
[Aeran] But you don’t say hello?

251
00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.622
I'm still your father's wife

252
00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.586
hello

253
00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.798
[Yoonhee] Let’s skip the greetings between us.

254
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:47.887
I want to be each other's older sister and younger brother.
There isn't any?

255
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.473
[Meaningful music]

256
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.350
[Aeran] I knew it before I got married.

257
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.603
Having a lover with a lump in your stomach

258
00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.398
Because of that lump for the rest of my life
I won't cause any trouble

259
00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.484
I promised to marry him

260
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.111
But not long ago

261
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:08.616
That guy
I found out that I broke that vow

262
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.284
motherfucker

263
00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.453
[Yunhee] 10 years ago

264
00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.873
My father is in that name

265
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.334
Creating a paper company in Hong Kong

266
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.878
You hid the money

267
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.965
As much as 300 million dollars

268
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.216
Didn't you know?

269
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.386
In my name?

270
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.555
[Excited laughter]

271
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.518
[Yoonhee] Just say a warm word to me
They didn’t do it

272
00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:39.480
That's a lot of money for you
I was stealing metallurgy.

273
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.566
[Aeran] That person is sick
Than cause and effect

274
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:47.113
Just like that
A sin that deceived us for 10 years

275
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.328
[A group of coughing]

276
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.459
[Sound of labored breathing]

277
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.504
It's up to you to take care of yourself

278
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.381
Because I don't want to do it

279
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.760
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

280
00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:11.345
[Yunhee] 300 million dollars

281
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.513
[Sound of a bag being lifted]

282
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.726
Is it enough to pay for the caregiver?

283
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:18.477
[A group of coughing]

284
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:19.979
Then please

285
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:27.194
[Sound of door closing]

286
00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.666
I have something to ask you.

287
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:45.671
Why is CCTV turned on at dawn?

288
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.924
[Jai] Until morning, definitely
You said it would be off.

289
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:56.057
You were at the hotel that day
Don't ask me what I did

290
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.311
CCTV was my mistake

291
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.397
I thought that time would be enough

292
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.609
[Ilgu] Before employees go to work
I turned it on again

293
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.572
So I went to the police station.

294
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.701
Because my mistake put you in a corner

295
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.746
[light sigh]

296
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.040
Is that why you said that?

297
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.084
Did you see a suspicious person?

298
00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.463
It's true that I saw someone

299
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.800
- [Nervous music]
- [Ilgu] But it also has this meaning

300
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.844
If you turn your gaze somewhere else

301
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.931
Because my suspicions toward you become less

302
00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.522
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

303
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.109
[Jay] Why for my alibi?
Revealing the fact that he had an extramarital affair

304
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.944
Also, what is a paper company?

305
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.404
Why are you suddenly like this?
Are you making it confusing?

306
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.616
mom and me
The one who abandoned me like a devoted partner.

307
00:17:58.494 --> 00:17:59.495
well

308
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.582
10 years ago and now
I don't care about anything else.

309
00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.000
Just you

310
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.129
I don't want you to get involved in something difficult.

311
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.675
[Ilgu] That will make your life easier

312
00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.520
[Yoojeong] Nana
I'm glad you look healthy.

313
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.732
[Yuna] Still, you shouldn’t relax

314
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.318
I don’t know when cholangitis will come again.

315
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.280
I'm sorry

316
00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:37.074
I should have taken better care of it.

317
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.370
Have you become a mother or a mother?
How long has it been

318
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:43.706
[Yuna] If there is a mistake

319
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.000
Naji

320
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.961
Giving birth to Nana in pain

321
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.589
I lost it to that guy again

322
00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:54.967
my sins are big

323
00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.347
Have you applied for a liver transplant?

324
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.433
[Yuna] Yes

325
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.936
I submitted documents to the organ transplant center.
I also took the first test.

326
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.149
Because I’m your biological mother and we have the same blood type.

327
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:11.609
There won't be any problem

328
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:15.362
[Calm music]

329
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.871
It's mom

330
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.124
[Yoojeong] Uh, uh

331
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.628
Okay, let's sleep.

332
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.797
[light laughter]

333
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:35.424
[light laughter]

334
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.058
[uneasy music]

335
00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:50.481
[Haemi] If I do something wrong
I could be a murderer

336
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.692
[Shouting] Mom
Because of the money I received in my name!

337
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:56.737
Just insist! It's money I don't know

338
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.448
Boy, the guy who gave me the money is dead.
Where do you prove it?

339
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.161
However, if you are discovered

340
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.621
don't get involved with me

341
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.583
If I get caught by the police, it's over.

342
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.461
than my daughter

343
00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.839
Are you more worried about yourself?

344
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.592
[Excited breathing]

345
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.022
[Haemi's anxious breathing]

346
00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.149
[Haemi takes a deep breath]

347
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.616
[Painful sound]

348
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.871
[Heavy breathing]

349
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.262
[Sound of door slamming]

350
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.055
[Door lock operating sound]

351
00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:09.768
[Leo] Where have you gone?

352
00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:12.938
older sister

353
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.441
- [Sound of clinking glasses]
- [Sound of pouring alcohol]

354
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.860
Why are you drinking from the floor?
leave the table

355
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.323
Why, there are times when you want to do that.

356
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.577
When you want to sit down

357
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.120
- [Sound of a bottle being set down]
- [Leo] I'm already drunk

358
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:29.204
stop drinking

359
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:38.547
Sister, listen to me.

360
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:42.301
I think Kanghu is a little strange.

361
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.927
[Meaningful music]

362
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.513
Yesterday my mother-in-law was there
I went out

363
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.808
So I went to Kanghu’s store.

364
00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:54.563
[Eunsu] Over there
When will you give me the money?

365
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.983
I want to leave Korea before I get caught and die.

366
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.860
[Kanghu] I’ll contact you when I’m ready.

367
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.196
[Leo] With someone a bit strange

368
00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:03.947
Aren't we having strange conversations?

369
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.115
[Kanghu] Go out the back door.

370
00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:09.578
[Leo] I don’t usually drink
Don't you drink a lot?

371
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.665
Something I usually do with Kanghu hyung
It looked a lot different

372
00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:17.711
[Haemi] People
It may be different from usual

373
00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:20.672
But at least

374
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:23.634
Don't go crazy

375
00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:26.512
[Leo] Are you crazy? who?

376
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:28.639
my mom

377
00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:32.351
[Leo] No, my mother-in-law is crazy.
What does that mean?

378
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:35.479
[Haemi] Usually

379
00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:38.982
If your child commits murder

380
00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:43.612
I'm trying to turn it around somehow
Aren’t parents the ones doing this?

381
00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:47.032
But my mom is the opposite.

382
00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:50.536
Even if I become a murderer

383
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.997
My mom told me not to get involved with her.

384
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:58.127
Where in the world is there a mother like this?

385
00:23:03.257 --> 00:23:05.717
No, sister, sister
You must be doing something wrong.

386
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:06.885
My sister misunderstood.

387
00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:08.804
[Crying] Leo.

388
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.683
No matter what the world says

389
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:16.895
No matter how people treat me

390
00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:20.524
Even if you whisper that I'm the daughter of a bar

391
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.278
I am my mother

392
00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:28.157
[Laughing] It felt like a strong windbreaker?

393
00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:33.662
No matter what storm comes

394
00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:36.498
I thought it would protect me

395
00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:43.547
Who should I trust now?

396
00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:51.263
It feels like the world has collapsed

397
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.309
[Haemi’s sobbing]

398
00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:04.568
[Yuna] It’s me

399
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:07.946
You don't get sick if you eat well
Let's eat quickly, okay?

400
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.785
[Nana] Where did dad go?

401
00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:16.163
I can't see my dad

402
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:24.087
Do you miss your dad?

403
00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:25.672
That's not it

404
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:30.135
I went to kindergarten
The kids said my dad was dead.

405
00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:32.387
[Nana] Now I don’t have a father

406
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:33.722
[dark music]

407
00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:36.099
Do I really have no father anymore?

408
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:42.522
[Yuna] That’s right, it’s Nana

409
00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:47.527
Now there's no me or dad

410
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.613
Dad, where did you go?

411
00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:50.989
[Nana’s surprised gasp]

412
00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.367
But it's me

413
00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:56.912
every child in the world
Not everyone has a dad

414
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.374
Still, as much as you want
I can live happily

415
00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:02.542
Besides, Nana

416
00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:05.420
I love Nana the most in the world
You have two mothers

417
00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:08.257
- Maybe you'll be happier?
- [Nana] No.

418
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.592
I don't have two mothers, I have one.

419
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.807
[Embarrassed] Oh, okay, sorry.
i made a mistake

420
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.433
It's just me and my mom

421
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.686
[Nana crying] I miss my mom

422
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:21.770
[Sound of door opening]

423
00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.606
[Sniffling] Mom!

[Nana’s footsteps]

425
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:32.197
[Yujeong is surprised] Uh, Nana, uh

426
00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.617
[Nana] That lady, go.

427
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.870
I hate that woman, huh?

428
00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:41.331
[Crying] Mom!

[Yoojeong] I just fell asleep

433
00:26:15.157 --> 00:26:18.285
Because he wanted to sleep in my bed
I just did it that way

434
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:22.539
[sigh]

435
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.082
Nana

436
00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.126
I was looking for my dad earlier.

437
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:31.089
[Yuna] The kids at the daycare center
I guess he was talking about his dad.

438
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.635
That person is dead

439
00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:37.971
Because it was on the news

440
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:42.100
[Yoojeong] I heard the parents talking

441
00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:45.520
What did the kids say to Nana?

442
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.400
So how did you respond?

443
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.239
I told you the truth

444
00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.910
It's a fact you'll find out anyway

445
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:02.746
[Yuna] But

446
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:06.041
Maybe that's why
I think I'm more obsessed with you

447
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:08.502
I'm afraid even my mom will disappear

448
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:12.089

00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:19.262
I'm still a baby

451
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.431
That's why

452
00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:23.266
Don't be too sad

453
00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:24.768
Yoo Jeong Ah

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:30.107
How do you make me feel
Jeong Gu-tae's mistress

455
00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:32.484
Do you think it's Emily Go?

456
00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.281
I
It is true that I worked at an entertainment establishment, but

457
00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:40.617
I had some pride

458
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.327
[Yuna] But

459
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.455
No sense of humiliation or shame
It didn't matter

460
00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:50.293
to see nana
If only I could come to Korea

461
00:27:51.628 --> 00:27:54.089
[Laughing] I
I would have done something worse

462
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.389
That’s how I met you, Nana.

463
00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:05.851
But I no longer
Do you think there is something to wish for?

464
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.065
I don't want anything anymore

465
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.528
Now my only wish is

466
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:19.865
Transplant my liver to Nana

467
00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.909
Making Nana healthy

468
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.162
That's one

469
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.543
So, Yoojung.

470
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:34.963
don't mind me

471
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:37.632
Rather, so that neither we nor I are anxious.

472
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.510
I wish you would take more care of me

473
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.055
That's my favor to you

474
00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:50.937
Yes, I will

Are you okay?

Let me get you some water.

It was very difficult, right?

491
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.863
If you need an alibi that day
I'll go out too

492
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.700
I was here with you that day
You can talk about it

493
00:30:28.034 --> 00:30:30.036
at that time that day
Kang-hoo wasn’t here.

[Soaring music]

495
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:35.959
To hide it

496
00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.503
Are you saying it wasn't recorded on CCTV?

497
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.176
yes, that's right

498
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.930

[Kanghu] I can’t say it now, but

501
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:56.938
There's a reason, Jay.

502
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.817
Mr. Kanghu, you came to the hotel that day.

503
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:02.527
[Jay] Why did you come to the hotel?

504
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:05.238
And why did you have to hide it?

505
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:11.661
As expected, Chairman Kang Il-gu saw me.

506
00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:20.337
[Kanghu] That day, I
I was chasing Secretary Choi.

507
00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:22.464
Secretary Choi?

508
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.384
Secretary Ki Yun-cheol?

509
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.597
Jay, I'm confused right now too.

[Kanghu] When I get my head in order

511
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.851
I'll tell you everything then

Song Je-hyuk is dead

516
00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:00.669
Does that have anything to do with Mr. Kang-hoo?

517
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.756
None, not at all

00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:08.093
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol, Angels Club
I was notified of being summoned as a witness.

706
00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:10.929
Someone blew Ki Yun-cheol

707
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:14.933
- Who?
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]

708
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:23.859
yes

709
00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:28.864
Song Je-hyuk's autopsy results came out?

710
00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:30.658
[siren sound]

711
00:48:34.787 --> 00:48:35.788
[nervous music]

712
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.916
[Junghyun] Autopsy results
I'll tell you

713
00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:45.673
To conclude,

714
00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:47.341
We are Mr. Song Je-hyuk.

715
00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.887
Drugs mixed with sleeping pills
by overdosing

716
00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.851
It was concluded that he committed suicide.

717
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.985
You mean suicide?

718
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.239
Why is that person…

719
00:49:11.865 --> 00:49:12.741
The reason is

720
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:14.827
[Camera shutter sounds repeatedly]

721
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.078
[Junghyun] The drugs I took

722
00:49:16.704 --> 00:49:19.415
Run by Mr. Song
It was confirmed that it was an ace bar

723
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:24.461
The syringe found at the scene
Only Mr. Song's fingerprints were found.

724
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.925
Also, it was covered at the time of discovery.
The bed sheets

725
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:31.468
At 8pm on the same day

726
00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:33.846
With turndown service
It was confirmed

727
00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.139
Even there, only

728
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.224
Only Mr. Song's DNA was detected.

729
00:49:38.892 --> 00:49:41.228
Evidence to suspect murder

730
00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:43.731
I couldn't find it at all

731
00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:46.400
[Haemi] Hey, but

732
00:49:47.693 --> 00:49:49.027
Just that much...

733
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:51.655
no

734
00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:53.490
How long have you been taking drugs?

735
00:49:55.576 --> 00:49:56.702
On Mr. Song's left arm,

736
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.204
There were two injection marks.

737
00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:01.290
[Junghyun] With a time difference

738
00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:03.167
The drug was administered twice
I see it

739
00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.254
Mr. Song
A person who sells drugs

740
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.340
That kind of person
There's no way you don't know the lethal dose.

741
00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:13.802
I will take you with me

742
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.846
The reason I am telling you these results is

743
00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:18.891
Due to unreasonable investigation

744
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.686
I apologize for making you uncomfortable.
To apologize

745
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:26.440
Then

746
00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:29.485
This incident
I'll end it like this

747
00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:32.863
Goodbye, welcome back

748
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:43.665
[siren sound]

749
00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.798
[Yoojeong] It’s probably suicide, right?

750
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.052
It's a result I couldn't have imagined.

751
00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:59.389
I heard you got stabbed twice with a needle.
We only got stabbed once

752
00:51:01.683 --> 00:51:04.686
[Haemi] Still, that guy
I guess he knew it was embarrassing

753
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.273
Maybe I was a coward

754
00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.443
[Yuna] Everything
Because it looks obvious

755
00:51:14.112 --> 00:51:15.906
Are you going to set up a funeral?

756
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.119
The whole world is criticizing him

757
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:25.249
At the nursery
Because I did such dirty things

758
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:29.878
There will be no funeral, just cremation.

759
00:51:29.962 --> 00:51:32.756
Yeah, just burn it.
Well, he was a good husband.

760
00:51:34.716 --> 00:51:35.968
[Haemi] But it’s over now

761
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.391
But that white sheet
Why did you turn it over?

762
00:51:43.141 --> 00:51:44.560
[Meaningful music]

763
00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:46.812
[Jay] It’s strange
A person who dies

764
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:49.815
Have you been thinking about that this whole time?

765
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.364
Isn’t it like a mask?

766
00:51:58.323 --> 00:52:00.158
Because I want to hide my hideous appearance

767
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:06.331
He did it all
You throw it away so easily?

768
00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:12.129
Even if I wear a mask, somehow
I'm a guy who tried to live

769
00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:16.550
I know how you feel right now

770
00:52:17.843 --> 00:52:19.011
It must be uncomfortable

771
00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:21.138
Maybe we all are like that

772
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.352
Our goal is that guy too
It was about dying by someone's hand.

773
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.438
[Haemi] Then it’s over.

774
00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:31.732
Just have fun, Jay.

775
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:35.068
The revenge you’ve been dreaming of for 10 years

776
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.529
It's finally over

777
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:25.243
[Calm music]

778
00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:41.802
[light sigh]

779
00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:50.477
[Sound of falling when touched]

780
00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:00.112
[Sound of falling when touched]

781
00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:03.699
[Sound of falling when touched]

782
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:12.290
[mask rustling sound]

783
00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:14.876
[mask rustling sound]

784
00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:24.469
[Sound of a post-it note being taken off]

785
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:27.264
[Sound of a post-it note being taken off]

786
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:40.587
[light sigh]

787
00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:52.265
[sigh]

788
00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:01.233
[Grass bug crying]

789
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:06.363
[Yoojeong] Everyone is busy.
I'm sorry for asking you to come.

790
00:56:07.155 --> 00:56:10.075
It's a bit hard to call only men.

791
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:11.910
What do we need?

792
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.413
[Yuna] Order a company
Song Je-hyuk took care of all his luggage.

793
00:56:15.664 --> 00:56:18.250
Ah, what a burden.
Does it keep coming?

794
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:22.295
I'm sorry, but please take care of that.
I piled it up in the study.

795
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:25.465
[Haemi] It’s Leo
Just throw it all in the trash can

796
00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:26.925
[Leo] Yes!

797
00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:28.260
Let's go, bro.

798
00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.477
[Jay] Is there anything we can help you with?

799
00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:40.981
It's okay

800
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.734
After all the baggage is gone
You will feel much relieved

801
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.528
Why do you feel like that?

802
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:51.825
[Yujeong] Just, I was packing up my luggage.

803
00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:54.244
That's what I thought

804
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:59.249
'The men I meet
'Why is everything like that?'

805
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.751
[heavy music]

806
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.254
Don't blame yourself

807
00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.173
You didn't do this alone.

808
00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:08.592
[Yuna] We all suffered.

809
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.013
[Jay sighs] Yes

810
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.474
- Now just think about the child.
- [Sound of clinking dishes]

811
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:21.938
[Yoojeong] It’s okay

812
00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:24.566
[Leo] Ah

813
00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:26.776
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Haemi] Good job

814
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.279
- [Leo] Oh
-Thanks to you, it was easy.

815
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:30.739
thank you

816
00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.824
[Kanghu] In the future too
Please call me if you need anything.

817
00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:36.953
[Leo] Ah, I have better strength, bro.
I'm young

818
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:38.205
- [Kanghu’s light smile]
- It's up to me to do the hard work.

[Yujeong and Leo’s laughter]

820
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.834
[Yujeong] Ah, after dinner,
It's good

821
00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:45.212
- Uh, I have some appointments.
- [Sound of bag clanking]

822
00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:47.422
I'm going on a date with Leo too.

823
00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:50.550
[Leo] Huh? Really? What happened?

824
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.137
- [Haemi’s light laughter]
- [Yoojeong] That's it, let's go, guys.

825
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:55.222
[Haemi] Then I’ll go first.

826
00:57:56.097 --> 00:57:57.516

00:58:09.361 --> 00:58:12.447
Could you please take care of this?

834
00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:15.534
What is this?

[Yoojeong] The prayer ceremony was held in the hotel room.
These are bad things

838
00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:25.544
I went to the grave to pray

839
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.587
I brought it back

840
00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:30.006
I didn't open it though

841
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:33.176
I kept it just in case.

842
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:38.723
Now I want to get rid of it completely.

843
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:42.102
I'll handle it.

Let's have dinner together, at my house.

You don't eat at home

I'm going to try it now

852
00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:28.189
I cleaned up all the dirty things in the house.

853
00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:31.776
Then

854
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:34.446
Let's go grocery shopping

855
00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:37.907

I want to eat at home

I have to sleep before I can touch it

865
01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.484
Because I can’t even touch you

866

867
01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:07.205

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.810
[Door lock release sound]

882
01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:14.898
[Sound of door closing]

883
01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.733
[door lock sound]

884
01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.885
[Sound of paper rustling]

885
01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:47.305
[sigh]

886
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.307
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Leo] Sister, I washed everything.

887
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.391
Sister’s turn…

888
01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:52.393
what?

889
01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:04.739
[Haemi] Where is the party going today?

890
01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.450
I'll go there now

891
01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.746
[cell phone vibrates]

892
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:22.674
[Cell phone end sound]

893
01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.079
[Jay’s cool breathing]

894
01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.249
[Kanghu] No
That's how I've been shopping

895
01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.667
Is it ramen again?

896
01:03:58.918 --> 01:03:59.919
[Jay's sigh]

897
01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:01.588
[Jay] I’m going to start with ramen

898
01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.673
Next time pasta

899
01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.968
Um, tteokbokki, steak.

900
01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.179
I'm going to cook everything at home.

901
01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:11.723
everything

902
01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.934
[Sighing] Yeah

903
01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:17.186
This must not have been home all this time.

904
01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.898
I can't even get over the food...

905
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:36.080
[Kanghu] What are you thinking?

906
01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:40.793
[Jay’s light sigh]

907
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.295
[Jay] Mr. Kanghu

908
01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:44.964
I

909
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.385
The words I hate to hear the most in the world
Do you know what it was?

910
01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:55.391
'Someday a good day will come'

911
01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.979
Right now, the future is just one inch away.

912
01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:04.776
For the day that might come
It's about living.

913
01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.362
like hope torture

914
01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.199
But

915
01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:13.993
now

916
01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:16.496
To have that hope

917
01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.290
[Calm music]

918
01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:21.459
It's still so vague

919
01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:23.753
It hasn't disappeared

920
01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.384
For some reason, I feel empty

921
01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.636
lingering doubts

922
01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:34.389
still

923
01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.017
It's not a nice sunny day

924
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.524
I want to live too

925
01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.068
At least once

926
01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:49.904
not me in hell

927
01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.201
me on a good day

928
01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.417
Now please

929
01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.461
Isn't it okay to be happy?

930
01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:08.673
me too

931
01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.634
Dojaeido

932
01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.580
[Crying] Thank you

933
01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:47.391
[Yoojeong] The prayer ceremony was held in the hotel room.
These are bad things

934
01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:49.352
now

935
01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.021
I want to get rid of it completely

936
01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:54.565
[Sound of a glass being set down]

937
01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:11.457
[sigh]

938
01:10:11.832 --> 01:10:12.959
[Kanghu] Crazy bastard

939
01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.425
[Meaningful music]

940
01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:31.644
[Memory card recognition sound]

941
01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:34.689
[Sound of clattering down]

942
01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.235
[Mouse click sound]

943
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.787
[Dosik’s painful sounds in the video]

944
01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:51.289
[Dosik’s moans in the video]

945
01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.417
The person who killed the prayer ceremony

946
01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:56.919
Wasn’t it Song Je-hyuk?

947
01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.713
[Jehyuk’s labored breathing in the video]

948
01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:00.131
Then who?

949
01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:02.300
[Jehyuk in the video] Are you here?

950
01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:04.385
[Man in the video] There was no reply

951
01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.054
I thought something happened

952
01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:10.141
- But how do you get things done?
- [Schematic in the video] Dad…

953
01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:11.559
[Kanghu] This voice…

954
01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:12.643
[Diagram in the video is having a hard time] Dad

955
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.437
- [Man in video] Tough guy
- [Soaring music]

956
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.022
- [Sound of stabbing with a knife in video]
- [Dosik’s moans in the video]

957
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.035
- [Sound of stabbing with a knife]
- [Ilgu’s strong breathing]

958
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.244
[Ilgu’s powerful spirit]

959
01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.628
[secret music]

960
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.696
[Sim-ok] Just now
The kid who got out of hell

961
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.739
[Kanghu] Are you here?

962
01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.533
[Sim-ok] Back to hell
There's no need to push it.

963
01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:11.285
[Kanghu] A

964
01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.162
- Don't do it, I'll do it.
- [Jay’s laughter]

965
01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:14.246
in the end

966
01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:17.124
[Kanghu] Say nothing to Jae-yi
I'm telling you not to do it.

967
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.169
Could it be that Chairman Kang Il-gu

968
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:21.670
{\an8}What if he is a dangerous person?

969
01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:22.963
{\an8}[Sim-ok] I have to cut it off.

970
01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.299
{\an8}[Secretary Choi] Choi Kang-hoo is correct.

971
01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:27.551
{\an8}The guy you saw in the parking lot that day.

972
01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.428
{\an8}I put this on my car
I followed you

973
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.056
{\an8}[Ilgu] That guy
Why did you chase me?

974
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.643
{\an8}[Kanghu] So,
The big man that Secretary Choi worked for

975
01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.186
{\an8}He was actually the head of the Angels Club?

976
01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.898
{\an8}[Ilgu] It’s shameless
I'm sorry, Jay.

977
01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:43.275
{\an8}The days I have left are

978
01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.069
{\an8}I will live for Jae-yi.

979
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:48.239
{\an8}From now on, I'm going to pay for that sin.

980
01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:51.367
{\an8}[Kanghu] Why come now?
Do you need a father?

981
01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.703
{\an8}[Ilgu] Choi Kang-hoo, that guy
I think I know something

982
01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.247
{\an8}I will prepare it for you.

983
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.208
{\an8}[Jay] This evening
Would you like to come to my house?

984
01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.254
{\an8}[Kanghu] Jaya

985
01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:06.882
{\an8}The two of us will have dinner together.
