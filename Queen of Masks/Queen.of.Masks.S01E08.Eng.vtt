[uneasy music]

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.548
{\an8}[Jehyuk] That’s not him.

3
00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.885
{\an8}He said he was giving that alcohol to Yoo Yoo-na.

4
00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:11.720
{\an8}[Schematic] No, did I know?

5
00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.847
{\an8} The unique thing that comes is not coming.
A strange kid came

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.182
{\an8}You know how to drink that drink

7
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.434
{\an8}So

8
00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.563
{\an8}Are you going to do this to her and not Go Yoo-na?

9
00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:24.274
{\an8}[Schematic] Are you crazy? He's a lawyer

10
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.526
{\an8}It’s completely different from a girl like Go Yoo-na.

11
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.033
{\an8}I’m rather embarrassed
I might not be able to talk somewhere.

12
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.035
{\an8}Is that so?

13
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:37.913
{\an8}[Schematic] Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know

14
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.248
{\an8} Ah, the girls came one by one
Because of bullying

15
00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:41.958
I feel like my head is going to explode, really.

16
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.670
I just go in and take a nap
I'll come out and think about it.

17
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.756
You're watching carefully
Okay?

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.707
- [Jehyuk speaks in a difficult voice] Me
- [Schematic] What should I really do?

37
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.167
[Schematic] What should I do?

38
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.668
[in a difficult voice] Me

39
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.796
I need to stop the bleeding, give me a towel

40
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.215
[Sigh] Okay, let’s do it this way.

41
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.843
You secretly gave me medicine

42
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.345
[Scheme] While I was sleeping
You drugged that girl.

43
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.306
And you're a bitch
I did it to rape you.

45
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.975
[Scheme] I’m not guilty of anything

46
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.978
people of course
I'm going to believe this

47
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.939
Because you're a human bastard

48
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.567
Because I am still the son of a member of the National Assembly

49
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.485
[Rough breathing] You

50
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.113

[Jay] Move anywhere

Where did you keep that?

Why are you curious about that?

85
00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.290
I gave you that mask.

86
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.583
You have the right to know that much

[sigh]

88
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.092

What is the situation now?

123
00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:18.141
why isn't leo here
Is Jehyuk there?

124
00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.311
I asked President Jeong

125
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.856
[Jehyuk] Secretly with Haemi
Because I have a story to share

126
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.774
Please make some space for me.

127
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.069

No, with my wife's friend
in the hotel room

130
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.163
What should we say in secret, just the two of us?

131

- [Dark Music]
- [Jehyuk] Please

132
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.045
- Dojae's card
- [Manok] Well

133
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.838
I still

134
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.092
You become the mayor of Tongju.
I'm not sure

135
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:54.719
Mr. Haemi

136
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.180
Hanok hotels are also across the water.

137
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:58.973
[Jehyuk] Are you having a hard time these days?

138
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.602
That's right

139
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.313
If you go across the water to the Hanok hotel

140
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.691
Donated to Youngun by our hotel
I need to return 10 billion won too.

141
00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.485
Without even giving it back

142
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.321
I know you're in a lot of trouble.

143
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.783
[Jehyuk] But our Yujeong

144
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.534
Please don't be too fussy

145
00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:23.206
Trust me and give me a little more time

146
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.959
I somehow
We'll solve it

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.295
[light laughter]

148
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.090
Well, Mr. Jehyuk.
I know you're a good husband

149
00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.676
My nose has grown three years too

150
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.104
Ah

[Jehyuk] Haemi’s stress

152
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.363
I wonder if this will help

153
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.282
Actually, when I have a hard time

154
00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:00.284
It's a place I stop by sometimes.

155
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.372
Because confidentiality is clearly guaranteed

156
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.541
You can believe it

157
00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.798
Well then, let’s go.

158
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.594
Haemi and me
When we leave the hotel together

159
00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:20.388
Because it looks strange

160
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.397
[Sound of door opening]

161
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.482

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.865
[Jay] If you go?

169
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.637
[Employee] Everyone, you can do well, right?

170
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.764
[Children] Yes

[Yuna] Mister

172
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:55.191
I had a car accident back then
My name is Lee Yeon-ah.

173
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.528
Could you please talk to me?

174
00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:04.867
[knock knock sound]

175
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.744
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Director] Can I come in?

176
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:10.873
what?

177
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.833
You're not even ready yet?

178
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.877
I don't even need to get dressed... [sigh]

Yeonya

180
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.381
Angels have come

181
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.176
[Awkward laughter] Let’s get out now.

182
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.972
Yeah, come out when you're ready

183
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.101
[Sound of door slamming]

184
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.352

[uneasy music]

186
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.085
A mask is a ticket?

187
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.714
What the hell are you writing that
What are you doing inside?

188
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.072
[Haemi’s trembling breathing]

[Door lock operating sound]

195
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.107
[Leo] Sister, I’m here

196
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.902
Sister?

197
00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.324
Baby, leave all the lights on
Where have you gone?

198
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.914
[sigh]

199
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.126
[Doorbell sounds]

[Meaningful music]

201
00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:40.606
Come a little early

202
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.067
Then you must have seen something interesting.

203
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.736
I came because I wanted to check something.

204
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.989
Why do you need that mask?

205
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.576
[Jay] Did you turn it on again?

206
00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.495
Toward Song Je-hyuk?

207
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:57.873
Ki Yun-cheol comforted me.

208
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.795
[Yuna] If you give it to me
They say they'll release me from wanted

209
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.255
[Jay] Ki Yun-cheol?

210
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.799
Why does Ki Yun-cheol need that mask?

211
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.843
He said he needed a leash.

212
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.638
[Yuna] The leash that will tie Song Je-hyuk’s neck

213
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:14.890
[sigh]

214
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:19.478
So much so that I have to turn my neck
A conflict broke out between the two?

215
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.105
But

216
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.275
Do you want to discuss it with me?
Have you tried it?

217
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.901
[Yuna] You were the one who betrayed me first

218
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:27.695
[Yuna’s laughter]

219
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.488

220
00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:30.573
me

221
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.701
I saw you with Yujeong.

222
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.286
[laughter]

223
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:37.204
It was tearful, that friendship

224
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.040
[laughter]

225
00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.708
You don't trust me

226
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.462
The mask is at Kanghu's restaurant.
Just lie

227
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:47.339
So, are you taking Kang-hoo to a hotel?

228
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.675
I think you are so childish
Have you tried it?

229
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.635
[Yuna] I know, it’s childish.

230
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.681
But just for a little while
I wanted you to feel it

231
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.018
Having something precious taken away
how do you feel

232
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.440
How painful

233
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.192
Are you miserable?

234
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.989
[Crying] How hard is it?

235
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.241
Is it heartbreaking?

236
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.630
[Jay] I’m sorry

237
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.049
I

238
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.259
Even if it's because of your daughter

239
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.970
I should have moved quickly

240
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:44.021
I'm sorry too

241
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.566
[Yuna] It’s not your fault

242
00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:50.402
[sigh]

243
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.488
But because of Nana

244
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.824
I feel like my heart is racing too much

245
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.620
[Sigh] Yoo Yoo-na

246
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.289
i need you

247
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:04.875
[Jay] The true nature of that guy

248
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.002
Anyone who knows exactly
There's only you

249
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.423
[breathing sound]

250
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.008
Well, actually

251
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.262
I need you too

252
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.934
I'm scared

253
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.981
Nana again
I'm afraid I won't be able to see it

254
00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.527
[secret music]

255
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.696
[Jay] Yoo Yoo-na

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:39.994
It's Yuna

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.329

258
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.540
Let’s trust each other now

259
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.751
Let's do our best

260
00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.129
Huh?

261
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.006
You can do that, right?

262
00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:01.265
Well, I…

263
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.518
[rustling sound]

264
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:08.230
I'm free now

265
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.983
[Yuna] Ki Yun-cheol
They released me from my wanted list.

266
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:12.735
[Yuna’s light smile]

267
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.404
I am also more active now
I'll stab him

268
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.740
Shady or sunny

269
00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.992
Don't hide anywhere

270
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.122
[Light laughter] Indeed

271
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:27.750
But you

272
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.336
How can you not ask until the end?

273
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.214
Aren’t you curious about Kang-hoo and me?

274
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:34.340
[laughter]

275
00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:36.926

276
00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:38.969
[Light laughter] No way

277
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.931
Well, what happened?

278
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.350
[Interesting music]

279
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:46.769
[Yuna in a strained voice] Mr. Kang-hoo

280
00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:48.270
I feel like throwing up

281
00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:50.522
[Sigh] I’m sorry.

282
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:54.568
In the ice storage room at the end of the stairs
Can you get me some ice?

283
00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.370
Then rest

284
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.455
Mr. Kanghu

285
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.959

[Jehyuk] What are you thinking like that?

289
00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.244
Oh no, why?

290
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.625
There's a magazine shoot in the afternoon.
You didn't forget, right?

291
00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.210
Please prepare well.

292

[Jehyuk] And Nana

293
00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.384
What can I say about the clothes I wore last time?
Does it look too princess-like?

294
00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.011
Although it's a girl

295
00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.930
A healthy and courageous concept
I think it's good

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.599
[dark music]

297
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:14.815
[Yoojeong] I can’t help it

298
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.193
Even exposing Nana to the election is a bit...

299
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.656
Nana can be stressed.

300
00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.452
Dojae doesn't have it.

Oh, do I have to leave right away?

303
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.253
[Jehyuk] Yes
I decided to meet the party leader.

304
00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:39.340
That's right, you called yesterday, right? I'm sorry

305
00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.009
Coming in at dawn
I couldn't even talk

306
00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:46.138
But why?

307
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:48.265
What do you have to say?

308
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.980
[Sigh] No.

309
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.067
I'll tell you when I'm more certain.

310
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:00.527

Sister, what's wrong?

327
00:22:58.335 --> 00:22:59.962
Oh, why are you doing that?

[surprised gasp]

330
00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.222

331
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.391
[Shouting] Did you do it again?

332
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:37.583

[Leo] Sister

Come to your senses!

- [Dark Music]

341
00:24:01.023 --> 00:24:02.733
Who and what happened?

342
00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.241
Leo, we

343
00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.954
Let's stop now

344
00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.167
What?

345
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:23.629
Anyway, customers and hosts

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.388
I'm still dragging it on too much, I

349
00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.725
I know you're not in your right mind right now.

350
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.728
My sister and I are the customers and hosts.

351
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:41.688
- How can you say that?
- [Haemi] It's not a drug.

352

- Please get out of my sight.
- [Leo’s sobbing breathing]

362
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:12.135
- [Shouting] Please go!
- [Leo] Sister!

363
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:13.595
[Haemi’s trembling breathing]

364
00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:15.931
[Leo] Sister

365
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:18.767
- [shaking breathing]
- Are you crazy?

366
00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.396
[In a tearful voice] Go

367
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.275
Please do me a favor, okay?

368
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.486
[Haemi] Please go

369
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.530
I no longer care about you

370
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:35.867
It's so ugly
I don't want to be seen

371
00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:39.329
[Sobbing]

372
00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:42.332
Oh, please go!

373
00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.635
[Sobbing]

374
00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.098
[shaking breathing]

375
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:03.687
[Leo] Even if I leave, even if I leave

376
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.939
Let me just say one thing.

377
00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.235
I'm sorry

378
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.611
[Crying sound]

379
00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:13.322
- [Sad music]
- [Sniffling sound]

380
00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:17.326
He said he would help me stop taking my sister’s medication.
Because I couldn't keep my promise

381
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.579
[Crying breathing]

382
00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:22.914
Call me if you need me, anytime

383
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:25.792
I'll wait

384
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:34.301
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Sobbing]

385
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:36.845
[Jay] Chareo

386
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.933
According to this Ace Bar internal data:

387
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:44.728
The general manager is Haemi’s husband, right?

388
00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.438
Not President Jeong

389
00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.025
Mr. Leo is like Ace.
I'm sure it's related

390
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.862
[camera shutter sound]

391
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.825
But suddenly like this
Are you the general manager?

392
00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:02.496
If there is a problem

393
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.207
Trying to put all the blame on Mr. Leo
It seems like a trick

394
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.626
Ace Bado

395
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.087
Because it's in his hands.

396
00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:13.799
By the way, lawyer

397
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.802
[Yongpil] Announced today
Have you seen the poll?

398
00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:19.596
For the first time, his approval rating

399
00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:21.640
I passed the lawyer.

400
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:27.187
A few days ago, at an event for Rep. Ki Yun-cheol,
That guy's interview

401
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.439
It seems to have gained favor with voters.

402
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.818
At this moment, between Ki Yun-cheol and that guy.

403
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:34.778
I think we need to separate it clearly.

404
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:39.491
Where Rep. Ki Yun-cheol goes
Please take a look

405
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.214
[heavy music]

406
00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.487
[Jehyuk] Do Jae Yi’s ledger

407
00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:20.615
What I exchange with this photo is
What do you think?

408
00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:47.476
[Jehyuk] Do Jae-i

409
00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:51.021
Following Ko Yoo-na and Joo Yu-jeong

410
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:55.567
There's only one left, Mr. Hae-mi.

411
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.242
Then

412
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:06.244
That… [shaking breathing]

413
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.789
[Rough breathing]

414
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.333
[Director] Didn’t you say that last time?

415
00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:15.170
When the angels came
Besides the badge I gave you

416
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:18.465
If you have something else on your body
Is it okay or not?

417
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:19.966
[Children] No.

418
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.760
[Director] That’s right, no.

419
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:23.637
Besides the badge I gave you

420
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.224
absolutely nothing on the body
You can't keep it

421
00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:28.767
- Okay?
- [Children] Yes

422
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.770
[Director] Okay, princesses, go in.

423
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:32.896
Ah, Yeji.

424
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:36.691
What's that on your clothes?

425
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.529
[dark music]

426
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.367
[cell phone vibrates]

427
00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.541
[Director laughing] Ah, yes

428
00:29:57.045 --> 00:29:58.630
Now, this time the princes

429
00:29:58.713 --> 00:30:00.048
Haemi, what's going on?

430
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.800
[Haemi] To me
After sending something like this, what?

431
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.219
What's going on?

432
00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.346
Was that your purpose?

433
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:09.307
Are you going to take Jay’s pride from me?

434
00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:11.101
Ah, this is sad.

435
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.395
I'm everything
I did that for Hae-mi.

436
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:15.856
To a drug addict

437
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.567
As much as giving medicine
Are you saying there is no healing?

438
00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:20.819
Does Yujeong know?

439
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.488
Are you this kind of person?

440
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:27.242
Mr. Haemi, Mr. Haemi
That he is that kind of person

441
00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.493
There are more people who don't know

442
00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:32.455
[Jehyuk] What, Mariela Hotel Chairman?

443
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.583
Or Hae-mi's mother

444
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:36.877
What?

445
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.045
[Light laughter] So

446
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:42.716
soon
Dojae, please give me the ledger.

447
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.012
Otherwise
Can't be cured even with medicine

448
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:50.307
tremendous stress
Because I'll be waiting

449
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.892
- [Soaring music]
- [Call end sound]

450
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:53.101
Hey, Song Jehyuk!

451
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.937
[Shouting] Hey, you bastard!

452
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:57.981
[shaking breathing]

453
00:30:58.064 --> 00:30:59.065
[Sound of cell phone closing]

454
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.943
[Anxious breathing]

455
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.361
[Sound of putting down cell phone]

456
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.157
[Anxious moaning]

457
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.909
[Doorbell sounds]

458
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.827
Leonie?

459
00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:15.457
- [doorbell sound]
- [urgent breathing]

460
00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:33.433
[Door lock operating sound]

461
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.897
[Yujeong] But what about Leo?

462
00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:42.525
Leo, do you ring the bell?

463
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:46.488
[Haemi] What’s going on? Without any contact

464
00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:50.951
[Yoojeong] I have a surprise for you.
I went to the hotel

465
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:52.243
I heard you paid monthly rent

466
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.621
So I came straight home

467
00:31:56.998 --> 00:31:58.333
Do you have any more surprises for me?

468
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.752
More than this?

469
00:32:02.128 --> 00:32:03.338
What's wrong with you?

470
00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:06.758
Are you with Leo…?

471
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.095
Leo left home

472
00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.222
[Haemi] No, I kicked him out.

473
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:16.017
No, how long did we fight?
Are you kicking me out of the house?

474
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.149
You're in a bad mood
It's a bit hard to say this, but

475
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:27.988
I'm with you Leo
You stopped me when I said I was getting married.

476
00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:32.033
[Yoojeong] A person who does that kind of thing
It's a little hard to believe

477
00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.119
[heavy music]

478
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.203
Who does that?

479
00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:38.331
[Haemi] What about Jehyuk?

480
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:40.750
your husband
How trustworthy is he?

481
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.586
They say there's a saying like that in gambling circles.

482
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.673
‘What the hell is going on in this gambling room?
'Who is Hogu?'

483
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:48.717
seeker

484
00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:52.595
They say that person is a bigot.

485
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.765
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

486
00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:58.810
[Shouting] You are the brat!

487
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:02.897
[Haemi] He is very
I know you're noble and smart, but

488
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:06.109
In fact, I am the most foolish and deceived.

489
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.361
[Screaming] Fool!

490
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:09.654
idiot!

491
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:11.322
Hogu!

492
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:14.492
[shaking breathing]

493
00:33:15.452 --> 00:33:17.871
Hey, Yoon Hae-mi

494
00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:19.914
[Yoojeong] Are you crazy?

495
00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:24.335
Yoo Jeong Ah

496
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.175
about your husband
I won't say a word

497
00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:34.929
That's what I can do for you

498
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.141
It's my last consideration

499
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.813
goodbye

500
00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:50.487
[panicked breathing]

501
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.338
[light sigh]

502
00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:23.728
[Kanghu] Jay

503
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:39.619
Come in, come in

504
00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:42.205
Why are you hanging out in front of the door?

505
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:47.919
[Jay] I’m not hungry
I ate sundae soup

506
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.297
[Kanghu] But just eat a little bit

507
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:57.929
That's right

508
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:00.390
You contacted me yesterday, right?

509
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:04.227
But I was crazy yesterday

510
00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:05.770
Because of Yuna

511
00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:08.189
Yuna?

512
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:10.191
[Kanghu] Yuna came yesterday

513
00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.027
He asked me to buy some medicine for a moment.

514
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.364
What to drink in the meantime
Did you drink that much?

515
00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:18.950
I walked you to the hotel.

516
00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:21.995
- [Calm music]
- [Response]

517
00:35:25.748 --> 00:35:27.917
That's it, aren't you curious?

518
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:33.506
No, well, some drunk woman.
I could take you there

519
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.012
[breathing sound]

520
00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.556
Is the soup a bit bland?

521
00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:45.268
Add ribs and chicken stock.

522
00:35:45.351 --> 00:35:47.187
[Kanghu] Today
I didn’t add ramen soup.

523
00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:51.983
No, in ramen
If you don’t add ramen soup

524
00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:53.693
[Jay] Is that ramen?

525
00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:57.572
Somehow it tastes delicious
I said it was falling a bit.

526
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.533
[Kanghu] At least think about yourself like that

527
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:01.993
Ramen every day...

528
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:03.536
[breath mixed with laughter]

529
00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.455
Thank you for taking care of me

530
00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:15.048
[Screaming] Jay

531
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:17.800
I actually

532
00:36:17.884 --> 00:36:19.385
[Leo speaks in a drunken voice] Kanghu hyung

533
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.013
Brother, are you in there?

534
00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:26.184
- [Dark Music]
- Huh? Oh, you were here.

535
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.518
[Leo's laughter]

536
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.941
I was kicked out

537
00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:36.361
[Leo] But I have nowhere to go.

538
00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:39.447
Marry Haemi's older sister

What I don't say about you
They say it's consideration for me.

Oh, well, it's not even a secret

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.672
Is there anyone without a past?

You mean something like that?

574

Are you hiding anything from me?

00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:12.908
This is Hae-mi’s reply.

719
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:24.628
[Yoojeong] What reply?

720
00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:28.674
[Jehyuk] Oh, I guess it’s starting.
Let's go and sit down.

721
00:49:29.842 --> 00:49:30.968
yes

722
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.317

723

- [Jay] Everyone
- [Camera shutter sound]

724
00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:06.462
Just today, I am not a mayoral candidate.

725
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.797
I want to greet you like this.

726
00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.091
hello

727
00:50:11.383 --> 00:50:13.218
This is lawyer Do Jae-i.

[applause]

729
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.353
Today I will meet you all
The reason I brought you here

730
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:26.732
Victim of sexual crime
It's for women.

731
00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:29.151

Let’s watch the video letter together.

- [Woman 1 in video] 5 years ago

735
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:40.078
While experiencing dating violence
I almost died

736
00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:42.998
Thanks to the lawyer
I was able to live a new life

737
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:46.668
You are my lifesaver.

738
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:47.961
I love you

739
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:51.048
[Woman 2 in the video] The lawyer
Thank you for helping me learn nail care

740
00:50:51.507 --> 00:50:53.425
I gained the will to live

741
00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.512
I will never forget that grace
thank you

742
00:50:56.595 --> 00:50:58.931

for more victims
please work

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.185
I will support you

[applause]

746
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:14.029
Probably other than these people

747
00:51:14.112 --> 00:51:17.074
Many people who do not have the courage
I think you are there

748
00:51:17.157 --> 00:51:19.201
[camera shutter sound]

749
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:21.411
[Jay sighs] So

750
00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:24.498
Today I am like these people

751
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.500
I guess I'll try to be brave

752
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.505

753
00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:32.714
fact

754
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:35.133
I am also a victim of sexual assault.

[People are upset]

756
00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:48.564
[Jay] The reason I couldn’t reveal it until now

757
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:50.732
10 years ago

758
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.818
no one

759
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.904
take my word for it
Because it wasn't

760
00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.617
But now
I think it will be different

761
00:52:01.159 --> 00:52:04.329
To reveal the truth of that day

762
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:06.540
We have gathered a lot of evidence

763
00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:11.503
From now on, the criminal who raped me

764
00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.046
I'm about to reveal it

765
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.507
[mumbling sound]

766
00:52:18.176 --> 00:52:20.512

[People's surprised exclamations]

768
00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:30.898
This is it

769

[Soaring music]

770
00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:40.282
10 years ago, the man wearing that mask

771
00:52:40.365 --> 00:52:42.743
He raped me.

772
00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:43.827
and

773
00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:46.079
I want to know the identity of the man behind that mask.

774

Isn’t that your son?

- [Painful elasticity]
- The person who committed sexual assault

Are you Rep. Ki Yun-cheol’s son?

786
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:36.129
Then maybe the three of you

787
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:38.090
Mr. Ki Do-sik’s murder case and
Is there a connection?

I'm trying to find out

[Yuna’s light sigh]

804
00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.298
[Yuna] Did you do one thing?

805
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:47.094
The internet is already there
It's all over the place with stories about Jay's event.

806

Did you come to say thank you?

807
00:55:51.723 --> 00:55:52.849
If you watch the video

808
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:54.976
At least you don't seem like a criminal, right?

809
00:55:55.477 --> 00:55:56.812
[Jehyuk] Looks like one of the three

810
00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:00.273
Thank you for your effort

811
00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:02.025
What should I do?

812
00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:03.610
It was in vain

813
00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.781
[Yuna] I’m going to crush you

814
00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:10.075
Your ex-wife

815
00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:13.120
If your ex-wife is a murderer then

816
00:56:13.578 --> 00:56:15.205
Your image will also be ruined.

817
00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.083
[snort]

818
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.377
I think you are completely mistaken.

819
00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.964
You married Jake.
Not Song Je-hyuk

[Yuna] Like that
I thought you would stick out your flippers

[nervous music]

824
00:56:36.935 --> 00:56:38.270
Do you know what this is?

825
00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:42.441
Me and my genes
evidence that matches

826
00:56:43.942 --> 00:56:45.068
As long as I have Nana

827
00:56:45.444 --> 00:56:47.195
you can't escape from me

828
00:56:50.449 --> 00:56:52.033
So give me Nana

829
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.871
And take off that disgusting mask
Take the punishment!

830
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:01.501
That would both be difficult, right?

831
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:05.797
[Jehyuk] Nana is already in the election
I can't do it because it's too exposed.

832
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:10.886
That disgusting mask
I already took it off

833

I am Song Je-hyuk to my core.

834
00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:17.392
I'll give you just one day to sort it out

835
00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:19.603
[Yuna] When time passes

836
00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.316
you are at the bottom again
I'm going back to Jake.

[Haemi speaks in a weak voice] This is
What's going on?

840
00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.717
What on earth is this...

841
00:57:52.928 --> 00:57:54.721
[Yoojeong] How could a video like that...

842
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.558
[Haemi] No, come now
Who on earth…

843
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:00.769
[Haemi’s trembling breathing]

844
00:58:02.687 --> 00:58:03.730
[Yoojeong] No way

845
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:07.651
Yuna?

846
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.030
[Yuna] That video

847
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.116
Do you think I played it?

848
00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:27.045
Are you doubting me again?

849
00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:29.839
Can’t you tell even after watching the video?

850
00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:32.133
I wasn't there

851
00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.177
that day

852
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.721
It was you who went to that room.

853
00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.851
And yet I went to jail

854
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.230
Even after coming out, I had to run away to America.

855
00:58:47.816 --> 00:58:49.234
how unfair I would be

856
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.444
Can you even imagine?

857
00:58:57.242 --> 00:58:58.410
[Jay] 10 years ago

858
00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.497
I'm really sorry for not believing you.

859
00:59:02.706 --> 00:59:04.958
But we were fooled too

860
00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:07.544
You know now

861
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:12.090
yes

862
00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.801
You guys were fooled too

863
00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:18.805
[Jay] We

864
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:21.141
Let's not dwell on the past

865
00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:22.767
What's important is

866
00:59:23.184 --> 00:59:25.228
We're still in hell

867
00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:27.230
Because of him

868
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:29.441
Wait a minute

869
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:35.280
Yes, Yuna is the culprit.
I know it wasn't

870
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.408
So who on earth is the culprit?

871
00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:41.411
[Yoojeong] Jay

872
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:46.374
Because of him we are still
Are you in hell?

873
00:59:47.667 --> 00:59:48.918
Who is that guy?

874
00:59:50.462 --> 00:59:51.921
[heavy music]

875
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.221
I'll tell you

876
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.852
The guy that Jay was talking about is

877
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.230
It's Song Jehyuk

878
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.274
[Yuna] Your husband

879
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.610
What?

880
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.112
- [Haemi’s surprised gasp]
- [Yuna] Jay today

881
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:17.947
The reason for organizing this event
That's it

882
01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.327
The guy who sexually assaulted Jay
The guy who killed Gido-sik is also Song Je-hyuk

883
01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:26.289
To reveal that it's him

884
01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.959
Did you turn?

885
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.336
[Haemi] Just…

886
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.590
Yoojung, very true.
I don't think it's impossible

887
01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:38.259
No, when I think about it

888
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.220
Yuna might be right.

889
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.056
Haemi, why are you doing this too?

890
01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:45.934
[Shouting] Your husband threatened me!

891
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.144
[Haemi] Ask for Jay’s ledger

892
01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:51.773
Such a scary man, your husband.

893
01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:53.942
That kind of person

894
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:55.944
Couldn't he have committed murder?

895
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.070
Yoon Hae-mi!

896
01:00:58.697 --> 01:00:59.906
[Yoojeong] You really
