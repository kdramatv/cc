{\an8}How could this happen...

8
00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.858
{\an8}You must cut it off

Uh, Mr. Kang-hoo.

13
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.880
Are you sure you can’t come later in the evening?

14
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.132
No, I'll go.

this room

34
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.275
It's not unfamiliar

35
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.776
[Ilgu] It’s my hotel.

36
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:33.945
Could it be unfamiliar?

37
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.074
Each room
There's no place I haven't looked into

38
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.454
I thought I was going to tell Jay.

39
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.914
Haven't you tried it?

40
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.417
If you were going to do it to Jay
You wouldn't have come looking for me

41
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.547
It's scary and shameless
You exceeded my expectations.

42
00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.009
[Kanghu] Still, it’s Jae-yi’s birth father.

43
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:57.719
I'm here to give you a chance

44
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.473
How about embroidering?

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.975
embroidery? About what?

46
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:08.104
You must provide evidence
Are you going to admit it?

47
00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.774
There's evidence?

48
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.692
[Tense sound effect]

49
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.615
That tough guy

50
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.953
How did you cruelly kill me?

51
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.580
Can you confirm?

52
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:27.249
[nervous music]

[sudden sound]

58
00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.601
Now
Are you thinking about turning yourself in?

59
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.318
Because you know everything.

60
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.028
I'll be honest

61
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:03.451
Was it wrong to kill Gido-shik?

62
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.414
That guy was worth dying for.

63
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.833
Then with that knife
They should have killed Song Je-hyuk.

64
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.502
What did that guy do to Jay?

65
00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.713
So you killed me, Song Je-hyuk.

66
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.009
That's enough
Aren’t you acting like a father?

67
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.971
If you killed Song Je-hyuk

68
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.724
[Kanghu] That’s
It probably wasn't for Jay.

69
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.143
Ki Yun-cheol is also your work.

70
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.271
The Angels Club you created
Because it was revealed

71
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.528
As you said

72
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.949
I sacrificed my daughter to my ambition.

73
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.617
What a heartless father.

74
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.663
[Ilgu] But as time goes by

75
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:53.668
I also know how important blood is.
I felt it painfully

76
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.962
So

77
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.923

When trying to kill

78
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.091
I saved you

79
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.136
And you saw it too

80
00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:06.097
How much does Jay care for me?

81
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.433
If you just shut up

82
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.520
Jay is
I can win Abby's love

83
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.064

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.900

It's always true

10 years ago, no, even now

88
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.870
My father should have known that much.

89
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.956
Are you really going to punish me?

90
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.297
I understand

This is my last request

You must keep that promise.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.746
[Kanghu] Otherwise

It looks like it's sitting on the street

187
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:16.235
Do I go out to play?

188
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.489
Even lying and saying it hurts

[Awesome breathing sound]

190
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.495

[Leo] Sister
Have you met Haemi’s sister?

194
00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.972
I don't know if this is what we met

195
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:47.183
I saw Haemi.

196
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:48.935
in front of the club

197
00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:50.603
[Leo] I have to catch Haemi.
Quickly

198
00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.147
Why are you doing this?

199
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:54.857
I already went in

[Moving] Today is special
There's no party, so what's going on?

201
00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.742
Not a party

202
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.578
I want to buy it separately

203
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.163
[Haemi] What should I do?

204
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.124
Because it's a party, the guests bring it.

205
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.126
I'm just condoning it.

Not officially handled

207
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.714
[Laughs] Who will officially appease me?

208
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.885
I ask for it informally.

209
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.891
Very good one

210
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.352
I'll pay you a high price

211
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.862
You know the Angels Club, right?

212
00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:46.534
[Moving] Before that happens
The director there secretly left it behind.

213
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:47.827
There is one medicine

214
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:55.751
Special A grade

215
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:06.137
What is it?

216

- [Leo] Mr...

219
00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.732
[Moving] What is it?
Stealing other people's customers, huh?

220
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.234
- I'm your sister's husband?
- [Moving] Husband?

221
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.404

Is it a pillar room?

Are you waiting for Choi Kang-hoo?

254
00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.608
The guy who makes women wait

255
00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:27.737
He's not a very trustworthy guy.

257
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.538

Talk carelessly
I wish you wouldn't do it

263

Okay, but when is he coming?

I'm dying, Mr.

[Secretary Choi] What you found
That video from 10 years ago

292
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:26.790
Don't you say anything?

293
00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.800

Apparently Mr. Kang-hoo

307
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.515
I don't think he'll come today

308
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.311

Hey there

328
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:21.757
I guess you should go to the hospital
I think it'll be good, the blood...

329
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.720
[Kanghu] I’m sorry, but
Please go to the place I'm talking about

330
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:28.889
I need to do you a favor.

331
00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:46.573
[Ilgu] I had a good meal.

332
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:51.161
[Jay] I heard you enjoyed it
That's a relief

333
00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:55.499
If you’ve eaten it all
Can I ask you something?

334
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:03.006
I met Rep. Ki Yun-cheol yesterday.
What did you talk about?

335
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:05.467
I told you

336
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.346
I reported it to the prosecution
I came to argue with you

337
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:13.892
- When leaving the hospital room, Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
- [Meaningful music]

338
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:16.311
He had a mesmerized expression.

[Jay] A little
It seemed like I was shocked.

340
00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.318
[light sigh]

341
00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:27.364
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you would care.

342
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.368
Actually, Ki Yun-cheol told me yesterday

343
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:33.078
I had a favor to ask

344
00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:34.913
[Ilgu] I refused that

345
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:36.373
What is that?

346
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.500
As you guess

347
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.671
I think it was Song Je-hyuk and Ki Yun-cheol’s doing.

348
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.926
[Ilgu] The guy he trusted
They found out something and threatened me.

349
00:23:48.302 --> 00:23:49.970
You asked me to help you

350
00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:51.805
i refused

351
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:56.143
at the angels club
I was even caught guilty of murder

352

Who is that person?

354
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.818
-Are you Secretary Choi?

Song Je-hyuk's older sister
sent to a drug party

[Leo] Then
I broke down because of my mother-in-law.

424
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:13.543
Because of Haemi’s mother?

425
00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:15.629
My mother-in-law received money from Song Je-hyuk.

That's Hae-mi's sister.
I already know

I think I'm disappointed in my mother-in-law.

What if I charge Haemi?

Oh, are you cowardly hitting me from behind?

00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:23.111
[sniffling sound]

540
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:00.857
[Haemi] Is it already the third day?

541
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:05.695
Jay, at home
They say it's sitting like a living corpse

542
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:09.323
[sigh]

543
00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:11.284
I'm going to die like this too

544
00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:13.411
What do you think of your sister?

545
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:15.413
us

546
00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:18.040
Shouldn’t I go see it?

547
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:21.586
Leave it alone

548
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:23.880
You probably need some alone time

549
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:26.966
[Yuna] Let’s just wait

550
00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:29.969
rather than that

551
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.847
Isn’t there a funeral for Mr. Kang-hoo?

552
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.517
According to what I heard from Yongpil,
An autopsy was conducted on Kang-hoo’s body.

553
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.061
until the results come out
My parents said they would postpone it.

554
00:40:41.564 --> 00:40:43.691
The gambler who killed Kang-hoo

555
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.110
[Haemi] I saw the news
I heard it went to China.

556
00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:48.488
Then what the hell is Mr. Kang-hoo?
Why did something like that happen?

557
00:40:48.571 --> 00:40:49.697
Isn't it something we will never know?

558
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.288
Are you okay?

559
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:00.500
what?

560
00:41:01.834 --> 00:41:03.753
You’re not feeling well either.

561
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.424
Where does it hurt?

562
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.635
[screaming loudly]

563
00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:12.178
It'll get better now

564
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:14.263
[Haemi] I need to get better

565
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:17.934
Otherwise, our Leo will have a hard time

566
00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.019
[heavy music]

567
00:41:23.773 --> 00:41:26.776
What about you? Is the foundation okay?

568
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:34.575
Yuna's older sister

569
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:36.744
When will Nana have surgery?

570
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:40.957
[light sigh]

571
00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:46.629
[Leo's sigh]

572
00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.130
[Grass bug crying]

573
00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:50.967
[Haemi yells] Mom, are you crazy?

574
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:55.137
In a dirty place like Angel's Club
Why are you involved, why?

575
00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:59.684
You have a nice hotel
I told you to build it, why?

576
00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:01.060
[Sound of intake of breath]

577
00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.520
So what are you going to do now?

578
00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.606
[Haemi] The members there
They were getting caught one by one.

579
00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.526
If someone blows my mom
What are you trying to do?

580
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:10.444
Why did you commit such a big sin?

581
00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:13.614
Mom just connected me to members.

582
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:17.326
In a den of crime
Connecting people is also a crime!

583
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:21.455
[Meaningful music]

584
00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:23.541
mom

585
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:25.668
Mom, do you have that?

586
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:29.672
Why, people from the political and business world
Fraudulent policies for managing money laundering slush funds

587
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:31.716
[Haemi] Let’s use that.

588
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.884
Just hand it over to them.

589
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.095
Save the mother and pay Yujeong back.

590
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.597
That's not possible

591
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.724
-Why?
- [Manok] That's

592
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:41.809
I'm risking my life to maintain the grand vision.

593
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:43.686
[Man-ok] Are you giving up your life for that small thing?

594
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.354
I'd rather go to jail

595
00:42:46.188 --> 00:42:47.273
Then just go to jail

596
00:42:48.608 --> 00:42:50.276
Instead, Yoo-jeong pays back the money!

597
00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:52.069
This is really...

598
00:42:52.778 --> 00:42:55.114
Isn’t that money that you don’t have to repay?

599
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:57.283
mom

600
00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.035
[shaking breathing]

601
00:42:59.118 --> 00:43:01.871
[Crying] Mom
It's really hard for me!

602
00:43:05.207 --> 00:43:08.002
I keep doing bad things!

603
00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:17.219
[Manok] Haemiya

604
00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:21.140
Mom too

605
00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:24.101
It hurts so much to see my daughter ruined.

606
00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:28.272
But please understand mom too.

607
00:43:29.982 --> 00:43:31.067
mom's whole life

608
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:34.403
I'm going to have a great time with you
I looked and lived

609
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.947
If you pass that shame book

610
00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:41.577
You too, this presidential election is over, it's over.

611
00:43:46.082 --> 00:43:47.083
[frustrated sigh]

612
00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:49.335

[cell phone vibrates]

615
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:10.648
Hello

616
00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:15.569
Chairman Kang Il-gu?

617
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:17.655
[Meaningful music]

618
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:26.580
[Man] These days, if you get involved with Youngwoon,
Rather, it is a minus.

619
00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:28.290
In the same situation now

620
00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:30.251
Who is in Yeongwoon?
Would you like to invest?

621
00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:32.962
until things calm down a bit.

622
00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:36.298
Whether investment or sponsorship
It seems difficult to attract

623
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:38.259
[sigh]

624
00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:45.724
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]
- [Sigh]

625
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.985
Yes, I am Joo Yoo-jeong.

626
00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:00.990
Yes?

627
00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:04.869
Are you Jay’s father?

628
00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:21.594
[Broker] Who called?

629
00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:29.768
Yes, because of the organs.

630
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.813
You said it was the liver of a 4-year-old girl, right?

631
00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:35.441
How many employees did we have?

632
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.443
They say it’s 100 million?

633
00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:38.569
Uh, no, no.

634
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:40.488
This, this

635
00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.406
300 million?

636
00:45:43.616 --> 00:45:45.117
Why is it suddenly jumping 3 times?

637
00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:47.870
Your daughter RH-

638
00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:51.415
That's because I'm looking for a target.
I have to work on it.

639
00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.252
If it's work...

640
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:01.884
Who are you talking about killing?

641
00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:03.219
So what should we do?

642
00:46:03.802 --> 00:46:06.013
Among the things we have
There is no such thing

643
00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.349
[Awesome breathing sound]

644
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.811

[sniffling sound]

650
00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:47.888
yes

651
00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:55.896
Chairman Kang Il-gu?

652
00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:20.421
- [Sound of banging door]
- [Yongpil] Lawyer, lawyer!

653
00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:24.300
Attorney, are you inside?

654
00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:27.595
Lawyer

[Jay’s light sigh]

658
00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.982
[Jay] Just leave me alone.

659
00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:43.694
[Yongpil] I must give it to you
That's because there are words

660
00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:50.409
In fact, before Choi Kang-hoo died,
came to visit me

661
00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:53.329
[nervous music]

662
00:47:53.662 --> 00:47:55.831
[Kanghu] I’ve been looking after you for a long time, Mr.
I watched

663
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.208
thankfully

664
00:47:58.459 --> 00:48:00.961
For our Jay
You worked sincerely.

665
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.922
So I'd like to ask you a favor.

666
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.674
sweet

667
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:07.551
What I will say from now on is

668
00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:10.095
It's definitely a secret from Jay.

669
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:12.681
To the lawyer?

670
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:16.393
That's a bit difficult

671
00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.812
[Yongpil] I am a lawyer.

672
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:20.773
That's it

673
00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:25.069
no matter what happens
The person who will become Jae’s person

674
00:48:25.152 --> 00:48:27.738
Because it’s the office manager.
This is what I'm asking you to do.

675
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:31.241
Can you do me a favor?

676
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:33.869
Okay, tell me.

677
00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:38.832
Just in case

678
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:41.293
If something happens to me

679
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.673
Ask Jay to look at my cloud.
Please tell me

00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:05.317
Only Jay knows that

685
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:09.488
Jay is the first
Because I need to check

686
00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:13.200
[Sound of paper rustling]

687
00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:16.078
[Yongpil] But

688
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:18.914
To Choi Kang-hoo
What happens?

689
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:20.791
That's

690
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.877
I don't know yet either

691
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:26.922
This is just in case.

692
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:30.968
I'm still not sure what it is

693
00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.804
I will do that

694
00:49:34.888 --> 00:49:35.889
thank you

[Sound of paper rustling]

696
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:47.943
Kang-hoo gave you this?

697
00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:49.361
[Yongpil] Yes

698
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:51.947
I don't believe it either
I didn't give you my password

699
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.908
Do you know what a lawyer is?

[Jai] ‘A date that should not be missed’

701
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:01.999
I don't know

702
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:03.876
I don't know either.

703
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:05.377
and

704
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.552
[Yongpil] Found in Choi Kang-hoo’s car
It's 500 million won

705
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.555
The police confirmed Choi Kang-hoo's death.

706
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.891
I think it has something to do with this money.
I think I'm watching

707
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:23.061
Why did Mr. Kang-hoo spend that kind of money?

[sigh]

I don't know what the hell is

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:32.196
Maybe

711
00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:34.823
This money is not from a person named Myung-soo.

712
00:50:35.616 --> 00:50:37.826
Choi Kang-hoo and Mr. Cloud
Isn’t it related?

I said you need to check.

717
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:54.092
Be sure to check it out

[Jay] But
What were you trying to make?

731
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.964
The chicken stock you used to put in ramen

732
00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.800
[Jay] But what ingredients?
So many?

733
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:17.968
- [Sad music]
- [Kanghu] This is

734
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:19.386
Do you know that it is usually sincerity?

735
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.389
Instead, since it is homemade, you have to eat it quickly.

later with this
Let’s eat a lot of delicious food

[Kanghu] Oh, it’s okay.
Oh, I'm hurt, now, now, now

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.973
Maybe if you hear this

763
00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.642
What happened to me?

764
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:33.645
But I'll be careful so that doesn't happen.

765
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:37.399
Anyway, this is
It's just in case

00:54:40.485 --> 00:54:43.530
[Kanghu in the video] I am now
I'm going to a person named Myeongsu.

767

To describe that person

768
00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:49.453
I have to go back to that day 10 years ago

769
00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:54.916

[Surprise] You guys…

775
00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:46.009
[Ilgu] Go Yoo-na too
Please sit over there.

776
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:02.692
late at night
To a place where I don’t have any good memories.

777
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:04.653
I'm sorry for making you come.

778
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.741
[Haemi] I’m sorry
Why did you call me here?

779
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:16.706
I, by any chance

780
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:20.335
[Yoojeong] I’m worried about Jae-yi
Did you call us?

781
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.711
no

782
00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:25.924
I have something to say to you three.
We have invited you

783
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.052
[Ilgu] By chance

784
00:56:29.594 --> 00:56:32.472
The three of you are very
That I'm in a difficult situation

I can't pretend not to know

787

- [Uneasy music]
- I would like to help you.

788
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.737
First, Go Yoo-na.

789
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:50.699

Even if I search the whole world

I'll save you

Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong

My parents passed away
From the time of operation

797
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:27.569
I gave help to the Youngwoon Foundation.
Did you know?

798
00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:31.114
yes you heard

799
00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:34.117
Thank you for your support

800
00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:36.077
thank you

801
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:41.416
The Youngwoon Foundation is ruined.
I don't want it either

802
00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:46.713
The Youngwoon Foundation
I will protect you

803
00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:52.260
Really?

804
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:56.598
Is your mother having a hard time these days?

805
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:00.435
[surprised] Do you know my mother?

806
00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:03.730
So that nothing bad happens to your mother.

807
00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.732
I will try my best

808
00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:08.193
Really?

809
00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:11.947
[in an embarrassed voice] Ah
I'm so thankful

810
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.992
Why are we suddenly...

811
00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:18.954
[Ilgu] Instead, there is a condition.

812
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.420
My relationship with Jay

813
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:30.048

819
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.956
[Haemi] So
As a condition of helping us

820
00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.749
Are you telling me to cut off ties with Jay?

821
00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:06.251
Why does it have to be like that?

822
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:09.421
[Yoojeong] That’s how Jae’s life turned out

823
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:11.464
They say it's because of us

824
00:59:16.011 --> 00:59:17.137
[Yuna] But why do I

825
00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:20.557
What Chairman Kang Il-gu says
Not for Jay

826
00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:22.976
Does it sound like you have other intentions?

827
00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:26.313
I was a little cold too

828
00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.982
No, that happened to Kang-hoo too.

829
00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:30.692
Tell us to stay next to Jay

830
00:59:30.775 --> 00:59:31.651
Isn’t that how it should be?

831
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.403
But...

832
00:59:37.198 --> 00:59:38.199
So

833
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:41.244
Aren’t you going to get Jay’s father’s help?

834
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:43.622
[dark music]

835
00:59:46.374 --> 00:59:49.252
They say they will help you only if you cut off Jae-yi.

836
00:59:49.628 --> 00:59:51.838
[Sighing] I'm going crazy

837
00:59:53.465 --> 00:59:54.924
I'm a little desperate right now

838
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.801
me too

839
00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:58.511
Me too

840
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.267
[Yuna] What should we do?

841
01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:36.966
[Kanghu in the video] You are Kang Il-gu
about that person

842
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.259
no matter what choice you make

843
01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.679
The choice is yours

844
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.223
And I made that choice

845
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:44.891
I'll respect you

846

I posted it to Secretary Choi.

Until the location tracker was discovered

852
01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.257
We analyzed Secretary Choi's movements.

And besides Kang Il-gu’s house,

An officetel in Daegok-dong
I went often

855
01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:27.517
I found out that Secretary Choi was
It was a place I rented directly.

856

- [Meaningful music]
-What is it for?

857
01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:31.479

- [Safe door lock operating sound]
- what we are looking for

863
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.138
There might be treasures...

864
01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.350
- Let’s start by cleaning up that officetel.
- [Yongpil] Yes

865
01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:12.604
But it doesn't have to be like this
Do you want to do it?

866
01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.272
[Yongpil] There is also solid evidence.

867
01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.567
[Jay] That person, Kang Il-gu

868
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:21.821
From the political world, the prosecution, and the police.
There is no place where the line doesn't touch.

869
01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.948
No matter what power you use

870
01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.784
So that it never escapes

871
01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.577
Take everything away

872
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.163
I will trample you thoroughly.

873
01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:33.708
The office manager will take charge of Secretary Choi.

874
01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.961
I will take care of Kang Il-gu’s family.

875
01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.380
- Kang Il-gu’s family?
- [Jay] Yes

876
01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:43.259
Kang Il-gu is like my family
I killed Mr. Kanghu.

877
01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.471
[Jay] Me too
We need to cut off Kang Il-gu’s family first.

878
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.225
That person has a family

879
01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:52.310
Because it will save you money.

[Jay] No

884
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.994
No reservation required
I'm going to my private room.

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:47.407
Do you have any proof?

898
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.201
It's in my name in Hong Kong
Money buried in a shell company

899
01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.954
It's all at the Angel's Club
It came out

900
01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.499
[Jay] Report it to the National Tax Service
If you track your money

901
01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.334
Everything is revealed

902
01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.962
who took my name
Even if it was stolen

903
01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:03.631
What do you want?

904
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.675
[Ae-ran] Kangbo Group shares?

905
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.803
[Laughing] No
Can you put me on the family register?

906
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:09.888
Get a divorce

907
01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.557
[Jay] Then, what about Angels Club?

908
01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:16.519
It's not the group's corruption
It will be Kang Il-gu’s personal corruption.

909
01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.068
[Ilgu] Divorce?

910
01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:29.198
I worked like a servant all my life.

911
01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.034
Are you going to throw me out now?

912
01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:33.494
Do you think I'll just be silent?

913
01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:37.165
I didn't send a lawyer
The reason I came here in person

914
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.960
[Ae-ran] Even telling the lawyer
It's because something embarrassing happened.

915
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.671
You know what that is, right?

916
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:46.299
Let's solve it quietly

917
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.760
Review the documents carefully

918
01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:50.595
Contact a lawyer

919
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:51.971
Then

920
01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:54.599
[Sound of door opening]

921
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:55.683
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

922
01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.809
[Sound of door closing]

923
01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:58.603
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

924
01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.606
[Sound of door opening]

925
01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.359
[Sound of door closing]

926
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.778
[Secretary Choi] Madam
What's going on here...

927
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:10.573
[Puzzled] Write
Did Jay move something?

928
01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.201
[Ilgu] We need to move quickly too

929
01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:14.786
What about Jay’s friends?

930
01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:16.412
[The person in charge urgently] Chairman

931
01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:19.540
From Kangbo Group to our foundation
Willing to sponsor 10 billion won

932
01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:20.500
The contract has arrived

933
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:23.878
This is all you need for urgent money
I think I can stop it

934
01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:31.636
[breathing in relief]

935
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:34.514
[Hospital Staff] Song Nana Child

936
01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:38.559
A relative who came from the United States
Are you registered at a transplant center?

937
01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:40.186
The examination will begin soon.

938
01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:43.147
[breathing in relief]

939
01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.736
[Manok] Angels Club
I got a call from members

940
01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.323
mom's name
He promised not to say it out loud.

941
01:05:52.407 --> 01:05:53.324
[breath mixed with laughter]

942
01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:05.503
[Sound of grass bugs]

943
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.631
[Yuna] Here

944
01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:10.925
Where are you?

945
01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.094
Come this way.

946
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.568
[Ilgu] Please sit down.

947
01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:49.839
Construction hasn't started yet
It's empty

948
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.007
Please understand

949
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.139
I would like to say thank you

950
01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.476
[Yuna] At the transplant center
I got a phone call.

951
01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:06.272
I also told the Angels Club members

952
01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:08.691
Mom promised not to get involved
I received it

953
01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:13.488
[Yoojeong] I received a sponsorship agreement

954
01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:15.573
thank you

955
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.451

thank you

957
01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:20.912
Everyone too

958
01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.915
A promise to cut off Jae-yi.

959
01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:25.833
You must keep it

960
01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:33.091
Then you and I

961
01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:35.551
I think we are on the same side

962
01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.845
We have prepared another gift for you

963
01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.013
Let's open it.

964
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.223
[Meaningful music]

965
01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.485
[Sound of a bag being opened]

966
01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:54.278
[Soaring music]

967
01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:10.628
This is

968
01:08:12.296 --> 01:08:13.131
What is it?

969
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:16.092
A new secret club to be built here

970
01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:17.760
It's a new mask

971
01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:27.520
Maybe

972
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.398
[Yuna] Chairman

973
01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:32.733
Angels Club...

974
01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:36.404
I created the Angels Club
It's a person

975
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.783
[Ilgu] I’m like that
I created a secret club

976
01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.326
I'm not ashamed

977
01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.038
Only 1% of people who run the world

978
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.584
extreme tension and
Under pressure

979
01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:53.713
Sometimes I wear that mask
Taking my breath away

980
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.298
Is this wrong?

981
01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.507
So

982
01:08:57.383 --> 01:09:00.845
[Yuna] We too
Join that new club?

983
01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:02.638
no

984
01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:04.807
I, everyone

985
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.476
new club

986
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:11.731
I want you to be queen

[Ilgu] Go Yoo-na

988
01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.071
The charm that attracts people
You are a person full of energy.

989
01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.658
With that charm
Gather the members

990
01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.245
Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong

991
01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.498
Put the club's profits into the foundation

992
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.417
Please launder money

993
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.632
Mr. Haemi Yoon
With the ability to run a hotel

994
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:39.717
Please manage the club

995
01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.512
When three people come together

996
01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.725
Best in Korea
You can create secret clubs

997
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.395
Then all the money and power in Korea

998
01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.314
You will hold it

999
01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.067
What do you think of my suggestion?

1000
01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.741
What if we decline the offer?

1001
01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:05.493
Sorry but

1002
01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.746
The gift I gave you will be taken back.

1003
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.959
[Ilgu] Me and
It would be difficult to be on the same side.

1004
01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:16.754
What would you like to do?

1005
01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.257
my gift

1006
01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:21.467
Would you like to receive it?

1007
01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:40.528
[cell phone vibrates]

1008
01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.580
[Ilgu] We
Shouldn't we meet once?

1009
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.167
[secret music]

1010
01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:26.699
[Doorbell sounds]

1011
01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.582
Are you here?

1012
01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.888
How did you…

1013
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.432
[Ilgu] Now these people

1014
01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:53.225
not your friends

1015
01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.645
They are my guests.

1016
01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:13.746
That person now

1017
01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:15.706
What does it mean?

1018
01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.466
[Shouting] I'm asking you what you mean!

1019
01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:40.648
[Heavy sound effect]

1020
01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.484
[Yoojeong] We

1021
01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.320
Can I do well?

1022
01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:48.989
You can't do it

1023
01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:50.533
To survive

1024
01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.910
Let's think that we wear masks too.

1025
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.037
Mask of Betrayal

1026
01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.586
[secret music]

1027
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.279
[Ilgu] A new secret club to be created

1028
01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.488
It's a new mask

1029
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:33.075
You too can gain strength with that mask

1030
01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.953
[Jay] I will never back down

1031
01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:39.081
[Secretary Choi] I guess Do Jae Yi
Looks like he's recruiting friends

1032
01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:40.958
{\an8}- [Ilgu] Jae-i?
- [Secretary Choi] In the end

1033
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.626
{\an8}[Secretary Choi] It’s all in one piece.
It means

1034
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.212
{\an8}[Haemi] I will give you the ledger of Jay’s money laundering.

1035
01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.798
{\an8}You can trust us with that much, right?

1036
01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.175
{\an8}[Ilgu] To increase strength

1037
01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.219
{\an8}The strongest person
You have to believe it

1038
01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:55.139
{\an8}[Jay] I’ll try it on, that mask.

1039
01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:56.432
{\an8}[Ilgu] Are you serious?

1040
01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:59.310
{\an8}[Jai] Even in the new club
Thank you very much

1041
01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.812
{\an8}Let's try together

1042
01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.355
{\an8}Father

1043
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:04.440
{\an8}Yes

1044
01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.025
{\an8}[Ilgu] Come join me

1045
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.568
{\an8}Thank you for trusting me, Jay

1046
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:08.736
{\an8}[Yongpil] Here it is

1047
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.070
{\an8}[Jay] What should I do?

1048
01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:13.240
{\an8}You killed Kang-hoo.

1049
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.659
{\an8}I will never forgive you

1050
01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:18.704
{\an8}[Siren sound]

1051
01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.247
{\an8}[Jay] More than the pain Kanghu suffered

1052
01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:23.209
{\an8}More terrible pain will follow

1053
01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:25.586
goodbye
