Are you sure you solved it?

I went

184
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.957
I did go, but

185
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.545
I didn't do anything, really.

186

Calm down

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.054
[Jay] It’s still for us
nothing happened

189
00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.223
The problem now is

190
00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:48.726
We went to the hotel last night
Someone knows

191
00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.109
But

192
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.903
I think I know who that is

193
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.582
[Secretary Choi] Yes?

194
00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:14.669

195
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:16.671
Okay

[Secretary Choi] Song Je-hyeok

199
00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:26.681
He died this morning

200
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.433
What? really?

201
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.565

[Yuncheol’s laughter]

203
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:43.364
Hey, this good news

204
00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.199
- To whom first...
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]

205

[Yuncheol’s laughter]

206
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:54.417
Hey, you called me at the right time, huh?

[Yuncheol’s laughter]

208
00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.795
Song Jehyuk is that guy

209
00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.423
Did you hear the news that it was released?

210
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.508
[Yuncheol’s laughter]

211
00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.887
[Yuncheol] So I just told Do-byeon
I was just about to call you.

212
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.805
Why? [snort]

213
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.473
Because of the photo?

214
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.058
[Yuncheol] A photo?

215
00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:12.518
No, what picture?

216
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.353
[Jay] All you had to do was touch me

217
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.898
Why did you do that to my friends?

218
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.150
[Yuncheol laughs] Oh

219
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.110
Well, if I did that

220
00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:22.904
There must be a reason for everything

221
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.742
Do Byeon from the Angels club roster

222
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.953
The promise to exclude me

223
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.541
To see if they are kept well
I need insurance too

224
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:37.960
Do whatever you want.

225
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.714
[Jay] With that photo
Because it's not a threat to me.

[Haemi] Is this what Rep. Ki Yun-cheol did?

229
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.185
what?

230
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.813
Are you threatening to report us to the police?

231
00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:59.815
[Sighing] It’s for insurance.

232
00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.359

Yes, I am Joo Yoo-jeong.

[Whispering] Pretending to be surprised, pretending to be scared

244

[Yujeong’s trembling breathing]

248
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.247
Come check my identity.

249
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:58.916
What should I do now?

It's natural

[Jay] And

252
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.341
The police tracked your whereabouts that day.
Can I ask you something?

253
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:08.926
Then

254
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.345
They say there was a party here

255
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.139
Okay?

256
00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.020
[Yuna] That guy died in my room

Who could it be?

263

Who threatened Dojae?

264
00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:57.975
no, and
Oh, what on earth was filmed?

265
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.188
[Yoon Cheol] By any chance, Secretary Choi

266
00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:03.564
yes

267
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:06.734
[Sound of intake of breath] There you are.
Well, do you know anything?

268

[Yuncheol] With Dojae
My friends got it

About that photo

270
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.366
[Secretary Choi] I’m not sure.

271
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.285
[Sigh] Well, I guess

272
00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.120
You have no way of knowing

This is what happened

276
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.963
Should I really drive it?

277
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.008
[dark music]

[Yooncheol’s bitter intake of breath]

283
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.856
I said to you

284
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.818
I have some good information for you.

285
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.195
- It didn't work?
- [Nervous music]

286
00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.198
[Haemi's surprised gasp] That, that's it
Does that make sense?

287
00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.450
No, it wasn't recorded!

288
00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.286
- [Yoojeong] If you check it one more time,
- [Haemi’s heavy breathing]

289
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.371
Why not?

Believe…

It didn't work

294
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.090
[Kanghu] I’m sorry, it was my mistake

295
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.508
Mistake?

296
00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:17.763
[Haemi yells] Mistake?

297

Without it, we!

298

[Sound of clinking glasses]

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.919
I think what's inside was filmed.

306
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.298
Does that exist?

307
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.387
[Haemi] Okay, for now
Because there is evidence that it came in.

308
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:02.641
[Kanghu] That didn’t work either

Was getting kicked out not enough?

[in a trembling voice] Yes

359
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.422
That's right, that guy.

360
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:21.108
[Haemi] Mom, they said he died, do you know?

361
00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.365
[Haemi] Yoo Jeong-ah

362
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.451
Are you okay?

363
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.415
Uh, we're still investigating the scene.

364
00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.333
[Detective] There was nothing special at the crime scene.

365
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:40.127
Well, I don't think it will take long.

366
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.796
[Yoojeong] Mr. Jehyuk

367
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:44.673
How did it happen like that...

368
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:47.342
[Detective] In the words of the optometrist

369
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.929
Except for the cut on the palm.
Well, they say there is no special trauma.

370
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:52.723
But

371
00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:55.309
There was an injection mark on my left arm.

372
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.686
[uneasy music]

373
00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:01.481
There is a possibility that the optometrist may have committed suicide.
They said they couldn't rule it out

374
00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:05.194
I'll get a search and seizure warrant tomorrow.
An autopsy is scheduled

375
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.239
Autopsy?

376
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.408
No, you mean murder?

377
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.076
who is that guy

378
00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:15.495
[Haemi] No
Who kills him?

379
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:17.789
You'll find out if you do some research.

380
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:21.960
[Detective] Are you going to the police station tomorrow?
Could you come?

381
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.880
I think I need to do some research.

382
00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.381
- [Haemi] Hey there.
- [Yujeong’s trembling breathing]

383
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.259
Can't you tell by looking at his condition now?
You're on the verge of fainting.

384
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:31.929
But how do you get to the police station?
Go and get investigated?

385
00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:35.432
In fact, Hae-mi Yoon
I would like you to come with me

386
00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:38.018
[Detective] To Hae-mi Yoon
I have something to ask you.

387
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.771
Why am I...

388
00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.190
Well, I'm still investigating.
I can't say anything but

389
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:47.152
[Detective] Both of you
You are not free from this incident.

390
00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:56.161
[siren sound]

391
00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:00.874
[Junghyun] I see you often.
Attorney Jae-i Do

392
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:04.753
What I attend is
Aren’t you uncomfortable?

393
00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.883
What evidence does Go Yoo-na provide?
Please tell me if there was an emergency arrest.

394
00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.385
Oh, first of all, Go Yoo-na.

395
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:15.514
Gangbo Hotel Suite Room 2401
You are a guest, correct?

396
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.891
That's right

397
00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:19.309
- Yes
- [Keyboard tapping sound]

398
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:22.688
Chairman Song Je-hyeok said that as time passes,
Use an app that automatically deletes text messages

399
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.690
[Detective] The record is
There isn't much left

400
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:25.899
But

401
00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:29.152
To Go Yoo-na before her death

402
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:33.240
'I'm leaving. Are the land documents ready?'
I asked

403
00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:36.034
‘I hope you arrive on time’
There is a record of a reply saying

404
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.371
[Yuna] Yes, he texted me.

405
00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:41.498
But I couldn't meet you

406
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.668
I went to the party because I was pissed.

407
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.796
[Yuna] The name ‘S’
masquerade party at a restaurant

408
00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.131
Well, why are you upset?

409
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:52.551
There's no need to explain everything

410
00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.136
[Jay] The important thing is

411
00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:57.514
Go Yoo-na and Chairman Song Je-hyeok are
I mean, we've never met.

412
00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.975
and it's true

413
00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:03.186
Go Yoo-na is with me.
was at the party

414
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.604
- [Junghyun] Ah
- [Dark Music]

415
00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:09.276
The lawyer's client's
prove your alibi

416
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:12.029
Hotel CCTV
You can check it out.

417
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.574
[Jay] Go Yoo-na
I left the hotel before 7 o'clock.

418
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:16.992
I haven't been in since then

419
00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:21.663
The hotel CCTV was turned off.
After all, it’s only from 8pm

420
00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:23.457
Like that

421
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.417
Are you in trouble?

422
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.461
Then, Chairman Song Je-hyuk

423
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:29.880
[Junghyun] There is no seed or Go Yoo-na.
In that hotel room

424
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:31.006
How did you get in?

425
00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:35.969
It must have come from Song Je-hyuk's belongings.

426
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:38.555
[Yuna] I gave you the keys a while ago.

427
00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:42.142
[Detective] Go Yoo-na
I heard you're Joo Yoo-jeong's friend.

428
00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:44.561
But to my friend’s husband
Why do I need a hotel room key…

429
00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.438
Why are you so naive?

430
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:49.483
If you're at the police station
You will see everything.

431
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:52.110
[Detective is confused] Oh, yes.

432
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:02.871
[Haemi] I’m going crazy

433
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.083
In this case we
What it means to not be free

434
00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:08.460
It means something is suspicious.

435
00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:12.464
Why on earth? Ah, for what?

436
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:13.590
[Yoojeong] Haemiya

437
00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:15.967
[Haemi] Uh, why?

438
00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.511
Is there anything you can point out?

439
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.098
Why did you go to the hotel that day?

440
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.476
-Why did I go...
- [Haemi] No, don’t say it.

441
00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.436
[Haemi] Then I have to say it too.

442
00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:29.064
[uneasy music]

443
00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:30.148
Why can't you talk?

444
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.324
We have to be investigated tomorrow!

445
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.910
[Haemi] We exchanged meaningless words
Just a twisted statement

446
00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.705
So what you're saying is

447
00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.541
uh

448
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:51.420
Let's all survive, okay?

449
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.339
[Haemi] I’m going

450
00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:17.821
[dark music]

451
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:20.907
[sigh]

452
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.135
[Sound of door closing]

453
00:28:40.343 --> 00:28:41.636
[Door lock operating sound]

454
00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:43.764
[Leo] Where have you been?
Not even answering the phone

455
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.515
Why did I find it?

456
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.561
You came earlier
Don't say anything

457
00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:52.189
[Leo] Just keep drinking
What's going on?

458
00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:54.775
You go out for a while.

459
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.027
[Leo] Huh? On this night?

460
00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:58.862
I have something to say to my mom.

461
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:03.283
Uh, okay

462
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:06.453
- [Leo] If anything happens, call me.
- [Sigh]

463
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.749
[Haemi] What does an injured person drink?
[Sound of clicking tongue]

464
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.300
[Manok’s sigh]

465
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.595
- [Sound of door opening and closing]
- [Door lock operating sound]

466
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:24.721
[Haemi] Now tell me

467
00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:28.016
I was in no mood yesterday
You didn't hear the details.

468
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.394
I didn't know he was there
How did you know?

469
00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.981
How did you find that room?

470
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.275
[Laughs] Indeed

471
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:40.111
I am Gil Man-ok at Daeseon Gak.

472
00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.531
If you just want to know, it's something like that.

473
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:44.032
I'm proud

474
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:47.786
Oh, what did you do when you went in?

475
00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:52.624
He was passed out on the sofa.

476
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.042
- [Uneasy music]
- [Man-ok’s bitter intake of breath]

477
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:57.212
[Man-ok] I wonder if he’s dead
I showed my face like this

478
00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:59.798
Suddenly that guy
Swinging something...

479
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:00.799
[Man-ok’s painful moans]

480
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:02.592
So, what are you going to do there?

481
00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:04.594
[Haemi] To that guy
I have some business to do!

482
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.638
Because of you!

483
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.516
[Man-ok] That guy took a picture of you
They say they sprinkle it

484
00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:11.518
But how can I stay still?

485
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:13.937
[Haemi] Still
I'm not going all the way there.

486
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.397
That's Yuna's room.

487
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.107
So it worked out better

488
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:21.236
[Manok] Two bitches together
Because they can surprise you and threaten you.

489
00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.363
Huh? Don’t let him post your photos!

490
00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:26.867
[light sigh]

491
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:29.578
After cleaning

492
00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:31.538
Did you do well?

493
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:37.168
[Meaningful music]

494
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.805
[cell phone vibrates]

495
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:54.477
Uh, mom

496
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:56.855
I just arrived at the hotel

497
00:30:58.398 --> 00:30:59.399
Go in now

498
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:40.440
[Sound of spraying liquid]

499
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:44.653
don't worry

500
00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.030
Because I removed all traces of my mother.

501
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:49.491
[sigh]

502
00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:51.743
But mom

503
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.120
What is your relationship with Song Je-hyuk?

504
00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.123
Well, what are you talking about?

505
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.335
That guy instead of me
Same thing with threatening my mom.

506
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.212
[Haemi] Mom, you can order someone too.

507
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:04.339
Why go there?
It's the same as visiting in person.

508
00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.425
Do you two already know each other well?

509
00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:10.470
- [Dark Music]
- Uh [shaking breath]

510
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:12.138
[Manok] That…

511
00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.141
Ace bar, that's his.

512
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.895
Mutual aid between business owners
That's it, whatever.

513
00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:22.774
But this crossed the line

514
00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.235
Where are you touching my daughter!

515
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:27.278
So I tried to warn you

516
00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:30.949
If you touch my daughter one more time
Tear your limbs apart!

517
00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:32.075
[Manok clicking his tongue]

518
00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.452
[Manok’s light sigh]

519
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:38.331
fact

520
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.793
During this time, I resented my mom a lot.

521
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:43.545
[Haemi] To me forever

522
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.964
The daughter of a bar girl
You gave me a tag

523
00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:49.217
But my mom

524
00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:52.512
[Crying] Because of me
Even such dangerous things...

525
00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.433
[sniffling sound]

526
00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.685
I'm sorry

527
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:02.313
I'm sorry, mom

528
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:06.776
Don't worry about this

529
00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.030
Because my mom protected me all my life.

530
00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:14.325
This time, I will protect my mom.

[Man-ok’s light smile]

533
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:26.296
Doesn’t it hurt?

534
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:28.465
[In a low voice] It hurts

535
00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:30.467
[Haemi] So, there
Go do something, really!

536

We'll do it again tomorrow

541
00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:47.567
If there are no charges, please let me go.

542
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.693
That's troublesome

543
00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:51.446
We have 48 hours
You know there are still some left, right?

544
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:52.530
[Yuna] Leave it alone

545
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.159
This is because I have a murder record.

546
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:01.247
Keep looking for evidence

547
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.129
[Jay] I’ll come back tomorrow

548
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:11.007

Attorney Jae-i Do

550
00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:17.472

[Junghyun] Tomorrow will also change
Must be investigated

554
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:26.356
In this case, Dobyeondo

555
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.234
He's a very important person.

Boss, you don’t drink alcohol at the store.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.756
- [Kanghu] What happened?
- [Employee] Ah

560
00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:55.009
If you go to the party yesterday
CCTV memory disappeared

561
00:34:56.386 --> 00:34:57.804
[Employee] Can I not report that?

562
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:01.766
Well, it's not expensive.
If someone took it

563
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:03.268
It feels uncomfortable.

564
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.603

don't report

568
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.111
[Kanghu] Just as you said
Well, it's not that expensive

569
00:35:55.195 --> 00:35:59.240
If the police come and go for no reason
It's interfering with business.

570
00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:02.076
[Employee] Yes

571
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.495
sorry

572
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.207
While the boss is away, I

573
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:09.292
I should have cracked down

574
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.754
You must have been busy with the guests too.

575
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:16.257
Oh, and

576
00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.427
I left in the middle of the party

577
00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:21.846
I don't want you to tell anyone

578
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.515

I wish I had slush funds

591
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:52.849
There must be a trace left somewhere

592
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:58.187
If the police find you first

593
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.606
All that money is gone

594
00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:05.987
I have to find it first

I'm planning to leave Korea.

I got kicked out by Hae-mi again.

607
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.099

Uh, no

612
00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:30.613
[Kanghu] Uh, sit down and wait.

613
00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:32.907

[Jay] It’s true that I took you to the hotel, but

669
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:35.926
I didn't kill you

670
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.763
I said it 10 years ago too

671

674
00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:03.579
I told you to be careful and to see you.

675

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:15.424
How to find out this secret
The only person is Ki Yun-cheol.

You know someone else?

679
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:26.977
No way

680
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.938
Are you talking about Mr. Kang-hoo?

[Meaningful music]

682
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.694

Mr. Kanghu

684
00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:41.867
That person in the world
I'm the only one who believes

685
00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.832

- [Mobile phone operation sound]

686
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:53.170
so you don't get involved
I'll be careful

687
00:52:54.796 --> 00:52:55.881
There's something I want to know

688
00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.886
Does the truth still matter to you?

689
00:53:02.054 --> 00:53:03.096
yes?

690
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:05.515
sometimes the truth
I could hurt you

691
00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:09.311
[Ilgu] Conversely, to find your truth

692
00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:12.314
Your loved ones may get hurt

[sigh]

694
00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:19.279
why suddenly
I don't know if you're asking a question

695
00:53:20.238 --> 00:53:23.450
If something happened in the past
If that's what you're talking about

696
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:27.704
I found him and uncovered the truth.

697
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:29.331
I have no regrets

698
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.917
[Jay] Even if I go back

699
00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:35.671
I'm sure I'll find him

700
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:40.175
Then

[Jay] Who is it?

706
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.582
The person who killed Song Je-hyuk

707
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:20.215
By the way, why are the police
Are you doubting the lawyer?

708
00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:22.551
[Yongpil] There is no CCTV in the hotel.

709
00:54:23.385 --> 00:54:24.678
What on earth do you have?

710
00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.764
Well, you'll find out when you go.

711
00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:30.851
I have to go out and see

712
00:54:32.227 --> 00:54:34.354
[Jay] With my friends
I made a promise in front of you.

713
00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:38.025
[Yongpil] Hey…

714
00:54:39.443 --> 00:54:41.361
About Choi Kang-hoo
I have something to tell you

715
00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:43.155
[uneasy music]

716
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.656
That fact

717
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.826
To the lawyer yesterday
I heard that there is no CCTV in the restaurant.

718
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.329
I went to a restaurant

719
00:54:51.747 --> 00:54:52.914
[Sound of door opening]

720
00:54:57.836 --> 00:54:59.046
[Yongpil] Let me ask you something.

721
00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:03.383
Yesterday, when I went to the party
Why wasn't the CCTV recording?

722
00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:06.219
Who are you asking that?

723
00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:17.022
It's not that it wasn't recorded.

724
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:19.191
Someone stole the entire file

725
00:55:19.566 --> 00:55:21.735
[Yongpil] That’s Choi Kang-hoo
I heard you were away for a while.

726
00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:22.819
Manager

727
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:25.906
You crossed the line

728
00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:31.745
From now on, I will have a fake ID like that.
Don't deceive people

729
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:37.375
[Sound of door opening]

730
00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:42.422
[siren sound]

731
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:53.934
I feel like I went back 10 years

732
00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:57.562
Don't say anything sinister
Take it easy

733
00:55:58.814 --> 00:56:01.316
[Haemi] You are a bereaved family member.
I said what I had to say, and I…

734
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.364
Jay, do you have any idea?

735
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.117
well

736
00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:11.910
Just

737
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:16.373
like 10 years ago
Let’s not do anything that will put Yuna at a disadvantage.

738
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:29.302
Well then, let's go

739
00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.187
As I said

740
00:56:40.188 --> 00:56:42.983
I spent all that night
was in a restaurant

741
00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:45.152
[Yoojeong] With my friends

742
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:48.905
[Detective] Well, that was before that.

743
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.241
At 2:38 a.m. the next day

744
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.035
Song Je-hyuk was there.
At the Grand Gangbo Hotel

745
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:55.328
Why did you visit us?

746
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.168
What is that...

747
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:03.044
[Keyboard tapping sound]

748
00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.467
[dark music]

749
00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:24.733
What were you looking for in the car?

750
00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:35.494
My husband

751
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.622
often go to that hotel
I knew it was coming and going.

752
00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:40.415
[Yoojeong] It’s obvious.

753
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:42.584
woman

754
00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:47.881
Is there any trace left?
I went looking for you

755
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:52.427
Then in that hotel room
You might have gone up.

756
00:57:52.928 --> 00:57:54.012
[Detective] To catch the scene

757
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:55.388
no

758
00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:58.225
Until such a difficult day
I couldn't do it

759
00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.437
me now

760
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:05.357
I'm pregnant

761
00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:10.779
Ah, yes, I see.

762
00:58:11.571 --> 00:58:12.572
I…

763
00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:16.952
[Detective] Usually
About Song Je-hyuk's relationship with women

764
00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:18.495
How much do you know?

765
00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:21.498
If you're talking about Yuna...

766
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:23.792
No, Go Yoo-na.
I'm not saying

767
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.086
[uneasy music]

768
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.838
Is there any relationship with Hae-mi Yoon?
Did you know?

769
00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:33.134
with my husband

770
00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:35.178
Haemi?

771
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:36.930
I told you

772
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.517
[Haemi] That day with my friends
I was at the party

773
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.102
ask my friends

774
00:58:44.813 --> 00:58:48.108
That day, Hae-mi Yoon
I never said I went to a hotel.

775
00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:54.155
What I'm curious about is

776
00:58:54.406 --> 00:58:56.241
With Song Jehyuk
This is Hae-mi Yoon’s relationship.

777
00:58:57.492 --> 00:59:00.579
[Laughing] Detective Lee
You're talking about really big trouble.

778
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:01.955
What a relationship!

779
00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.332
[Haemi] I and my friend’s husband
What does it have to do with it?

780
00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:05.667
Then why did you take the money?

781
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:08.044
[Detective] That too
A large amount of money, close to 10 billion

782
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:09.379
[Meaningful sound effects]

783
00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:10.755
Ten billion?

784
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:12.799
Me?

785
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.343
Song Je-hyuk's cell phone
There was a note

786
00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:18.096
[Detective] Haemi Yoon and Han
It's a money transaction history.

787
00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:22.601
Date, amount, whatever, method is cash

788
00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:24.269
Well, it was written in such detail.

789
00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:27.397
If you are in a relationship where you receive a lot of money like this,
It's not a normal relationship.

790
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:29.608
Almost what, an economic community?

791
00:59:30.817 --> 00:59:33.236
- [Meaningful music]
- [Man-ok] Ace’s bar belongs to him.

792
00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:37.115
Mutual aid between business owners
That's it, whatever.

793
00:59:37.532 --> 00:59:38.533
Haemi Yoon

794
00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:43.121
When I die, I'll be with your mom
What are you going to do with the Daeseonakak?

795
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:45.165
We've been together for 10 years

796
00:59:52.339 --> 00:59:54.132
Lawyer Do Jae-i said that.

797
00:59:54.215 --> 00:59:56.801
Until he comes
don't say anything

798
00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:59.971
Ah, today is Attorney Do Jae-i.
You can't sit down.

799
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.725
[Detective] Because of Attorney Do Jae-i
I have something to ask Go Yoo-na.

800
01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:06.561
What about Jay?

801
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.606
It was about 4:12 a.m. the day before yesterday.

802
01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.108
Chasing Attorney Do Jae Yi
You went to the hotel, right?

803
01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.735
[Detective] Why did you chase me?

804
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:19.783
Do you happen to ask Attorney Jae-i Do?
Did you have any doubts?

805
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.128
Oh, it was all caught on CCTV.

806
01:00:35.256 --> 01:00:37.926
Do you have CCTV?

807
01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.013
- [Detective] Yesterday at 4:11 a.m.
- [Sound of tapping on desk]

808
01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.848
At the hotel where candidate Song Je-hyuk was located,
Why did you go?

809
01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:48.269
And after about 20 minutes
Why did you come out of the hotel feeling nauseous?

810
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:55.902
Yesterday, during the investigation of Go Yoo-na,

811
01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.530
I'm doing forensics on the CCTV file.
I couldn't tell you

812
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.283
However, the forensics was completed
When I looked at the file

813
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.329
From 8pm the previous day
It's true that the CCTV was turned off.

814
01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:10.917
From exactly 4 a.m. the next day
CCTV at the hotel entrance is turned on.

815
01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:15.630
Security office staff made a mistake
Did you turn it on earlier than the scheduled time?

816
01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.968
He disappeared right after the CCTV employee incident.

817
01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.762
You were the one who ordered to turn off the CCTV, right?

818
01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:25.140
And then I went to the hotel early in the morning
You killed Song Je-hyuk, right?

819
01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:28.601
And I'm terrible too
Didn’t it come out while you were nauseous?

820
01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:38.319
As of this time, Attorney Jae-i Do has
Converts from witness to suspect

821
01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.196
Even though you are a lawyer

822
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.657
Separate lawyer
You can also appoint

823
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.743
unfavorable statements
You may refuse

824
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.286
[Sound of door opening]

825
01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.082
Attorney Jae-i Do

826
01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.168
They say he has an alibi.

827
01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.087
Someone who can prove it
Are you coming now?

828
01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.271
[Sound of car door opening]

829
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.108
[Sound of ringing shoes]

830
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.820
[dark music]

831
01:02:22.655 --> 01:02:23.823
[Sound of car door closing]

832
01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.630
[Detective 1] Hey, who is it?

833
01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:41.549
- [Detective 2] The chief said that?
- [Detective 1’s puzzled breathing]

834
01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.469
[Detective 1] Who on earth are you?
The person who is coming now

835
01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:49.682
[Sound of door opening]

836
01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:30.265
[Joonghyun] About Attorney Jae-yi Do

837
01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:32.892
You have something to say...

838
01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:34.978
first

839
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:38.398
Hotel CCTV that day
The person who told me to turn it off

840
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.025
close

841
01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:46.823
[Junghyun's embarrassed breathing]

842
01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:48.992
[Junghyun] Why did you tell me to turn it off?

843
01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.873
It's a shame, but
I have a child out of wedlock

844
01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.585
[Ilgu] That extramarital child
I called you at the hotel

845
01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.505
That record
This is so as not to leave anything behind.

846
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.716
But the employee in charge

847
01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:07.677
You turned it on too fast, like a fool.

848
01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.721
Hey, wait a minute.

849
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.347
Who is that extramarital child?

850
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.018
if…

851
01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:16.644
[Ilgu] Yes

852
01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:21.482
This is lawyer Do Jae-i here.

853
01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.030
That day at the hotel

854
01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:30.450
You were with me
in my office

855
01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:35.330
Jay, let’s not hide it anymore.

856
01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:38.666
[Sound of a group of people taking a deep breath]

857
01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.501
But it is

858
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.629
I that day

859
01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:45.089
I think I saw something

860
01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:46.841
[nervous music]

861
01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.596
Can I tell you? Jay

862
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.892
[Ilgu] You still
Does the truth matter?

863
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.353
sometimes the truth
I could hurt you

864
01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:01.481
On the contrary, to find your truth

865
01:05:02.106 --> 01:05:04.025
Your loved ones may get hurt

866
01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.861
[Soaring music]

867
01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.239
[Junghyun] What did you see?

868
01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.866
Even if it's a suspicious person...

869
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.743
Wouldn’t it be better to tell you?

870
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.455
[Ilgu] Something that could be a clue
I have to tell you everything

871
01:05:17.538 --> 01:05:22.085
Detectives quickly
Won't you find out the truth?

872
01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.254
[Junghyun] Please tell me

873
01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:27.465
What did you see that day?

874
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.343
that day

875
01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.137
I went to the hotel a little after 10 o'clock.

876
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.479
[tire rubbing sound]

877
01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.195
[Ilgu] I just got on the elevator

878
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.406
far behind a pillar

879
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.784
wearing black clothes and a black hat

880
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.328
I saw a man

881
01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.584
Was there an English letter N on the hat?

882
01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.716
The figure hiding behind the wall is suspicious.
It was memorable

883
01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:12.885
Did you see the face too?

884
01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:33.948
[heavy music]

885
01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:17.450
[Jay] Suddenly
Why are you doing this?

886
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.994
Why are you suddenly like this?
Are you making it confusing?

887
01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.704
[Ilgu] 10 years ago and now

888
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:25.249
Just because you're having a hard time
I don't want to get involved

889
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.001
[Leo] Kanghu hyung
It seems a little strange

890
01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:30.588
{\an8}With a somewhat strange person
Aren't we having strange conversations?

891
01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.132
{\an8}Something I usually do with Kanghu hyung
It looked a lot different

892
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.593
{\an8}I will give you the money to escape.

893
01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.554
{\an8}[Eunsu] This person is me

894
01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.765
{\an8}He gave me money and told me to leave Korea.

895
01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:43.142
{\an8}How scared I was, Mr.

896
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.602
{\an8}I can never forget

897
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:45.937
{\an8}Never

898
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.816
{\an8}[Junghyeon] Autopsy results
I'll tell you

899
01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.860
{\an8}[Yoojeong] It’s an unexpected result.

900
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.781
{\an8}[Ilgu] You still
Does the truth matter?

901
01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.325
{\an8}[Jay] Song Je-hyuk is dead

902
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.536
{\an8}Do you have anything to do with Mr. Kanghu?

903
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.413
{\an8}At that time that day
Kang-hoo wasn’t here.

904
01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.666
{\an8}Why did you come to the hotel?

905
01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:07.875
Why did you have to hide it?
