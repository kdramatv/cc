{\an8}Why? Is it difficult?

28
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.195
{\an8}That's not it, I'm upset

29
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.199
{\an8}[Yeji] These days
Because the angels are not coming

30
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.118
{\an8}You don't get pocket money.

{\an8}Serving alcohol at your age
It's bad, don't you know?

32
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.418
{\an8}I know, but still

33
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.380
{\an8}[Yeji] You have to have money
I can also do leg surgery

{\an8}I too, like other kids
I want to run around and play

I'll give you surgery on your leg.

But sister

They say you can make a lot of money

- What does that mean?

41

Like my sister too
When you are old enough to wear school uniform

43
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.948
The angels will give you a lot of money

44

[Yeji] I too quickly
I want to wear a school uniform [laughs]

45
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.831
[Jay] I caught that guy
The thing about not giving up

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.960
The bad guys

47
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.796
do bad things
It's not just a one-time thing.

48
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.798
if we are silent

49
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.385
Someone else could get hurt too

50
00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:43.932

It could be a person

What are you doing?

66
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.419
[Jehyuk in speaker] Did I call you?
Yujeong called.

67
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.715
Anyway, you are because of that damn friend.
Because it ruins my life

What the hell am I!

71
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.683
What the hell are we doing to you
What did I do wrong to be like this?

From that day 10 years ago

78
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.582
Was this all planned up until now?

79
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.210
Oh my, what kind of plan did I make?

80
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.172
I'm also tied up with you guys
I'm so tired I'm dying

fact

82
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.093
What happened 10 years ago was a coincidence

[Doorbell sounds]

84
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.722

[Schematic] Are you here?

86
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.808
[Jehyuk] You created that coincidence

87
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.519
That's not him

88
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.314
He said he was giving that drink to Yoo Yoo-na.

89
00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.402
Hey, you bastard
That girl ran away!

[Jehyuk] Niga
I wish you hadn't come to that room

93
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.121
- [Scheme] Hey, hey [groans with difficulty]
- [Jehyuk] I guess the prayer ceremony didn’t die?

94
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.123
So

95
00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:40.502
Is that why you approached Yuna?

96
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.213
Are you sorry for turning me into a murderer?

97
00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.048
[Jehyuk snorts]

98
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.595
[Jehyuk] Are you sorry for loving you?

99
00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.848
we loved each other
Enough to give birth to Nana

100
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.809
Then it should have just ended with Yuna!

101
00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:00.146
[In a tearful voice] To Yujeong
Why did you approach me?

102
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.231
[Crying breathing]

103
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.815

Pretty, lots of money

105

Plus, he's in love with me

106
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.782
How can you not love?

107
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.325
[Jay] Lie

108
00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.953
Your goal is just this orphanage.

109
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.874
Among many, many places
Why this orphanage?

110
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:23.628
This is where the kids are!
[shaking breathing]

111
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.381
[Jehyuk in speaker] Children
Because there is

112
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:31.219
[Jehyuk] No matter what happens

113
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.264
Children who don't even have parents to help them

114
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.766
When rich people find this place

115
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.686
People are noblesse oblige

116
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.355
‘You came to do something good’
don't think

117
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.358
[Jehyuk in speaker] Than here
To play a secret game

118
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:47.360
Could there be a better place?

119
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.487
[Crying breathing]

120
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.115
That secret game is over now

121
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.659
I'm the only one dying

122
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.620
Do you think that data will be buried?

123
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.080
- [Sniffling sound]
- [Jehyuk’s laughter in the speaker]

124
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.125
Kill me? why?

125
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:07.130
To destroy people
Not the way to kill

126
00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.382
That there is another way

127
00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.676
you know better

128
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.722
[Jehyuk in speaker] Yes

129
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.474
That's what you think

130
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.935
[laughter]

131
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.356
The data you stole anyway

132
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:27.692
You can't hurt me at all

133
00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:28.943
So

134
00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:32.488
Stop chasing this club with me right now.

135
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.699
Otherwise

136
00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:39.037
what you think
It's going to start

137
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.831
until you surrender

138
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.834
[Jehyuk in speaker] Jay

139
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.337
You've had a hard time so far

140
00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.673
Then now

141
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.010
I'll relax your body and mind first.

142
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.803
Take a deep breath

[Jay’s powerful moans]

146
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.330
I told him to call me when he got home.

147
00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:24.666
Anyway, Dojae

148
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.709
[cell phone vibrates]

Uh, yeonya

150
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:35.802
[Yuna] Hey, uncle

151
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.805
I think I can testify

[dark music]

153
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.183
No, please let me do it.

154
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:43.393
[Kanghu] Are you serious?

155
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.019
Can you really do that?

156
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.772
Attorney Do Jae-i was right.

157
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.024
If I don't have courage

158
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.360
Yeji will suffer like me.

159
00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:55.738
I'll pass it on to Jay.

160
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.407
[Kanghu] Let’s discuss it with Jae-yi.

161
00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.200
Well, man...

162
00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.955
I just met Attorney Jae-i Do.
I think I saw it

163
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.415
Jay?

164
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:06.791

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:28.555
Surprised

357
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:29.807
I know everything

358
00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:32.768
what are you thinking

359
00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.354
- [Yuna’s trembling breathing]
-What are you doing?

360
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.233
I know everything
You damn adolescent!

361
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:40.818

[Sound of stand falling]

364
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:46.782
Are you okay?

365
00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:48.325
I'm fine

366
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.577
I need to find the master key quickly.

367
00:22:58.627 --> 00:22:59.628
[Kanghu] Let’s go

368
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.635
[unlock sound]

369
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.513
[Kanghu] Jay! Jay!

370
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:10.597
[Yuna] Lawyer!

371
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.224
[Kanghu] Jay

372
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.726
Jay, Jay, Jay

373
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:20.816
- Don't touch it!
- [Heavy music]

374
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.234
Toxin powder

375
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:23.986
Also, poison?

376
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.863
[Kanghu’s heavy breathing]

377
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:28.073
Let's go out now
I can't feel Jay's breathing

378
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:37.291
[Jehyuk] Thank you
let me talk

379
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:38.542
[Nurse] Oh, yes, I understand.

380
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.928
Oh my, I'm sick of it, I'm sick of it

381
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:53.265
The more you are like this
Don’t you know that Nana is having a hard time?

382
00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.477
[Yuna] Let me ask you one favor.

383
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:00.355
As you said, a woman named Yoo Yoo-na

384
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.984
As Nana's biological mother
If you can't donate your liver

385
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:07.487
Let Emily Go do it.

386
00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:09.907
- [Dark Music]
- me

387
00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.159
It's also Emily Go.

388
00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:13.368
[laughter]

389
00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:15.954
Are you kidding me?

390
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.706
when you are in america

391
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.418
With Emily Go
Just say you gave birth to Nana.

392
00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:23.754
[Yuna] Make the documents like that.

393
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.839
you can do it

394
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:30.886
Why should I go through that trouble?
While manipulating documents

395
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.179
[Yuna] Me

396
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.599
You know there is land in Tongzhou, right?

397
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.392
What Jeong Gu-tae gave me

398
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.479
I decided to give it to Jay.

399
00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:43.106
I'll give it to you

400
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:48.654
The business you did at the orphanage
I heard you were caught by Jay?

401
00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.907
Then the new space
You won't need it

402
00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:56.954
you

403
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.456
You're not thinking nonsense, are you?

404
00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:00.999
[Yuna] To me, it’s better than that land.

405
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.628
Nana’s life is more precious

406
00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:06.338
you have land

407
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.174
I want to have a child

408
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.599
Okay

409
00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.851
- [Jehyuk] I’ll contact you when the documents are ready.
- [Heavy music]

410
00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:20.894
But

411
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.397
Don't tell Yujeong

412
00:25:23.814 --> 00:25:25.524
If you know, it becomes complicated.

413
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:32.072
Ah, what is this? This is

414
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:33.699
[Tsk tsk clicking sound]

415
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:22.164

[nervous music]

419
00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.894
[Jehyuk] The reason I mock you is
It's not me

420
00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:46.480
Your life was ruined by drugs
Do you know who it is?

421
00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.815
Chareo, your husband whom you love

422
00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:51.902
And I love you

423
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:53.528
You protect me

424
00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:55.572
Isn't that true mockery?

425
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:58.075
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Door lock operating sound]

426

older sister

429
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.419
What is this... [Painful groan]

430
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.132
You?

431
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:17.344
What put me into this hell

432
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:20.430
[Haemi] So where are you?

433
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:22.265
[Laughing] Pretending to be for me

434
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.852
When he died in prayer ceremony 10 years ago

435
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.522
I went to that room

436
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.400
Do you know why you went?

437
00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:37.406
I'm trying to get this!

438
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:39.783
[Haemi’s trembling breathing]

439
00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.701
If it weren't for this, I...

440
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.831
In that dirty incident
I wasn't even caught up in it.

441
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.875
Then I should stop taking the medicine.

442
00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:51.044
[Crying] But you wanted more?

443
00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:52.754
[shaking breathing]

444
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.423
Every time that day comes to mind

445
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:58.260
Whenever I feel stressed!

446
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:02.389
[Crying] Every night, every night

447
00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:07.102
I want to take this medicine
Fighting against temptation

[Crying breathing]

449
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:11.481
Scratching your whole body without you knowing

450
00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:13.734
me every night
Do you know how hard it was?

451
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.612
But

452
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:22.033
take me to hell
It was you who left it out? uh?

453
00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:25.203
[laughter mixed with tears]

454
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:28.832
[Haemi’s sobbing]

455
00:28:28.915 --> 00:28:32.169
My life like this
Were you the one who ruined it?

456
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:35.630
[Hae-mi’s sobbing breathing]

457
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.966
How could you do that, you!

458
00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.302
how!

459
00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:44.222
[Yuna] People addicted to drugs

460
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:45.974
When life falls into abyss

461
00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:47.851
The first person to complain
Do you know who it is?

462
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.187
The guy who sold me drugs

463
00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.689
If Hae-mi's life goes wrong

464
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:54.441
What will I hate you the most?

465
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.072
But sister

466
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.369
My life wasn't heaven either

467
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.414
[Leo] I live with my sister

468
00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.249
no

469
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.376
As I fell in love with my sister

470
00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:17.005
My life was hell too

471
00:29:18.632 --> 00:29:22.135
I'm afraid my sister will find drugs again
I feel anxious and nervous every day

472
00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.179
[sniffling sound]

473
00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.764
I can't sleep because of guilt

474
00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:27.808
[shaking breathing]

475
00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:29.142
so me
I went out to Ace Bar again.

476
00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:30.477
I'm trying to keep an eye on my sister so she can't sell drugs.

477
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.521
Don't you know that it made it harder for me?

478
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:35.899
[Haemi] You were reported to the police

479
00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.442
If you do something wrong, you!

480
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.654
You could go to jail for selling drugs

481
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.072
Just by selling drugs?

482
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:44.991
[Leo] Forward to me
Are you going to commit more sins?

483
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.869
Not only me and Ace Bar

484
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.830
I got involved in a secret club too.

485
00:29:50.664 --> 00:29:51.873
[Meaningful music]

486
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:53.750
- [Haemi’s sigh]
- But

487
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:57.212
I'm in that world
I'm going deeper

488
00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.965
So that's what that bastard Song Je-hyuk does
Revealing everything to the world

489
00:30:01.758 --> 00:30:03.134
I'm going to ruin that kid's life too.

490
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:04.302
Are you crazy?

491
00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:07.389
It's not just him
It will ruin your life too!

492
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.432
like my life
It doesn't matter what happens

493
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:13.019
But sister

494
00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:18.024
[Sound of picking something up]

495
00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:22.612
[Leo] I have a sister
I hope it doesn't happen like this

496
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.450
Hand this over to Song Je-hyuk.
If you ruin sister Jay

497
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.245
Do you think your sister will be okay?

498
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:32.372
You'll probably regret it

499
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.001
No, it must be painful?

500
00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:38.211
Because of what I did to my sister

501
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.630
Like it's so painful

502
00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.718
So don't give this to him

503
00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:47.637
This is my last request

504
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:51.683

How do you get things done?

516
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.475
Because you fooled me,
sorry

517
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.601
I did it wrong

518
00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:36.770
What happened? He said he collapsed

519
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.732
[Director] Ah, ah, that’s because he’s so strong.
I don't think I'll die

520
00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:42.317
It's Dojae, not that bastard!

521
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.487
I collapsed, hey, I checked the CCTV.
He seemed unconscious.

Shut up forever

526
00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.506
You know what I mean, right?

527
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:05.590
yes

528

I have to watch the progress.

- [Dark Music]
- 24 hours from now are critical.

536
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:43.670
[Haemi] It’s not just him
It will ruin your life too!

537
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:45.797
like my life
It doesn't matter what happens

538
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.424
[Leo] I hope you don’t do this

539
00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:50.218
Hand this over to Song Je-hyuk.
If you ruin sister Jay

540
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.928
Do you think your sister will be okay?

[cell phone vibrates]

542
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:11.906
Hello?

543
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:16.911
Leo was under emergency arrest?

544
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:20.957
I'm going to the police station now.

545
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:22.751

547
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:35.638
Leo, you did it, right?

548
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.516
Where is this law?

549
00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:41.561
I haven't answered you yet!

550
00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.980
[Jehyuk] You choose
I feel like I can't do it

551
00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.607
I did it for you

552
00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:49.235
So, like a pet dog
Throw it away

553
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.071
You just live

554
00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:54.532
Dojae’s shame, until today.

If anyone sees it, it's not my husband.

560
00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:27.774
I thought it was a strange man.

[light sigh]

562
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.653
I was startled while sleeping.

563
00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:34.155
Why do you sleep like this?

564
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:36.658
In the words of the nurse
I heard you fell asleep early

565
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:40.912
Where did you go out at night?

566
00:34:41.955 --> 00:34:43.748
[shaking breath] This doesn't make sense.

567
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.252
Where are you going out that night?

[Meaningful music]

569
00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:52.132
Then

570
00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.092
What is this?

571
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:02.559
Oh, I went for a walk yesterday.

572
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:04.352
[Yujeong] I want to get some air

573
00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:08.523
Actually

574
00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.859
[Jehyuk] Just lying here
It will be frustrating

575
00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:12.777
Oh, by the way

576
00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:14.988
I have something to discuss with you.

578
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.618
I'm going to close the door now

579
00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:26.708
[Yoojeong] Why?

580
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.669
That's where you liked it.

581
00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:33.506
I'm no longer interested

582
00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:35.758
Why? no, I do not want?

583
00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:40.138
[Yoojeong] No

584
00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.849
do it like that

585
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:46.352
I'm no longer involved in the foundation's affairs.

586
00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.566
[Jehyuk] Thank you, for trusting me

587
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:55.653
However, the decision-making authority is still
Because you have it

588
00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:57.197
I'll bring the documents when they're ready.

Are you okay?

592
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.337
Oh, sure
Travel looks like a lot of fun

593
00:36:12.795 --> 00:36:14.339
Seeing as I haven't even contacted you

594
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:18.676
[Jehyuk] I’ll go

Are you feeling better now?

599
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:47.580
- It's me.
- [Nana] Yes?

Aunt

601
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.544
I might not be able to come for a while

602
00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:56.547
[Yuna] But the lady
When I came back

603
00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:57.840
Not the lady

604
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:03.054
Can you call me mom?

605
00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:05.807
[Surprising gasp] I have a mother.

606
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:09.477
[heavy music]

607
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.646
What does it mean to be a mother?

608
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:16.776
Do anything for me
The person who can do it is mom

609
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.362
[Yuna] The lady

610
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:22.740
I can do it for me

611
00:37:23.283 --> 00:37:24.826
So until then

612
00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:30.164
Don't get sick, okay?

613

From now on, like this
I won't make you uncomfortable

[Ilgu] Why did you do that again?
Are you angry?

621
00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:25.636
Jay, to that guy.
Do you know that I almost died?

622
00:38:26.512 --> 00:38:27.513
You mean him?

The guy who did something terrible to Jay!

625
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.898
So how is Jay now?

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:16.247
[Ilgu] The fact that I came here...

641
00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:19.459
[Kanghu] I know
It's a secret

642
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:24.213
The relationship between Jae-yi and the chairman is
Only I know

643
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:25.590
[Ilgu] Then

644
00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.844
Can I ask you a favor?

645
00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:35.016

What I did at Ace Bar

651
00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:09.258
Blame it all on me

652
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.887
They even reported me with their own hands

653
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.682
He's a really scary guy, that guy.

654
00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:18.726
I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

655
00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:21.187
Did you leave home to show me like this?

656
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.481
To that guy instead of my sister
I wanted revenge

657
00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:24.565
That guy is bullying my sister.

658
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.819
[Crying] But

668
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:08.317
I screwed up my daughter, who is to blame?

669

just anyone
I wanted to resent you

670
00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.699
Otherwise I would be so embarrassed

671
00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:18.911
So it's not your fault

672

Don't blame yourself too much

Crying! The male bastard
I barely got anything like that

674
00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:29.171
Did I raise you like that?

675
00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:34.885
don't worry

676
00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:39.140
I'll hire the best lawyer and get you out of it.

[Leo’s whimpering sound]

682

But where are you going?

683
00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.540
Are you talking like someone who is definitely going somewhere?

684
00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.982
[Haemi] I’ll send Dojae’s ledger.

685

717
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:37.670
- [Call connection tone]
- [after exhaling]

718
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:39.004
[dark music]

719
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:41.549
Ah, Chairman.

720
00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.300
This is Song Je-hyuk.

721
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.761
[Laughs] No.

722
00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:48.806
A photo for the president
I want to send it to you

723
00:46:50.516 --> 00:46:52.059
Ah, the chairman's hotel

724
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.436
This is a photo of Vice President Haemi Yoon.

725
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.230
[rustling sound]

726
00:46:57.398 --> 00:46:58.524
[Sound of putting it down]

727
00:46:58.607 --> 00:46:59.733
[Nurse] Then take a break.

728
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:01.402
[Yoojeong] Ah, hey, teacher

729
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.821
[Embarrassed breathing]

730
00:47:03.904 --> 00:47:07.283
Sorry but
Could you please lend me your cell phone for once?

731
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:09.743
Ah, yes

732
00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:23.841
[Sound of scraping dishes]

733
00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:36.520
But I'm not like this

734
00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:38.772
I want to eat ramen

735
00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:41.734
- I saw you were looking for ramen.
- [Emotional music]

736
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:43.360
I guess it's worth living now

737
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:44.987
[Kanghu] Still not working

738
00:47:45.404 --> 00:47:48.532
I need a few more days to see the doctor.
They said it was back to normal

739
00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:51.702
But

740
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:54.455
Why did I move here?

741
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.249
- [light sigh]
- [Sound of spoon being put down]

742
00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.501
[Sound of putting down a bowl]

743
00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:01.795
when you lose consciousness

744
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:04.381
Someone came to visit you at the hospital

745
00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:07.343
Can I ask you a favor?

746
00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:11.013
[Ilgu] If Jae-yi wakes up

747
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.098
Leave the hospital right away

748
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.727
And to a place where no one can find

749
00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.479
Take Jay

750
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:20.564
[Kanghu] That person’s eyes

751
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.149
It's not a request

752
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:24.443
It felt like a strong warning

753
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:28.822
Still, I'm still the person who loves you

754
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:31.533
I decided to listen to that warning

755
00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.952
You can do anything as long as you live

756
00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:42.252
I know your heart

757
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:44.713
Let's get our bodies together first, okay?

758
00:48:45.798 --> 00:48:46.882
[light laughter]

759
00:48:47.966 --> 00:48:49.551
[Jay] Is it because I died and came back to life?

760
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.804
Because Kang-hoo is next to me

761
00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:54.765
Thank you so much

762
00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:58.352
I don't think I'll be lonely even if I die

763
00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:02.064
Damn, I barely saved him alive.

764
00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:03.941
[knock knock sound]

765
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:08.487
[in a nervous voice] Who is it?

766
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:14.368
Besides me
People who will make you not feel lonely

767
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.079
[Kanghu] Please come in.

768
00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:20.290
[Sound of door opening]

769
00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:25.254
[Jay] You guys…

770
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:27.673
[Kanghu] I got a call.

771
00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.216
I told you it was here

772
00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:31.802
- [light laughter]
- [Haemi] Hey, Dojae

773
00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:34.346
I knew you were fearless
This isn't it

774
00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.766
Why go there alone?
I hope you end up like this!

775
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:38.892
motherfucker

776
00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.439
Don't hit the glass door with your high heels.
I should have filmed that guy

777
00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:45.023
- No, but
- [Yuna’s sigh]

778
00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:46.817
Are you guys here together?

779
00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:50.112
[Yuna] That can’t be true

780
00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:52.239
I met you in front of me

781
00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.576
I'm down there today
Because I'll be at the dorm

782
00:49:56.201 --> 00:49:57.661
[Kanghu] If there is anything uncomfortable, please contact me.

783
00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:00.998
- Oh, and…
- [Yuna] Go see

784
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:02.332
I will take good care of Jay.

785
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:05.794
[Haemi] Because I don’t eat Jay.
Don't worry, let's go

786
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.671
[light laughter]

787
00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:09.673
[Haemi’s light smile]

788
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.133
[light laughter]

789
00:50:11.884 --> 00:50:12.926
[Thunder sound]

790
00:50:32.738 --> 00:50:34.281
[Jehyuk] It’s been a while, Rep.

791
00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.449
Let's have a drink

792
00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:38.076
[Yuncheol] It’s important

793
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.078
Is it just alcohol?

794
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:43.248
Hey, because of you, congressman.
Business was closed today.

795
00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:44.333
I feel sorry

796
00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:47.961
Are you going to give me a drink and make a wish?

797
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:51.089
After your son's video scandal

798
00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:54.885
The approval rating for the presidential election plummeted.
I guess you've lost your intelligence

799
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:57.930
Even today, the famous chairman
I've been contacted

800
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.349
I'm interested in a new club

801
00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.100
New club?

802
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:05.521
I'm closing down Angel's Club.
Ace bar too

803
00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:06.980
[Jehyuk] And

804
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:09.149
We will create a new club

805
00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:12.861
Something bigger and more secret

806
00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:15.781
- [Snort]
- [Dark Music]

807
00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.492
What kind of money do you have?

808
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:22.120
Land in Gonggok District, Tongzhou City

809
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:24.414
It will soon be mine

810
00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.669
[Jehyuk] I became mayor
If you create a secret club there

811
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:32.548
Tongzhou City becomes my kingdom.

812
00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:36.134
What can customers do?
You should come to me

813
00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:38.846
Dojae already found out about that.

814
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.598
I was playing around with that data.

815
00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:43.809
Do you think Dojae will stay still?

816
00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:45.185
[light laughter]

817
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:51.108
[Jehyuk] Do Jae-i
Do you know what your Achilles heel is?

818
00:51:52.025 --> 00:51:54.361
His friends and his sense of justice

819
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:57.990
Go Yoo-na, Joo Yoo-jeong, Yoon Hae-mi

820
00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:03.287
And even the children at the orphanage
It's all in my hands

821
00:52:03.537 --> 00:52:04.663
What can you do?

822
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:09.376
So you
don't worry about me

823
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:10.794
worry about you

824
00:52:11.753 --> 00:52:14.006
Customers are lining up for me

825
00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:17.134
I'm saying your string fell off.

826
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.928
What is it?

827
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.432
I guess blood can’t deceive

828
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:26.351
Dosik looks a lot like you

829
00:52:27.936 --> 00:52:30.814
[Jehyuk] I wish I was a bit picky
I would have saved my life

830
00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:34.610
Because I cross the line

831
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.240
Are you confessing now?

832
00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.784
You killed my son?

833
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.412
- [Nervous music]
- As Do-sik goes to the end

834
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.747
Do you know what I said?

835
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.125
[Teasing] Dad, Dad

836
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.338
How much I searched for my father like a child

837
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:56.548
[Angrily gasping] You bastard!

838
00:52:58.383 --> 00:53:00.052
How dare you kill my son!

839
00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:01.553
- [Yuncheol’s exasperated exclamation]
- [Sound of strength]

840
00:53:01.637 --> 00:53:03.597
- [Sound of surprise]
- [Secretary Choi] Congressman, please be patient.

841
00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.352
[Jehyuk] Just like your son
If you don't want to fall behind

842
00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:11.605
Don't ignore me, okay?

843
00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:14.232
[Soaring music]

844
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:16.652
[Yuncheol’s exasperated exclamation]

845
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:19.363
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Scream]

846
00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:27.788
[Yuncheol] Get out of my way!

847
00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:30.707
That bastard

848
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:32.834
I'll kill you

849
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.933
[Manok] I didn’t know either.

850
00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.227
Our Haemi

851
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.438
I went to such a bad party

852
00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:56.900
I understand

853
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.820
For the hotel, we use Haemi.

854
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:01.905
You should send it out.

855
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.281
Just

856
00:54:04.157 --> 00:54:07.953
To prevent that photo from being leaked
please pay attention

857
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:10.706
Please

858
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:14.084
[Call end sound]

859
00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:20.549
[Meaningful music]

860
00:54:23.802 --> 00:54:25.429
Song Jehyuk

861
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.849
You bastard

862
00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:33.603
I'll grind it up and eat it up

863
00:54:42.487 --> 00:54:43.572
[Yuna] Me

864
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:46.992
I'll kill you

865
00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:48.660
Song Jehyuk

866
00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:50.912
[Crackling sound]

867
00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.457
This time, I'm going to become a real murderer.

868
00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:58.670
Jay, you came here to say that.

869
00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:01.506
you

870
00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:03.884
Are you serious?

871
00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:06.845
To that guy

872
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:10.265
Liver transplant to Nana
I asked you to let me do it

873
00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:13.351
I'm not the guy who will do it

874
00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:15.687
[Yuna] They’ll just try to take the land.

875
00:55:17.272 --> 00:55:18.815
But so do I

876
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:21.109
With the bait of giving land

877
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.488
Call him to a secret place
I'll kill you

878
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:26.490
my nana

879
00:55:27.783 --> 00:55:29.618
Under that guy all my life
I can't let it happen

880
00:55:30.368 --> 00:55:31.745
And what if you get caught by the police?

881
00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.206
[In a trembling voice] Liver transplant
Just don't get caught until the end.

882
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.832
[Yuna] After that

883
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.168
I don't care what happens

884
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:39.544
Hey, who cares?

885
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:42.672
[Haemi] If you get caught this time
Legally it's my second murder.

886
00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:44.508
Then that

887
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:46.218
The, well, serial killer.
Isn't it like that?

888
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:47.469
Then what should I do!

889
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.387
[heavy music]

890
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:51.890
There is no way to get Nana out.

891
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:58.855
I'd rather do it myself

892
00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:01.483
[Haemi] Today, our Leo

893
00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:06.196
I'm locked up in a detention cell
It was so mind-boggling

894
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:07.823
Why in the detention center?

895
00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:09.699
leo now

896
00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:13.662
Drug sales, money laundering
I was arrested on slush fund charges.

897
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:16.790
I got caught in that guy’s trap.

898
00:56:17.457 --> 00:56:19.459
[Haemi] But this time
I don't think it will end

899
00:56:19.835 --> 00:56:22.712
Probably me and Leo for the rest of my life
He's the one to grab your ankles, that guy

900
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:31.138
[Jay] Have you contacted Yujeong?

901
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.474
[Yuna] I wish I could contact you
Would I have stayed still?

902
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.019
Being in the same hospital as me
He's the one who I haven't even looked for once!

903
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:41.481
I told Yujeong earlier
Did you get a call?

904
00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:48.989
No, I asked where it was.
I told you that I was going to see Jay.

905
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.699
[Haemi] He asked for the address and I gave it to him.

906
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:51.867
What if I teach you

907
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.577
[Yuna] If I tell Song Je-hyuk,
What should I do?

908
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.037
Hey, no matter what
Yoojung is not that type of person.

909
00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:01.543
And there was something strange about his voice.

910
00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:03.879
[Haemi] Leave your cell phone behind

911
00:57:03.962 --> 00:57:05.630
to someone else's phone
Same thing with calling

912
00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:09.009
Maybe

913
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:11.970
Are you being watched by Song Je-hyuk?

914
00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:16.933
[Car engine sound]

915
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:21.771
Look who's here

916
00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:24.107
Isn't it him by any chance?

917
00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:31.823
[Haemi] Isn’t she Yujeong?

918
00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:37.037
[Yujeong] Guys [surprised gasp]

919
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.455
[Haemi] Yoojeong!

920
00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:40.665
are you okay?

921
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:42.876
Yoojung, are you okay?

922
00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:45.128
- [Yuna] Yoo Jeong-ah
- [Haemi] Wake up

923
00:57:45.212 --> 00:57:46.755
- [Yujeong’s labored groans]
- [Jay] Yoo Jeong-ah

924
00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:49.549
[Yujeong’s sobbing]

925
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:50.842
[Yoojeong] Jay

926
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.220
[Yujeong’s sobbing]

927
00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:03.647
[sigh]

928
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.982
[Yujeong’s sobbing]

929
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:12.072
[Jay's sigh]

930
00:58:14.616 --> 00:58:15.742
[Yoojeong] I…

931
00:58:17.702 --> 00:58:19.621
As much as you think

932
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:23.375
It's not that I don't know anything

933
00:58:26.294 --> 00:58:28.213
I found that person strange too.

934
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:32.717
- [Jehyuk] Uh, President Jeong
- [Uneasy music]

935
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.678
Copy just one phone

936
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:37.806
[Yoojeong] Because my doubts became certain

937
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:42.477
Even the things I tried to ignore
It came to mind

938
00:58:43.728 --> 00:58:45.021
That person [shaking breath]

939
00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:47.524
As if from long ago

940
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.986
It felt like someone knew me

941
00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:53.154
I didn't know the girl

942
00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.907
With such a noble and pretty face

943
00:58:57.117 --> 00:58:59.327
some men before
Have you been meeting?

944
00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:02.706
[Jehyuk] I can’t bear to say it with my mouth.
I won't talk about it

945
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.460
That's my consideration for you.

946
00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:09.588
You guys

947
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.675
That person is a rapist
When you say you're a murderer

948
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.928
The guy who sexually assaulted Jay
The guy who killed Gido-sik is also Song Je-hyuk

949
00:59:17.137 --> 00:59:18.847
[Shouting] Your husband threatened me!

950
00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:20.307
[Yoojeong] You really…

951
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:21.766
Yuna is right

952
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.602
[Yoojeong] Just like you think
That person...

953
00:59:23.977 --> 00:59:25.270
I'm not a terrible person

954
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:27.856
[Yoojeong] Although he denied it on the outside,

955
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.441
me too

956
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:32.027
I thought it might be possible

957
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.572
But when I heard the child's heartbeat,

958
00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:38.783
for a moment

959
00:59:39.451 --> 00:59:40.744
[Baby heartbeat sound]

960
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:44.122
Even if that's true
I even thought it wouldn't matter

961
00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.042
[heavy music]

962
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:50.211
That I would never be able to have children in my life
I thought about it

963
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.922
Because there is a child in my stomach

964
00:59:54.341 --> 00:59:56.134
I was crazy for a moment

965
00:59:58.553 --> 00:59:59.554
[sniffling sound]

966
01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:02.265
Then

967
01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:05.477
[Yuna] I’m in Tongju City
You know we have land, right?

968
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.562
you have land

969
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.856
I want to have a child

970
01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:12.651
[Jehyuk] I understand

971
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.403
I'll contact you when the documents are ready.

972
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.488
and

973
01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.407
Don't tell Yujeong

974
01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:21.284
If you know, it becomes complicated.

975
01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:22.911
[Yoojeong] I’ll save my life

976
01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.789
I saw them dealing with the land.

977
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.416
I was scared

978
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.754
Someday, the child in my stomach will also

979
01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.173
That person's ambition
It could be used

980
01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.967
So I went looking for it

981
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.513
Where prayers are buried

982
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.351
I felt like I would make up my mind if I went there.

983
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.563
I met the wrong guy again

984
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:54.234
I won't ruin my life
firm determination

985
01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:00.115
I know it's too late to turn back

986
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.283
But even now

987
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.286
With my Nana

988
01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.997
To protect the child in my stomach

989
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.042
I'm going to abandon that person

990
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.547
So are you going to divorce?

991
01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.757
[Haemi] Will he be obedient?

992
01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.259
I won't divorce

993
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.138
I'll kill you

994
01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.056
[Yoojeong] Our children

995
01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.851
As a child of such a devil
Because I can't make it

996
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:33.022
[Yuna] Do you guys remember?

997
01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.693
how did i approach you

998
01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.280
Same university as you
You said you were a student

999
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.283
It's late but I'm sorry

1000
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.578
I scammed you guys

1001
01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.416
Still you
What it means to be a fashion designer

1002
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.418
It wasn't really a lie

1003
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.129
You dressed very well

1004
01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.339
[Yoojeong] Yes

1005
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.717
It wasn't with bad intentions.

1006
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.469
It's true that it was done with bad intentions.

1007
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.013
[Meaningful music]

1008
01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.848
[Yuna] But then I got to know you guys

1009
01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:10.059
I really like you guys

1010
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.813
While I'm with you
I also have a dream

1011
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.357
That damn bar

1012
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:21.112
Get away from the gangsters
Dream of living a decent life

1013
01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:23.865
But

1014
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.078
[Sigh] I ruined you guys.

1015
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.293
To a guy like me praying
Even if I didn't introduce Yujeong

1016
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:39.088
Are you with Song Je-hyuk?
Because there was nothing to get involved with.

1017
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.018
That's why

1018
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.395
me

1019
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.649
I'm going to kill Song Je-hyuk

1020
01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.820
Fighting with my ex-husband over custody
I killed him by accident.

1021
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.446
[Yoojeong] If my husband is murdered

1022
01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:06.449
- The first thing he suspects is his wife.
- [Dark Music]

1023
01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.536
So the murder between the couple
They say it's common

1024
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:12.747
So I will do it

1025
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.666
A smart bitch can't beat a toxic bitch

1026
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.252
[Haemi] A toxic bitch
They say you can’t beat that crazy bitch.

1027
01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.087
I'm just taking drugs

1028
01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:21.297
I'm going to go crazy and kill that guy.

1029
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.549
Stop it, you guys.

1030
01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.802
[Jay] This revenge

1031
01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.555
It started because of me

1032
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.306
[Splendid music]

1033
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.641
So you too

1034
01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.726
Even your children

1035
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.312
Even innocent children in orphanages

1036
01:03:37.438 --> 01:03:39.065
It became dangerous because of me.

1037
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.653
Even if I finish it, I finish it

1038
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.239
You got to this point fighting alone

1039
01:03:47.448 --> 01:03:48.533
Stop it

1040
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:50.493
[Yuna] You’re the only one using poison.

1041
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.204
I won't leave you alone either.

1042
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:55.999
I can't stand it either

1043
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.876
[Haemi] The guy who almost killed you

1044
01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.627
i kill you

1045
01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:09.095
[Reporters' irritated words]

1046
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.687

[Employee] Please wait a moment.

1050
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:25.612
How much?

1051
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.033
[Yongpil] Just like this
Do you want to do it?

1052
01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:40.877
[Jay] Anyway, my purpose is
The goal was to catch that guy.

1053
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.253
Still

1054
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:46.257
You've been working hard all this time
That's because it's a waste.

1055
01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.803
Let's begin now

1056
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.056
[Jehyuk] Where the hell are you?

1057
01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.768
Even if I search the whole country
Didn’t I tell you to find Dojae?

1058
01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.022
I have to find Dojae to save him.
I'm not going to kill you! You bastard!

1059
01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:03.650
[Gwangcheol] Yes, I found it, but…

1060

- [Dark Music]
- Really? Where are you?

1061

[Gwangcheol] A breaking news just came out.

1062

- What?
- [Gwangcheol] Dojae live

1063
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:13.660
- [Gwangcheol] There’s a press conference.
- Press conference?

1064
01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:24.087
- [Sang-guk in the video] Candidate Jae-i Do
- [Camera shutter sound in video]

1065
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.590
That 10 years ago
This is my first time seeing you since the video scandal.

1066
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.176
I haven't even campaigned for a while.
What did you do?

1067
01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.681
- I've been pretty busy.
- [Camera shutter sound]

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.016
For worrying you

1069
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.184
sorry

1070
01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:41.312
[Jay] For now, I

1071
01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:43.314
- [Interesting Music]
- I'm going to let it all go.

1072
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.486
In the eyes of the media and public
Because I need to be free

1073
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.279
[Jay] No

1074
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.408
About that video
I have nothing to say

1075
01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.035
[Jay] Today I
The reason we gathered you all

1076
01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:57.328
Before

1077
01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:58.997
since this time

1078
01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:02.792
He is not a candidate for Tongju mayor.
I want to tell you something.

1079
01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.253
I will resign

1080
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.422
- [Reporters muttering]
- [Sang-guk] What is the reason?

1081
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:10.717
It fell after the video scandal.
Is it because of approval ratings?

1082
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.051
no

1083
01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:13.970
I

1084
01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.347
Because I have work to do

1085
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.685
[Jehyuk] Do Jae-i

1086
01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.272
What are you planning?

1087
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.066
[Sound of putting it down]

1088
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.776
[Haemi] Put everything down

1089
01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.278
What next?

1090
01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:31.821
And then…

1091
01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:36.909
[Jay] We’re having a party.

1092
01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:41.080
10 years ago, it was stained with blood

1093
01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.459
Same party as back then

1094
01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:48.713
At that time

1095
01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.174
Although we were played into his hands

1096
01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.510
It's different now

1097
01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.015
He's playing into our hands

1098
01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:02.727
The dress code is

1099
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.854
'Black'?

1100
01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.316
You have to be polite

1101
01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.902
Because it could be the last time

1102
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.075
After tonight

1103
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:20.453
we are born again

1104
01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:31.089
10 years ago

1105
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.424
Before I met that guy

1106
01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.469
beautiful and

1107
01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.180
confident

1108
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:43.184
To us back then

1109
01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.732
[nervous music]

1110
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.068
[Doorbell sounds]

1111
01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.159
[Door lock operating sound]

1112
01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:01.869
[Sound of door opening]

1113
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.538
[Employee] I’m here to clean.

1114
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:14.799
Hey there

1115
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:19.971
[screaming]

1116
01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.016
[secret music]

1117
01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.367
[Jehyuk] I suddenly have this thought.

1118
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.578
Why do I have to pick just one person?

1119
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.496
You can have it all

1120
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.415
[Yongpil] If something goes wrong

1121
01:08:47.498 --> 01:08:49.917
Lawyer
It could be a really big problem

1122
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.171
[Jay] Anyway, one of the two
It's a fight that ends only in death

1123
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.715
[Yuna] You should be a speaker

1124
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.092
{\an8}10 years ago, that guy came back

1125
01:08:58.593 --> 01:08:59.594
{\an8}Where is this bastard now?

1126
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:01.304
{\an8}[Yuna] The medicine is
Did you say Haemi was saving you?

1127
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:02.388
{\an8}[Haemi] The customer’s secret is

1128
01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.557
{\an8}You have to take it to the grave
You have to keep in mind

1129
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.184
{\an8}[Yoojeong] Obviously next to that guy

1130
01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.060
{\an8}There must be something I can do

1131
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.145
{\an8}Do well

1132
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.355
{\an8}[Yujeong] Quince tea is good for the bronchi.

1133
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.399
{\an8}You must be meeting a lot of people these days.

1134
01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.650
{\an8}I’m afraid it will be difficult

1135
01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:16.569
{\an8}- [Gwangcheol] Hey, stick together, stick even more
- [tire rubbing sound]

1136
01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.653
{\an8}Ah, more sticky!

1137
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:20.031
{\an8}[Jay] Are you going to die or am I going to die?

1138
01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:24.410
{\an8}[Anchor] At Cheonrang Orphanage in Tongju City
A shocking incident occurred

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.579
{\an8}[Jehyuk] I
Born in an orphanage with angels

1140
01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.372
{\an8}For unpleasant events
With a responsible mind

1141
01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:30.208
{\an8}[Sang-guk] Then now
Where is candidate Song Je-hyuk?

1142
01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.335
{\an8}- [Camera shutter sound]
- I don't know either.

1143
01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:34.712
{\an8}[Yoojeong] Wherever that person is

1144
01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:37.006
{\an8}I'm sure it's holding up well.
