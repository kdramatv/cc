00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.755
[Guide voice] For now
I don't answer the phone

183
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:52.965
- [Yuna’s exasperated breathing]
- Next time

184
00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:54.383
please walk

185
00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.593
- [Call end sound]
- [absurd breathing sound]

186
00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:57.761
Are you chewing my phone?

187
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.769
But where did Yujeong go?

188
00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.855
The child has reached this point

189
00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:12.526
don't ask me anything

190
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.612
[Woman] Because I don’t know anything

191
00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.616
Then I'll find out for myself.

192
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.743
- [Dark Music]
- [Yuna’s light sigh]

193
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.494
[Cell phone operation sound]

194
00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:24.330
- [Mobile phone touch sound]
- [Call connection tone]

195
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.292
"VIP Room"

196
00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:30.753
[Sound of clattering down]

197
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.215
[Jay] Yoo Jeong-ah

198
00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:35.799
Yuna is right

199
00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.802
The guy who raped me

200
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.263
The guy who killed the prayer ceremony

201
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.557
- [ECG monitor operating sound]
- This is your husband, Song Je-hyuk.

202
00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:45.059
[Painful breathing]

203
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.146
[groan]

204
00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.607
[Nurse] Why? Is your stomach full again?

205
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.234
[Yujeong’s painful breathing]

206
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.986
[Nurse sighs] So,
don't think anything

207
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.529
Please rest well.

208
00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:00.741
It is absolutely stable.

209
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.037
[Sigh] Hey, maybe

210
00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.290
[Yoojeong] Have you seen my cell phone?

211
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.376
It's not in my bag.

212
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:13.921
Well, when you fall
Who took care of it separately?

213
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.426
[Nurse] But that too
don't look

214
00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:22.596
The guardian
You were very kind.

215
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.307
Something to be stressed about
Never give anything away

216
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.851
[Small] Rest.

217
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:30.521
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

218
00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.107
[Meaningful music]

219
00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:41.740
[Kanghu] Confirmed

220
00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:45.661
member list
I have all the money transaction details.

221
00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.624
But there is one thing that holds me back

222
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.132
[nervous music]

223
00:20:58.507 --> 00:20:59.633
The general manager of the club

224
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.176
It's called Yoo-jeong.

225
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.596
Actually, Song Je-hyuk's name is nowhere to be found.

226
00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:07.016
Then even if you report it

227
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.392
He gets away

228
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.769
Instead, Yujeong gets hurt?

229
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:13.147
[Kanghu] So I looked again and

230
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:16.317
Money transaction details and payments
Yujeong did it all.

231
00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.113
No way, even Mr. Yoo-jeong

232
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:22.781
Do you know about this club?

233
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:24.616
no

234
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.036
Yujeong is definitely not that type of person.

235
00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:30.539
[Jay] That guy runs a club
It was disguised as a daycare center.

236
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:34.418
Customers as sponsors
Club membership fees are donations.

237
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.628
children at orphanage
By thoroughly using it

238
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.088
[Kanghu] Then

239
00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.923
How about meeting Yujeong?

240
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.302
If Yoo-jeong knows the truth,
I won't change my mind

241
00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.263
[Yujeong is crying] You guys
No matter what you say

242
00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.848
I trust Jehyuk

243
00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:49.475
That's it

244
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.020
Because it's for my child

245
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:56.982
[light sigh]

246
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.650
It's probably no use

247
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.737
Do you have any photos of the club?
Is there any video or something?

248
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.864
[Jay] I couldn’t film it.

249
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.492
You should leave your cell phone with us when entering.

250
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.244
There wasn't even a CCTV in the hall.

251
00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.707
However, in children’s bodies
By attaching some kind of hidden camera or something

252
00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:15.125
Looks like they're filming

253
00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.711
[Sigh] I couldn’t find that video.

254
00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:19.546
How about looking for a witness?

255
00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:22.883
[Kanghu] Who is in charge of the club?

256
00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:24.384
You could testify.

257
00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:26.804
Who will come over?

258
00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:28.472
They're all under him.

259
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.313
Hey there

260
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:41.068
[Kanghu] I’m at the orphanage.
I know a child, Yuna.

261
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.237
like you

262
00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.948
If you go, you're a traumatized child.

263
00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:48.534
Trauma if you go?

264
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.410
[Kanghu] I’m not sure, but

265
00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.413
Doing something similar to you
I might have been hit

266
00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:57.960
Hey, Mr. Kang-hoo.

267
00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:00.671
Please let me meet that child

268
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.757
I really need to meet you

269
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.053
[Secretary Choi] That data is
It's no use?

270
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:11.306
Still there is a problem

271
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:14.768
Dojae sees the club with his own eyes
I checked it carefully

272
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:17.479
If customers know that

273
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.566
You won’t leave Song Je-hyuk alone, right?

274
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.276
Who do you think is a fool?

275
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.194
You think I don't know that?

276
00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:28.198
[Jehyuk sighs]

277
00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:29.783
don't worry

278
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.785
before customers know

279
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:35.289
Dojae, I will step on it perfectly

280
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.293
- [Uneasy music]
- [Sighing with a sneer]

281
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.800
[Jehyuk] Why haven’t you contacted me, Hae-mi?

282
00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:48.635
Are you testing my patience?

283
00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.471
[Sound of cell phone closing]

284
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:52.931
[Frightened breathing]

285
00:23:58.061 --> 00:24:01.148
[Manok] Our Haemi
I'm not that kind of guy [laughter]

286
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:06.069
So that big hotel
I even became vice president [laughter]

287
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.155
- [Call waiting tone]
- Oh, I got a call again.

288
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:10.699
Then, please come by sometime.

289
00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.202
I will treat you kindly.

290
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.745
[Laughs] Yeah

291
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.330
[sigh]

292
00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:17.664
- [Continued call waiting tone]
- [Mobile phone button sound]

293
00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:18.999
[Sound of taking a breath]

294
00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:21.210
Yes, Minister Koo.

295
00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:25.005
Oh, that's not true.

296
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:28.300
Yes, thank you for your concern.

297
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:29.760
yes

298
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:31.220
[breathing sound]

299
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:33.722
[frustrated sigh]

300
00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:35.933
[Manok’s deep sigh]

301
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:37.517
- [Dark Music]
- [Man-ok’s surprised gasp]

302
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:45.442
[disgusted breathing]

303
00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.403
The best hotel in Korea
A kid called Vice President

304
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:49.947
What does this look like?

305
00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:53.951
Should I go shopping with mom? huh?
Why not try sweeping it?

306
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:56.370
[Crying] Mom

307
00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:58.205
I'm sorry

308
00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:00.082
What are you sorry about?

309
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:01.750
One mistake in the past
Is there anyone who hasn't?

310
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.543
[Manok] That kind of video

311
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.545
One top star dating rumor
It's something to be buried in

312
00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.047
[shaking breathing]

313
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.674
[Crying] Mom, that’s not it…

314
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:13.470
[Haemi’s crying]

315
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.641
[Sobbing] Mom

316
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.811
please save me

317
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.982
Mom, please save me, Mom [crying]

318
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:29.444
What else is going on with you?

319
00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:32.781
He took that picture
It's strangling my neck

320
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.324
[Hae-mi in a trembling voice] Mom
What should I do?

321
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.326
What should I do?

322
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.829
What should I do? What should I do?

323
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.915
If what he wants is a ledger

324
00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:43.000
[Man-ok] I have to give it to you.

325
00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:46.837
[siren sound]

326
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.589
[ECG meter operating sound]

327
00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.347
[Nana] A pretty lady

328
00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.475
When did the lady come?

329
00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:04.855
Nana

330
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.566
Are you okay?

331
00:26:12.863 --> 00:26:14.531
But what about Mom?

332
00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:17.451
Is my mom still sick?

333
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:19.578
Mom

334
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:21.913
Does it hurt?

335
00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:24.041
[Sound of door opening]

336
00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.045
- [Nana] Dad
- [Jehyuk] Oh, it’s Nana.

337
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.382
I heard the story from my aunt.

338
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.551
my nana
thank you for your care

339
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.141
Was I in a lot of pain?

340
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:44.144
It hurt just like last time.

341
00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:46.980
- Head and stomach
- [Dark Music]

342
00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:48.106
[Yuna] Last time?

343
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.358
Isn't this the first time this has happened?

344
00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:53.487
Let's go out and talk.

345
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:02.704
- [Yuna’s angry breathing]
- [Sound of door slamming shut]

346
00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:07.250
The kid has gotten to that point.
Are you showing up now?

347
00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:08.710
Are you a human bastard?

348
00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:11.171
Thanks to that, Nana and I
You could have stayed all night

349
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.881
Rather, I should be grateful.
Doesn't it work?

350
00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:15.967
tell me

351
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.345
How many times did you do that while I was gone?

352
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:20.764
[Sigh] I did that a few times.

353
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.724
[Jehyuk] If I end up in the hospital,

354
00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:24.309
It'll get better soon, don't worry

355
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:26.228
What's okay with that?

356
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:29.815
[Yuna] The doctor said that
That disease is not a disease that can be cured.

357
00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:32.025
[Shouting] If something goes wrong
I need a liver transplant!

358
00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:34.027
I am the legal guardian.

359
00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:35.862

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.589
Of course we are family

542
00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:04.801
[Jay] In an anxious state of mind
Judgment becomes clouded

543
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:07.220
Rather, to bad people
I lean on it

544
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.555
You just need to listen carefully

545
00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.224
[Jay] The bad guys

546
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:14.268
The victims
They're using that mentality.

547
00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.440
I can't even report it

548
00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:21.734
Rather, take their side.

549
00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:25.822
But even if you report it anyway
People like that don't get punished.

550
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:29.158
Because they are very high-ranking people

551
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.911
That's right

552
00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:35.498
They say force is stronger than law

553
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.210
[Jay] But that power is

554
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:43.464
It doesn't just mean money, power, or anything like that.

555
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.384
having courage

556
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:48.344
not giving up

557
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.139
That also gave me strength

558
00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:55.768
No matter how much you say, I can’t report it.

559
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:58.271
I don't look like a lawyer.

560
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.150
[Yuna] I don’t have courage and I’m quick to give up.

561
00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:10.408
[Jay] This is a secret

562
00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:12.702
I'm a coward too

563
00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:16.789
[sigh]

564
00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:19.125
It's already been 10 years

565
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:21.836
When I still think about that day

566
00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:25.506
It's so scary and terrible

567
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.258
So creepy

568
00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:32.847
And yet

569
00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.267
I caught him
The thing about not giving up

570
00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:41.022
Bad guys do bad things
It's not just a one-time thing.

571
00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:42.899
and

572
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:45.276
I don't even do it to just one person.

573
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.738
if we are silent

574
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:52.116
Someone else could get hurt too

575
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:59.165
that's what i love
It could be a person

576
00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:05.379
[nervous music]

577
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.011
[shaking breathing]

578
00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:16.599
[sniffling sound]

579
00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:21.729
Yeonya
If it's hard, you don't have to do anything

580
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.608
Just don't give up on yourself

581
00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:29.278
That's it

582
00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:32.198
That's what I want to tell you

583
00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:46.587
[Kanghu] If anything happens, be sure to contact me

584
00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.174
[Jay] Yeji

585
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:53.719
Maybe at a stationery store?
Didn't you get a pretty brooch?

586
00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:57.473
The stationery store owner
I said I gave it to Yeji.

587
00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:00.017
[Yeji] Yes, I received it.

588
00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:01.686
[Jay] Really?

589
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.938
You need to keep that in mind.

590
00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:09.694
If something happens to Yeji,
I'll run right away

591
00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.696

593
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.742
Dojae met Yuna.

594
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.579
[Jehyuk] Do Jae Yi meet Yuna?

595
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:21.289
[Director] Yes, yes

596
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:26.085
How on earth do you take care of kids?
How do you do it?

597
00:42:26.168 --> 00:42:27.336
[Takes a deep breath]

598
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.546
What should I do?

599
00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:30.590
Should we lock the kids up?

600
00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:33.009
Are you going to lock them up for the rest of their lives?

601
00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:36.345
If you don't go to school for one day
The investigation is coming right away?

602
00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:45.855
Dojae says to the kids
Maybe they planted something

603
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:48.649
Look through your kids' belongings.

604
00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:50.985
Even the trash can

605
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:55.948

[knock knock sound]

608
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:02.830
- Yes
- [Sound of door opening]

609
00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:05.958
The item arrived quickly

610
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.877
- Oh, give it to me.
- [Sound of approaching footsteps]

611
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:11.255
[Jehyuk] Yes

612
00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:13.591
[Sound of footsteps moving away]

613
00:43:25.478 --> 00:43:27.063

[Meaningful music]

615
00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:34.362
This is

616
00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:36.656
It's not Dojae's ledger, right?

617
00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:40.660
[Haemi] Ace Bar’s
This is a money laundering ledger.

618
00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:43.663
But Jehyuk, really
I guess it was the ace of the ace bar.

619
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.247
You made a lot of money, right?

620
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:48.584
how
Would this be a good deal?

621
00:43:58.427 --> 00:43:59.428

Ah, yes, thank you for your hard work.

625
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.451
It's a police station, right?

626
00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.329
I just want to report something.

627
00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:28.958
Located in Gonggok District, Tongzhou City

628
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.544
It's a bar called 'Ace Bar'.

629
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.045

[Junghyun yelling] Dojae-i
You were like this, right?

633
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.434
By stabbing me with a knife like this!

634
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.518
jeon…

635
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.228
[Kanghu] ‘Very much’
He looked confused'

636

'The charge of killing Gido-sik is denied'

637
00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:53.315
I was raped

638
00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:55.901
[Kanghu] ‘But in that room
There was another man'

639
00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:58.529
'To that man
Claimed to have been sexually assaulted

640
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:01.073
The on-site verification was completed completely.

641
00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:03.200
In that hotel room that day

642
00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:05.911
Other than Mr. Gido-sik
There was no trace of the other man.

643
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.247
[Kanghu] ‘But there’s not enough evidence’

644

in the bar bathroom

645
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.627
Ecstasy and condoms
I heard there were that many?

646
00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:15.880
[Junghyun] Are you on drugs?
Aren't you mistaken?

647
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.923
[Kanghu] ‘Drunk
'Concluded that it was a mistake'

648
00:45:20.009 --> 00:45:22.887

I didn't believe Jay.

[Soaring music]

650
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.394
Just leave the place
Where have you been, huh?

651
00:45:30.478 --> 00:45:31.479
[Eunsu] No, that’s…

652
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.148
[Kanghu] ‘Why?
'At the time of the estimated incident'

[Kanghu’s sigh]

658
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:48.704
I think there's something there

659
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.002
What is this?

660
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.339
Did you have a camera?

661
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.594
‘In the room at the time’

'There was a battery charger'

‘Memory card not found’

665
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:16.690
But this camera

[camera shutter sound]

667
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:37.461
Hey bro, it's been a while
Is the studio doing well?

668
00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:42.716
the photo i just sent
Can you please confirm?

669
00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.844
With that camera model

670
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.597
underneath
Is this the correct battery model?

671
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:52.184
[Minsu] This battery charger is
It doesn't fit this camera

672
00:46:52.268 --> 00:46:54.562
So, it's a different model.

674
00:47:01.443 --> 00:47:02.444
Uh, bro, thanks.

Come to our store sometime soon
Let's take a look

676
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:06.949
Yeah

677
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:17.710
Then there are two cars in that room
I mean there was a camera.

678
00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.296
Song Je-hyuk must have taken one.

679
00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:23.382
Then the other one…

680
00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:31.432
Made my son a rapist

681
00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:33.142
Are you hungry now?

682
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.353
[Jay] Hmm

683
00:47:37.479 --> 00:47:38.897
If I were to ask,

684
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.234
I am the congressman's son
I didn't make him a rapist.

685
00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:44.194
Song Je-hyuk did it.

[sigh]

687
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.451

[Clears cough] I don’t know, I don’t know.

692
00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:07.635
[Laughing absurdly] Are you pretending not to know?

693
00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:11.597
then what is it
I'll tell you

what is that club

698
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.071
Who goes in?

699
00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:29.031
What are you doing?

00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:34.870
- [Sound of clicking lipstick lid closing]
- But I'm curious.

701
00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.498
[Jay] Are you a simple member?

702
00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:39.083
Is it the body?

703
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:42.711
Is he one with Song Je-hyuk or not?

704
00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:45.964
But it doesn't matter what it is

705
00:48:46.548 --> 00:48:47.716
What is clear is

706
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.178
Song Je-hyuk is already dead.

707
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.391
If customers find out that the data was leaked

708
00:48:55.974 --> 00:48:57.059
Would you leave him alone?

709
00:48:58.352 --> 00:49:01.730
Right now, from the congressman
You probably want to kill him

710
00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:07.403
You know how to cut off the tail, right?

711
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.573
customers
It makes me abandon Song Je-hyuk.

712
00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:15.911
Then you might survive

You know, our security is strict.

717
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.053

719
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.849
Honey, CEO, CEO…

720
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.857
How on earth did the rumor spread?

721
00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:50.612
Tell me, what's the big deal?

722
00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:54.241
[President Jeong] Club
VIP customers

723
00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:57.578
Some people came here today
There was an uproar

724
00:49:57.911 --> 00:49:58.912
I'm going out to the club

725
00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:00.706
Why?

726
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:03.459
Is this true?

727
00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:06.336
Club data leaked outside?

728
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.423
When members leave the club
What should I do?

729
00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.632
[President Jeong’s thoughts]

730
00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:14.386
'When club secrets are exposed
'Compensation is double the membership price'

731
00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.890
[President Jeong] I
But money is money too

732
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:21.685
The chairman
Aren't you in trouble?

733
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:23.687
- [Dark Music]
- They're angry

734
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:25.230
- [President Jeong] If you turn the tables...
- [Jehyuk] Hey

735
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.191
Are you going to criticize me?

736
00:50:27.566 --> 00:50:29.485
Taking drugs and having fun with women

737
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.320
Who has that video?

738
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:34.990
[ice clattering sound]

739
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.911
[Sound of putting down a glass]

740
00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:43.624
Tell it to members

741
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:45.542
Be quiet

742
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:47.711
[Jehyuk] That leaked data

743
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:50.964
Don't let me go out into the world
Because I will bury it

744
00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:53.675
[siren sound]

745
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.555
- [Knock knock sound]
- [Sound of door opening]

746
00:50:58.639 --> 00:50:59.640
[Nurse] Joo Yu-jeong

747
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.391
[Sound of door closing]

748
00:51:05.354 --> 00:51:07.272
It's time to go to the ultrasound exam room.

749
00:51:10.108 --> 00:51:11.109
Ultrasound?

750
00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:14.363
[Light laughter] In the beginning
Because the baby is so small

751
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:16.698
It was difficult to confirm, but maybe…

752
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.826
Well, you'll see today.

753
00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.578
[Calm music]

754
00:51:36.134 --> 00:51:37.135
[sigh]

755
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.805
[Cell phone operation sound]

756
00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:43.433
[cell phone vibrates]

757
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:44.518
[cell phone button sound]

758
00:51:46.144 --> 00:51:47.145
Hello?

759
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:48.772
Yes, aunt.

760
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:51.400
[Woman] Over there
Can you please come to the hospital?

761
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.985
[nervous music]

762
00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.617
- [Sound of clinking dishes]
- [Sigh]

763
00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:03.120
What's going on today? Eat meat too

764
00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:04.538
[light laughter]

765
00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:06.707
[Jay] Try to cheer up

766
00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:09.585
Because we need a last-minute spurt

767
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:10.669
Last minute?

768
00:52:11.837 --> 00:52:13.088
Looks like things are going well.

769
00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:18.594
Angels Club members
I started pecking at Song Je-hyuk.

770
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.678
[Meaningful music]

771
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.471
[Jay] If you beat Song Je-hyuk like that,

772
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.974
They'll probably fight among themselves.

773
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:27.853
People originally united in secret

774
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.230
The moment the secret is leaked
Because we become enemies

775
00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:32.524
But Song Je-hyuk

776
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.526
Are you being bullied quietly?

777
00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:36.778
They will struggle

778
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:38.322
But

779
00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:41.033
People who will protect you
In a situation where everyone turns their backs

780
00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:42.576
It won't be easy, right?

781
00:52:43.076 --> 00:52:44.077
[Kanghu] Still, be careful

782
00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:47.664
If you lose your temper
Because he's the guy who will do anything

783
00:52:55.088 --> 00:52:56.214
[Jehyuk] Do you know?

784
00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:59.468
Chairman's daughter
How can you be so reckless?

785
00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:00.969
[nervous music]

786
00:53:02.054 --> 00:53:04.264
Please answer
I'm asking!

787
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.768
If you overdo it, you'll get in trouble.

788
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.519
- [Soaring music]
- Yes?

789
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.314
you have too much
You're trying to have it

790
00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:16.443
And then
I made too many enemies

791
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.572
I wanted you to be mayor

792
00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:23.408
It was nothing more or less

793
00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:25.619
Are you going to do this to the Chairman?

794
00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:29.164
[Jehyuk] I am like this
The reason for Adeungba Lighthouse is

795
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.375
Everyone wants to become mayor
Isn’t it like this?

796
00:53:32.834 --> 00:53:34.753
How did I get here?

797
00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.588
What are you doing?

798
00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:42.260
Just wait and see

799
00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.681
I will definitely become mayor
So

800
00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:49.059
I will create my own kingdom in Tongzhou City.

801
00:53:49.685 --> 00:53:50.686
But

802
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:53.480
If someone blocks the way

803
00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:55.399
I won't leave you alone

804
00:53:58.944 --> 00:54:00.570
Even if it's the president's daughter

805
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.336
[Yuna’s urgent breathing]

806
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:19.506
[Yuna] What happened?

807
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.883
Why did Nana suddenly
Did you go to the intensive care unit?

808
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:25.512
The fever doesn't go down
What number has gone up...

809
00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.680
Bilirubin levels?

810
00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:27.973
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that

811
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.850
It went up so I moved it quickly.

812
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:31.935
[Woman] I’m feeling better now

813
00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:34.438
Tomorrow
They say I can move to a regular room.

814
00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.400
But what?

815
00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:40.736
[Urgently] Please tell me quickly!

816
00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:44.239
I think I need a liver transplant.

817
00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:46.116
[heavy music]

818
00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:48.910
[Woman] For more details
Ask me or dad

819
00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:51.204
Me and Dad
Because I spoke to the doctor

820
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.336
[cell phone ringing sound]

821
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:02.674
[Button sound]

822
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.469
Why do you keep calling me?

823
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.471
[Yuna] It’s me, Song Je-hyuk

824
00:55:10.223 --> 00:55:11.224
Go Yoona?

825
00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:13.351
you

826
00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:16.104
They say I need a liver transplant.
Did you hear?

827
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:20.150
Uh, I spoke to the doctor.

828
00:55:21.777 --> 00:55:23.111
But are you still?

829
00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:24.863
[Shouting] A man called Dad!

830
00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:27.532
Do you want to hang up?

831
00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:28.658
[Angrily breathing]

832
00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:30.243
- [Jehyuk] If you keep doing this
- [Sigh]

833
00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:31.953
You don’t even get your aunt’s number?

834
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.121
[Sound of intake of breath]

835
00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:34.915
Liver donation [sigh]

836
00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.834
I'll do it, let's do the surgery quickly.

837
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.169
[Yuna] Huh?

838
00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:42.047
How many times should I say it? you don't deserve it

839
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:44.466
[Jehyuk] To donate liver

840
00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:47.469
Donor-recipient relationship
Everything needs to be revealed

841
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.346
I know you were my ex-wife

842
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.972
I don't want to reveal it to the world

843
00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:52.933
[Shouting] Then you do it!

844
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.643
You're the dad!

845
00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:56.311
[Jehyuk] The election is less than a month away

846
00:55:56.394 --> 00:55:57.771
Where do I have time?

847
00:55:58.146 --> 00:56:00.690
And the kid is sick.

848
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.360
My dad is campaigning for elections.
Then

849
00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:06.029
What is my image?

850
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.865
Are elections important to you?

851
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:11.326
The kids are all dying!

852
00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:12.577
‘That kind of election’?

853
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.747
[Shouting] Hey
If I lose this election, I will die!

854
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.168
[Sighing] I am now

855
00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:23.004
Do you have time to worry about anything else?

856
00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:24.214
[In a crying voice] You

857
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:27.050
Are you really crazy?

858
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.679
Because I'm having another child
Is Nana insignificant now?

859
00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.056
[sigh]

860
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.310
Liver donation and whatnot?

861
00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:39.855
Everything

862
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:43.066
After I won the election

863
00:56:46.153 --> 00:56:47.654
[Sighing] Hey, this is what happened

864
00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.073
This too

865
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.784
It's all fate

866
00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:54.786
[Call end sound]

867
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:57.831
[Screaming] Hey, hey, hey, Song Je-hyuk!

868
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.208
[Haemi] I asked if there was a deal.

869
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.085
- Why is there no answer?
- [Message sending sound]

870
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.879
[clattering sound]

871
00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:09.801
[Sound of putting it down]

872
00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:14.764
Why? What's good?

873
00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:17.559
[Sound of intake of breath]

874
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:20.979
[Laughing slightly] No.

875
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.274
If it gets resolved later
I'll explain then

876
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:26.610
Okay then

877
00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:30.864
[Haemi] Wait a minute

878
00:57:32.199 --> 00:57:33.283
Wine with body

879
00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:35.452
A glass with a wide mouth
I said it was good

880
00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:37.829
That way the flavor is released better.

881
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:39.414
[Realized elasticity]

882
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:43.585
I'll prepare another glass for you.

883
00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:44.669
[Hae-mi's breathing sounds mixed with laughter]

884
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:47.380
[Haemi’s laughter]

885
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:49.841
[The sound of Leo's footsteps moving away]

886
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.471
[glass clattering sound]

887
00:57:54.763 --> 00:57:56.056

[Cell phone operation sound]

891
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.488
Yes, this is Chareo’s cell phone.

892
00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:14.533
[Police] Yes, this is Gunggok Police Station.
This is the drug investigation team.

893
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:18.119
- [Uneasy music]
- From the drug investigation team

894
00:58:18.745 --> 00:58:19.746
Why?

895
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.206
[Police] It’s about Ace Bar.

896
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.708
Oh, isn't it you, Chareo?

897
00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:28.880
I'm not there right now

898
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.383
