00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.350
Is this your first time seeing me?

181
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.102
My fiance, Song Je-hyuk

182
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.773
Nice to meet you, my name is Dojae.

183
00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.692
Hello, this is Song Jehyuk.

184
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:15.281
Strangely enough, I
It doesn't feel like I'm seeing you for the first time

185
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.825
To Mr. Yujeong
But I've heard so much about it

186
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:22.246
[Haemi laughs] That’s Jae-yi.
It's because it appears on TV so often.

187
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.332
I saw a celebrity at the hotel the other day

188
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.292
'Huh? hey!' And

189
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.502
- You hit me on the back.
- [Leo’s laughter]

190
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.628
I thought he was my younger brother [laughter]

191
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.629
[Leo] I

192
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.756
- Now, now, now, let’s not be like this.
- [Haemi’s laughter]

193
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.008
Let’s all go have a drink together.

194
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.843
My older sister, Jay, is running for office.
Let's celebrate too

195
00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.095
- [Leo] Let’s go.
- Oh, there

196
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:42.266
[Jay] Today I
I'm not feeling well, so...

197
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.102
Hey, we got together because of you, is that why?

198
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.521
[Haemi] Go, go and relieve yourself.

199
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.064
Are you okay too?

200
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.359
Uh, can we...

201
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:54.862
[Jehyuk] Let’s go

202
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.990
You can't miss out on Jay's congratulations.

203
00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.286
[Haemi] Okay, let’s go

204
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.247
I'm having a drink on a day like this

205
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.331
[Leo] Let’s go

206
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.459
- [Haemi] Come quickly!
- [Yoojeong] Uh

207
00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.089
[Haemi and Leo’s footsteps moving away]

208
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.424
What's going on?

209
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.843
You don’t like drinking places with a lot of people.

210
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.387
Still, I have to go

211
00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.431
These are Yujeong’s friends.

212
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.516
[breath mixed with laughter]

213
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.226
- [Interesting Music]
- [Leo] Ta-da

214
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:27.228
[Elasticity]

215
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.980
- [Haemi’s laughter]
- [Leo] Now

216
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.189
[Yujeong’s laughter]

217
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.315
Jay's older sister

218
00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:32.817
Brother

219
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.152
Ah, sister

220
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.403
- [Yujeong’s breathing mixed with laughter]
- Now

221
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.571
[Haemi] Fish oil

222
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.822
- [Sound of strong breathing]
- [Haemi’s laughter]

223
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.074
- Hey, please wake up.
- [Ice rattling sound]

224
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.742
- [Haemi] Okay, okay, let’s wake up.
- [Leo] Wake up, sister.

225
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.328
[Leo] Okay then

226
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.039
For sister Jae-i’s election!

227
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.166
[Haemi, Leo] For!

228
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.834
[Together] For!

229
00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.043
- [Haemi and Leo cheer]
-Thank you

230
00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.336
[ice clattering sound]

231
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.007
[Sound of swallowing]

232
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.926
[Leo and Haemi’s cool elasticity]

233
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.052
[Leo’s cool breathing]

234
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.721
[Leo] Huh?

235
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.056
Hey, sister, the first drink is one shot.

236
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.726
I'm sorry
I don't think it will go over well

237
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.313
[Leo] I’ll definitely skip this one.
Why?

238
00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.774
This, a certain golden ratio in Cheongdam-dong
Because it is a liquor made

239
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:14.901
Yes, try it.

240
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.152
[Hae-mi's breathing sounds mixed with laughter]

241
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.487
[Yoojeong] Mr. Leo

242
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.864
Our Jay is
Don't offer too much alcohol

243
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.327
Jae-yi, a drink poured by a man
I never drink it

244
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.412
- [shocked breathing]
- [Leo] Oh, why?

245
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.707
Long time ago, some guy
Spit on alcohol?

246
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.917
[Laughing] Oh my!

247
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.001
[Haemi, Yujeong’s throat cough]

248
00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.129
[Leo's breathing sounds mixed with laughter]

249
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.257
[dark music]

250
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.057
[Jay's exasperated breathing]

251
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.142
[eerie sound effect]

252
00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.145
- [Jay’s surprised gasp]
- [Intense sound effect]

253
00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.444
[Leo is frustrated] Ah, sister.

254
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.906
Oh, just the alcohol we give you
Let’s have a drink, Solka.

255
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.158
Here to sister Jay
Where is the man?

256
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.995
I'm our Haemi older sister
Jehyuk's older brother is Yujeong's older sister.

257
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:09.914
[Jehyuk’s light smile]

258
00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:13.960
But...

259
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.422
Then, let’s have some alcohol.

260
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.222
[Jehyuk] Why?

261
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.975
[Laughing] Do I look like a man, do I?

262
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:34.730
[Jehyuk’s light smile]

263
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.567
[panicked breathing]

264
00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.778
[Sound of picking up a glass]

265
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.238
I'll have a drink, alcohol

266
00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.448
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

267
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.659
[ice clattering sound]

268
00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.328
[Kanghu] Please stop.
To people who don't like it

269
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.164
[Leo] Ah, bro

270
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.043
I think Jae-ni was nervous.
I'm asking you to let me off the hook.

271
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.128
Well…

272
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.255
Don't do that, come quickly too.
Let's have a drink

273
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:00.548
[Jehyuk] If anyone sees

274
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.550
[Laughing] Mr. Jay
Do you think it's my boyfriend?

275
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:03.634
The boss

276
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.556
[Meaningful music]

277
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.686
That's right, boyfriend.

278
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.776
So you qualify?

279
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.654
I have the right to not let Jay drink alcohol.

280
00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:27.658
[Leo] Huh? [Laughter and exclamation]

281
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.119
Sister Jae-i and brother Kang-hoo!

282
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.663
It's 'Congratulation', hey, this is it

283
00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.665
It’s hotter than declaring candidacy.

284
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.918
[Haemi] Look, what did I say?

285
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.713
He said no and said,

286
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.466
- [Haemi’s laughter]
- [Leo] Now, now, now

287
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.550
Brother, please sit down quickly.

288
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.261
So this time I, um

289
00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.932
Las Vegas style
I'll roll it up for you

290
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.350
- [Haemi] Good
- [Leo] Good

291
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.434
[Interesting music]

292
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:54.977
[rattling sound]

293
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.164
[Sound of pouring alcohol]

294
00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:33.683
[Meaningful sound effects]

295
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:37.979
[Yuncheol] Thank you for your hard work

296
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.114
[Yuna] Did you see it? Dojae

297
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.409
Were you surprised to see the congressman?

298
00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.576
[Yuncheol] Well

299
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.037
I think I'm a little surprised

300
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.247
But what?

301
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.041
That killed my son
I don't think that means

302
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.627
Jay has changed a lot.

303
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:04.797
[Yuna] It used to be like that
I wasn't shameless

304
00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:08.009
[Yuncheol] I heard you
If you think you believe it 100%

305
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.176
It's an illusion

306
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.346
the police obviously

307
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.057
They said you were the criminal

308
00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.977
my son last
The person who sent the text

309
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.395
It was you

310
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:23.107
And on the spot
You said your stuff was found too?

311
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.319
- [Meaningful music]
- It's a trap.

312
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.823
Someone is trying to make me a criminal

313
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.118
Who?

314
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.664
[Yuncheol’s absurd laughter]

315
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.292
[Yuncheol] Hey, this

316
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.087
You have a very Pacific imagination.
Huh?

317
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.590
Even if I search the whole world

318
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:51.761
I want to find the real culprit
This is how the father feels.

319
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.554
It's not just Abby.

320
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:55.890
- [Yuna] Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
- [Soaring music]

321
00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.475
My son died anyway

322
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.935
If you think about your future political actions

323
00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.855
likes to ask and argue
Rather than a lawyer

324
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.066
An easy-going bar girl
Being a criminal

325
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.275
Wasn't it better?

326
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.862
But are you going to start a full-fledged presidential election?

327
00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.573
Even that must have been annoying?

328
00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.535
Get me out of jail
So much so that they are kicked out of this land.

329
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.080
[Disapproving exclamation]

330
00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.086
[Yuna] Are you telling me to leave?

331
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.588
[Secretary Choi] What the old man said

332
00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.548
I'm just passing it on.

333
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.345
[Yuncheol] So

334
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.514
Why did you come to me?

335
00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.016
Let’s reinvestigate it now

336
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:43.270
I want Do Jae-i to be put in jail.
Do you want to say something?

337
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:44.355
[Yuna] No

338
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.524
I will take revenge on Dojae.

339
00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:49.860
For a big guy like you
I have to accept something bigger

340
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.154
[absurd gasping sound]

341
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:53.948
[laughter]

342
00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.828
[Yuncheol] You want to keep me as insurance
I think it's a masterpiece

343
00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:01.497
What if you don’t like it?

344
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.791
I can't do it

345
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.670
your son in the grave
There is no choice but to take out the corpse.

346
00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.089
[Yuna] Then your son
What kind of guy was he

347
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.841
What did you do that led to your death?

348
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.760
It will be revealed to the world

349
00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.346
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol, the next presidential candidate

350
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.602
To Grand Gangbo Hotel
Could you take me there?

351
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.981
I'm there
I'm staying in a suite.

352
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.442
The place where Rep. Ki’s son died

[Yuna’s laughter]

354
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.454
[Door bell sounds]

355
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.916
[Call connection tone]

356
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.626
[Yongpil] Attorney

357
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.296
I checked and
It is best sold at a local stationery store.

358
00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.175
There is nothing strange about the owner either.
I don't think there is one

359
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.343
- [Sighing] Yes.
- [Elegant music plays]

360
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:59.305
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

361
00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.476
[Yoojeong] I mean Leo.

362
00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:08.981
- It was like that earlier.
- [glass clattering sound]

363
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.193
What's worse is that Mr. Kang-hoo appears.

364
00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.277
[Bewildered] Oh my

365
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.280
What made Kang-hoo angry was
Is it because of Jehyuk?

366
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.282
[Haemi] I thought the two of you were going to have a fight earlier.

367
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.827
[Sigh] That’s our Jehyuk

368
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.163
It's because I'm trying to accommodate Mr. Leo.

369
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:27.708
Guess our Leo?

370
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.169
Guess what?

371
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.298
- [Haemi] I’ve felt this for a long time.
- [Sound of putting down a glass]

372
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.718
you secretly
Do you know that we are ignoring Leo?

373
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.930
how many times have i
We were supposed to have a couple's get-together, but they threw it away.

374
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.057
I didn't like it

375
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.352
Our Leo
Meeting Jehyuk in the same class

376
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.395
[Haemi and Yujeong laugh]

377
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.981
Where is that word?

378
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:53.984
That's just

379
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:56.195
Jay doesn't have a boyfriend.

380
00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.613
[Yoojeong] Between us
Having a meeting like that

381
00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.822
I feel a bit sorry...

382
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.866
Hey, don't lie, I can see it all

383
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.452
[Haemi] You know that, right?

384
00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.997
Pork belly or pork belly
Are they all the same pork?

385
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.752
Leona Jehyuk
In the end, it's all the same

386
00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:13.462
Sticking a straw in a woman's back

387
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.257
Have you said everything?

388
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.591
[Making a yawning sound] No
I didn't do it all

389
00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.511
[Haemi] I saw you earlier, Jehyuk.

390
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.221
He had talent

391
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.807
'Do I look like a man, do I?'

392
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.891
- [Haemi’s snort]
- [Sigh]

393
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.602
[Haemi] Do your research well before getting married.

394
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.773
With that ironclad talent
Is there a child hidden somewhere?

395
00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:46.996
[Jay] Why did you do that earlier?

396
00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:51.625
He's my boyfriend

397
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:55.879
just

398
00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:58.507
[Kanghu] Give me something
I think it's rude

399
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.802
You hate rude people

400
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:04.513
[Calm music]

401
00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:07.850
Why?

402
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:09.435
what?

403
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.103
Why do you look at me like that?

404
00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:13.897
[light laughter]

405
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.027
Thank you for helping me

406
00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:22.990
[Sighing] But

407
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.285
It's true that I'm sensitive today

408
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:29.747
[Jay] Just a drink
I just had to drink it away.

409
00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:35.044
[sigh]

410
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.212
Why are you sensitive today?

411
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.259
Earlier, at the nursery

412
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.636
I saw that mask

413
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.431
[Jay's sigh]

414
00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.641
How surprised I was

415
00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:51.977
A child wearing a mask

416
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.938
I mistook it for that guy.

417
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:56.565
Like a fool

418
00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.738
[Looking embarrassed] No

419
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.240
Well, it just looked the same.

420
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.160
[Jay] The material is different too
The mark is also different

421
00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:10.245
[Laughing] It was a different mask.

422
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.628
Is it because the statute of limitations is running out?

423
00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.463
Just

424
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.257
I'm getting impatient

425
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.928
[sigh]

426
00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.179
Jay

427
00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:34.144
Maybe I can catch him
If there's anything I can help you with...

428
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.439
[Meaningful sound effects]

429
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:42.736
Leo went to light a cigarette.
I want to give you some company.

430
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.739
[Jehyuk] Two people
Congratulations again

[sigh]

433
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.336
Jehyuk must be a good person.

434
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:01.797
[Laughing] Well, leaving everything else aside

435
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.215
Yoojeong

436
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.676
I like Jehyuk a lot

437
00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:08.554
So, Mr. Kang-hoo

438
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.472
relax your mind

439
00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:13.559

440
00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.478
[Leo] Uh, bro

441
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:18.647
I've been thinking about it

442
00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:22.401
I'll go back to work as my brother said.

443
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:23.777
But

444
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.238
On the condition of administering medication rather than being an athlete.

445
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.116
instead brother

446
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.202
You better really watch your mouth.

447
00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:34.663

453
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.474
But did you smoke?

454
00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:58.937
From what I heard from Hae-mi,
I can't even drink well

455
00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:00.606
Saenim doesn’t even smoke…

Everyone has a secret

458
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.739
Especially to the wife-to-be

459
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.118
I didn't tell Yujeong.
What's the secret?

460
00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:16.705
[Jehyuk] What about Leo?

461
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.498
Does Haemi have a secret?

462

[Leo's gulping sound]

463
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:23.795
[Leo] Ah
I thought I had it all figured out

464
00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:27.174
[Clicking tongue] Now again
It seems like it will happen, sadly

465
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:29.384
What is that?

466
00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:33.931
What that means is that this time I

467
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.059
[surprised elasticity]

468
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:40.354
Because it comes naturally
I almost said everything

469
00:24:40.437 --> 00:24:42.940
- [Leo] This brother is a player, a player.
- [Laughs]

470
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.943
[Laughing] Then
let's not talk to each other

471
00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:49.655
[Jehyuk] When a secret is a secret
Because it's fun

472
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:53.283
If all the secrets are revealed
All the fun is gone

473
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:54.910
like smoke

Are you going to meet me?

499
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.058
We have to meet

500
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.145
We have to meet and end it.

[Old-fashioned gulping sound]

502
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.983
I don't think it will be easy? finish it off

00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.359
[Old] Huh?

504
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:12.863
There was a back boat
That's huge too

Back belly?

Not only the child's father
He said he had to find his child.

Well, if you go out carelessly,
I think it's dangerous

508
00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.586
Let alone the kid who attacked you wrongly.

509
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:30.172

[Sound of Yuna’s footsteps moving away]

532
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:35.779
[Yoojeong] I’ll go first, I’ll go first

533
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:37.239
- [Jehyuk] See you again
- [Haemi] Go in

534
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.490
- [Jay] Go in
- [Leo] Yes, please go in.

535
00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.451
[Car engine sound]

536
00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:45.747
[Sound of car door closing]

537
00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.124
[Car engine sound]

538
00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:53.255
[Haemi] The two of them
What are you going to do now?

539
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.465
It's the 1st from today.

540
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:56.842
- [Haemi’s light laughter]
- [Jay] Ayu

541
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.802
Don't talk nonsense and get on quickly.

542
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:01.263
[Leo] Brother, good luck. [Laughs]

543
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.849
[Sound of car door opening]

544
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:06.643
Kang-hoo, fighting!

545
00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:08.478
- [Haemi’s laughter]
- [Jay] Go in

546
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.439
[Sound of car door closing]

547
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.608
[Car engine sound receding]

548
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.948
Do you want to come in for a moment?

549
00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:23.952
- [Calm music]
- [Kanghu] Oh, well, over there, what

550
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.413
You didn’t eat well earlier.

551
00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.039
There was also food left

552
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.417
[light laughter]

553
00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:32.919
Is that so?

554
00:28:33.336 --> 00:28:34.337
[Kanghu’s light smile]

555
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.653
Why did you do that earlier?

556
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.781
[Yoojeong] Earlier, at the drinking party

557
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.991
He seemed like a slightly different person.

558
00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:04.868
Playing mischievous pranks

559
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.078
[breath mixed with laughter]

560
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:08.330
me

561
00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.624
I like pranks

562
00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:12.292
[Yujeong and Jehyuk’s laughter]

563
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:19.549
I tried

564
00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.885
[Jehyuk] To set the tension with Leo

565
00:29:22.803 --> 00:29:24.137
I'm calming down

566
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:26.264
Hae-mi’s position is a bit like that.

567
00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:31.061
I would already care about my husband’s background.

568
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:33.355
[light laughter]

569
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.024
Right?

570
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:37.567
Is that so?

571
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:39.820
[breath mixed with laughter]

572
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.112
As expected

573
00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:43.073
[Yujeong] Your consideration

574
00:29:45.534 --> 00:29:46.660
Why did you do that, Mr. Yujeong?

575
00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:50.539
Jae-i and Kang-hoo are doing well.

576
00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:52.874
I felt like I didn't like it very much.

577
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.504
Uh [embarrassed breathing]

578
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:58.922
That…

579
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:02.759
No, nothing like that.

580
00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:05.929
[Jehyuk] Tell me

581
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.765
before we got married
You said there would be no secrets.

582
00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:14.729
[light sigh]

583
00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:17.524
Actually

584
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.735
Kang-hoo's girlfriend

585
00:30:22.737 --> 00:30:24.573
We were friends from back in the day

586
00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:26.783
But Jae-yi

587
00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.953
Doing that with that friend's ex-boyfriend?

588
00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:33.164
[Exhaling in disgust] It's so terrible.

589
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:34.499
I can't do that

590
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.502
[Yujeong’s sigh]

591
00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:38.962
Such a terrible friend

592
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.131
Who are you?

593
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.468
You don’t need to know [Awkward laughter]

594
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:48.388
Mr. Jehyuk
I'm a person you'll never see.

595
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:50.265
[Yujeong’s breathing mixed with laughter]

596
00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.517
[Jehyuk’s light smile]

597
00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:55.729
[Leo] Jehyuk hyung.

598
00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.732
[Haemi] Jehyuk, what?

599
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:02.944
Before I got a job at Yujeong’s sister’s daycare center.

600
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:04.446
I guess it was because he was a person who did something?

601
00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:05.864
[Laughing] I don’t know.

602
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:10.160
I heard you were a teacher
I don't watch anymore because I'm bored, why?

603
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.369
[Meaningful music]

604
00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:17.834
Huh? 'Thank you'

605
00:31:20.754 --> 00:31:22.589
I don't think he has the manners of an ordinary person.

606
00:31:23.006 --> 00:31:24.007
What?

607
00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:25.967
[Leo] That brother was earlier
He gives me a cigarette...

608
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.052
[cell phone vibrates]

609
00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:37.604
What is it?

610
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:39.856
Uh, nothing.

611
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:43.276
Jehyuk, what about cigarettes?
Didn't you?

612
00:31:44.027 --> 00:31:45.028
uh

613
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:47.781
I just think he’s a person with good manners.

614
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:49.157
[Bewildered] What?

615
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:52.285
[Haemi] It’s Leo

616
00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:54.537
When I get home, get some sleep first.

617
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:58.333
Shaved ice for my hotel
Because I have to think about it all night

618
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:01.294
[Leo] No way, sister

619
00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:02.879
I wonder if I have to stay all night again...

620
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:06.049
I told you not to talk nonsense, right?

621
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:09.219
[Haemi] No, please be quiet.

622
00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:12.597
Because I need to get some sleep

623
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.151
[Meaningful sound effects]

624
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.752
[Yuna] Behind?

625
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:46.131
[Old] Not only the child’s father
Are you saying I need to find my child?

626
00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:49.300
Well, if you go out carelessly,
I think it's dangerous

627
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.303
Let alone the kid who attacked you wrongly.

628
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.848
Should I rot in prison for the rest of my life?

629
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:56.599
[Old-fashioned gulping sound]

630
00:32:56.933 --> 00:32:58.184
[Old-fashioned breathing sound]

631
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:00.228
So

632
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:03.648
Get ready and attack

633
00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:06.026
To that guy

634
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.611
[light sigh]

635
00:33:08.862 --> 00:33:09.863
What the heck

636
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.034
A person called Backbae
How great of a person is he?

637
00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:18.038
[Meaningful music]

638
00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:19.581
[Old] That's

639
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.876
I take good care of my land

640
00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:27.130
If I give it back after I become minister
I'll tell you then

641
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:32.927
Later, Emily
If you just get land and run away, you're in trouble.

642
00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:34.554
[old-fashioned laughter]

[cell phone vibrates]

648
00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.347
Yes, manager.

- [Nervous music]

[Oncoming car driving sound]

653
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.035
Hey, is it okay if I don’t go with you?

654
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.162
Uh, it's okay

655
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:54.008
[Kanghu] Be careful

656
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.846
[Light laughter] I will

657
00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.447

[Jay] Yes, manager.

660
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.626
I'm on my way to the police station now.

661
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:30.587
But

662
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.589
Are you sure about that mask?

663
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.300
In the words of the chief
I raided an illegal gambling house.

664
00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:37.302
The characteristics of the gambling hall are
They said it was to wear a mask.

665
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.847
[Yongpil] But one of the guests
I was wearing that mask

666
00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:42.932
Really?

667
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.145
Then who is the person wearing the mask?

668
00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:48.813
Did you find out?

669
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.275
[Noisy noise]

670
00:35:55.278 --> 00:35:56.613

676
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.024
That file is

677
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.443
I told Attorney Do Jae-i
borrow a watch

678
00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:37.278
It's true that I recorded it myself.

679
00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:43.701
[Sound of intake of breath]

680
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.081
[Jay] This mask

681
00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:50.541
What happened?

682
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:53.962
Every time I feel stressed

683
00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.631
I need stimulating play

684
00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:00.343
[Bomi] But Attorney Jae-yi Do
You interrupted my play.

685
00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:03.137
[Jay] Where did you get it?

686
00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:07.725
Why can't I steal something from someone else?
I stole my husband's baby

[Bomi’s laughter]

688
00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:12.689

I'm in the detention center.

690
00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:17.026
Because of you

691
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.153
Mr. Kim Man-bok

692
00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.990
- [Bomi’s candy sucking sound]
- How did you get this?

693
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.868
I heard you get it if you join some club.

694
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.246
[Bomi] Ah

695
00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:30.832
This club closed 10 years ago.

696
00:37:31.332 --> 00:37:32.959
- I thought it was reopening?
- [Tense sound effect]

697
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:34.919
Is it open again?

698
00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.879
[Old] I did it 10 years ago

699
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.966
of some club
I signed up for membership

700
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:44.512
The club's meeting place is
Because it's there

701

[dark music]

702
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.391

703
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:50.101
Do you know where it is?

704
00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.733
To Choi Bomi
Did you hear the club location?

705
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:58.526
no

706
00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:01.321
Kim Man-bok even to Choi Bomi
They say they kept it a secret.

707
00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:05.033
[Jay] It’s definitely out there somewhere.

708
00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:08.286
I don't know where it is
It's so frustrating

709
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.415
The club closed 10 years ago
Why reopen?

710
00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:16.419
Maybe

711
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:19.088
prayer ceremony incident
Could it be related?

712
00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:20.173
[dark music]

713
00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:22.675
Even if everyone in the world says no

714
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:24.761
You know it yourself

715
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.097
That I saw the mask

716
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:32.935
Then, until the incident quiets down.
Have you been struggling for 10 years?

717
00:38:34.062 --> 00:38:35.063
In 10 years

718
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.607
for rape
Because the statute of limitations has expired.

719
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.401
If that guess is correct

720
00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:43.696
He's in that club
Could be a key figure

721
00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:47.909
Close the club
able to reopen

722
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:51.871
I guess I'll go there myself
I need to peck at Kim Man-bok.

723
00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:54.123
And the lawyer

724
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:58.336
[Yongpil] Look at this

725
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.051
[Jay laughs]

726
00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:09.514
In my declaration of candidacy
I sent Ki Yun-cheol

727
00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:11.015
- I'm sure it's Go Yoo Na.
- [Clock second hand sound effect]

728
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:14.102
Keep following Go Yoo-na's footsteps.

729
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.612
[Calm music plays]

730
00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:27.240
[Sound of foot massage]

731
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:39.460
[Yun Cheol] Welcome, Chairman.

732
00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:41.170
[Sound of a group of people gulping bitterly]

733
00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:45.007
[Ilgu] Why in a place like this?
Did you ask to meet up?

734
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.843
[Laughing] I

735
00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.929
I'm having some stress.

736
00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:51.639
[Yuncheol] You don’t have to worry

737
00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:53.266
As you can see

738
00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:56.644
They can't see us or hear us.

739
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.528
[Sound of glass pieces falling]

740
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.072
[laughter]

741
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:10.867
[Yuncheol] Like this
You are a thorough person.

742
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.243
To others so far

743
00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:15.455
You probably haven't found a single weakness.

744
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:19.167
[Sniffing bitterly] But what should I do about this?

745
00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:22.462
Go Yoo-na came to Korea

746
00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:24.255
What did they say?

747
00:40:24.338 --> 00:40:27.675
He killed my son
He's not the culprit?

748
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:30.303
The culprit is

749
00:40:30.636 --> 00:40:32.388
I heard it's Dojae.

750
00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:35.475
Fortunately, unique

751
00:40:36.476 --> 00:40:39.687
Dojae is the chairman's wife.
I don't think I know

752
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:41.772
[Yuncheol’s laughter]

753
00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:44.025
- [Interesting Music]
- [Yuncheol] That’s amazing too.

754
00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:46.903
No matter how young and energetic I committed it,
Even though it was a mistake

755
00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:48.905
In a world like today

756
00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:53.159
how do you do that
I wonder if it can be completely hidden [laughter]

757
00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.621
Would you like me to clean it up for you? Go Yoo-na

758
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.165
[Ilgu] Our Kangbo Group is

759
00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:03.085
You are the most powerful person in this country.
What I make for you

760
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:05.338
It is the calling of a lifetime.

761
00:41:06.422 --> 00:41:07.423
But

762
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.842
How dare a girl like that

763
00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:13.304
Rep.'s shameful son
If you try to find out

764
00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.849
I have to clean it up, I

765
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.061
[Light laughter] No.

766
00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:22.730
As the Chairman said

767
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:25.233
That kind of girl

768
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:27.777
What can you dare to do?

769
00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:31.989
[Yuncheol] Just
Knowing it is revelation

770
00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:37.203
Then

771
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:40.748
I hope you relieve your stress well

772
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.792
- [Sound of a group of people slurping bitterly]
- [Meaningful music]

773
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:46.462
I don't fit in like this

774
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:48.798
Well then, that's it

775
00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:51.801
[Sound of a group of people breathing]

776
00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:01.561
[Exhales loudly]

777
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.230
[Junghyun] Still, the culprit was caught
Thank goodness

778
00:42:05.273 --> 00:42:08.150
I risk my life and death
Found the culprit, yes

779
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:09.569
[Siren sound heard from far away]

780
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:12.488
[Yuncheol] Who is that woman?

781
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:16.659
[Junghyun] Oh, I’m Attorney Jae-i Do.

782
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:18.744
Until the bar madam got caught.

783
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:20.663
He was the most likely suspect.

784
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:22.248
But

785
00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:26.669
Why Kangbo Group
Are you with Vice Chairman Kang Il-gu?

786
00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:28.421
That's strange to me too

787
00:42:29.255 --> 00:42:32.258
Anyway, Vice Chairman Kang Il-gu
After coming

788
00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:33.759
The chief's order has been given.

789
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.053
[Junghyeon] The real culprit was caught too.

790
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.556
Attorney Jae-i Do
Don't investigate any further.

791
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:40.182
even

792
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.435
They even said to delete the records I had?

793
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.437
Well, isn’t that something like that? [laughter]

794
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:46.647
Having a child out of wedlock, something like that?

795
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:49.734
Fatherly love once

796
00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:52.528
I'm crying

797
00:42:58.159 --> 00:42:59.201
[Cell phone operation sound]

798
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:01.621
- [Mobile phone operation sound]
- [Yuncheol] Go Yoo-na

799
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.914
If you need anything, let me know.

800
00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:06.083
let me help you

801
00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:07.168
[Text sending sound]

802
00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:08.794
[heavy music]

803
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:11.756
[Taking a breath] You protect your daughter.

804
00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:16.552
I hunt my son's killer
Because I will punish you

805
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.055
[Soaring music]

806
00:43:30.232 --> 00:43:31.317
[Meaningful music]

807
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:36.072
[Employee] Oh, hey.

808
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.324
This is a membership club.

809
00:43:38.866 --> 00:43:40.701
And it's under construction
Business is closed

810
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.411
[snort]

811
00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:46.165
I'm going to change some chairs
What is remodeling?

812
00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:47.375
[breathing sound]

813
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:49.085
I'm not a guest

814
00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:50.711
It's a partner company.

815
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:51.837
- [Meaningful music]
- [Sound of bags rattling]

816
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.297
Tell it to President Jeong.

817
00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:55.049
Go madam came

818
00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:00.680
[President Jeong] Oh my gosh

819
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:02.723
Who is this?

820
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:06.519
no
I heard you had a hard time at Kampang.

821
00:44:06.852 --> 00:44:10.815
Wow, is it because I can’t see the sunlight?
Make your skin more shiny

822
00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:12.066
Put away the nonsense

823
00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.070
President Jeong [sighs]

824
00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:18.030
You know my ex-husband, right?

825
00:44:18.114 --> 00:44:19.740
Are you married?

826
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:22.743
No, who sees Madam Ko as a married woman?

827
00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:24.703
Hey, even if I go to active duty right now...

828
00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:25.871
[slams the table]

829
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:30.459
[President Jeong] No
Well, I heard about it.

830
00:44:30.543 --> 00:44:31.710
Living together means

831
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.548
Oh, but I'm with that guy
It's been a long time since we lost contact

832
00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:37.925
Oh, what, do you have dog habits?

833
00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:40.261
어디 호구 년 하나 물어 가지고
들어앉았는지

834
00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.720
코빼기도 안 보이더라고

835
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:43.472
[유나] 내가 그 새끼가
Where do you live and what do you do?

836
00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:44.682
Do you think I came here because I didn’t know?

837
00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:46.434
What I want to know

838
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:49.228
He's the big guy who looks after that bastard.

839
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:50.312
[President Jeong] Big guy?

840
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.814
Is the big guy watching your back?

841
00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.441
Who is it?

842
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.608
[absurd gasping sound]

843
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.693
[Exciting music]

844
00:44:57.486 --> 00:44:59.196
I still can't come to my senses

845
00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.949
[Yuna] Even after 10 years, I

846
00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:04.452
It's Madam Go.

847
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.662
blow fast

848
00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:09.457
Let alone remodeling the store.
before putting it out of business

849
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.458
[Sound of footsteps coming down the stairs]

850
00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:16.005
[Sound of door opening]

851
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:18.340
- [Leo] Oh
- [Sound of door closing]

852
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:19.800
Isn't it in President Jeong's office?

853
00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:21.844
[Employee] Oh, are you with a customer right now?

854
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:23.929
The late Madame?

855
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.228
[eerie sound effect]

856
00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:41.614
[Manbok] What? Let's make a deal?

857
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:43.282
So

858
00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:47.077
If I tell you where the club is

859
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.497
Will you save my company?

860
00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:51.832
[full laughter]

861
00:45:54.627 --> 00:45:59.048
No, what are you doing?
Are you going to ruin my company?

862
00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.759
Your wife Choi Bomi

863
00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:04.428
Playing at an unlicensed gambling house
I got caught

864
00:46:04.512 --> 00:46:05.513
Mr.

865
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:07.932
[Manbok] Is this guy’s wife crazy?

866
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:11.268
From stealing to now gambling

867
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.355
Because of you
It's already a risky company

868
00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.774
[Jay] No, if your wife gets robbed

869
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:19.401
Who would buy that company's products?

870
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.196
Well, sales will drop.

871
00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:25.032
Well then, you're screwed.

872
00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:27.201
[Embarrassing sound]

873
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:30.955
[Manbok’s voice of worry]

874
00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:32.081
[Jay] So

875
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.457
Talk to me

876
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.419
Where is the club?

877
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.261
good

878
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:47.263
Look forward to it

879
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:50.683
Tomorrow on the front of the portal
Because your wife will be plastered with articles.

880
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.643
angels

00:46:54.853 --> 00:46:55.938
[eerie music]

882
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:58.607
I'll tell you everything I know

883
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.110
About Angels Club

884

[Meaningful music]

885
00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.322
the club name

886
00:47:06.282 --> 00:47:07.283
Are you Angels?

887
00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:09.493
[Noisy noise]

888
00:47:10.536 --> 00:47:12.496
- [Jehyuk] ‘Apple’
- [Idle] ‘Apple’

889
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.249
- [Jehyuk] Once again
- [Idle] ‘Apple’

890
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:17.960
- [Jehyuk] ‘Angel’
- [Children] ‘Angel’

891
00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:21.171
- What about this?
- [Children] ‘Banana’

892
00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:22.881
Very good job

893
00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:25.884
You did a great job with your homework.
Didn't play last week, huh?

894
00:47:25.968 --> 00:47:26.969
- [Director] Hello
- [Jehyuk’s laughter]

895
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:28.804
- Ah
- [Director] Team leader

896
00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:30.431
Just watch for a moment

897
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.557
[Child] Yes

898
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:37.938
[Director] Ah, in the backyard
Guests are coming

899
00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:42.359
[uneasy music]

900
00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:43.777
[Grass bug crying]

901
00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.031
What's going on? Without any contact

902
00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:48.324
Then, if anyone catches your eye,

903
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.493
[Jehyuk] This is
What are you doing? [Painful groan]

904
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:53.579
[Director] Uh, Chairman.

905
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:55.664
-What happened without any contact?
- [Yujeong’s laughter]

906
00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:57.499
[Yoojeong] Ah, director, hey, Mr. Jehyuk.

907
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:00.461
No, are you above the team leader?

908
00:48:01.337 --> 00:48:02.338
Ah, team leader

909
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:05.132
Where did you go when you had a guest?

910
00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:08.010
Are you a guest?

911
00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:10.054
[Birdsong]

912
00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:15.017
[Yoojeong] Mr. Jehyuk

913
00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:18.771
Oh no

914
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:20.189
The face

915
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.566
No, why is your face like this?

916
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.110
They said a guest came

917
00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:27.029
Did you have a fight?

918
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:30.282
[sigh]

919
00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:33.911
I called a friend to give me a wedding invitation.

920
00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:35.204
But

921
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.415
I don't even know what's inside me

922
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:40.417
I guess there was something like a sense of entitlement.

923
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:44.004
My friend touched it, so stop...

924
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:47.049
Do you have a sense of entitlement?

925
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.219
Why Jehyuk?

926
00:48:52.971 --> 00:48:55.432
They told me to call my boss
He said he was good at seducing me.

927
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.477
This doesn't make sense

928
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.146
[Yoojeong] How can you say that?

929
00:49:02.856 --> 00:49:04.108
- I'm trying to get used to it now.
- [Yujeong’s absurd breathing]

930
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.527
They say we live well thanks to women

931
00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:10.322
- [Calm music]
- This is something you will hear for the rest of your life.

932
00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:12.991
[disgusted breathing]

933
00:49:13.575 --> 00:49:16.537
Leona Jehyuk
In the end, it's all the same

934
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.205
Sticking a straw in a woman's back

935
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:22.960
[sigh]

936
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:24.545
Let's do it like this

937
00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:27.631
Youngwoon Foundation Chairman

938
00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:30.217
From now on, I’m Jehyuk.

939
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.972
[Yoojeong] I created something new
Culture and Arts Complex Promotion Committee

940
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:36.223
I will only serve as chairman.

941
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:39.393
But

942
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:43.105
What about the daycare center if I become chairman?

943
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:44.732
[Makes a yuck sound]

944
00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:46.775
I'll figure out how to do that

945
00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:49.027
[Yoojeong] So you

946
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:52.197
Please serve as Chairman of the Youngwoon Foundation.

947
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:56.201
[surprised gasp]

948
00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:06.879
[heavy music]

949
00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:16.096
[Haemi] So, only Jay
You can't believe it

950
00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:19.183
You have to find your own way to live

951
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.062
[Doorbell sounds]

952
00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:34.782
[Snort] You too?

953
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.702
[Sound of door closing]

954
00:50:48.128 --> 00:50:49.129
[Yuna] Sit down

955
00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:53.592
[Tense sound effect]

956
00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:09.566
[Hae-mi's absurd breathing]

957
00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:14.738
You are a pumpkin seed
I've known it for a long time

958
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.741
This is the best ever

959
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.118
[Haemi] How can you tell me
Without saying a word

960
00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:21.411
Come here, come here?

961
00:51:21.495 --> 00:51:24.081
[Yoojeong] The foundation is in urgent need of money.
I couldn't help it

962
00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:25.833
[Hae-mi's disapproving breath]

963
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.918
But you came too

964
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:30.963
I predicted it in advance
Finding my way to live

965
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:32.256
[laughter]

966
00:51:36.301 --> 00:51:38.720
What old people say
That's all right [laughter]

967
00:51:40.389 --> 00:51:42.391
It's fun to watch the fight

968
00:51:43.141 --> 00:51:44.434
[Haemi laughs]

969
00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:47.104
[Yuna] Just say something

970
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:48.856
When are you going to go?

971
00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:50.315
Why did you come to me?

972
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.028
your land

973
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.405
What can I do?

974
00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.616
[Haemi] Well, don’t kill people.
Don't talk like this

975
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.995
[Sigh] My mouth hurts.
repeat what I said

976
00:52:04.204 --> 00:52:05.747
[Yuna] What I want is
That's all there is?

977
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:07.583
[Haemi sighs] Well…

978
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:09.835
It's Yuna

979
00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:13.005
That's because we really need that land.

980
00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.507
Please tell me how, okay?

981
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:19.344
[Old] Not only the child’s father
Are you saying I need to find my child?

982
00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.931
Well, if you go out carelessly,
I think it's dangerous

983
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:28.729
Let alone the kid who attacked you wrongly.
I'll have to rot in prison for the rest of my life

984
00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:36.194
[Yuna] Then let’s do it like this

985
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:40.490
be friends with me

986
00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:41.909
Like before

987
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.410
[nervous music]

988
00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.706
[Laughing] Didn’t you understand?

989
00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.335
Be friends with me, like 10 years ago

990
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:53.170
[Haemi's embarrassed exclamation]

991
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.088
[absurd laughter]

992
00:52:56.381 --> 00:52:59.092
You don't know what a friend is, do you?

993
00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:02.512
[Haemi] My friend is
I'm not doing it with just anyone.

994
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.390
trustworthy
Friends are what you do with kids.

995
00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:07.726
[absurd laughter]

996
00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:12.272
[Yuna] You guys came here
Isn't it Jay?

997
00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:15.943
Not knowing the meaning of friends
Sounds like you guys?

998
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:22.741
- I'm not asking for much.
- [Meaningful music]

999
00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:26.036
When you all get together with your husbands

1000
00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:27.871
please invite me just once

1001
00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.375
That way, trust will be built.

1002
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.669
That way you can make a deal

1003
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.296
Isn't it?

1004
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:47.182
[Atmospheric music plays]

1005
00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:52.604
[Elasticity of oil well]

1006
00:53:53.188 --> 00:53:54.356
[Yujeong’s breathing sound]

1007
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:56.733
[Haemi] Hey, are you crazy?

1008
00:53:57.776 --> 00:53:59.194
Why are you doing something you shouldn't do?

1009
00:53:59.277 --> 00:54:00.278
[sigh]

1010
00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.030
Because I'm scared

1011
00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:03.490
Yuna says we should be friends

1012
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.118
[Yujeong’s light sigh]

1013
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:07.202
It's not scary

1014
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.287
[sigh]

1015
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.623
[Haemi and Yujeong sigh]

1016
00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:15.585
[Haemi] Hey, at your wedding
Do you want to invite me?

1017
00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.380
If it's a gathering where even the husbands come,
That's the fastest

1018
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.507
No, my wedding

1019
00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.468
This marriage has to be perfect

1020
00:54:24.177 --> 00:54:25.303
[Haemi] So are you going to give up that land?

1021
00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:26.805
Then give it to your foundation.

1022
00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:28.557
Donations to our hotel
Do I have to retrieve it?

1023
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.351
Hey, that doesn’t work either, suddenly…

1024
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.522
Where is something like that all of a sudden?

1025
00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:36.773
This doesn't work, that doesn't work either.

1026
00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:37.983
[Shouting] Well, what are we going to do?

1027
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:41.820
[Yujeong’s sigh]

1028
00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.118
[Yoojeong] Then

1029
00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:49.953
Not a wedding

1030
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:53.331
at my house this weekend
Shall we all get together once?

1031
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.878
Our Mr. Jehyuk
I became the chairman this time.

1032
00:54:58.545 --> 00:54:59.880
Let’s have a celebration party too

1033
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:02.883
Jehyuk, did you make him chairman?

1034
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.305
[light sigh]

1035
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.515
But

1036
00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:12.726
What should I say to Jay?

1037
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.605
[Yoojeong] You invited Yuna
Shouldn't I say it?

1038
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.275
Don't say it first

1039
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.195
[Haemi] Then we can secretly today
I also visited Yuna

1040
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:24.488
You have to blow

1041
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.324
When I see you at your house later
Let's solve it then

1042
00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:32.746
[Yujeong’s light sigh]

1043
00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:34.706
[Haemi’s swallowing sound]

1044
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:39.211
[Jay] This is February 18th
All event venues in Gunggok District

1045
00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:40.587
You mean it's a reservation situation?

1046
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.880
[Yongpil] However, in the data provided,

1047
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:43.173
It's called Angel's Club.

1048
00:55:43.256 --> 00:55:45.217
Something like a secret club opening ceremony
There was no

1049
00:55:47.052 --> 00:55:49.930
[Sighing] Kim Man-bok
It definitely did.

1050
00:55:50.555 --> 00:55:52.516
It opens in exactly one week

1051
00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.269
Then you can't do it

1052
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.106
[Yongpil] On this day in the Gunggok district
At events held

1053
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:00.816
I have no choice but to send everyone out.

1054
00:56:02.317 --> 00:56:03.318
good

1055
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:06.696
Are you watching well?

1056
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.282
[Yongpil] Ever since I met Ki Yun-cheol
There was no special activity

1057
00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.535
It's about a business I used to do business with.

1058
00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:14.204
- [Meaningful music]
- I went to an unexpected place once.

1059
00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:21.294
[cell phone vibrates]

1060
00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:27.759
[Haemi] Go Yoo-na

1061
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.803
Yujeong is coming home this Saturday

1062
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.721
I'll send you the address and time again.

[sigh]

1064
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:39.062
Are we finally seeing it?

1065
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:44.276
[Yuna] Tell me

1066
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:46.194
my ex husband

1067
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:48.572
Who's the big guy looking after you?

[President Jeong] FBI because you’re from the United States?

[Yelling] President Jeong!

1073
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:03.128
[President Jeong] Oh, it’s true

1074
00:57:03.712 --> 00:57:05.297
That much is shrouded in mystery?

1075
00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:09.050
With the skills I used to dig up after the big guys,
I tried to shake it all off.

1076
00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:11.011
[Clicking tongue] I didn’t know.

In front of the hotel?

1082
00:57:25.358 --> 00:57:26.359
Who?

1083
00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:39.164
[Yuna] If you came this far
Without coming up?

1084
00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:42.083
scared?

1085
00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:43.585
Reminds me of the old days?

1086
00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:44.753
[Heavy sound effect]

1087
00:57:47.506 --> 00:57:49.007
I want to drive with you

1088
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:51.051
Where do you want to go with me?

1089
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.137

[Yuna] What are you?

1103
00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:55.699
Why did you bring me here?

1104
00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:58.785
[Jay] To find your daughter

1105
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.121
you

1106
00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:03.373
Did you put someone behind me?

you are righteous
You weren't a lawyer

1110
00:59:12.757 --> 00:59:14.968
[Yuna] A guy like Jeong Gu-tae
If you look at what was done,

1111
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.220
So?

1112
00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:19.431

You cannot go abroad without permission.
There is a condition

1117
00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:32.902
[Jay] But you broke it
You went to America, right?

1118
00:59:33.278 --> 00:59:34.446
That is

1119
00:59:34.863 --> 00:59:36.781
You're a wanted man in Korea

1120
00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.660
As you are Emily Go
It's a shame that I came

[Yuna] I again
They found out my ex-husband

1125
00:59:50.128 --> 00:59:51.421
Are you not scared of me?

1126
00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:54.507
[Jay] Just one phone call from me

1127
00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:56.217
you are under arrest right now

1128
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:57.469
- [Yuna] If you’re scared of prison, etc.
- [Nervous music]

1129
00:59:57.552 --> 00:59:58.887
You probably didn't even think about coming

1130
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.307
I came prepared to die, I

1131
01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.355
[Jay] Let’s make a deal

1132
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.023
Give me your land

1133
01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:14.277
Then no matter what method I use

1134
01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.197
I'll get your daughter from your ex-husband.

1135
01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.493
What do you think?

1136
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.036

What if my child’s father is Mr. Kang-hoo?

1142
01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:46.059
- [Nervous music]
- Can you still fight?

1143
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:47.852
for me

1144
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:51.481
What nonsense...

1145
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.025
When did you guys break up?

1146
01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.152
me

1147
01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.905
I met Kang Hoo before going to the US.

1148
01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:00.990
[Yuna] We were pretty hot

1149
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.118
I guess Mr. Kang-hoo didn’t tell you?

1150
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.125
Jay

1151
01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.168
What I mean is

1152
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.213
What to believe in the world
There is nothing

1153
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.091
So don't trust anyone

1154
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.552

do that

1159
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.780
Then I will give you my land

1160
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.118
I guess the desire to give me a ride has disappeared.

1161
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:46.953
I'll go alone

let me do it

Don’t eat ramen and soju?

Today

- [Meaningful music]
- Just, kinda.

1173
01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.114
Because I don’t want to mess around

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.884
Have you ever met since you were released from prison?

1181
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.221
[Kanghu] No, there is none.

1182
01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:12.807
Then

1183
01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.518
When was the last time you saw it?

Before that incident happened

1187
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:27.780
Today is a little strange

1188
01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:30.116
What happened?

1189
01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:34.829
no

1190

What can’t you do?

They told me not to wear corrective shoes

1215
01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:12.218
I need to rest my feet too.

1216
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:18.016
Even if you get married, stay at home
I'll always be wearing this

1217

I'm going to tell you everything today

1224

No way

1225
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.917
That's after getting married
We decided to talk slowly.

no

1227

Jehyuk is my leg
As if I don't think of it as a flaw

1228

I also meet Jehyuk’s condition.
I don't think it's a flaw

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.172
- [Jay] He probably won’t come.
- [Haemi] Oh, that’s a relief.

1241
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.844
Ah, Kang-hoo, you must be tired.
I need to rest

1242
01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.137
[Haemi’s awkward laughter]

1243
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.516
[Leo] Now, now, now, this
Put it in front of food and drag it for a long time

1244
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.309
That's torture, let's start now.

1245
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.560
- [Rattling sound]
- No

1246
01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.357
There is someone who hasn't arrived yet

1247
01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.235
- Who?
- [Nervous music]

1248
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:54.904
[Awkward laughter]

1249
01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:56.280
You'll find out when you come

1250
01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.449
Take care of it in advance
Don't lose your appetite

1251
01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.582
Ah

1252
01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.668
before guests arrive

1253
01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.630
Only in front of my close friends
I have something to say

1254
01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.427
[Yoojeong] Me

1255
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.722
I'll have a beautiful daughter soon

1256
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.099
[Haemi’s surprised gasp]

1257
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.644
- [Leo’s throat coughs and an embarrassed exclamation]
- [Haemi’s surprised gasp]

1258
01:08:26.727 --> 01:08:28.729
Hon, premarital pregnancy?

1259
01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:30.439
[Haemi] Hey

1260
01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.108
These pumpkin seeds, really.

1261
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.318
That's not it

1262
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:39.115
Actually

1263
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.367
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]
- Our Jehyuk

1264
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.911
-Before you met me...
- [Jay] Yes, manager.

1265
01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.330
[Yongpil] I’m with my friends now
Are you together?

1266
01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.541
Yes, what about it?

1267
01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.460
Let’s go outside for a moment and talk on the phone.

1268
01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:53.629
Ah, yes

1269
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.132
[Jay] Wait a minute
I'll go out and make a phone call.

1270
01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.633
[Yoojeong] Oh

1271
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.386
[Haemi] Ah, at an important moment

1272
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.307
[Jay] I’m out, manager.

1273
01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:05.516
Please speak

1274
01:09:11.105 --> 01:09:12.565
Go Yoo-na's child's father

1275
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.150
Who are you?

1276
01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.361
[Haemi] Oh, why doesn’t he come here?

1277
01:09:19.614 --> 01:09:21.908
Ah, hey, until I come back
I can't wait

1278
01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:23.868
Talk to me quickly

1279
01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.620
Unless you are pregnant before marriage

1280
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.206
That you will have a daughter
What on earth are you talking about?

1281
01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.588
[Yoojeong] To Jehyuk
I have a daughter

1282
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.888
[Soaring music]

1283
01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:53.689
My daughter's name is Nana

1284
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.067
I'm 4 years old now

1285
01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.240
[Yuna] Do you understand now?

1286
01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:05.409
[Sound of shoes again and again]

1287
01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:15.336
That's right

1288
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.380
That guy is the father of my child

1289
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.806
[Heavy sound effect]

1290
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.559
[dark music]

1291
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.118
[Yujeong’s trembling breathing]

1292
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.788
[Yujeong’s heavy breathing]

1293
01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:52.373
[Cell phone operation sound]

1294
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.582
[Call connection tone]

1295
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.501
[secret music]

1296
01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.606
[Yuna] I warned you, right?

1297
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:19.692
Don't trust anyone

1298
01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.653
The couple gets along well
There is only one way to live well

1299
01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:26.615
Never letting each other know our secrets
Isn’t that right, Haemi?

1300
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:29.577
[Haemi] But why did you do that yesterday?

1301
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.705
Like a rabbit caught in a wolf's den
I'm so scared

1302
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.457
{\an8}[Yuna] Isn’t that the case?

1303
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.626
{\an8}Before marriage
My husband, who I thought was an angel

1304
01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.962
{\an8}It turns out he was the devil

1305
01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:43.174
{\an8}Very 'surprise', surprisingly

1306
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.551
{\an8}[Kanghu] Trust me

1307
01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.219
{\an8}No matter what anyone says

1308
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.138
{\an8}[Yoojeong] I’m Jehyuk

1309
01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.141
{\an8}My mom and dad in the sky
It's like a gift you sent me

1310
01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.476
{\an8}[Yuna] So

1311
01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:54.935
{\an8}Whose side will you be on?

1312
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:55.936
{\an8}Song Jehyuk?

1313
01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.480
{\an8}Or me?

1314
01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.149
{\an8}[Jai] Good people, bad people
It's all relative

1315
01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:04.070
{\an8}Tang, Go Yoo-na, I will solve everything.

1316
01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.322
{\an8}- Niga
- [Grunting sound]

1317
01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:09.492
{\an8}No matter how much I pretend to be Emily Go,
you are unique

1318
01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:11.494
{\an8}[Yuna's heavy breathing] Dojae!
