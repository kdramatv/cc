00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.107
[In a crying voice] All over my body
bugs crawling

182
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.110
While enduring that terrible pain

183
00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:41.571
[shaking breathing]

184
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.200
But it's all over now

185
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.287
I don't want to protect anyone anymore

186
00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.960
I'm like this because of my sister and mother-in-law.

187
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:57.587
[Leo] My mother-in-law too
There must be something going on

188
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.921
So we met
Let’s talk…

189
00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.047
no!

190
00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.844
[Sobbing] I'm so scared

191
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.389
[Haemi is crying] I no longer

192
00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.977
To the people I love
I don't want to get hurt

193
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.772
Even now, my mom

194
00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.943
cruel enough to me

195
00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.742
[Crying sound]

196
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:29.827
Oh, I'm hungry

197
00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:41.339
[Yuna] I told Nana
They can't give me a liver transplant?

198
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.465
why?

199
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.843
[Eunsu] My mother’s blood type matches, too.
It's all good

200
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.220
You have hepatitis C.

201
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.473
Then it is difficult to become a donor.

202
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.642
[Yuna] Register at the center

203
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.562
Randomly follow the order
Do I have no choice but to wait?

204
00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:00.399
Still, type O
Because I can only get it from type O

205
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.360
It is disadvantageous compared to other blood types.

206
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.612
Besides, Nana is RH-

207
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.824
[Eunsu] Among brain dead people, there are those conditions.
It won't be easy to find

208
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.494
[dark music]

209
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:24.966
[Yoojeong] That person’s things
That's the last one, right?

210
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.177
[Secretary] At the prosecution
Take everything you can

211
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.428
This is

212
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.557
The chairman is in the office
This is the suit I kept as a spare.

213
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.228
Okay, go out.

214
00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.444
Hey, Chairman.

215
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:50.074
among employees
There are ugly words going around.

216
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.578
I have a lot of debt with the foundation.
It's going to close soon

217
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.289
No

218
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.542
Now I'm back

219
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.753
Foundation, I now protect it.

220
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.137
[Sound of door opening]

221
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.889
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Sigh]

222
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.316
[nervous music]

223
00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.665
[Man-ok] I, Daeseonggak Gil Man-ok,

224
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.169
Chairman Song Je-hyuk's slush fund amounted to 9.7 billion won.

225
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.213
Chairman Song
Until the mayoral election is over

226
00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.548
Leave it for a while

227
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.509
If this money is not returned

228
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.220
I will accept any disadvantages

229
00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:58.392
To Gil Man-ok’s daughter Yoon Hae-mi
I understand that I can make a claim on my behalf.

230
00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.728
April 10, 2023

231
00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:02.938
Gil Man-ok

232
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.113
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol, why did you come?

233
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.115
You must have come to argue

234
00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:16.619
I handed Representative Ki over to the prosecution.

235
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.124
Do you have any proof?

236
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.918
[Ilgu] I have that much power

237
00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:29.006
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
I won't get out this time

238
00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.009
[Jay] Two people
Weren't you close?

239
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.720
You uncovered the truth

240
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:36.597
[Ilgu] You are here

241
00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.141
I found a guy named Song Je-hyuk.

242
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.895
As it turns out, after that guy
There was Ki Yun-cheol

243
00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:45.898
[Sighing] At that time, I

244
00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:47.566
If only I had trusted you

245
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.530
You spent 10 years in that hell
I wouldn't have lived

246
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.409
[uneasy music]

247
00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:02.581
[Jay] Rep. Ki Yun-cheol.

248
00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.000
The person who cared for his son so much

249
00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:08.921
How could Song Je-hyuk kill his own son?
Can we become part of the same team?

250
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:13.509
Well, oh my god
More than love for children

251
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.554
self-ambition
Because there are bigger people

252
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:17.930
I don't understand

253
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.809
No way

254
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.271
So Song Je-hyuk...

255
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.024
Song Je-hyuk committed suicide.

256
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.861
[Jay] That day
Also, the CCTV was turned off.

257
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.822
I know we're going there that day
I even took a picture

258
00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.033
And then to us
I tried to blame it all

259
00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.619
Just like 10 years ago

260
00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.706
The person who can do all of this

261
00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.125
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol is the only one.

262
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.752
Moreover, Song Je-hyuk must disappear.

263
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:52.339
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol also attended the Angels Club.
Because you can be free

264
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:57.595
Are you curious about the truth again?

265
00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.102
If there is anything I can help you with

266
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.353
- [Dark Music]
- say it

267
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.067
It's a bit unfamiliar

268
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.486
you always

269
00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:18.824
The truth doesn't matter
You talked about it

270
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.249
[Ilgu] I have another day to live
There isn't much left

271
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.251
I am deeply guilty, I

272
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:31.837
before dying

273
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.966
With the intention of repentance
The secret club you found

274
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.054
So that it can be revealed in detail
I intend to help.

275
00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:44.808
I'm sorry, Jay.

276
00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:47.853
[Ilgu] It’s shameless

277
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.732
Can I ask you a favor?

278
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.319
Even now, me

279
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.696
Can you call me father?

280
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:09.625
"Daeseongak"

281
00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.960
[Birdsong]

282
00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.061
[Man-ok in the recording] This money
If it is not returned

283
00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.814
I will accept any disadvantages

284
00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:36.485
To Gil Man-ok’s daughter Yoon Hae-mi
I understand that I can make a claim on my behalf.

285
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:40.155
April 10, 2023

286
00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.615
Gil Man-ok

287
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.910
I won't tell you much

288
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.288
[Yoojeong] The money that person entrusted to me

289
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.124
I hope you give it back

290
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.296
With that recording file
What can I do?

291
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.049
[Man-ok] And that money is black money.

292
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:00.509
You know

293
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.511
What was that guy doing?

294
00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:05.973
That kind of money is legally
There's no need to return it, right?

295
00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:08.726
No, mother

296
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:13.522
[Yoojeong] That money at the Mariela Hotel
This is the money invested in our foundation.

297
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.441
[Sighing] But

298
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.818
I have to give it back

299
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.155
Otherwise
Our Youngwoon is in big trouble.

300
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.284
You guys are in big trouble
Do you think it's because of the money?

301
00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:28.662
[Manok] You
The moment I marry that bastard

302
00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.331
Youngwoon is already over

303
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.292
- [Uneasy music]
- [Man-ok clicking his tongue]

304
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:37.254
Even if I had to choose
Pick a guy like that, really.

305
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:38.547
[Manok’s laughter]

306
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.631
Mother!

307
00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.467
[Yoojeong] I took that money

308
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.762
As my mother said
What if I charge Haemi?

309
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.097
do that

310
00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:49.183
Yes?

311
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.311
It's not just your life that's messed up.

312
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:56.065
I got caught up in your husband's asshole.
My life is a mess now too

313
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:57.649
[Manok] So

314
00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:00.986
Visit your dead husband's grave
Going to see Hae-mi

315
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.572
Don't come looking for me again, okay?

316
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.033
[Tsk mouth sound]

317
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.211
[Ilgu] Even now, me

318
00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:20.172
Can you call me father?

319
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:25.469
[sigh]

320
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:27.721
your father

321
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.557
What a bad person.

322
00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:32.893
[Yuncheol] Be careful, you too

323
00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:40.901
[Call connection tone]

324
00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:42.402
[cell phone vibrates]

325
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.406
I want your cell phone confiscated.
I think I did well

326
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:48.951
- [Nervous music]
- [Secretary Choi] As expected,

327
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.452
Do Jae-i contacted Ki Yun-cheol.

328
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:55.833
[Ilgu] Jae-yi kills Song Je-hyeok
I suspect it was something Ki Yun-cheol did.

329
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.461
I have to drive like that at this point.
I think it would be neat

330
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:01.130
[Secretary Choi] That means…

331
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:02.589
[Ilgu] Ki Yun-cheol

332
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.967
When the prosecution investigation begins

333
00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.428
I won't be able to withstand that humiliation.

334
00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:11.056
I'd rather die with honor

335
00:23:11.682 --> 00:23:13.475
They say they will protect the rest of the family.

336
00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.688
[Secretary Choi] Yes, I understand.

337
00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:23.652
But suddenly Dojae
Why do you keep it close to you?

338
00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:27.614
[Ilgu] My wife
Hidden in a paper company

339
00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:29.283
Find out about the slush fund

340
00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.535
I even exposed it to Jay.

341
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.746
Jay is the source of the money

342
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:38.458
If you know it's Angel's Club
Will I stay still?

343
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.672
Let's make enemies
Better to have it on my side

344
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.550
Will Do Jae Yi trust the Chairman?

345
00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:51.889
For an old man who is about to die
Pity is bound to arise.

346
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:53.515
Besides

347
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:55.601
The old man

348
00:23:56.685 --> 00:24:00.230
Especially if it's your father who you've missed your entire life.

349
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.156
[Door lock operating sound]

350
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.329
- [Tapping sound]
- [Door lock operating sound]

351
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:23.837
[Jay's happy sigh] Mr. Kang-hoo?

352
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.465
Are you here?

353
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.467
Change your clothes and come

354
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:30.344
Yeah

355
00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:35.766
I heard there was something urgent to do in the morning.

356
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.476
[Jay] What, did you go shopping?

357
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:40.812
[Kanghu] That too

358
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.898
There was someone I suddenly wanted to see

359
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.317
Who?

360
00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.487
The person who always smiles when he sees me

361
00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:52.157
[Laughing] What's going on? Without any contact

362
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.951
[Kanghu] I want to discuss something
Because there is

363
00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:58.413
To my grandmother
I think I can tell you

364
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.917
Jay, what's going on?

365
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.629
-Grandma
- [Sim-ok] Yes

366
00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:10.050
Grandma says Chairman Kang Il-gu
What do you think?

367
00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:12.302
What do you think?

368
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.764
[Sim-ok] The guy who abandoned my daughter and granddaughter

369
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.058
Just feed them a bowl of pesticide

370
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:19.810
I want to kill you
I think he's a bastard

371
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.981
Sometimes you call me and feed me.

372
00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:27.567
- Isn’t that still affectionate?
- [Sim-ok] That's

373
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:32.281
What if something happens to Jay?
To use it

374
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:36.660
[Sim-ok] Ah, still
You and Jay are related by blood.

375
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:39.413
[Kanghu] Could it be that Chairman Kang Il-gu

376
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.456
What if he's not a good person?

377
00:25:41.832 --> 00:25:44.251
- No, what if he is a dangerous person?
- [Uneasy music]

378
00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:49.423
About that guy
Did you find out anything?

379
00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:57.431
[Sim-ok] If that guy

380
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.350
If he is dangerous to our Jay

381
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.730
I just need to cut it off

382
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:06.440
instead

383
00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:09.067
Without Jay knowing

384
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:17.034
In the end, for Jay
I'm telling you not to say anything.

385
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:20.495
[Sim-ok] Jae-yi
Even if you don't show it on the outside

386
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:24.499
I'm a kid who's thirsty for his father's affection

387
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:31.173
But because of him
Hurt me again?

388
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:35.052
The kid who just got out of hell

389
00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:39.139
back to hell
There's no need to push it.

390
00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:46.938
[light laughter]

391
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:49.733
No, if I was going to see my grandmother
Let's go together

392
00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:51.860
[Jay] I want to see my grandmother too.

393
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:55.072
Then we can go together again tomorrow.

394
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:57.616
yes

395
00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.701
[Jay] But
What were you trying to make?

396
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.204
[Kanghu] You put it in ramen
Chicken stock

397
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.831
[Jay] But what ingredients?
So many?

398
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.167
Do you know that this is usually sincerity?

399
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:10.379
Instead, since it is homemade, you have to eat it quickly.

400
00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:12.631
later with this
Let’s eat a lot of delicious food

401
00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:16.343
Then I want to learn too, teach me

402
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:18.845
That's enough

403
00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.806
I have to do it for the rest of my life

404
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.100
[Calm music]

405
00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:26.311
- I want to try it.
- [Kanghu] Child

406
00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:29.314
- [Kanghu] Don’t do it, I’ll do it.
- [Jay’s light laughter]

407
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.733
[Jay] No, no
Just give it a try

408
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:34.069
- [Kanghu] Oh, it’s okay.
- [Jay] Huh?

409
00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:35.237
[Kanghu] I got hurt while doing it, now, now

410
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.613
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- [Jay] No, what did you hurt?

411
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:38.240
[Kanghu] Now, now
I'm sitting in my seat

412
00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.119
[Leo] It’s done

413
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.913
If you sleep well while taking this
I'll come to my senses

414
00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.625
injection man

415
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:53.422
you this
You know it’s illegal medical practice, right?

416
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:56.174
Former Mariela Hotel Vice President

417
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.843
You can't take him to the hospital.

418
00:27:58.718 --> 00:28:01.638
[Leo] And I can
You must be better than the nurses, right?

419
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.765
Even 10 years ago, I always let you go.

420
00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:07.310
Hey Leo

421
00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:12.149
- I'm not feeling well right now, am I?
- [Leo] No

422
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:13.900
Rather, it was a big problem.

423
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.403
You look so pretty even like this

424
00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.619
I'm sleepy

425
00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:27.539
- Take a deep breath
- [Leo] Yes

426
00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:34.921
[Haemi is crying] I no longer

427
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:39.468
To the people I love
I don't want to get hurt

428
00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:43.430
Even now, my mom

429
00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:47.809
cruel enough to me

430
00:29:11.374 --> 00:29:13.752
[President Jeong] I received a good reward.

431
00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:18.423
But the person who takes care of me
There is only you

432
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.884
[Leo] Did you hear that he died?

433
00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.305
Oh, Song Je-hyuk?

434
00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:27.474
I watch the news here too

435
00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:30.352
Then now
Because the scary guy is gone too

436
00:29:30.977 --> 00:29:32.646
Will you answer whatever I ask?

437
00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:36.149
Do you still have any questions?

438
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.569
Gil Man-ok, my mother-in-law

439
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.573
-What is your relationship with Song Je-hyuk?
- [Meaningful music]

440
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.742
[President Jeong] What is the relationship?

441
00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:50.705
What do sales people do?
It's all just like that, whatever.

442
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:54.876
brother

443
00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:57.462
Don’t you need permanent residence money?

444
00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:03.385
Baby, you ugly bastard

445
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.683
President Gil Man-ok and Song Je-hyuk

446
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.476
[President Jeong] Almost

447
00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:14.271
It was fate to be in the same boat

448
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.607
We did business together

449
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:19.818
Business?

450
00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:24.406
my mother-in-law
Do you have a stake in Ace Bar?

451
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.449
Hey, not there

452
00:30:30.996 --> 00:30:32.372
[President Jeong] There is a secret club, right?

453
00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:35.458
[Leo] Secret?

454
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.335
Hey, there

455
00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:39.337
angels club

456
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:44.968
[Grass bug crying]

457
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.309
[Manok] Dead
Visit your husband's grave

458
00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:53.476
Going to see Hae-mi

459
00:30:53.894 --> 00:30:56.313
Don't come looking for me again, okay?

460
00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:01.818
- [Sigh]
- [Sound of putting down a glass]

461
00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:03.528
[dark music]

462
00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:05.488
What kind of mother do you have?

463
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.922
[Eunsu] Still, type O
Because I can only get it from type O

464
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.132
It is disadvantageous compared to other blood types.

465
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.843
Besides, Nana is RH-

466
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:32.432
Among brain dead people, those conditions are met.
It won't be easy to find

467
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.728
[sigh]

468
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:46.613
[Meaningful music]

469
00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:33.451
I think it's me

470
00:32:35.412 --> 00:32:36.955
I don't want to leave it to you

471
00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:39.958
[Yuna] But Nana is only looking for you

472
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.543
You are the only mother!

473
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.254
What I can do for you
Not one, not one!

474
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.260
What's wrong with you?

475
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.762
What's going on?

476
00:32:58.643 --> 00:32:59.728
me

477
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:04.441
- They said they couldn’t give Nana a liver transplant.
- [Heavy music]

478
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.361
[Yuna] They say there’s a problem with my body

479
00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:10.780
Nana

480
00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:14.993
As you know, I'm RH-O.

481
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.371
Because it's so rare
They say it's hard to find a donor.

482
00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.916
What if something goes wrong with me?

483
00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:24.669
[Sobbing] Then maybe I'll be okay

484
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.212
[Yuna’s sobbing]

485
00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:33.762
so now i
Do you know what I brought?

486
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:47.108
[Yoojeong] What does this mean?

487
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.693
long term trading

488
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:51.446
What? Are you crazy?

489
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:52.655
doesn't care

490
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.700
I sit still
I won't just wait for luck

491
00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:57.911
[Yuna] Anyway

492
00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:00.246
Someone who will give me a liver transplant

493
00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:02.248
I'll definitely find it

494
00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:13.301
[Jay] Wow, with this
You mean you can make it all?

495
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.136
It's all-rounder

496
00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:18.515
With this one, you can now
You can invite guests to your house

497
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.433
[Jay] Wow, no way

498
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.936
I can't even cook ramen properly.

499
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:24.896
- [Kanghu’s light smile]
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]

500
00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:30.443
[Ilgu] Jay, I was just discharged from the hospital.

501
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:33.071
- [Dark Music]
- If we’re not busy, let’s eat.

502
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.536
[Ilgu] My lungs are hardening...

503
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.331
Am I dangerous?

504
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.458
Don't worry

505
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.461
Chairman, at the hospital
We have the best medical staff

506
00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:52.590
If you take good care of it
You'll probably be flying around

507
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.427
[Secretary Choi] Chairman
Where should we take you?

508
00:34:57.137 --> 00:34:58.179
Go to the hotel

509
00:34:58.721 --> 00:34:59.973
[Secretary Choi] Are you okay?

510
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:03.643
What's not to be okay with?

511
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:07.897
[tire rubbing sound]

512
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.237
[Kanghu] Whose message is this?

513
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:15.947
[Jay hesitates] Ah…

514
00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:17.532
- [Sound of grabbing a glass]
- [Clears cough]

515
00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.325
He said he was discharged from the hospital.

516
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:21.786
Him?

517
00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.625
Chairman Kang Il-gu?

518
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.337
- Uh
- [Sound of putting down a glass]

519
00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:34.841
- Are they contacting you openly now?
- [Heavy music]

520
00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:38.720
[sigh]

521
00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.472
I'm in this situation right now too

522
00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:46.311
It's so awkward and strange

523
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.065
Jay

524
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.359
[Kanghu] That person

525
00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:55.737
The person who abandoned you and your mother.

526
00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.657
Even when something like that happened to you
I pretended not to notice

527
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.243
So for the rest of my life
A kid who didn't even treat me like a father...

528
00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:03.620
I received an apology today

529
00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:10.960
How do you know if that apology is sincere?

530
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:13.254
I guess it hurts a lot

531
00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.049
[Jay] The people I received on the day I died

532
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:18.468
Well, they said they were doing something like repentance.

533
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.723
I guess he's like that too, well

534
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:28.353
Ki Yun-cheol was handed over to the prosecution.

535
00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:30.897
It must be sincere

536
00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.607
Did you check?

537
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.567
What I received on the day I died

538
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.611
No way

539
00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:39.405
What, are you going to play with your life?

540
00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:40.531
[Kanghu] I don’t know

541
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.617
Maybe he made a bigger prank and lived

542
00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:46.955
Why? What do you know, Mr. Kang-hoo?

543
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.085
[Sim-ok] Just got out of hell
The kid who escaped

544
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:56.673
back to hell
There's no need to push it.

545
00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:00.551
no, nothing

546
00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:03.805
Mr. Kanghu

547
00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:05.598
[Jay] Me

548
00:37:06.683 --> 00:37:07.767
for the first time

549
00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:11.980
To try to trust that person

550
00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:14.315
no

551
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:15.984
for the first time

552
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:19.112
I want to believe it once

553
00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.656
Throughout my life so far

554
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.074
Except Kang-hoo.

555
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:28.162
I lived my life suspicious of everyone

556
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:31.916
But now
I really don't want to live like that

557
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.421
[cell phone vibrates]

558
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:46.222
Uh, Leo

559
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:48.766
[Leo in a drunken voice] Uh, bro.
Where are you?

560
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.643
I have something to say to my brother.

561
00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:55.106
Yes, I'm waiting, I'll be there soon.

562
00:37:57.692 --> 00:37:58.776
[Sound of cell phone closing]

563
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:01.362
Leo will see you

564
00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:03.489
I'll go out for a moment and come back

565
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.542
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Door lock operating sound]

566
00:38:15.752 --> 00:38:18.379
- [Sound of door closing]

567
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:19.464
[sigh]

568
00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:25.595
[Leo’s elasticity]

569
00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.351
[Leo] You know my mother-in-law, right?

570
00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:34.604
Daeseonggak President Gil Man-ok

571
00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:39.484
To my mother-in-law now
Something big happened

572
00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:43.029
I think that's why you're trying to protect yourself.

573
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:44.697
What a big deal!

574
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.657
- Today, I am CEO of Ace Bar Jeong.
- [Uneasy music]

575
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:47.825
I came here to meet you

576
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.662
tell me

577
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:56.417
So my mother-in-law
The body of the club?

578
00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:58.461
The body is [light smile]

579
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:02.715
President Gil is just
He was a member recruiter.

580
00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:06.719
[President Jeong] The real body is
Ki Yun-cheol and Song Je-hyuk

581
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:11.057
But there’s a secret that Ki Yun-cheol doesn’t know.

582
00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:13.643
head over torso

583
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.562
The big man that Song Je-hyuk served

584
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.856
The big man that Song Je-hyuk served?

585
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.943
Who is that?

586
00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.070
I don't know that either

587
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.948
[President Jeong] But
There is a person named Secretary Choi.

588
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:32.203
That person is Ki Yun-cheol and that big guy.
I'm a person with both legs crossed.

589
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:36.416
That person is Song Je-hyuk
I came here often

590
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.042
To run errands for that big man.

591
00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:42.922
fact

592
00:39:43.256 --> 00:39:45.049
Take Goyonnado out of the bread.

593
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.051
I sent it to America
That's the big guy

594
00:39:48.678 --> 00:39:50.263
Why did the big man do that?

595
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:53.433
[Leo] Hyung

596
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.519
Even though I knew all these facts
Why didn't you tell the police?

597
00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.271
Am I crazy?

598
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:02.316
All I had to do was join Ace Bar.
Get involved with that club

599
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:04.318
It's better to pretend not to know

600
00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.071
[Leo] My mother-in-law

601
00:40:09.282 --> 00:40:13.119
If you are found to be involved with that club
They say you could go to jail.

602
00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:14.912
brother

603
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:16.914
This is it
Should I tell Hae-mi?

604
00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:18.708
Wait a minute

605
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:22.628
So
The big man that Secretary Choi worked for

606
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.630
He was actually the head of the Angels Club?

607
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:29.719
Yes, that's what I heard.
Why?

608
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.929
[Soaring music]

609
00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:43.649
[Secretary Choi] Chairman

610
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:45.651
Wouldn’t another room be better?

611
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:49.155
There's a lot of history here

612
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.950
It's better for me to protect it

613
00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.540
[Sound of door opening]

614
00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:14.555
[Heavy sound effect]

615
00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:17.183
[Dark sound effect]

616
00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:18.476
I'm craving a drink

617
00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:20.811
Shall we have a drink?

618
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.272
[Secretary Choi] Yes, Chairman.

619
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.821
[Secretary Choi] Choi Kang-hoo is correct.

620
00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.075
The guy you saw in the parking lot that day.

621
00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:38.162
in my car
I chased after you with something like this

622
00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:39.539
[Meaningful sound effects]

623
00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:48.130
Then you
I realized that you were mine.

624
00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:50.758
[Secretary Choi] I’m sorry.

625
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.219
I should have been more careful

626
00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.472
[Ilgu] That guy
Why did they chase you?

627
00:41:58.057 --> 00:42:01.227
He told me what happened 10 years ago
I was digging

628
00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.397
[dark music]

629
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:07.400
[Secretary Choi] Then

630
00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:11.112
I found Myeongsu

631
00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.322
[Ilgu] Then I

632
00:42:13.406 --> 00:42:15.992
I ordered them to turn off the CCTV.
You would have known

633
00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:19.787
Prayer ceremony for the dead
You might have hooked me up.

634
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.748
- [Nervous music]
- Even so, there is no evidence.

635
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:26.002
[Secretary Choi] Song Je-hyuk had
Video camera memory chips

636
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.129
I handled it well

637
00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:30.423
There were two cameras in that room.

638
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.050
Hidden camera installed by Gido-sik

639
00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:35.136
Are you saying the memory is gone?

640
00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:47.064
If you found out something
There will be movement

641
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.984
location tracker
I will handle it

642
00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:51.777
Leave it

643
00:42:52.862 --> 00:42:54.822
It might be useful

644
00:42:58.492 --> 00:42:59.577
[Birdsong]

645
00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.537
[Yuna] It’s definitely different

646
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.499
There is warmth

647
00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:08.085
Kang-hoo came and went, right?

648
00:43:13.132 --> 00:43:14.216
what's the matter?

649
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.469
A person who should die happy

650
00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:19.430
[sigh]

651
00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:21.557
I think that person is sick

652
00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:23.851
They say you can't live long

653
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.771
Chairman Kang Il-gu?

654
00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:34.278
I feel bad for you too

655
00:43:35.237 --> 00:43:36.947
This is a person I have hated my whole life.

656
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:41.577
Because I heard things like that
I feel a little like that

657
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:46.207
You are better off like this
Marry Kanghu.

658
00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:49.377
[Embarrassed] Marriage?

659
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.920
Oh, before you die

660
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.589
[Yuna] I got married
It’s nice to see people living well.

661
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.428
Do you have something to say?
Didn't you come?

662
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:03.599
[Yuna’s sigh]

663
00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:05.309
[Yuna] Just

664
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:08.813
I feel frustrated
I have nowhere to complain

665
00:44:10.398 --> 00:44:12.024
Because Yujeong is busy with foundation work.

666
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.527
What's going on?

667
00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.071
Nana liver transplant

668
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.908
I have a problem with my body
They say I can’t do it

669
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:23.744
[Yuna] I guess I committed a lot of sins

670
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.247
So I feel like I'm being punished

671
00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:28.416
What is my blood type?

672
00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:30.835
[Jay] Although I am not related by blood

673
00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:32.545
Still, you never know

674
00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:34.713
Type O and RH-

675
00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.341
- [Yuna] They say it’s the hardest thing to find a donor.
- [Meaningful sound effects]

676
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.137
[Jay] Type O and RH-?

[Meaningful music]

678
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:45.558
Yoojeong

679
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:48.018
Isn’t that the blood type?

680
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:51.397
Yoojeong?

681
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.942
Yeah, I think I heard that before.

682
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:57.111
Well, it's not accurate.

683
00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:20.092
[Cell phone operation sound]

684
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:25.222

[cell phone vibrates]

686
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:36.984
Yes, Yujeong noona.

687
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.571
Sister Haemi now
I'm sleeping because I'm sick

688
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:42.740
I'll tell you to call me when you wake up.

689
00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:44.825
yes

690
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.246
[Cell phone operation sound]

691
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.708
Does it hurt a lot?

692
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:55.461
[Sim-ok laughs] I see you often.

693
00:45:56.504 --> 00:45:59.340
If you came alone
Always complaining

694
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:00.799
- [Sound of door opening]
- Oh my, what...

695
00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:06.847
[heavy music]

696
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:31.747
- [Jay] Let’s eat.
- [Ilgu] Yes, let’s eat.

697
00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:45.261
[Ilgu] To my grandmother
I don't know if you heard

698
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:49.181
I like this sundae soup
I've been eating it since I was 20

699
00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:51.725
In the past, your grandmother

700
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:55.646
I ran a sundae soup restaurant and also stayed in a boarding house.

701
00:46:55.729 --> 00:46:57.189
I was a boarder there

702
00:46:58.023 --> 00:46:59.066
I heard

703
00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.944
That’s how I met my mom too.

704
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.200
[Ilgu] When you have no money and are having a hard time
Is it because it is food that fills my stomach?

705
00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:10.578
There is nothing more delicious to me in my entire life.

706
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.621
But you helped me when I had no money and was having a hard time.

707
00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:14.790
Grandma and Jay’s mother
So you left?

708
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.460
I even threw away Jae-yi.

709
00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:21.213
- Mr. Kanghu
- [Ilgu] No.

710
00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.132
It's true, but

711
00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:25.843
- [Heavy music]
- [Ilgu] That’s right.

712
00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:29.847
I betrayed Jay's mother.

713
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:34.602
I was hungry at that time too
Success was also painful

714
00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:39.523
So from now on
I'm trying to pay for that sin

715
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:42.651
The days I have left

716
00:47:43.902 --> 00:47:45.404
I will live for Jae-yi.

717
00:47:50.075 --> 00:47:53.287
Jay, still without a father
I've had a good life

718
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:57.124
But why come now
Do you need a father?

719
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.377
That's what blood lines are like.

720
00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:02.421
Even though we turn away from each other

721
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.507
Melting with a single warm word

722
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:10.554
[Ilgu] That’s a drop of blood
It's different from others who don't mix.

723
00:48:12.264 --> 00:48:14.475
[Kanghu] I also have blood
I thought it was something like that

724
00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.477
But it wasn't

725
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:22.566
Your ambition is more important than blood
That there is someone bigger

726
00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:24.777
I found out

727
00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.077
[cell phone vibrates]

728
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:39.041
[Jay] Yes, manager.

729
00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.420
Okay

730
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.260
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol

731
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.390
They say he jumped from the roof of the Gangbo Hotel.

732
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:56.225
[heavy music]

733
00:48:57.893 --> 00:48:59.269
I think it's suicide

734
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:05.401
[Sound of spoons being set down]

735
00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.194
How could this happen...

736
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.988
[Ilgu] How could this happen...

737
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:13.701
It's all my fault

738
00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:16.161
I drove him like that.

739
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:19.832
No, probably not.

740
00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.631
Hey there

741
00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:34.054
[uneasy music]

742
00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:38.726
[Jay] Maybe

743
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:41.311
this evening

744
00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:43.230
Would you like to come to my house?

745
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.358
At your house?

746
00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:50.404
at that hotel
It's hard when you're alone

747
00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:53.782
Come and have a meal

748
00:49:54.199 --> 00:49:55.659
I have something to ask you.

749
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.329
yes, thank you

750
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.513
Why are you going to that person's house?

751
00:50:17.222 --> 00:50:18.682
Just on the verge of death

752
00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:21.018
You're a sick person

753
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:22.394
[sigh]

754
00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:26.523
What should I ask that person?

755
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:29.860
Ki Yun-cheol

756
00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:32.196
That happened before the prosecution investigation.

757
00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:36.074
But such a big man

758
00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.786
Without struggling even once
Making that choice?

759
00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:43.332
Yesterday in the hospital room
What kind of conversation did you have?

760
00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:45.709
- [Jay] I wanted to ask you that.
- [Nervous music]

761
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.300
Did you meet that person, Ki Yun-cheol, yesterday?

762
00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:56.512
Yes, in the hospital room

763
00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.097
[Jay] I feel strange too

764
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:01.809
The person I met yesterday became like that

765
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:10.150
Mr. Kanghu

766
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:13.111
Are you coming later?

767
00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.783
[Call connection tone]

768
00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:20.494
[cell phone vibrates]

769
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:27.876
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

770
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.086
[Ilgu] There was no problem, right?

771
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:33.715
Yes, more than you think
I accepted it obediently.

772
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.927
[Yuncheol] The rest of my family
promise to keep

773
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.096
Please protect me

774
00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:41.598
[Secretary Choi] That’s
don't worry

775
00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:43.809
you have never

776
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.770
Have you ever been mine?

777
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.023
sorry

778
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.861
[Secretary Choi] Then, goodbye.

779
00:52:19.887 --> 00:52:21.138
Rep. Ki's suicide

780
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:23.599
Angels Club too
I think it will end well

781
00:52:24.016 --> 00:52:25.309
What about Representative Ki’s cell phone?

782
00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.643
[Secretary Choi] Processed.

783
00:52:29.187 --> 00:52:31.773
But there's a problem

784
00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.738
That guy Choi Kang-hoo
I think I know something

785
00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:42.993
Yes, I will prepare it for you.

786
00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:49.559
[Sound of pressing safe button]

787
00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.019

[Birdsong]

790
00:54:16.878 --> 00:54:18.046
[sigh]

791
00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:33.812
The lawyer didn't come to work today.

792
00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:35.564
I didn't come to see Jay.

793
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.275
I came to see the manager.

794
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.239
[Kanghu] For a long time
I watched the manager.

795
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.411
Thankfully for our Jay
You worked sincerely.

796
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:51.538
So

797
00:54:51.913 --> 00:54:53.248
I want to ask you a favor.

798
00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:54.583
- [Dark Music]
- only

799
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:59.588
What I will say from now on is
It's definitely a secret from Jay.

800
00:55:01.214 --> 00:55:02.591
To the lawyer?

801
00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:06.136
[Yongpil] That’s a little bit difficult.

802
00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:09.264
I am a lawyer

803
00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:11.725
That's it

804
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.644
[Kanghu] No matter what happens

805
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:17.564
The person who will become Jae’s person
Because it’s the office manager.

806
00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.399
This is what I'm asking you to do.

807
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:23.070
Can you do me a favor?

808
00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:28.283
Okay, tell me.

809
00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:44.508
I'm still not sure what it is

810
00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:47.719
I will do that

811
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.805
thank you

812
00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:55.894
[cell phone vibrates]

813

[Meaningful music]

814
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:08.740
He said he was leaving
Are you still here?

815
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:11.660
[Eunsu] Yes
I'm taking a boat from Incheon tonight

816
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.871
But who keeps
I feel like they're following me

817
00:56:15.664 --> 00:56:16.998
[nervous music]

818
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:19.626
Could this be Secretary Choi?

819
00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:21.461
Where are you now?

820
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.630
[Eunsu] It was that fishing spot back then.

821
00:56:24.756 --> 00:56:25.799
Wait a minute

822
00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.598
Secretary Choi's car is now
Kangbo is at the hospital.

823
00:56:34.015 --> 00:56:36.268
[Kanghu] It’s a long way from Myungsoo.

824
00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:38.145
So are you in debt?

825
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:41.022
You said you were leaving today, right?

826
00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:44.151
I'm in the middle
I'll check Secretary Choi's location.

827
00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:45.360
don't worry

828
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.487
yes, thank you

829
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:50.198

[Employee] Are there any flowers you want?

835

Are there any hydrangeas?

836
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:24.191
[Employee] Ah, yes
What color hydrangea do you want?

837
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:27.486
[Jay] With pink
Mix it with purple, please.

842
00:58:01.228 --> 00:58:02.604
I'll bring it later

843
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:05.065

Hae-mi says she’s sick.

[Yoojeong] Make some porridge, I’m going to give it to you.

846
00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.198
Come back

847
00:58:14.032 --> 00:58:15.033

888
01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.225
What is it? suddenly

889
01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:57.899
[telephone ringing sound]

890
01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:03.988

this room

895
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.146
It's not unfamiliar

896
01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:40.024
It's my hotel

897
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.235
Could it be unfamiliar?

898
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.406
[Ilgu] Every single room
There's no place I haven't looked into

899
01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:52.203
I thought I was going to tell Jay.
Haven't you tried it?

900
01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:57.041
If you were going to do it to Jay
You wouldn't have come looking for me

901
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.339
[Kanghu] So scary
Your shamelessness is beyond my expectations.

902
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:07.886
Still, since Jay is your father,
I'm here to give you a chance

903
01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.930
How about embroidering?

904
01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.141
embroidery? About what?

905
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.310
You must provide evidence

906
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.103
Are you going to admit it?

[heavy music]

908
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.440

That tough guy

910
01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.662

[Ilgu] A tough guy

917
01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:59.270
You can finally embroider yourself
Have you thought about it?

918
01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:23.962
[Kanghu] See you soon

919

Is there anything you are looking for in particular?

[Jay hesitates] Uh

934
01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.403
When to propose
What do you usually do?

Do you want to decide in advance?

It's always true
