00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.696
If Yoojeong

186
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.200
Even if I find out that Nana is my daughter

187
00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.162
[Yuna] Like now
I don't know if I'll be pretty

188
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:08.584
Then

189
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.754
[Jay] I am Song Je-hyuk
If you take off that damn mask

190
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:15.133
Even Yujeong will trust me then.

191
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.885
[Yuna] How are you going to take it off?

192
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.304
As he said

193
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.015
This mask is you
It's not proof of sexual assault.

194
00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.435
I'll make you a star

195
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.896
star? Song Je-hyuk?

196
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.024
That guy is in the shadows
If he was active like that

197
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.860
It's hard to show to the outside world

198
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:37.196
[Jay] Pull it up to the surface
If you make it a star

199
00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.199
No matter how perfect the mask is,

200
00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:43.411
The bare face is revealed

201
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.246
[surprised gasp]

202
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.624
[secret music]

203
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.334
Then you take charge of the brisket.

204
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.878
[Yuna] I’ll take charge of the dark side

205
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.005
It will be easier if you press up and down.

206
00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:56.549
Can you do it?

207
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.843
Anyway, he's your ex-husband.

208
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:00.428
I'm more worried about you

209
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.056
Anyway, Yoo-jeong is her husband.

210
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:13.316
Let’s do our best, Go Yoo-na.

211
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.278
[Jehyuk] Sometimes Nana looks for you

212
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.206
remember

213
00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.541
me, you, my daughter

214
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.881
We had a good time in America

215
00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:45.306
[Yuna] Then

216
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.100
Can you show me?

217
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.693
Do your best, Dojae.

218
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.282
[Secretary Choi] You couldn’t find the mask?

219
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.455
[Jehyuk] Yoo Yoo and that

220
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.207
I handed it over to Dojae.

221
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.168
Hey

222
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.295
[Sound of Secretary Choi taking a deep breath]

223
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.800
No, then Song Je-hyuk
Doesn’t it become more dangerous?

224
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.260
[Secretary Choi] That mask is

225
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.762
With Dojae rather than Go Yoo Na
Because it's more relevant.

226
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.475
So tell this to Representative Ki.

227
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.185
No matter what I do

228
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.063
Do Jae-i becomes the mayor of Tongju
Stop it

229
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.566
[Jehyuk] Otherwise, it’s not just me

230
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.611
The whole Angels Club
You might get stepped on

231
00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.154
[nervous music]

232
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.326
[Kanghu’s sigh]

233
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:50.872
[Jay] The evidence I have and

234
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:54.000
The blood DNA on the mask
It matches

235
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.251
[Sound of paper turning]

236
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.712
Now that guy is the culprit

237
00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.463
It became clear

238
00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.384
But how did you do that?
You can clean your identity, right?

239
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.261
[Yongpil] In the name of Song Jehyuk

240
00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.263
violation of traffic laws
Didn't take off a single ticket

241
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.437
[Jay’s sigh] Mayor Jeong Gu-tae
Please contact the chairman of the sponsoring association.

242
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.691
From now on, in the Tongju mayoral election
sold out

243
00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.745
[Calm music]

244
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.996
[Heavy sound effect]

245
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:51.891
[Kanghu] Yuna, I’m Kanghu

246
00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.768
Can I meet you for a moment?

247
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.273
[Sound of cell phone closing]

248
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.614
[Jay] Mayor Jeong Gu-tae
when you were alive

249
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.699
I used to come here often

250
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.662
True every time
I remember eating it deliciously.

251
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.122
this restaurant

252
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.000
The chairman of the sponsoring association
You run it, right?

253
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:21.963
Oh, yeah, well, well, yeah

254
00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.300
At the minister's celebration party

255
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.844
[Jay] Mayor Jeong Gu-tae

256
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.805
You said that.

257
00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:33.099
As mayor's successor

258
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.184
You think of me

259
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.853
Chairman

260
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.730
In this mayoral election

261
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.984
My sponsoring chairman
How about becoming one?

262
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.988
Uh, that…

263
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.073
[Sound of intake of breath]

264
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.908
That's so...

265
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.159
[Sponsoring Chairman] Oh my

266
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.245
Are you here?

267
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.122
[dark music]

268
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.582
- [Yuncheol] Sit down, sit down
- [Sponsoring Chairman] Ah, yes

269
00:15:58.666 --> 00:15:59.667
[Kichul’s light smile]

270
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.005
This is someone who should know.

271
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.298
At someone else's meal

272
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.134
You can't intervene.

273
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:09.844
[Laughs] Well, actually

274
00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.930
[Yuncheol] Here to the chairman
I came here because I had some business to do.

275
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.440
Because the recommendation to cancel the correction order was processed

276
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.734
You can relax now

277
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.068
[Sponsoring Chairman] Oh my

278
00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.030
Thank you, Senator, thank you.

279
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.407
- [light laughter]
- [Sponsoring Chairman’s happy laughter]

280
00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.617
Ah, here’s the chairman.

281
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.202
Blink by mistake

282
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.706
This store
You did an illegal expansion?

283
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.668
[Yuncheol] This restaurant
I have been a regular customer for decades

284
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.378
can you stay still

285
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.048
I helped you a bit.

286
00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:51.052
Oh, hey, Chairman.

287
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.554
Could you please give me some acorn jelly?

288
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.931
It's not on the menu

289
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.184
How delicious it was

290
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.685
- [Yuncheol’s laughter]
- [Sponsoring Chairman] Ah, yes

291
00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:03.898
[Sponsoring Chairman] Soon
I'll make it for you, yeah [laughter]

292
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:14.075
Only in Tongju

293
00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.452
25 years as a member of the National Assembly

294
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.498
Something that has no basis whatsoever, what?

295
00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.167
[Yun Cheol] You want to become mayor?

296
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.252
- [Snort]
- [Sound of clattering chopsticks]

297
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.347
If you try to eat it raw like this

298
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.724
I'm sick, I'm sick

299
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.937
By now

300
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.606
Misconceptions about me
I think you solved it?

301
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.692
The real culprit who killed my son

302
00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.487
Does anyone really have any doubts?

303
00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.533
[Jay] Take a good look

304
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.537
The saying ‘it is dark under the lamp’
As you think about it

305
00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.972
[Call connection tone]

306
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.599
Uh, senior?

307
00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:23.310
[Atmospheric music plays]

308
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.694
[Sound of Hae-mi catching her breath]
Isn’t it strange?

309
00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.529
This pasta has all kinds of ingredients.

310
00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.114
- It's all in there.
- [Sound of picking with a fork]

311
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.867
last posted
A few pieces of this black truffle

312
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.161
This pasta scent
They take over everything.

313
00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.453
[sigh]

314
00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:43.330
you are really good at speed

315
00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:45.875
When I see the rice being passed over

316
00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:48.752
[laughter]

317
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:50.754
- [Sigh]
- [Sound of fork being put down]

318
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:57.928
What is this?

319
00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.097
My black truffle?

320
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:01.974
what?

321
00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:03.809
Jay that's it

322
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:07.104
Jeong Gu-tae's family
After processing, the fee received

323
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.149
through my mom's store
I washed it

324
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.526
[heavy music]

325
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.195
[Haemi] I have this

326
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.489
We will occupy the land of Tongzhou City.

327
00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:29.668
[Savoring elasticity]

328
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.004
[Sound of paper turning]

329
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.388
With this, Jay
Are you trying to threaten me?

330
00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:43.307
[Laughing] What is a threat?

331
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.059
It's called black truffle.

332
00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.978
- [Haemi] Let’s just watch the situation first.
- [Sound of fork being put down]

333
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.524
Either hand it over to Jay or not.
Hand it over to Ki Yun-cheol.

334
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.361
I just need to secure the land

335
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.532
This

336
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.868
[Yoojeong] Is there anything in the file?

337
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.995
[Laughing] My mom
You're old.

338
00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.330
That ledger is unique

339
00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:10.251
[Sound of Hae-mi taking a deep breath]

340
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.795
[Haemi] Maybe you too
If you want to share it

341
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.130
taken from our hotel

342
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.674
- Give me 10 billion first!
- [Yujeong’s surprised gasp]

343

- Oh, really.
- [Sound of a ledger being closed]

345
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:24.223
Okay, I'll give it back, okay?

346
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:27.476
[light laughter]

347
00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.777
[Haemi] How about newlywed fun?

348
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.279
good?

349
00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.407
[Jehyuk] Why do you keep
Are you being dragged around by your friends?

350
00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.450
Are you Mojiri?

351
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:46.870
just

352
00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:50.916
Is it different from before marriage?

353
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.129
It seems like things have changed a bit

354
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.257
[bursts of laughter]

355
00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:01.802
Hey, I'm getting married
Are there some men who don’t change?

356
00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.888
Ah, all men change, all

357
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.307
[Haemi’s laughter]

358
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:08.684
Right?

359
00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:10.894
That's it, right?

360
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.479
[Sound of clicking tongue]

361
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:16.025
I'm more worried about Nana than Jehyuk.

362
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:20.029
Sometimes I meet you and you make me happy
It’s different from raising them at all.

363
00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:22.781
[Sound of dishes being set down]

364
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:24.658
Yes

365
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.286
[Yoojeong] Since we met Nana

366
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.496
It's only been a year

367
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.249
As if from the beginning
like you were my baby

368
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.501
It's so so pretty I'm going crazy

369
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.047
Now the world without me

370
00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:40.507
It's so unimaginable?

371
00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:42.092
Then it's a bigger problem?

372
00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.553
[Haemi] When my real mother comes to visit
What are you going to do?

373
00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.097
This is a woman who committed a crime and went to prison.

374
00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.932
What right do you have to come to Nana?

375
00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.394
What does prison have to do with your real mother?
If you gave birth, you are the biological mother.

376
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.396
[Haemi’s worried breathing]

377
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.981
I rather use the excuse that that woman is me.

378
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:57.775
- I'm worried that it will shake up Jehyuk too.
- [Heavy music]

379
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.821
[light sigh]

380
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.075
Ah, so why are you like that?
Are you married to a complicated man?

381
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:08.077
[Haemi clicks her tongue]

382
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.496
[Haemi] Like me
I should have done it with a simple man.

383
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.291
[Savoring breathing]

384
00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:19.338
[President Jeong] Mariela Hotel
In the suite

385
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.299
Is there a VVIP member waiting for you?

386
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:23.884
I bring you a gift

387
00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.803
I put the things you need in it.

388
00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.262
I'll tell you

389
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.348
It's for my sister, my sister

390
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.683
[Leo] I only
There is only one sister, Haemi.

391
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.227
Okay, it's okay.

392
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:35.562
[Nervous breathing]

393
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.526
VIP-only elevator
Where is it?

394
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:43.529
- [Employee] You can go here.
- thank you

395
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:44.863
[Employee] Yes, thank you

396
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:52.496
[Employee] Hello.

397
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:55.207
That person just now
What were you asking?

398
00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:58.877
[Employee] Ah, to the VIP-only elevator.
You asked for the direction

399
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:00.754
Ah, yes

400
00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.424
[Doorbell sounds]

401
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:11.765
[Doorbell sounds]

402

[Sound of door opening]

403
00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:16.562
[Light elasticity]

404
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:18.522
- Hey, this flower delivery.
- [Woman’s surprised gasp]

405
00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:19.898
I think I came to the wrong place?

406
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:22.067
[Leo] Here is a gift

407
00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:31.118
- [Sound of door opening and closing]
- Is it really okay if I don’t take you there?

408
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:32.703
The hotel is just around the corner.

409
00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:34.913
- Then I'm leaving.
- [Yoojeong] Yes

410
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:48.427
[Branch Manager] No more

411
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:52.431
How much money do you have to repay now?
Another loan?

412
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:57.394
[Yoojeong] Received from Mariela Hotel
That's because I have to pay back the donation.

413
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:02.691
Even if we use our office building as collateral.
How could it not?

414
00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:05.402
I'm talking about that donation.

415
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.322
- [Branch Manager] Financial District Jjirasie
- [Dark Music]

416
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.199
Rumors are going around

417
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.452
Because of the land lawsuit

418
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.162
I can't move

419
00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:18.415
The culture and arts complex

420
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:21.001
Is it true that the Youngun Foundation does this?

421
00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:28.800
[sigh]

422
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:35.140

[Call connection tone]

424
00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:41.063
Ah, aunt

425
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.732
Yes, I'm on my way home.

426
00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:45.651
Did you pick up Nana?

427
00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:46.777
[Woman] Oh, no

428
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.781
Well, I got a call from the chairman.
I said I would pick it up myself.

429
00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:54.785
[Surprising gasp] But
Did you stop by the playground? You're a little late.

430
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.203
Are you Jehyuk?

431
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.249
yes, i understand

432
00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:03.502
[Cell phone operation sound]

433
00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:06.797
At the playground?

434
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.426
Please go to the playground

435
00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.271
[heavy music]

436
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:24.398

[Children's laughter]

438
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.542
Who are you?

439
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.007
if

440
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:55.178
Do you remember me?

441
00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.181
I'm Anna...

442
00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:00.475
Oh no

443
00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:03.395
I remember me too

444
00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.480
I don't know

445
00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:10.569
[Nana] But lady
Why are you crying?

446
00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:16.325
[laughter mixed with tears]

447
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.785
just

448
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:21.955
[Crying breath] Nana
Because it’s so pretty

449
00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:24.082
The lady is pretty too

450
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.960
My mom is prettier though

451
00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:33.133
[sniffling sound]

452
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:34.426
Nana

453
00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:37.054
Can I touch it?

454
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:43.810
[Yuna’s trembling breathing]

455
00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:47.230

[Yuna continues to sob]

460
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.025
Huh? Wait a minute

461
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.446
[nervous music]

462
00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:42.119
[Sound of car door closing]

463
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.406
Because I listened to what you wanted
Now it's my turn

464
00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:21.575
[Jehyuk] Tell me

465
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.410
Dojae

466
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.912
What are your future plans?

467
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.708
Nothing much yet

468
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.377
I'll let you know when I see movement

469
00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:37.549
If you still want to see Nana
You'll have to do it right

470
00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:42.929
I have a question

471
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.099
[Yuna] Yoojeong caught it
You even became the chairman of the foundation.

472
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.435
- But why are you so greedy?
- [Nervous music]

473
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.228
Doing secret business

474
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:52.814
It's instinct

475
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:56.359
Just as you cling to your maternal instinct

476
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:58.695
my instinct is money

477
00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.324
I have some strength
Things that ignored me

478
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.701
Put it under my feet and dominate it.

479
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:06.495
That's

480
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:08.997
For that to happen, it is a necessary project.

481
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:14.377
If it's a business

482
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.756
That club or something?

483
00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:23.053
[snort]

484
00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:26.723
At least I should know something
let me help you

485
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.059
[Soaring music]

486
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:35.357
Still you

487
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:38.193
You're the kid's dad, right?

488
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.410
Don't go to Ace Bar.

489
00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:50.163
Because I don’t want you to get hurt either.

490
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.875
[Jehyuk] Still you

491
00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.002
You're the kid's mom, right?

492
00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:04.177
Yujeong is still with us

493
00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:06.555
Don't you know?

494
00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:13.395
- [Sound of door opening and closing]
- [Nana] Mom!

495
00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.981
[Yoojeong] Uh, is my Nana here?

496
00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.482
It's me

497
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.317
Did you have a good time?

498
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:21.778
[Nana] I drew it in kindergarten today

499
00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.113
[Surprise gasp] Really?

500
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:24.656
Let's see

501
00:30:24.739 --> 00:30:27.659
[Yujeong is surprised] Wow, you drew it well.

502
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.704
[Impressed exclamation] Thank you so much
It's me

503
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:33.623
Mom now

504
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:36.334
Without me or me
I don't think I can survive even a day

505
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.547
I love you, my daughter [laughter]

506
00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:43.675
Oh, but it's me

507
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.344
Where did you go with dad earlier?

508
00:30:46.428 --> 00:30:47.971
It wasn't there because I went to the playground?

509
00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:50.181
I went to another playground

510
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.435
But there
I played with a certain lady

511
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:56.521
What kind of lady?

512
00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:58.857
My dad knows this woman

513
00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.985
[Nana] That lady too
You look pretty like your mom

514
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.863
[uneasy music]

515
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:08.783
[Nervous breathing]

516
00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:15.123
[Jungho] The person waiting
Who is it?

517
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.084
[Senior] Ah, Chairman.
You will find out when you go in.

518
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.763
To arrogant lawyer Do Jae-i
Shall we get a drink?

519
00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.806
- [Jungho] What are you doing? Now, huh?
- [Sound of a kettle being put down]

520
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.974
I'm trying to upset the situation.

521
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:36.102
Hey, are you out of your mind right now?

522
00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:40.607
[Senior] I’m sorry

523
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.027
Do-byeon also asked for a favor.

524
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:45.820
[Jungho] It’s done.

525
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.238
I have nothing to do with you

526
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.200
Today is not the Do Jae of those days.

527
00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:52.702
please give me one more chance

528
00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:05.298
[Sound of a kettle being set down]

529
00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:12.597
It was really rude back then.

530
00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.599
Kim Joong-ho, Chairman of Nomination Management

531
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:20.563
[Jungho] I ran for the Tongju mayoral election.
There will be no need to get nominated anymore.

532
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:24.067
Write it to me for some reason
Has your attitude changed like this?

533
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:28.405
I am new to politics and

534
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.323
Because he is an independent candidate

535
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:34.077
[Jay] Will you support me on this floor?
The elderly are not there

536
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.205
Representative Ki Yun-cheol of the Liberty Korea Party and

537
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.457
the only one
able to stand shoulder to shoulder

538
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.793
Jeonghandang Chairman Kim Jung-ho

539
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.671
[Jay] My political supporter
If you can be

540
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.716
more than this
I don't think it can be an honor

541
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:50.135
Give me a drink

542
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:52.053
- They're asking for everything.
- [Senior’s light smile]

543
00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:53.304
[Joongho’s heavy breathing]

544
00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:54.514
[Jungho] With rude language

545
00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:57.934
I am Lawyer Jae-i Do.
If you become a political supporter

546
00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:00.395
What do I get?

547
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:05.066
Chairman
If you just do that

548
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:07.652
That

549
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:10.447
You will have Dojae.

550
00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:13.199
[secret music]

551
00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.289
[camera shutter sound]

552
00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:29.883
[applause]

553
00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:41.394
[Sangkuk] Lee Jeonghandang, Liberty Korea Party

554
00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:44.355
These two major political parties
I feel disgusted with old politics

555
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:48.151
As a refreshing independent candidate
You said you came out

556
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:49.736
Now, like this

557
00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:52.822
You joined the Jeonghandang.
What was the trigger?

558
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.115
[Jay] With all my promises

559
00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:57.786
It will become a landmark of Tongzhou City.
A cultural and artistic complex was proposed.

560
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:00.038
In order to carry out that promise

561
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:03.374
I have a strong organization behind me.
I realized I needed it

562
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.754
[Reporter] Candidate Jae-i Do
After becoming a candidate for the Jeonghan Party,

563
00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:11.633
Naturally, the Liberty Korea Party candidate
I'll be your biggest rival

564
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.135
Among the candidates currently being discussed

565
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.638
which candidate
Are you keeping an eye on it?

566
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:20.433
surpassing me
Unless a fresh candidate emerges

567
00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:23.770
[Jay on TV] Something that could be powerful
There are no candidates?

568
00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:25.271
[Camera shutter sound on TV]

569
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.398
[Sim-ok] Our Jay

570
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:30.860
mayor approval rating
You know we’re running in first place, right?

571
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.489
People in the market here are already

572
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:38.993
My granddaughter became mayor
It's just a mess, it's a mess [laughter]

573
00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:43.081
[Ilgu] As usual
The table setting has changed a bit.

574
00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.749
[Sim-ok] Oh my, it has to be different.

575
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.961
I'm going to charge more for food than usual.

576
00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:51.297
- How much do you need?
- [Meaningful music]

577
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:56.427
[Sim-ok] Um, our Jay
Enough to hold an election?

578
00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:58.638
I will deposit money

579
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:03.143
Money alone isn't enough
My daughter is running for election.

580
00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:07.856
The obstacle in front of Jae-yi
Clean it up like this

581
00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:11.234
Oh, you can do it.

582
00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:15.488
I'll try

583
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:29.878
[Employee] We haven’t opened yet.

584
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.962
Uh, hello

585
00:35:31.838 --> 00:35:34.257
Boss Jeong, are you ready to go to work yet?

586
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.885
Today

587
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:39.554
Are you here to see Mingi?

588
00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:48.521
[Yuna] Drink

589
00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:52.650
[Mingi] Ah, my job is
Because I'm not a player

590
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:54.319
Would you like me to call someone?

591
00:35:54.944 --> 00:35:56.154
I came to see you

592
00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.240
I'm better than the players

593
00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:00.867
Are you more attracted to me?

594
00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:02.869
The mask is novel

595
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:05.747
[dark music]

596
00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:07.373
What do you think?

597
00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:09.167
[Yuna] Playing as a real player is

598
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.629
Rather than delivering alcohol to my sisters

599
00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:14.839
With my sisters
Don't you like drinking alcohol?

600
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.677
President Jeong
I'm not that one...

601
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:20.970
What does he know?

602
00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.223
A man sees a woman accurately

603
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:26.351
[Yuna] You know Leo, right?

604
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:28.478
his wife

605
00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:30.021
Did I tie it up?

606
00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:39.072
What can I do?

607
00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.284
[People's exclamation]

608
00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.078
[People laughing and applauding]

609
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.334
[Jay] Please take care of me

610
00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.877
[Man 1] Oh, that’s good.

611
00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:54.671
- You're a total drinker, a drinker.
- [Jay’s light laughter]

612
00:36:54.754 --> 00:36:55.755
[Man 2] That’s right.

613
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:57.257
With that knack for drinking bombs

614
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.051
About Tongju City
Would you like me to eat it hot? huh?

615
00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:01.344
[People laughing]

616
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:04.931
[Joongho] Drinking alcohol so well
How have you been holding on for so long?

617
00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:09.143
I finally
I think I found a talent

618
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.436
[People laughing]

619
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:15.608
If you build a culture and arts complex
A promise to take care of my share

620
00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:16.901
Don't forget

621
00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.570
Ah, is there any possibility?

622
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:20.697
[laughter]

623
00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:22.532
But Jay

624
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.367
[Senior] You were earlier

625
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.662
Liberty Korea Party lawmakers to reporters
Aren't you ignoring me too much?

626
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:30.248
Politicians can't do that

627
00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:32.500
Even if I swear on the inside
Pretending to be good on the outside

628
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.294
You have to become an actor half the time.

629
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:37.547
- Look, our great actors.
- [People laughing]

630
00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:40.717
[Jay] You have to lay the ground like that.

631
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.427
I feel like I'm going to crawl out

632
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.387
[Jungho] Who is crawling out?

633
00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:47.724
I want to fight separately
Do you have a partner?

634
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:50.351
Chairman

635
00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:54.814
Because the chairman is a journalist,
Are you close with reporters?

636
00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:59.944
I am better than Ki Yun-cheol
That's the strong one, right?

637
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:02.989
- [People laughing]
- Close ties with the media.

638
00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:04.490
[People laughing]

639
00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:07.827
Then to the political reporters

640
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.662
- Please tell me just one rumor.
- [Dark Music]

641
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:12.790
Rumors?

642
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:20.840
[Kanghu’s sigh]

643
00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:26.763
[Sound of door opening]

644
00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:43.279
[Jay’s tired breathing]

645
00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:50.870
[Kanghu] No, what the hell?
How much did you drink?

646
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:52.872
Looks like I'm getting drunk too

647
00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:56.042
I drank a little too much

648
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:58.711
[Jay] There’s nothing we can do.

649
00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:02.298
[Kanghu] But like this
What if I drink too much?

650
00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:05.593
Don't push yourself too hard, hurt yourself

651
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.887
- [Sigh]
- [Calm music]

652
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.264
I'm fine

653
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.767
I'm worried about the kids

654
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:14.811
Kids?

655
00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:17.772
Yes, Hae-mi and Yoo-jeong.

656
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:23.277
Still believe in me
These are the kids who followed me.

657
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.697
Well, I can't tell the truth

658
00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.449
You must be in so much trouble.

659
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:31.994
What do you plan on doing?

660
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:35.081
[Sigh] We should meet and talk.

661
00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:38.584
I can't avoid feeling betrayed at all, but

662
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.711
somehow

663
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:43.297
I want to make you hurt less

664
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:46.342
[sigh]

665
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.511
[light laughter]

666
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.305
[Kanghu] Haejang Ramen? okay?

667
00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:53.599
[Jay] Okay

668
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.112
[sigh]

669
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:10.533
[Jay] Yoojeong-ah, Haemiya

670
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.493
let's meet up

671
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:15.580
[cell phone vibrates]

672
00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:19.292
[nervous music]

673
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.169
[Yuna] I’m busy so I’ll reply now

674
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.129
Why are you suddenly asking to see me?

675
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:30.219
Mr. Kanghu

676
00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:34.765
[Kanghu] Trust me

677
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:36.851
no matter what anyone says

678
00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.228
I mean

679
00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:44.817
[light laughter]

680
00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:46.402
just

681
00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:48.196
Because thank you

682
00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.989
[light laughter]

683
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:55.536
[telephone ringing sound]

684
00:40:58.706 --> 00:40:59.707
[Jehyuk] Yes

685
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.919
[Secretary] Chairman, at OCS
A reporter came to visit

686
00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:04.295
OCS?

687
00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:06.672
Uh, come on in.

688
00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:09.550
[Sound of putting down the receiver]

689
00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:10.885
[Knocking sound]

690
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:21.604
hello
This is OCS reporter Sang-guk Han.

691
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:23.022
[Awkward laughter]

692
00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:25.233
What happened to you, reporter?

693
00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.569
- [Jehyuk] Candidate for Tongju mayor?
- [Nervous music]

694
00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.198
Me?

695
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:34.200
[Sang-guk] Ah, ah [laughter]

696
00:41:34.283 --> 00:41:35.701
Oh, you don't know.

697
00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:39.205
This is a political club like ours.
It's a rumor going around among reporters.

698
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:41.499
You really have no idea.

699
00:41:41.707 --> 00:41:44.919
Huh? Well, from the Liberty Korea Party.

700
00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:47.838
He is a candidate for this Tongju mayoral election.

701
00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:51.425
Appointment of Chairman Song Je-hyuk
I heard you are planning

702
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.595
Why in the Liberty Korea Party?

703
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.139
I go that way

704
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.933
I've never been active at all

705
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:02.144
As much as Jeonghandang candidate Do Jae-i
fresh and

706
00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:03.771
[Sang-guk] Also, at the orphanage

707
00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:06.148
To young children
Well, I heard you were called an angel.

708
00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:07.942
- [Embarrassed laughter]
- If you are an angel

709
00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:11.112
Huh? Candidate Do Jae-i, an icon of justice, and
It's worth it

710
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:12.405
This is it

711
00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:13.948
[cell phone vibrates]

712
00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:23.207
[Jehyuk] Yes, this is Song Jehyuk.

713
00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:25.084
Jeonghan Ilbo?

714
00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.129
[Incoming call sound]

715
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.257
[in a low voice] Ah, reporter.
Wait a minute

716
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.341
[Sang-guk] Yes, yes

717
00:42:33.301 --> 00:42:34.302
yes

718
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.180
Myeongjin Today?

719
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:41.225
- [Soaring music]
- [Noisy noise]

720
00:42:45.438 --> 00:42:47.815
- [Reporters’ questions]
- [Camera shutter sound]

721
00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:05.207
[Jay] Now the table is set

722
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.001
Can I just herd rabbits?

723
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:15.593
[Atmospheric music plays]

724
00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:19.472
[Sound of a bottle being set down]

725
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:27.938
[Jehyuk] In return for making our wedding shine

726
00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:31.984
I will serve you once, I will serve you
It's late.

727
00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.778
Because this is where I live today

728
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.529
Eat as much as you want

729
00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:38.824
It's a very popular topic these days.

730
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.536
And then really
Aren’t you going to be the mayor of Tongju?

731
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.871
[Manok’s laughter]

732
00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.373
[Gicheol clears his throat]

733
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:48.542
[Yuncheol] Well, not really
Because reporters keep pestering me

734
00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:52.046
I shouted that it was unfounded.

735
00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:55.174
No, the mayoral candidate
Where are the kids playing?

736
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:57.968
Where did you get such ridiculous origins?

737
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:02.223
Where are you from?

738
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.557
[Clears cough]

739
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.977
[Sharp sound effect]

740
00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:09.897
[Music that heightens tension]

741
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.981
[Awkward laughter]

742
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.025
Don't do that, just push me.

743
00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:15.903
[Man-ok] Like Chairman Song
A healthy young man

744
00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:17.196
Became the mayor of Tongju

745
00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:18.989
If I become the congressman's right hand man

746
00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:21.367
I think it would be good for the presidential election as well.

747
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.077
[Yuncheol] Eheh, really, really

748
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.580
Sprinkling shit on someone else's table
Please stop yelling

749
00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.796
What do you think, Chairman Song?

750
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.384
Thinking?

751
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:40.761
Are you interested in politics?

752
00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:49.812
I don't know

753
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:53.858
never thought about it
Because it doesn't happen

754
00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:56.026
When you make up your mind, tell me

755
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.404
[Ilgu] Really for the sake of Tongzhou City

756
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:01.949
Willingness to work hard
If you stand

757
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.247
[Haemi’s laughter]

758
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.040
[Atmospheric music plays]

759
00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:13.961
[Haemi’s speaking voice]

760
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:17.298
[Nervous breathing]

761
00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.685
Were you here first?

762
00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.316
[Sound of dishes rattling]

763
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.067
[sigh]

764
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.403
[Jay] Now

765
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.002
This is my regular place

766
00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:59.006
Goes well with steak
They also do good wine pairing.

767
00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.592
[Haemi] I’m no good?

768
00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:04.345
My favorite restaurant that I sometimes trusted is like this.

769
00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.846
- I heard you're betraying me.
- [Sound of putting down a glass]

770
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:09.558
[Sound of dishes rattling]

771
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:11.393
[Clears cough]

772
00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:14.271
Traveling with Kanghu

773
00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.190
[Yoojeong] Did you like it?

774
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.151
[Jay] What about you?

775
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.611
Me what?

776
00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:23.531
Is it okay to get married?

777
00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:24.740
[panicked breathing]

778
00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:27.826
What's so bad about it?

779
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.663
I had a wish

780
00:46:30.996 --> 00:46:32.414
Building a perfect family

781
00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:33.916
[Haemi] Oh, that’s right

782
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:37.169
Jehyuk's article appeared on the Internet today
Do you know it's plastered all over the place?

783
00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.880
Liberty Korea Party candidate for Tongju mayor
It's rising rapidly

784
00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:42.508
What should I do?

785
00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:44.260
- [Sound of chopping steak]
- If you do something wrong, it's you.

786
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:46.303
It looks like you're being pushed out by Jehyuk?

787
00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:49.765
[Yoojeong] Those are all rumors

788
00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:51.684
Don’t reporters know?

789
00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:55.604
When it comes to elections
Just spreading rumors

790
00:46:55.688 --> 00:46:57.398
[Laughing] What's wrong?

791
00:46:58.023 --> 00:46:59.024
Hey, honestly

792
00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.192
- [Haemi] Jehyuk said rudely.
- [Sound of putting down]

793
00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:01.402
What's missing?

794
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:03.529
Excellent persona, good image

795
00:47:03.612 --> 00:47:06.865
Besides now
You are the chairman of the Daeyoungwoon Foundation.

796
00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:08.742
Our Mr. Jehyuk

797
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:11.412
I said I didn’t want that chairman position either.

798
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.414
[Yoojeong] What kind of election is a person like that?

799
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:16.333
Even if not

800
00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:19.461
[Jay] Because of that, I have something to say

801
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:25.551
In Tongju City
Decided to build a culture and arts complex

802
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:29.972
I don't think I can do it with you guys

803
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.223
[heavy music]

804
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:33.017
As Haemi said, Mr. Jehyuk.

805
00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:35.853
The political world is paying attention now.

806
00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:38.355
That kind of person
To the foundation where he serves as chairman

807
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:40.024
Entrusting that big construction project?

808
00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.276
It's not dangerous

809
00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:44.028
In politics

810
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.947
somehow
Because I'm going to try to make someone my own.

811
00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:48.741
[Surprise gasp] But how...

812
00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.075
I told you so

813
00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:51.910
He betrayed us

814
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.706
[Haemi] Was that the condition?

815
00:47:55.914 --> 00:47:57.374
What are the conditions for joining hands with Yuna?

816
00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:59.293
Are you throwing us away?

817
00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.669
[Jay] What are you talking about?

818
00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:02.254
Why did I abandon you?

819
00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:03.756
[Haemi] That’s enough

820
00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:06.592
Now no matter what you say
I don't believe it

821
00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:10.387
[Yoojeong] Jay

822
00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:12.765
Just one more time
Why not think about it?

823
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.892
We really need that land

824
00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:16.226
Wake up, you too!

825
00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:17.436
Jay

826
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.439
Please
Let's think about it again, okay?

827
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.150
- [Haemi] Come out
- Please, Jay.

828
00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.943
- [Haemi] Wake up!
- [Yoojeong] Jay

829
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:26.654
[Haemi] Come out

830
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.780
[Yoojeong] Jay!

831
00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:28.864
[Yujeong’s surprised exclamation]

832
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.886
[Haemi] You have become a best friend

833
00:48:51.303 --> 00:48:52.680
You became a best friend

834
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.099
Do you go to your favorite restaurant together now?

835
00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:58.018
But Dojae

836
00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.937
There is only one difference between a friend and an enemy.

837
00:49:00.562 --> 00:49:01.855
That we were best friends

838
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:05.275
That much about you
Because I know everything inside out.

839
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.778
Even your private parts

840
00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:25.129
[Calm music plays]

841
00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.047
- [Yuna] Do you regret it?
- [Writing sound]

842
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.633
You kicked them out and stuck with me

843
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.178
How did you find out about this place?

844
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.850
Because it’s not something to say over the phone
I went to the office and

845
00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:39.351
The office manager is here

846
00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.311
What do you mean?

847
00:49:42.688 --> 00:49:43.689
[Sound of dishes being set down]

848
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:49.570
[Yuna in the recording] Tell me

849
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:52.698
at ace bar
Have you ever seen a suspicious gathering?

850
00:49:53.741 --> 00:49:54.742
[Mingi in the recording] That’s…

851
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.535
[nervous music]

852
00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:57.953
[Mingi] About once a month?

853
00:49:58.787 --> 00:50:00.372
General guests are not accepted

854
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:02.750
There are days when the entire store is emptied.

855
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.293
Once a month?

856
00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:06.503
When is that?

857
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:09.840
[Yuna] The 18th of every month

858
00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:12.217
The staff at Ace Bar

859
00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:14.762
Not even accepting regular guests
There's a suspicious meeting going on.

860
00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:16.597
That's it

861
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.432
It was the Angels Club.

862
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:23.020
Ace Bar is called Angel's Club?

863
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.938
How did you know that?

864
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:26.690
Maybe

865
00:50:27.232 --> 00:50:28.442
[Jay] Have you met Song Je-hyuk?

866
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.781
This is information I obtained by selling my daughter.

867
00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.367
you

868
00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.078
You have to catch him

869
00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:46.126
[Jay] Thank you

870
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:47.961
I

871
00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:51.965
I will definitely find your daughter

872
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:56.261
[Yuna] Did you do something too?

873
00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:59.139
It really made him a star.

874
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:01.099
But

875
00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:03.811
But would he really run for office?

876
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:07.481
I need to make him run for office.

877
00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.275
Even if I grab him by the collar

878
00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:20.035
[Jehyuk’s strong breathing]

879
00:51:20.118 --> 00:51:21.286
[Sound of car door closing]

880
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:25.332
What else do you have to say?

881
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:27.960
You really

882
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.339
To Tongju Market
Why not run for office?

883
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:35.968
[laughter]

884
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.846
Earlier, you said something about your background.

885
00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.558
Why did you change your mind?

886
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:45.310
Chairman Kang Il-gu

887
00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:49.273
I told you to leave
Do you know why?

888
00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:54.945
The opponent that his daughter Do Jae-i will defeat

889
00:51:55.487 --> 00:51:57.114
It's because you're easy

890
00:51:58.657 --> 00:51:59.658
[heavy music]

891
00:51:59.741 --> 00:52:00.742
- [Yuncheol] So, at this point
- [Sigh]

892
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:02.744
Make sure to step on Dojae.

893
00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.414
Because I will push you

894
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:09.251
Rep. Ki

895
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:13.005
Do you want to keep Chairman Kang Il-gu in check?
I understand your feelings, but

896
00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:19.553
I want to be used there
I have no thoughts?

897
00:52:20.762 --> 00:52:21.847
[Yuncheol] One way or another

898
00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:24.892
You have nothing to lose, right?

899
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:27.853
hopefully

900
00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:31.398
Tongzhou City is yours.

[cell phone vibrates]

903
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.210
[Jay] Let’s meet, Ace, come right away.

904
00:52:52.294 --> 00:52:53.337

905
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:03.597
[Rhythmic music]

906
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.062
[President Jeong] Reservations are made today
How many teams are there?

907
00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:12.356
- [Mingi] I guess it’s almost full today, right?
- [President Jeong] Oh, really?

908
00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:14.691
[Mingi] Hello

909
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.027
This is membership only
This is where it operates

910
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.695
Are you a member?

911
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:20.614
I came to meet a guest.

912
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.574
My name is Song Je-hyuk.

913
00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.620
We will guide you to the prepared room.

914
00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.121
[President Jeong] Come here.

[Sound of door opening]

917
00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:26.763
[Jehyuk] What’s going on?

918
00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.765
Let's all meet up tonight?

919
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.893
Are you busy?

920
00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:34.021
As soon as I sit down, I get to the point.

921
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.150
Pour a glass of that

922
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.986
[laughter]

923
00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:44.031
You say you don’t drink alcohol from men?

924
00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:47.117
Are you saying you're not a man? to me

925
00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:48.910
[snort]

926
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.255

[Sound of putting down a glass]

928
00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.727
[Jehyuk] One drink
Are you trying to reconcile?

929
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.895
Or

930
00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:18.273
Did you miss me that day?

931
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:22.694
[snort]

932
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:26.281
I made the mistake of thinking that he had asked me to pour him a drink.

933
00:55:27.908 --> 00:55:30.827
I feel like I'm going to explode from stress
You called me

934
00:55:31.203 --> 00:55:32.621
[Jay] You must have seen that article.

935
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:34.247
As if

936
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:37.709
Like you're my rival
Talking loudly

937
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:39.294
[Jay snorts]

938
00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:40.754
I can't pray

939
00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:43.048
How are you my rival?

940
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:44.424
dare

941
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.259
From that place

942
00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:49.387
- From, from!

943
00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:52.682
[sigh]

944
00:55:53.058 --> 00:55:54.726
What the hell are people

945
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.645
Why are you questioning my origin like this?

946
00:55:57.562 --> 00:56:00.065
[Jehyuk] You do that
Aren’t you the granddaughter of the Sundae Guk restaurant?

947
00:56:00.398 --> 00:56:01.900
The origin I'm talking about is

948
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.277
Money, background, nothing like that.

949
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:08.073
Is it an innate quality?

950
00:56:12.994 --> 00:56:13.995
[Sound of putting down a glass]

951
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:15.747
Are you curious?

952
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:18.208
What is Dojae’s dignity?

953
00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:24.172
Ah, I came here to relieve some stress.

954
00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:27.050
Let's quit

955
00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:28.802
It's not fun

956
00:56:31.012 --> 00:56:32.222
[rustling sound]

957
00:56:34.683 --> 00:56:35.725
Is this okay?

958
00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:37.102
What is this?

959
00:56:38.436 --> 00:56:39.771
you were the host

960
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.815
[Jay] I heard it was pretty popular

961
00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:45.569
But is it because I’m old now?

962
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.612
You’re not attracted to me at all?

963
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.031
[secret music]

964
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.663
This is what class means.

965
00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:00.292
I don't want to give even a single penny
Even if he’s a piece of trash

966
00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:02.878
I wish I had called you and made you pour me a drink

967
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:04.796
Tips are courtesy to give

968
00:57:06.631 --> 00:57:07.716
Did you understand?

969
00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:11.511
[Jehyuk] You

970
00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.931
If I become your real rival
What are you doing this for?

971
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.687
To women in bars like this
On the subject of drinking alcohol

972
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:23.190
[Jay] Becoming the mayor of a city?

973
00:57:24.065 --> 00:57:25.150
Hey

974
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:26.735
wake up from a dream

975
00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.904
A place where you can climb

976
00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:31.364
Yoo-jeong turned his back and climbed up.
the chairman's position

977
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.867
That's it.

978
00:57:34.868 --> 00:57:36.036
[Jay snorts]

979
00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.788
Well, actually, that space is too much.

980
00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:40.415
you just

981
00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.292
This is the place

This is Song Je-hyuk.

[Soft music plays]

992
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:36.930
[Yoojeong] The rumor should have ended as a rumor.

993
00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.892
Suddenly it's Tongju Market?

994
00:58:43.478 --> 00:58:46.606
[Jehyuk] Sometimes there are rumors
It can also become reality

995
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:50.569
But the reality is that bad
Isn't it true?

996
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:53.196
Our Youngwoon is in crisis right now.

997
00:58:54.114 --> 00:58:56.616
When I become mayor
I can save Youngwoon

998

Guaranteed to happen...

999
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.621
My opponent is Jae-yi.

1000
00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.208
[Yoojeong] How could you
I will beat Jay

1001
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.334
[Screaming] Jay, Jay, Jay!

1002
00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.503
[dark music]

1003
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:10.964
you are still better than me
Are you trusting Jay more?

1004
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.340
Do I look that funny?

1005
00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:15.427
[Jehyuk] You were abandoned by Jae-yi, right?

1006
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.429
So, the culture and arts complex
It went across the water

1007
00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:18.972
Then like this
You can't stay still.

1008
00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.473
We have to stop it somehow!

1009
00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:29.107
[sigh]

1010
00:59:33.278 --> 00:59:34.738
your wish

1011
00:59:34.946 --> 00:59:36.990
You said it was about creating the perfect family.

1012
00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.408
Then

1013
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.369
help me become mayor

1014
00:59:41.786 --> 00:59:42.996
Then Yeongwoondo

1015
00:59:43.955 --> 00:59:45.790
We can protect our families too

1016
00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:50.503
[Nana] I went to another playground

1017
00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:54.299
But there
I played with a certain lady

1018
00:59:54.716 --> 00:59:56.801
My dad knows this woman

1019
00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:59.804
That woman is just like her mother
You look pretty

1020
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:03.558
Okay

1021
01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.436
[Yoojeong] I will support your choice

1022
01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:08.563
But

1023
01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.025
The only thing that protects Youngun is

1024
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.736
It's not about creating a perfect family.

1025
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:17.947
me

1026
01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.243
And I have to protect myself too.

1027
01:00:24.245 --> 01:00:26.039
Okay, I will do that.

1028
01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.124
[Yoojeong] Thank you

1029
01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:30.585

1030
01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:32.879
I believe it

1031

[Kanghu] Thank you, for meeting me

1032
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.391
Why do you want to meet Jay secretly?

1033
01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.769
[Yuna] Come back with me
I'm not asking you to date me

1034
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.941
I want to know about the prayer ceremony

1035
01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.236
Prayer ceremony?

1036
01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:58.613
Not even Song Je-hyuk?

1037
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.448
That incident 10 years ago

1038
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.535
It started from a prayer room.

1039
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:06.955
[Kanghu] Now Jae-yi
Because I'm chasing Song Je-hyuk.

1040
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.250
I don't know if Jay had an incident like that.
From that very day

1041
01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.252
Let's chase after it

1042
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.170
[laughter]

1043
01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:17.173
It's truly a desperate love

1044
01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:21.094
[Yuna] Mr. Kanghu

1045
01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.514
Aren't you being too cruel to me?

1046
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:27.684
[Kanghu] I’m sorry

1047
01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.688
But about the prayer ceremony
The only person I can ask is you

[Interesting music]

1049
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.404
What do you want to know about prayer ceremonies?

1050
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.043
I'm threatening Dojae with this.

[Sound of a ledger being closed]

1052

Or hand it over to Song Je-hyuk.

1053
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.596
What will benefit me?

[Jihee] Oh, that’s right, this person

1057
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.241
[Laughing] He was your groom.

1058
01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.077
I saw you briefly before getting married.

1059
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:29.496
- I didn't recognize you.

1061
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.919
I saw your groom at the hotel

[nervous music]

1063
01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.506
I heard you were going up to your room?

1064
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.468
It is also the highest presidential floor.

1065
01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.012
- What?
- [Jihee’s breath of realization]

1066
01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:49.557
Oh, before your groom gets married.
You said you were the host, right?

1067
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:54.187
[Jihee] Still a mutt
Aren't you able to stop pooping?

1068
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.147
- This is real!
- [Jihee’s exclamation of surprise]

1069
01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.399
Are you going to hit me like this?

1077
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.727
[Yuna] Hey there

1078
01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.273
Are you Aunt Nana?

1079
01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.649
Ah, yes

1080
01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.526
Are you here to meet your baby’s mom?

1081
01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:42.944
[Light laughter] No.

1082
01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.573
fact

1083
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.157
I came to see my aunt.

1084
01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:49.909
Me?

1085
01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.161
yes

1086
01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.290
[Yongpil] What was in it?
I don't know, but

1087
01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.750
quite a lot
was being transported inside

1088
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:10.847
This is Song Je-hyuk’s car.

1089
01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.601
Even after business hours
I visited again

1090
01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.605
something from ace bar
There seems to be movement

1091
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.856
In 18 days

1092
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.650
tomorrow

1093
01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.235
What should I do?

1094
01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.119
The prayer ceremony [sigh]

1095
01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:35.872
A typical bully

1096
01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.333
[Yuna] Alcohol, drugs

1097
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.002
A typical rich son who likes women?

1098
01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.173
I don't know any more than that

1099
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.009
Even now

1100
01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:51.012
About prayer ceremony
Can anyone tell me?

1101
01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.264
Well, a prayer friend or something.

1102
01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:54.515
[laughter]

1103
01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.644
his friends
It's all similar to the prayer ceremony.

1104
01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.188
Mr. Kang-hoo is meeting me.
What special story should I tell you?

1105
01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:02.440
[light sigh]

1106
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.485
But think a little more

1107
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:08.112
[sigh]

1108
01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:11.658
[nervous music]

1109
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.034
Yujeong’s orphanage?

1110
01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:16.371
[Yuna] That guy on the weekend
I definitely went there and served.

1111
01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.082
If you don't go

1112
01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.834
Ki Yun-cheol is his card.
I said I'd cut it off.

1113
01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.266
[tire rubbing sound]

1114
01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.436
[surprised gasp]

1115
01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.233
[Kanghu's urgent breathing] Are you okay?

1116
01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.028
Blood, ugh, this guy
I can't see it

1117
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.738
[Kanghu] Ah, blood, blood

1118
01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:53.282
- [Intense sound effect]
- [Student’s terrifying scream]

1119
01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.789
[Soaring music]

1120
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.710
[cell phone vibrates]

1121
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:10.717
[Yuna’s surprised gasp]

1122
01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.387
[breathing in relief]

1123
01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.147
Now, is everyone ready?

1124
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.231
[Police] Yes!

1125
01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.151
[tire rubbing sound]

1126
01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.570
[Junghyeon] In our palace district
distributing drugs

1127
01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.697
There is an illegal secret organization
A report has been received

1128
01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:40.830
- Let’s have fun clearing it out!
- [Police] Yes!

1129
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.208
[Police talking]

1130
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.547
[Employee] Hey, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait

1131
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.631
[Sound of arguing]

1132
01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.425
[Police 1] Drug dealing here
There was a report that there was

1133
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.093
Is this real?

1134
01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.428
[Police 2] Come out, come out, come out!

1135
01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.263
[Police 3] Go straight in.

1136
01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.601
[Sound of people talking noisily]

1137
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.522
[Police 4] Miss, give me your handbag and go.
Give me the handbag!

1138
01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.024
[singing sound]

1139
01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.072
[People’s excited exclamation]

1140
01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.406
[Police 5] Everyone stop moving

1141
01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.285
[Sound of arguing]

1142
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.127
What are you doing now?

1143
01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:33.132
A person who conducts business with a law-abiding spirit
Can I turn you into a druggie like this?

1144
01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.809
[Call connection tone]

1145
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.936
The lawyer's prediction was correct.

1146
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.896
There is no Song Je-hyuk here.

1147
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.942
[Jai] Tomorrow is the 18th

1148
01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.527
[Yongpil] What should we do?

1149
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:55.363
[sigh]

1150
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.448
Please prepare first.

1151
01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:59.826
[Yongpil] Still a daycare center with angels
Are you getting caught?

1152
01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.328
The day of the opening ceremony of the Angels Club

1153
01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:05.873
Song Je-hyuk is at Cheonrang Orphanage.
had a wedding

1154
01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.542
the wedding

1155
01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.877
I thought it was the opening ceremony of the club.

1156
01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:13.047
However, in a daycare center with children
What can be done?

1157
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.299
- [Sigh]
- [Yongpil] As Go Yoo-na said

1158
01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.218
ace bar
How about hitting it?

1159
01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.846
Let's hit two places at once.

1160
01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.223
[sigh]

1161
01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:24.725
That's right, Chief.

1162
01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:28.020
[Jay] It’s not an ace bar
This is correct

1163
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.272
[Junghyun] I only believe in one thing

1164
01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:31.858
You know that if this goes wrong, it’s over for me, right?

1165
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.443
Yes, let's go

1166
01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.113
[Police] Come on, let’s go.

1167
01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:38.990
[nervous music]

1168
01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.381
[Director] No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1169
01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.799
What's going on, this time of night...?

1170
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.221
[Jay] Just this
It's just the beginning

1171
01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.017
I waited 10 years

1172
01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.480
The beginning of revenge on you

1173
01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.275
[Embarrassing elasticity]

1174
01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.070
more cruelly

1175
01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.160
even more miserable

1176
01:09:27.455 --> 01:09:28.539
I'll trample you down

1177
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.085
that day

1178
01:09:34.378 --> 01:09:35.421
there

1179
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.508
you showed me

1180
01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.178
In return for that hell

1181
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.306
[Woman's scream]

1182
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:50.978
Now your mask is coming off

1183
01:09:51.646 --> 01:09:52.688
right away

1184
01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:55.316
- The moment you open this door
- [Sound of door opening]

1185
01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:06.410
[Sound of door slamming shut]

1186
01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:17.797
[Nana] What is it?

1187
01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:26.138
[Yuna] Do you know who this person is?

1188
01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:28.391
[Nana] Aunt

1189
01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:33.729
Then

1190
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.482
Who is this pretty baby?

1191
01:10:43.864 --> 01:10:45.324
[Intense sound effect]

1192
01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.160
[secret music]

1193
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.054
[Jehyuk] Choi Kang-hoo?

1194
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.639
[Kanghu] It’s a prayer ceremony.

1195
01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.308
Do you remember?

1196
01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:13.644
[Jehyuk] Unlucky bastard

1197
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:15.563
[Jay] I will soon

1198
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.441
{\an8}About the identity of the orphanage
I think I can tell

1199
01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.526
{\an8}Then it's the end for Song Je-hyuk.

1200
01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:23.696
{\an8}[Jehyuk] Tell me

1201
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.865
{\an8}I’m curious too

1202
01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.366
{\an8}Your heart

1203
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:29.493
{\an8}[Yuna] Is it a secret club or something?

1204
01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:31.537
{\an8}First of all, starting with Song Je-hyuk
Can't we solve it?

1205
01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:35.458
{\an8}- Do you remember the lady?
- [Nana] Yes

1206
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.626
{\an8}[Yuna] I'm looking for Nana
One o'clock is urgent

1207
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.711
{\an8}[Nana’s happy exclamation]

1208
01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.087
{\an8}[Yoojeong] Because of that past

1209
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:43.591
{\an8}My precious family now
There will be no waking up

1210
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.509
{\an8}No matter what happens

1211
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.511
{\an8}I

1212
01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.013
{\an8}I will protect you

1213
01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:50.473
{\an8}[Yoojeong] Promise me one thing

1214
01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:51.640
{\an8}Jay Niga

1215
01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:53.893
{\an8}Me and Jehyuk

1216
01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.270
{\an8}I won't do anything that breaks the family.

1217
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:57.813
{\an8}I can't do that

1218
01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:58.898
{\an8}[Sigh]

1219
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.900
{\an8}[Jay] I am your husband

1220
01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.360
I can't forgive
