1
00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.716
- [Heavy music]
- [Ilgu] Thank you for your difficult decision.

2
00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.719
Through your new club

3
00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.598
{\an8}Unimaginable money and power
You will taste it

4
00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.814
{\an8}I promise to help you
I kept it

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.649
{\an8}Now it's your turn

6
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.736
{\an8}My relationship with Jae-i
promise to cut off

7
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.238
{\an8}How will you protect it?

8
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.908
{\an8}I'm not contacting you.

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.618
{\an8}Jay doesn't either.

10
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.161
{\an8}That's not enough

11
00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.331
{\an8}You need to show it more clearly.

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.041
{\an8}[Ilgu] For example…

13
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.929
[Yuna] Shall we reveal Jae-yi’s weaknesses?

14
00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:56.598
[Yuna’s laughter]

15
00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.601
That's enough
It's not just about severing ties.

16
00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.354
Almost like Jay
Sounds like you're saying to become an enemy, right?

17
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.356
That's right, Marshal

18
00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.149
[Ilgu] That should be enough

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.569
A relationship that has lasted for over 20 years
I can quit

20
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.990
You've seen Jay for a long time.

21
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.661
About Jay
You know better than anyone else.

22
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.123
But as you know

23
00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.126
Jay is an icon of justice
I'm the kid who was called

24
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.630
[Yoojeong] To a child like that
There can be such a thing as a weakness...

25
00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:29.840
[Haemi] Yes, there is

26
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:34.386
Why, in the past, Jeong Gu-tae's family
You took care of it afterward.

27
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.848
[Yuna] You burned that evidence.

28
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.683
It's not a weakness if there's no evidence

29
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.060
without a copy
Where is the discount book?

30
00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.105
Do you have a copy?

31
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.233
- [Nervous music]
- Yes, I have.

32
00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.364
[Haemi] What I decided to do
Let's just cool it down

33
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.575
Even if it gets robbed anyway, Jay won’t die.

34
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.244
So reassuring
What are you worried about when you have a chaebol dad?

35
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.499
It would be better for Jay to be broken

36
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.085
I hope you come to the Chairman’s arms
Is that what you want?

37
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.796
That way, Jay’s suffering will end.

38
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:12.382
You're really smart.

39
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.426
[Ilgu] Jay

40
00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.804
Now I'm trying to embrace it

41
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.309
I have a file on Jay’s money laundering ledger.
I'll give it to you

42
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.311
[Haemi] That’s enough

43
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.187
Can you trust us?

44
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.317
Jay is coming here now.

45
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.360
[Ilgu] Make up your mind

46
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.446
When you break off a relationship

47
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:37.198
It must be cut off clearly

48
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.005
[Doorbell sounds]

49
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.261
Are you here?

50
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.265
[Sound of door closing]

51
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.646
[Jay's surprised gasp]

52
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.940
[Jay] How did you guys…

53
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.444
[Ilgu] Now these people
not your friends

54
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:17.906
They are my guests.

55
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.575
[secret music]

56
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.717
What does he mean now?

57
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.308
[Shouting] I'm asking you what you mean!

58
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.269
Father, it’s exactly what you said.

59
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.479
[Yuna] We

60
00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.065
I'm going to stop seeing you now

61
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.735
This is what happened to your life
They say it's all because of us

62
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.821
Then you should cut us off

63
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.532
This is how my life turned out
Is it because of you?

64
00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.368
Who said that? Is that him?

65
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.203
It's not wrong.

66
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.332
[Yuna] If only you didn’t get involved with me
your life

67
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.251
It was probably easier than it is now.

68
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.295
Let's stop now

69
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.506
Hey, Go Yoona

70
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.675
Let's just do it, Jay.

71
00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.636
We can survive only if we cut you off.

72
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:23.805
please

73
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:26.641
Yoo Jeong Ah

74
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.436
[Jay] Are you like that too? uh?

75
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.021
I'm sorry

76
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.150
I'm sorry, Jay.

77
00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.247
[Crying] How can you

78
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.294
[Jay] You guys
How could you do this to me!

79
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.448
[Ilgu] Do you understand now?

80
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.077
I told you, build your strength

81
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:32.499
But what you’ve raised so far
Is this all it is?

82
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.085
friend? trust? Loyalty?

83
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.045
Something with no power?

84
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.214
Why are you doing this?

85
00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.342
Why on earth
Are you going this far?

86
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.219
Jay

87
00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.181
Just once

88
00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.017
Have you ever trusted me?

89
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:53.853
[Ilgu] To increase strength

90
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.356
- [Heavy music]
- The strongest person

91
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.774
You have to believe it

92
00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.276
i feel bad about that

93
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.238
As a father, I feel sad.

94
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.157
Why don't you trust me?

95
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.914
You betrayed my mother and abandoned me.

96
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.376
How can I trust you like that?

97
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.380
It's true that you betrayed your mother, but
I didn't abandon you

98
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.340
[Ilgu] Even 10 years ago

99
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.467
And even now

100
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.636
I am Abby

101
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.848
A minimum of conscience
I think I have lived by protecting it.

102
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.933
Conscience?

103
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:33.935
[snort]

104
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.854
Anyone who has something like that

105
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.773
I don't commit murder

106
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:40.775
It's murder...

107
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:45.905
The beginning

108
00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.032
It was because of you

109
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.504
10 years ago, that guy Ki Yun-cheol

110
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.632
for his political ambitions

111
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.179
I made it with great care
Tried to take over the Angels Club.

112
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.765
[Ilgu] I stay still
I couldn't help but win

113
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.186
But then by chance

114
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.480
- [Heavy sound effect]
- I got to know Song Je-hyuk.

115
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.108
[Jehyuk] You’re so famous
Vice President

116
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.027
Why did you come looking for me?

117
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.070
This is the ace of the floor?

118
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.156
I also sell some medicine

119
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:29.949
[Ilgu] Whether it’s alcohol or drugs

120
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.494
Selling it is amazing
I heard a rumor that you are good at it

121
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.874
But I don’t have a taste for men.

122
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.834
I can't sell alcohol to the vice president.

123
00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.170
Could you please give me some medicine?

124
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.964
[Ilgu] No
Try selling me something else

125
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.383
what a bastard's weakness

126
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.135
Weakness?

127
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.512
It's a prayer ceremony

128
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.973
Son of National Assembly member Ki Yun-cheol
Are you a customer?

129
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.727
[Ilgu] That bastard
Take a picture of me doing medicine

130
00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.523
If possible, take medicine and touch a woman...

131
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:02.857
[Jehyuk] If you do

132
00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:04.817
What will you give me?

133
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.070
mask

134
00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.988
- [Dark Music]
- Mask?

135
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.450
[Ilgu] Korea’s best
Only those in power can use it

136
00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.120
What do you think?

137
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.332
Would you like to try it?

138
00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:22.794
[Ilgu] I can see at a glance

139
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:27.340
I recognized his devilish nature.

140
00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:30.593
{\an8}- [Hye-ran] A flawed daughter
- [Exciting music plays]

141
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.554
{\an8}Getting married to such a nice family

142
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.057
Really in a coma
Would that be enough?

143
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.643
Ah, that's why I'm telling you

144
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.853
- Now that I've said anything,
- [Paper rustling sound]

145
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.568
[Yuncheol] What I’m finishing today is
How about it?

146
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.071
[Hye-ran] In such a hurry...

147
00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:51.739
No, the wedding is in two weeks.

148
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.576
Well, it's such a drag
Isn't it true?

149
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.244
[Yuncheol’s laughter]

150
00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.328
That's what I heard.

151
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:58.955
[Sound of a group of people taking a deep breath]
Wait a minute

152
00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.582
[uneasy music]

153
00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.877
What do you do after the wedding?
I think it's natural

154
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.672
[Ilgu] Even a small contract is a contract.

155
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.511
[Sound of water]

156
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.349
[Yuncheol] Are you saying that because you feel like it’s a waste?

157
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.353
That's why you're sabotaging me.

158
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:27.150
The vice president put so much effort into
A daycare center with angels

159
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.779
I'm going to end up in a coma.

160
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.449
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure

161
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:37.952
Let's be honest with ourselves

162
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.539
[Yuncheol] I was splitting the fish belly.
The son of a raw fish restaurant

163
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.251
I married the daughter of Kangbo Group.
Became vice president

164
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:47.837
Is there anyone who doesn't know?

165
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:53.885
But the son-in-law is not related by blood.

166
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:58.514
An uneasy situation where you don’t know when you will be kicked out.

167
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.516
That's why I made it

168
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.603
Abanggung in the basement of the orphanage

169
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.397
That's where the powers that be gain strength

170
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.859
To become the real owner of Kangbo Group

171
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.406
I guess that's what the congressman said.

172
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.535
I'm lucky enough to keep my seat as a member of the National Assembly.

173
00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.789
You have organizational skills and money.

174
00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:27.502
[Ilgu] When
I don't know if I'll be unemployed in politics.

175
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.588
So you're selling your son's wife?

176
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.509
I set it up at the orphanage
Are you trying to steal Abang Palace?

[snort]

178
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:39.555
That's right

179
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.557
I didn't know either

180
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.685
my son like that
Will it be a great help?

181
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.774
[Yuncheol] So
I guess the old adults did that.

182
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.321
No matter what
Farming for children is the most important

183
00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.200
[Yuncheol’s laughter]

184
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.670
Let's take a look

185
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.007
[Ilgu] Will that son be my strength?
Could it be poison?

186
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.218
[Soaring music]

187
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:18.428
[Elevator button sound]

188
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.826
[Ilgu] I turned off the CCTV, let’s start the party

189
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.960
[Ilgu] Ki Yun-cheol’s son
In order to overcome the weaknesses of the prayer method

190
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.422
I sent the devil to the hotel

191
00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.257
- [doorbell sound]
- But

192
00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.260
in that room

193
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.679
Not Goyeonana

194
00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.432
- [Heavy sound effect]
- You came.

195
00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:06.017
[Jehyuk] That’s not him.

196
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.604
He said he was giving that drink to Yoo Yoo-na.

197
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.147
Oh, did I know?

198
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:14.650
It's called O, but it doesn't come.
The wrong kid came and drank that drink.

199
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:17.778
[Scheme] Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know

200
00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.156
I'm a girl
They come and harass me one by one

201
00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.824
I feel like my head is going to explode, really.

202
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.453
I went in, took a nap, and came out.
I'll think about it

203
00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.288
Are you watching carefully?
Okay?

204
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:31.959
You little bastard

205
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.222
[cell phone vibrates]

206
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.935
[Ilgu] Is the party over?
Did the recording go well?

207
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.354
[light sigh]

208
00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.779
[Meaningful music]

209
00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.243
Hey

210
00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:07.078
[Jehyuk groans in pain]

211
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.247
[Dosik’s encouraging sound]

212
00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.374
[Jehyuk] Hey, no, [squeezing]

213
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.542
[Ilgu] From then on

214
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.378
Things got complicated

215
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.171
[Jehyuk groans in pain]

216
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.590

218
00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.055
[Jehyuk’s sound of strength]

219
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.021
[Ilgu] Why is there no answer?
Have you failed?

220
00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.203
[Sound of door opening]

221
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.372
[Dosik’s encouraging sound]

222
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.585
[Dosik groans in pain]

223
00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:07.972
[Rough breathing]

224
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:11.934
[Heavy breathing]

225
00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.146
[Jehyuk speaks in a strained voice]
How did you get here?

226
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.816
Because there was no reply
I thought something had happened

227
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.862
[Ilgu] But
How do you get things done?

228
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.283
[Do-shik speaks in a strained voice] Dad…

229
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.826
dad…

230
00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:30.745
[Ilgu] A tough guy

231
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.751
- [Sound of stabbing with a knife]
- [Painful groan]

232
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.252
- [Sound of stabbing with a knife]
- [Painful Elasticity]

233
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.264
[Ilgu] That day
If only you hadn't come here

234
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.351
I never had blood on my hands either.

235
00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.269
your daughter

236
00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:59.273
Song Je-hyuk was sexually assaulted by that guy.

237
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.945
But Song Je-hyuk covers that guy up.

238
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.656
I pretended not to notice

239
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.076
Even though you
Can you call me your father?

240
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.746
The guy who did that to you back then

241
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.165
I thought it was a prayer ceremony

242
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.876
[Ilgu] Eliminate the prayer ceremony

243
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.004
I am Abby
I thought I did what I had to do

244
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.465
Then what about Song Je-hyuk?

245
00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.384
- What about Ki Yun-cheol?
- [Heavy music]

246
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.636
You're all like that too

247
00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.846
Song Je-hyuk should have been killed long ago.

248
00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:39.313
[Ilgu] Song Je-hyuk is what you were looking for
I found out later that it was him.

249
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.028
I took revenge on you

250
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:49.907
Ki Yun-cheol

251
00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.286
It is a death of one's own choosing.

252
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.040
It's not my fault

253
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.543
Then what about Kang-hoo?

254
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.379
Why did Mr. Kang-hoo have to die?

255
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.006
Do you still believe in Choi Kang-hoo?

256
00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:09.427
Choi Kang-hoo came to see me

257
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.847
Pushing in files from 10 years ago

258
00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.849
threatened to give me money

259
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.435
[Ilgu] Choi Kang-hoo in the car
Money was found

260
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.645
Didn’t you know that too?

261
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.360
[Yongpil] In Choi Kang-hoo’s car
500 million won discovered

262
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.697
Do you think I would believe such a joke?

263
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.365
Mr. Kanghu

264
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.826
I'm not that kind of person

265
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:37.538
I saw your friends a little while ago.

266
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.085
[Ilgu] People
I never believe it

267
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:47.923
Rather

268
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.302
How about believing this?

269
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.974
[secret music]

270
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:06.192
A new secret club
It's a new mask

271
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:07.943
[Ilgu] I use this

272
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.405
Better than Angels Club
For those with more power

273
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.075
I'm thinking of creating a more secret club.

274
00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:17.787
[absurd gasping sound]

275
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.914
you

276
00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.792
Are you really crazy?

277
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.251
It's going crazy

278
00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.129
This is the world we live in

279
00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.132
[Ilgu] In such a world
In order to survive, people

280
00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.176
Pretending to know, pretending not to know

281
00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:34.386
I live wearing a mask like this

282
00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.185
You live alone with no face

283
00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:43.562
Will people notice?

284
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.778
[Jay] With that mask
Do you think the truth will be covered up?

285
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:52.738
What do you see when you take off the mask?

286
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.698
truth? look!

287
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.701
what are you watching right now

288
00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.580
The truth is just dirty and ugly

289
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.750
[Ilgu] That’s me
This is why I made the mask

290
00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.293
If you wear a mask

291
00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:09.839
Because that ugly truth is hidden

292
00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:12.800
Rather

293
00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:16.595
You too can gain strength with that mask

294
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.139
So

295
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.517
Create the world you want

296
00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.730
I

297
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.234
Do you think you will accept that offer?

298
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.194
If you refuse

299
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.074
you are the same as me

You've been in this room too

304
00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:01.682
[Ilgu] Probably to me
I asked them to turn off the CCTV.

305
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.355
[Jay] I ask you
on date and time

306
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.860
Grand Gangbo Hotel
Please stop the CCTV

307
00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:14.904

308
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:17.948
You recorded it?

[Ilgu] Your friends too

310
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.501
I become an accomplice with you.

311
00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:31.420
[Jay laughs]

312
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.507
They took pictures of us

313
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.428
It was you

314
00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:51.857
[Sound of a lighter opening]

315
00:19:58.781 --> 00:19:59.907
If this happens

316
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.159
Will you trust me?

317
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.164
[Ilgu] So, it’s Jae.

318
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:09.416
Let's stop now

319
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.713
you can't defeat me with strength

320
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:20.636
You'd rather be with me

321
00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:22.721
Then you too

Are you really going to do this?

332
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.393
You said there was solid evidence.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.252
This has been
Helping women who are victims of sexual crimes

356
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.671
Known as an icon of justice
In the image of lawyer Do Jae-i

357
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.173
As a move that greatly disapproves...

358
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:49.493
[Cell phone operation sound]

359
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:52.579
[Call connection tone]

360
00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.087
- It's me.
- [Ilgu] Okay, say it.

361
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.133
I need time to prepare my mind

362
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.135
Will you give it to me?

363
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:12.516
I give up my lifelong beliefs
Of course it will take time

364
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.476
I understand

365
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.480
[Jay] And one thing
I have something to ask you.

366
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.610
The person who killed Kang-hoo

367
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:25.863
Who are you?

368
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:33.453
Well, I don't know.

369
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.836
Okay

370
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:45.841
[Sound of cell phone closing]

371
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.278
[Secretary Choi] What do you say?

372
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.281
[Ilgu] You don’t know anything

373
00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.125
Jay, don’t you think I’m completely ruined now?

374
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:24.254
Do I really have to do this?

375
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.798
I'm not sure yet

376
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.010
What about you?

377
00:24:30.427 --> 00:24:31.511
I feel like I committed suicide

378
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.681
[Meaningful sound effects]

379
00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:36.558
[secret music]

380
00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:37.851
That's what I wanted

381
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.437
[Jay] Rather, I feel relieved

382
00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:44.608
It must not have been easy to fool that person.

383
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:46.902
Good job

384
00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.111
[Yuna’s light smile]

385
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:49.196
Was it easy?

386
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.240
Lying is my major

387
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.741
- [Jay and Yuna’s laughter]
- Hey, acting is

388
00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:54.743
Surprisingly, our Yoojung did something.

389
00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:57.829
Hey, I heard it was awesome? uh?

390
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.498
[Haemi laughs] Even like this
I can't even do that

391
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.750
- Complex and subtle acting
- [Yujeong and Haemi’s laughter]

392
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.502
[Imitating Yujeong] I'm sorry
Jay

393
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.796
[Jay, friends laugh]

394
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.465
Chairman Kang Il-gu

395
00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:12.469
now we really
You'd think I'd abandoned Jay, right?

396
00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:20.769
For choosing me

397
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:22.938
thank you

398
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.110
What would you like to do?

399
00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:32.864
Would you like to receive my gift?

400
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.923
Let's talk for a bit

401
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.221
[Haemi] I mean

402
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.598
Chairman Kang Il-gu
He said he would help his mother with her work.

403
00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:00.017
When I told him to cut off Jae-yi

404
00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.020
Honestly, my heart hurts
I understand

405
00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.648
Jae-yi needs to break away from the past
They say they are happy

406
00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:09.192
Because we are in the past

407
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:10.652
But

408
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:14.448
That person owns the Angels Club
The moment you hear that you made it

409
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:15.866
Goosebumps, wow

410
00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:19.411
I really didn't show it
When I touch that mask

411
00:26:19.494 --> 00:26:21.997
It's just hair
I thought you were going to stand still.

412
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.833
What did I hear there too?

413
00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:26.501
- I can't think of a thing.
- [Uneasy music]

414
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:28.920
[Yoojeong] From the moment I entered

415
00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:32.257
‘When can I get out of here?’
That was all I thought

416
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.969
For Jae-yi, Jae-yi
Even telling me to cut it off is all an excuse.

417
00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.972
[Haemi] If Jae-yi is next to us
us to that new club

418
00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:41.183
Because I don’t think I can pull him in.
Isn’t that what it is?

419
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.228
Hey, you talk too

420
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.689
You probably have thoughts too

421
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.027
What kind of person is Kang Il-gu?

422
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.446
What will be solved by arguing now?

423
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:01.244
[Sighing] I'm like, 'What should I do?
Will I escape from that threat?

424
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:02.329
I'm thinking about that

425
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:04.706
Threats?

426
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.292
[Yuna] That person said that

427
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.086
If you refuse a new club job

428
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:11.046
The things they do for us
I'm withdrawing

429
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.839
Is that a threat or something?

430
00:27:14.257 --> 00:27:16.051
[Haemi] I’m that person
I don't want to get help

431
00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:19.471
My mom and the Angels Club
The moment you hear that you are connected

432
00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:21.640
I really
I thought the sky was falling

433
00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:23.600
But look at me
Do you want me to do club work like that?

434
00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:26.937
[Incredulous gasp] Queen?
Ugh, that's it!

435
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:28.772
I'll just be next to Jay

436
00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:31.942
yes

437
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:33.944
- [Meaningful music]
- I think so too.

438
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.367
[Yoojeong] Of course
I also want to save the foundation

439
00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:43.203
Passed down to me by my mom and dad
It's also a legacy

440
00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:46.748
for our children
Because it’s the necessary background

441
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:48.792
But

442
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.130
I will save the foundation
I found out while running around.

443
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:58.427
Because of Song Je-hyuk, our foundation’s reputation is
completely dirty

444
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.639
Youngun Foundation
Let alone the children's prosperous backgrounds,

445
00:28:03.724 --> 00:28:06.143
rather
It would be an embarrassing background

446
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:09.104
Then I have no regrets about the foundation.

447
00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:14.693
So, will you choose Jae-i?

448
00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:17.946
[Haemi] Yuna, you are just
Hold Chairman Kang’s hand

449
00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:20.657
Now, it's better than surgery for me
Where's the important thing?

450
00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:29.207
[Yoojeong] Then

451
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:31.877
How about doing it like this?

452
00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:34.629
Yuna, your worries

453
00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:37.132
I can solve it

454
00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:39.926
[Calm music]

455
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.888
Then you too
You don’t have to get Chairman Kang’s help.

456
00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.099
me

457
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:47.893
With Nana

458
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.395
We have the same blood type

459
00:28:51.646 --> 00:28:52.689
I'm sorry

460
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.691
Now I'm saying it

461
00:28:58.278 --> 00:28:59.404
I know

462
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.157
What are you feeling?

463
00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:04.743
[Yuna] You

464
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.953
Delete the child

465
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:09.956
To Nana
They want to give you a liver transplant.

466
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.297
You idiot

467
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:20.926
Your child is not Song Je-hyuk’s child.

468
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:22.594
It's completely your child

469
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:25.430
But now
Are you deleting a child like that?

470
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:26.932
[breathing sound]

471
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.145
thank you

472
00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:35.065
For saying that

473
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:38.693
[sniffling sound]

474
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:40.529
But [clearing throat]

475
00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:42.656
don't worry

476
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.826
I also have a child

477
00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:47.994
I can do surgery for you too.

478
00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:51.248
I already went to the hospital and had a consultation.

479
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:54.000
Even after having a child and having surgery

480
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.586
They say I and I are fine

481
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.258
Really?

482
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.014
It's Yuna

483
00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:10.684
Nana is my daughter too

484
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:16.481
for my daughter
Do you think I can’t even do that?

485
00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:23.113
[Yuna] Thank you, Yujeong.

486
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:25.657
[In a tearful voice] Really
thank you so much

487
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.123
[Haemi sniffles] Oh, what is it?

488
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.126
I feel sorry for Yujeong for no reason.

489
00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:39.880
Me too, my mom
Money received from Song Je-hyuk

490
00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:41.631
I'll pay you back somehow

491
00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:44.134
- If you use my mother’s savings plan…
- [Yoojeong] No

492
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:47.262
That's okay too

493
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.848
If you organize the foundation

494
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.018
Investment received from Mariela
I can pay it back

495
00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:57.439
[Yoojeong] If there’s one thing that matters,
It's a daycare center.

496
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.984
[Sighing] In that dirty club
Being taken advantage of

497
00:31:02.152 --> 00:31:04.112
I couldn't protect my children

498
00:31:08.491 --> 00:31:09.534
Guys

499
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:13.163
For now, let’s stay by Jay’s side.

500
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:15.916
If we help each other little by little

501
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.794
You don’t have to accept Chairman Kang’s offer.

502
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.220
[Cell phone operation sound]

503
00:31:30.764 --> 00:31:32.599
[Call connection tone]

504
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:36.061
Jay

505
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:38.021
We need to talk.

506
00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:40.565
[uneasy music]

507
00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:44.361
[Jay is crying] How can you

508
00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:46.905
How did you guys
You could do this to me!

509
00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.583
[Sound of door opening]

510
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:02.712
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Interesting Music]

511
00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:09.886
[Haemi] But Jae-i, you
It seems like the poison has really risen a lot.

512
00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:11.680
No, I even have precognitive powers.

513
00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:15.016
No, how can you do exactly what you said?
Is Chairman Kang testing us?

514
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.811
If it weren't for the secret ledger you gave me
We almost got caught

515
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:22.607
testing you
It must have been a ploy to exploit my weakness.

516
00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:26.444
But are you okay?

517
00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:30.073
[Yoojeong] Your reputation is so ruined

518
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:33.410
If you reveal someone's true face

519
00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:35.704
It's true that it started with me

520
00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:37.831
Now Chairman Kang Il-gu

521
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.583
we are completely
Does he think he's on his side?

522
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:46.548
[Sighing] Well

523
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:48.466
[Jay] But

524
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.302
I want you by my side

525
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:55.056
I'm still scared

526
00:32:57.183 --> 00:32:58.309
If you think about it

527
00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:02.272
Because of me, your life
It's become so difficult

528
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.609
So I'm so sorry

529
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.153
[Yuna] Don’t be mistaken

530
00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:12.323
Revenge on Song Je-hyuk
It wasn't just your revenge.

531
00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.075
It was revenge for all of us

532
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:18.038
But if you didn't start

533
00:33:18.872 --> 00:33:20.290
I couldn't get that revenge

534
00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:23.209
Strangle me tightly
Do you have to stab yourself with a knife to get revenge?

535
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.713
You keep picking on him
harassing

536
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:29.007
[Haemi] If you fail, they hit you again

537
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:33.178
Then, in the end, they each other
You made me die and kill you

538
00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:35.388
Thanks to Janey

539
00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:37.932
we could do it together
that revenge

540
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:39.142
[Yoojeong] Yes

541
00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.019
If it weren't for you too

542
00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:44.189
She was still that horrible man's wife.

543
00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:47.692
Yuna probably didn't see Nana either.

544
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.030
Haemi is also because of drugs.
It would continue to be difficult

545
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:57.535
In the end you
You saved us all, Jay.

546
00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:05.376
Thank you for saying that.

547
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.545
Think only forward

548
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:09.839
That's important

549
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.549
[Sighing] That’s right.

550
00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:13.676
The real fight

551
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.804
From now on

552
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.263
us

553
00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:19.974
Can I do well?

554
00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.187
You can't do it, if you want to survive

555
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:26.648
Let's think that we wear masks too.

556
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:28.817
Mask of Betrayal

557
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.044
[Ilgu] I don’t know

558
00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:51.714
What do you say?

559
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:53.550
[Ilgu] You don’t know anything

560
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:57.095
[nervous music]

561
00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:59.806
[Secretary Choi] Yes, I knew so.

562
00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:02.267
[camera shutter sound]

563
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:06.271
[Car remote control operation sound]

564
00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:23.746
[Secretary Choi] I guess Do Jae Yi

565
00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:25.748
It seems like he's recruiting his friends.

566
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:29.711
[light sigh]

567
00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.004
[telephone ringing sound]

568
00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:42.932
Ask them to come up

569
00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:50.273
I heard Jay came?

570
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.483
yes?

571
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.155
[Ilgu] Organizing my mind
It ended sooner than expected

572
00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.576
[Jay] Meeting friends
It was helpful

573
00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:02.660
[Meaningful sound effects]

574
00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.079
Have you met your friends?

575
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:07.207
yes

576
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.002
[Jay] I contacted everyone.
I don't want to take it

577
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:14.214
I went to Yujeong’s house.

578
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.466
To my friends too

579
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:18.843
About the new club
You talked about it

580
00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:23.806
That

581
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.477
I'll try it on, that mask

582
00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:30.355
[Jay] Kang-hoo dies

583
00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.440
My career is ruined too

584
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.027
If you don't have any friends in this situation

585
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.239
I don't think I can last

586
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:43.534
Are you serious?

587
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:52.210
what should i do
Can I trust you?

588
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.589
[Meaningful music]

589
00:36:58.132 --> 00:36:59.217
father

590
00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.349
[Awkward laughter]

591
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:09.018
I know it's hard to believe right now

592
00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:10.728
[Jay] Actually, me too

593
00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:12.772
This situation is awkward right now

594
00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:14.357
Still

595
00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:18.403
Let's try together

596
00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:22.657
yes

597
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.534
[Ilgu] Then, Jay

598
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.536
[Light laughter] Yes

599
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.790
[Jay] Then I’ll go.

600
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:32.709
Secretary Choi

601
00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:33.918
yes

602
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.629
me today
Because I didn't bring my car

603
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.673
Can you take me there?

604
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:43.511
It'll be okay, Dad?

605
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:45.471
do that

606
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:04.198
I wish you all the best in the future

607
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:09.704
What can I do for you?

608
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:12.123
yes?

609
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.793
How should I kill you?

610
00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:17.837
[nervous music]

611
00:38:19.005 --> 00:38:20.089
You

612
00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:22.550
You killed Kang-hoo.

613
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:26.220
[Jay] More than the pain Kanghu suffered

614
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:29.474
More terrible pain will follow

615
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:31.684
[Elevator sound]

616
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.561
look forward to it

617
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:47.158
[Yongpil] Here it is

618
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.994
This is Secretary Choi’s officetel.

619
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.374
smart home system
By inserting a spy chip

620
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:58.586
Now, from the entrance door to CCTV
We can control it all

621
00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:01.839
CCTV installed in the room

622
00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.008
There is something that needs to be protected.

623
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:05.760
I guess it's because of the safe.

624
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.805
[Yongpil] So I
Searching through past CCTV records

625
00:39:08.888 --> 00:39:10.681
I watched the video of the safe being opened.

626
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:15.228
Secretary Choi also treated Kang Il-gu like that.
It didn't seem like he believed it.

627
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.275
Inside this is the person who stabbed Mr. Kang-hu.
There might be a knife too.

628
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:25.446
But the safe

629
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:29.826
It's a double locking method.
It seems difficult to open

630
00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.414
[Jay] Why do we have to do this?
Is there a need to open it?

631
00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:36.999
Just make it open on its own

632
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:39.794
[Secretary Choi] Do Jae-i

633
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.255
I killed Choi Kang-hoo
I knew it

634
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:45.049
and

635
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:47.385
I won't leave you alone
I even threatened you

636
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:48.970
Jay?

637
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:51.431
[Secretary Choi] Me who killed Choi Kang-hoo

638
00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:54.183
under the chairman
Should we try to stay together?

639
00:40:00.022 --> 00:40:01.107
Don't worry

640
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.359
You won't get hurt.

641
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:07.155
[Soaring music]

642
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:10.658
[Safe operating sound]

643
00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:22.712
No way

644
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:24.964
Are you going to abandon me?

645
00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:33.014
[Birdsong]

646
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.141
[Yoojeong] Have a nice trip

647
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:37.810
[Yuna] I’m excited for the first time in a while

648
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:39.812
I'm going back to Emily Go.

649
00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:42.148
- [light laughter]
- [Yuna] Emily Lee and Passport

650
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:44.734
Like this again
I didn't know it would have any use

651
00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:46.444
[laughter]

652
00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:51.365
Nothing much will happen to me while I'm gone, right?

653
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:54.160
Don't worry, I'll take good care of it.

654
00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:57.455
[Yuna] It’s me

655
00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.790
Lady, I'm going on a short trip.

656
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:01.542
I'm listening to you mom

657
00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:03.961
Where are you going, lady?

658
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.809
[Manok] Bellflower tea is said to be good for the lungs.

659
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.396
[Ilgu] Thank you for your thoughts.

660
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.692
But I'm sad

661
00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:29.695
I heard you're opening a new club.

662
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:31.531
[Man-ok laughs]

663
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:34.909
[Man-ok] After hearing that story from Hae-mi,
How sad I was

664
00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:37.787
[Haemi] But the chairman
You helped your mom with her work.

665
00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:40.456
And what about mom
I'm not that honest

666
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.583
Even though I have a plan to protect my customers,

667
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:43.668
[Sound of intake of breath]

668
00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:47.255
Do you still have that?

669
00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:50.091
What have I got to believe?
That's one thing

670
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.177
But even that was taken away.
To Yujeong

671
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.055
Are you Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong?

672
00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:57.723
- [Dark Music]
- [Manok’s light laughter]

673
00:41:57.807 --> 00:42:00.810
[Man-ok] I lived with Song Je-hyuk’s wife.
I became a fox

674
00:42:01.143 --> 00:42:04.772
So I can't give you the money I entrusted to you.
Instead, they took that.

675
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:06.315
[Ilgu] You know

676
00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:08.359
People don't believe

677
00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:11.529
But Secretary Choi
Why do you believe that?

678
00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:14.615
[Haemi] Actually, the reason I brought you here is

679
00:42:15.157 --> 00:42:17.743
The hotel is because of Secretary Choi.
It's a bit uncomfortable

680
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.705
What's going on?

681
00:42:22.415 --> 00:42:23.541
[Director] You know the Angels Club, right?

682
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.585
Before it gets caught, the director there

683
00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:28.963
The medicine that was secretly taken out
There is one though

684
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:31.799
[Sound of door opening]

685
00:42:39.432 --> 00:42:40.558
[Haemi] This

686
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.768
This is at the Angels Club
It's a deal, right?

687
00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:49.442
How do I do this?

688
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:51.027
Meanwhile, Secretary Choi

689
00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:54.447
At the Angels Club
They secretly took the medicine.

690
00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:57.658
[Haemi] I happened to
I ended up saving it.

691
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.746
A person who does something else behind your back
Can you believe it?

692
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.961
I'm glad he just took the drugs.

693
00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:11.589
Who knows? I might have taken out something extra.

694
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.853
Secretary Choi, try cleaning up his account.

695
00:43:27.063 --> 00:43:28.648
When someone is suspicious

696
00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:31.942
The first thing to check is
It's a bank account.

697
00:43:32.902 --> 00:43:35.780
If there is anyone who contacts me with my weakness

698
00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:37.990
It will be noticeable

[Sound of door opening]

707

- [Secretary Choi] Chairman
- [Ilgu] You mean it?

708
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:02.616
Are you hiding something from me?

709
00:45:03.492 --> 00:45:04.452
yes?

710

00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:00.180
If you sleep alone, you have to cook.

887
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.851
[Jay] What if that one thing?
Pasta, tteokbokki, and bulgogi

888
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.019
I can do it all

889
01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.772
Well, it tastes pretty good.

890
01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:12.817
Lawyer
Do you know how to make something like this?

891
01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:20.408
A very precious person taught me

892
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.206
[Jay] Anyway, this is homemade
Since you made it, you have to eat it quickly.

893
01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:32.420
Sister, I am Tteokbokki

894
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.047
[Yuna laughs] Yes

895
01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.509
- It's pretty
- [Emotional music]

896
01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:40.887
[Surprisingly] My Nana
It's really, really pretty [laughs]

897
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.263
So shall we go now?

898
01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.975
Wait a minute, lady, one last time.
Is there something to do?

899
01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:55.110
[Yuna] When going out
Aunty, you have to apply this.

900
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.667
I'm going out with Nana.

901
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.377
I want to be pretty like Nana, too.

902
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.462
[Yuna's light smile] Soon
I'll just apply it once

903
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:18.717
It's pretty

904
01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.595
Wait a minute, huh?

905
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:25.432
Still as good as me
Doesn't it look pretty?

906
01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.392
[Yuna] I need to apply a little more

907
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:28.476
Should I apply it to you too?

908
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.602
[Anticipatory sigh]

909
01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:30.854
[Yuna’s light smile]

910
01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.313
Now

911
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.691
- Huh? [Surprise exclamation and laughter]
- [Nana’s surprised exclamation]

912
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.987
What do you think? Like Auntie Nana
Does it look like baby skin?

913
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.780
- yes!
- [Yuna’s laughter]

914
01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.908
[Yuna is surprised] Wow, I took the medicine well.

915
01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:47.370
I'm so pretty I'm dying [laughter]

916
01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.164
When I go to the hospital next week

917
01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:52.250
The lady told the doctor
I need to praise you a lot.

918
01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.710
[Nana and Yuna’s light smile]

919
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.256
Oh, starting next week

920
01:01:58.339 --> 01:01:59.340
You know I do it too, right?

921
01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.719
[Worried breathing] I’m scared of water.

922
01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.264
That means Nana has become healthier.

923
01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:10.935
Don't worry, in the pool
Because the lady will go with you

924
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:12.896

[Yuna’s surprised gasp]

927
01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.236
Nana

928
01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:23.490
What did you say to me just now?

929
01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.784
It's mom

930
01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.839
[Yuna's light smile] I...

931
01:02:43.384 --> 01:02:45.136
How did you know I was your mom?

932
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.181
Just like my mom

933
01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.851

[Director] Yes

947
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:44.571
Maybe it's because it's fresh and delicious
I have a really big appetite [laughter]

948
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:46.656
It's difficult to stop taking medication.

949
01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:49.450
So today
Eat a lot of delicious food and cheer up

950

Sister Mariela Hotel
It was cool when I became vice president.

952
01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.087
It's still cool now

Oh, I should have brought my mother-in-law too.

959
01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.063
You haven't even gone out these days.
They say you stay at home

960
01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:21.649
Oh, don't do that.

961
01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.235
Because my mother-in-law likes sushi
Let’s pack some when we go.

962
01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:27.363
You're protesting because you're angry at me.

963

Put down the Daesan Pagoda
You must have been disappointed.

then what should i do

966
01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.918
Even customer fraud measures
I handed it all over to the police.

967
01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:44.547
That's just extenuating circumstances.
He was released on probation

968
01:04:45.506 --> 01:04:48.134
At a bar where all the secrets of customers are revealed.
Who will come now?

I told you to trust only this sister.

973

Oh, that's right
Hey, we don't have time to eat later.

977
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.405

What kind of hotel is this?

987
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.239
[Manok] Compared to the hotel you used to go to
It's a play house

988
01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:54.951
[Haemi] Mom, true healing is
