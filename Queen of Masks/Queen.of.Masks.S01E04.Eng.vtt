[Yoojeong] Because I’m calling home
They said he didn't come

7
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.947
I'm not answering my phone. Where are you?

8
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.209
[Sigh] Is this happening again?

9
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.795
You promised not to do that.

10
00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.474
I know where your hideout is

11
00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:58.809

[Jay] I heard Yujeong is pregnant.
I couldn't bear to say it

17
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.888
Still, I don't think this is it

18
00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.307
Where are you? talk to me

19
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.893
Did you go to the hotel by any chance?

How did you find out about this place?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.833
why? can't i come here?

27
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.919
I'm your brother's fiancee.

[Yoojeong] I always go home
lying

Come here and hang out with the girls
Do you think I don't know?

30
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.011
You, too, are with men today
You had fun

31
00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.804
Say it with that

32
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.517
I thought it would stop if I waited

33
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.647
But how did it get to a day like today?
How can this happen?

34

- [Heavy music]
- Should I cancel the wedding?

With a normal woman

37
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.830
I'm going to tell everything to mom and dad

38
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.959
You're a drug addict and a bully.

If you don't want to embarrass the family

51

Go home and do well in prenatal care.

That's right

65
00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.598
That guy is the father of my child

66
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.225
[Yuna] Please kill one person

67

I want you to kill him

Your ex-husband

70
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.161
He is the man who will marry Yu-jeong.
I knew it

71
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.662
Why didn't you tell me?

72
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.164
I told you so

73
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.625
My mouth is itching too

74
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.753
[Yuna] But as you know

75
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.963
I'm a wanted person in Korea

76
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.216
If you say something carelessly

77
00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.676
Instead of looking for the child
I might never see you again for the rest of my life?

78
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.221
But why did you come here?

79
00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:47.764
No way

80
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.432
What, meeting Jehyuk?

81
00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.772

To Yujeong and Haemi

83
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.486
- What?
- [Yuna] I warned you, right?

84
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.113
Don't trust anyone

85
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.532
[Yuna] They

86
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.575
These kids are more important to the land than you.

87
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.704
[Sigh] Okay, today

88
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.040
[Jay] Don’t create unnecessary trouble.

89
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.084
Me too today
I have no idea what to do

90
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.670
I just came to show you

91
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.464
[Yuna] Song Je-hyuk

92
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.300
What a shameless guy he is.

93
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.426
Go Yoo-na

94
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.387
[Jay] Are you really going to do this?

95
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.430
If Yoojeong
When you find out this fact...

96
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:30.515
[Yuna] You!

97
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.142
You said you would help me

98
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.476
I told you to trust me!

99
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.731
Take a look and choose today

100
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.776
Whose side should you be on?

[Embarrassed laughter]

103
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.577
Why so much...

104
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.787
[Yoojeong] To embarrass people

105
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.498
No, where did that daughter come from...

106
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.708
[Haemi sighs]

107
00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.669
[Haemi] How did you give birth?

108
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.758
When in America
met a woman

109
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.261
[Jehyuk] Then

110
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.680
I even had a child

111
00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.558
We broke up

112
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.187
[Yoojeong] Please

113
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.397
I guess she was of poor quality.

114
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.941
They say he's in jail

115
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.155
[Meaningful music]

116
00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.282
[sigh]

117
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.578
Because of the feeling of betrayal towards the child's mother.

118
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.498
[Jehyuk] No more
I don't want to be in America

119
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.502
So take the child
I came to Korea

120
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.462
Then

121
00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.591
I met Mr. Yujeong.

122
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.721
like fate

123
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.851
[Haemi] Ah, well, okay, okay.

124
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.895
It's all good

125
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.315
Well, even to us so far.
Did you keep it a secret?

126
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.567
It was my idea

127
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.864
[Yoojeong] If you tell me in advance
I'm afraid people will see me with sunglasses on.

128
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:11.991
fact

129
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.537
Haemi, you too, Mr. Jehyuk.
That's what you thought

130
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.541
What am I? when?

131
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.463
[Yoojeong] Originally, after marriage
I tried to let you know naturally

132
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.384
I said we'd talk today.

133
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.010
my nana

134
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:35.014
proudly at the wedding
I'll set it up as a flower shop

135
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.516
[sigh]

136
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.394
Where the heck does your pumpkin seed end up?

137
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.230
[Haemi] No, how could it be like this?
Do you break records every time?

138
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.068
Bless you, Haemi.

139
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.028
[Yoojeong] You know

140
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.865
how much i
Did you want to be a mother?

141
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.128
Yeah, whatever.

142
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.214
My stomach doesn't hurt
It would be nice to have a pretty daughter.

143
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.177
bless you

144
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.639
- [Haemi] Congratulations
- [Yujeong’s light smile]

145
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.099
Congratulations to Jehyuk too.

[Jehyuk] Thank you

147
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.645
[Leo] But

- [Sound of door opening]
- The baby’s biological mother

151
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:29.986
[Yuna] Who's in the bread?

152

[nervous music]

153
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.638
[Kanghu] It closed early

154
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.806
I'm going now, to Yujeong's.

155

[Meaningful music]

156
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.293
[Haemi awkwardly] Oh, it’s Yuna.

157
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.379
Is this your first time seeing this?

158
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.383
This is in four days
Song Je-hyuk, Yoo-jeong's husband

159
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.388
And this is my husband Chareo

160
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.352
[Yuna] It’s strangely friendly.

161
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.687
Like people I used to know

162
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.775
I'll say hello

163
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.152
My name is Emily Go.

164
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.739
[Jehyuk groans in pain]

165
00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.617
[Jehyuk’s heavy breathing]

166
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.578
Let's talk about it

167
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.123
What did I do to deserve it?

168
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.459
in the usa

169
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.420
Go Yuna has arrived

170
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.046
What?

171
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.091
Already out of bread?

172
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.593
[Jehyuk] The transaction that could cause me to be tracked is

173
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.595
I put it all on her account.

174
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.431
It would be difficult to come out anyway.

175
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.684
And isn't he a wanted man?

176
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.520
[Secretary Choi] Laundering my identity
Entry was possible

177
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.440
But still in Korea
That I'm a wanted person

178
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.818
Because you know better
I can't go out without permission, but

179
00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.739
Be careful though

180
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.450
[uneasy music]

181
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.493
Rather, I’m looking forward to it?

182
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.412
How will Go Yoo-na come out?

183
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.706
Don't worry

184
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.000
No matter how unique the country is

185
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.211
If you don't want to go to jail
Are you really going to do something stupid?

186
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.588
[light laughter]

187
00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:56.424
Ah

188
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.136
I apologize for my fist

189
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.472
The elderly

190
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.640
To Song Je-hyuk, who created this situation

191
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.934
[Secretary Choi] A warning must be given.

192
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.811
[Jehyuk] Just wait and see

193
00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.063
how do i cook

194
00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.608
[light laughter]

195
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.318
Nice to meet you

196
00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:18.821
Yujeong has a friend like this.
I didn't know you were there

197
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.828
I'm sorry you didn't know me

198
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.624
We were pretty close friends

199
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.960
[Yuna] Still with each other
Do you think there's a lot you don't know?

200
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:34.670
[dark music]

201
00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.758
Hope you like it

202
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.093
Like Yujeong
Because I met an innocent wife

203
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.555
What does it mean?

204
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:47.600
You are so gullible

205
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.436
[Yuna] So
I'm not even a college student

206
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.855
Same university as you
I believed that you were going

207
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:55.650
Men like gullible women

208
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.111
Right?

209
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:02.865
The name is…

210
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.618
Oh, Mr. Jehyuk?

211
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.578
Let's stop today

212
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.872
[Jay] I’m a little tired

213
00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:13.501
Shall we see you again next time?

214
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.253
Then Jay, you go.

215
00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.798
[Yuna] I need some time now
I'm trying to be fun

216
00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:21.300
Nice to meet you too, Leo.

217
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.596
how do the two
Did you end up getting married?

218
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.641
What do you know before you ask?

219
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.935
[Haemi] What do you want to say?

220
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.528
[Yuna] Would you like to try this?
They say it’s a fatigue reliever.

221
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.698
- [Sound of dishes rattling]
- [Haemi] I want to eat

222
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:44.782
[Sound of rustling bags]

223
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.450
[Yoojeong] What is it?

224
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.619
Ah, that [light smile]

225
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.996
[Yuna] Not like this

226
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.622
Let's relieve our stress

227
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.041
- [Men] Hello
- [Upbeat music plays]

228
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.793
- [Woobin] This is Woobin.
- [Hyunbin] I’m Hyunbin.

229
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:57.044
[Wonbin] Wonbin

230
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.047
My name is Leo.

231
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:04.385
[Haemi whispers] I am her

232
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.262
I think Leo is okay.

233
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:09.765
Hey, new one

234
00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:14.604
[President Jeong’s light smile]

235
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:15.980
[President Jeong] Now

236
00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.029
- [Leo] Hello
- [Haemi] Yes

237
00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.365
[Yuna] Today among beginners
Have some fun

238
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.783
- [Haemi’s light laughter]
- [Leo] Yes

239
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.619
you

240
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.954
To this sister
If you do something useless, you will die.

241
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.748
- [Light laughter] Chi
- [Leo] Yes

242
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:37.710
Would you like a drink?

243
00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:39.879
yes

244
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.256
- [glass clattering sound]
- [President Jeong] Now, the sister inside

245
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.799
My sister has some money.

246
00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:47.553
I want them to come often, you know? huh?

247
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.888
[Sound of putting down a glass]

248
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.181
[dark music]

249
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.642
[Yuna] I’m going to turn away

250
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.729
Did you give medicine to Haemi?

251
00:14:58.648 --> 00:14:59.732
[sigh]

252
00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:04.070
just know that

253
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.658
people addicted to drugs
When life falls into abyss

254
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.826
The first person to complain
Do you know who it is?

255
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.537
The guy who sold me drugs

256
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:18.250
If Hae-mi's life goes wrong
What will I hate you the most?

257
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.297
I have a lot to say

258
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.384
Don't worry

259
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.931
Today’s protagonist is
Because Yoojeong and Jehyuk

260
00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.816
[Yuna] When did you say the wedding was?

261
00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.651
Can I go?

262
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.277
Stop it now

263
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.029
Why?

264
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.781
I haven't even eaten yet

265
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.868
Oh my, is it roast chicken?

266
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.996
It's my favorite

267
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.792
[Yuna] Is there any chorizo sausage here?
Did you get Sunride Tomatoes in there?

268
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.299
[Sound of clattering dishes being picked up]

269
00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.385
[snapping sound]

270
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.684
[Haemi] Daebak

271
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.562
How did you know without even seeing the stomach?

272
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.940
Don't you have to cut it with a knife?

273
00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:24.859
[Sound of intake of breath]

274
00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.444
- [Heavy music]
- Doesn’t it smell nice?

275
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.072
[Sound of dishes being set down]

276
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.323
[Yujeong’s light smile]

277
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.243
This was all made by our Mr. Jehyuk.

278
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.786
[Yoojeong] To give it to you

279
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.121
[Yujeong’s light smile]

280
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:39.874
Sometimes with wonderful dishes like this
Because you surprised me

281
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.002
[Yuna] Something surprising
That's not all.

282
00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.212
[Jay] Yoo Yoo-na

283
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.299
Isn’t that the case?

284
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.842
[light laughter]

285
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:51.594
I heard that too when I got married.

286
00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:54.972
before marriage
My husband, who I thought was an angel

287
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.391
[Yuna] It turns out he was a devil?

288
00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.438
Very ‘surprise’

289
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.981
amazingly

290
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.405
How about you prepare yourself too?

291
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.782
before marriage

292
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.450
[sigh]

293
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.578
That's why your marriage happened like that
It's a shame

294
00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.915
[Yoojeong] Everyone
Don't think it's all like that

295
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.294
Hae-mi and Leo
How well do you live?

296
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.466
- [bursts of laughter]
- [Dark Music]

297
00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:37.640
The couple gets along well
There is only one way to live well

298
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.519
Never letting each other know our secrets

299
00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.438
Isn’t that right, Haemi?

300
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:46.982
[Yuna] Isn’t that right, Leo?

301
00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.905
[laughter]

302
00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.703
Oh, that's right

303
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:01.956
[Haemi] A surprising secret!

304
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.251
Jay, you couldn’t hear because you were on the phone, right?

305
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.837
Jehyuk says he has a daughter.

306
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.549
This is my 4-year-old daughter, and her name is pretty.

307
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.009
It's me, it's me, right?

308
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.594
[Laughing awkwardly] Uh

309
00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.229
[Yuna] I…

310
00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:28.524
me?

311
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:32.862
My daughter's name is...

312
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.574
Is it me?

313
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.205
[Meaningful music]

314
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.419
[Yoojeong] Bless me, Jaeiya

315
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.756
I think I'm really good at marrying

316
00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:56.635
As soon as I got married, I had a beautiful daughter.

317
00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.097
Thank you, Jehyuk.

318
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:02.808
For giving me such a beautiful daughter

319
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.355
I am more thankful

320
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:11.567
[Jehyuk] For becoming Nana’s mother

321
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.405
[nervous music]

322
00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.703
[Jay] Let’s go, stop now, okay?

323
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.371
[Yuna] Who is the child’s mother?

324
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.462
Did you reach an agreement with your mother?

325
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:34.590
What are you doing as a mom?

326
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.220
Go Yoo-na

327
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:40.763
That kind of thing requires agreement.

328
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.059
[Yuna] A mother is a child
It's like the sun

329
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.187
under the sky
There can't be two suns

330
00:19:48.812 --> 00:19:49.939
Someone has to give up

331
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.110
Even if I see the end

332
00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.822
I

333
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.825
I gave birth
I don't think everyone is a mother.

334
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.162
[Yoojeong] If the child’s mother is not motherly,

335
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.748
Mom's place
Couldn’t it be taken away?

336
00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:16.674
Did you see it?

337
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.926
[Yuna] That mother
Not like a mother

338
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:21.303
Or did you ask?

339
00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.264
Are you going to abandon your daughter?

340
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.311
[Jay] Now wake up, wake up, okay?

341
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:30.396
[Yuna] Why!

342
00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:31.855
What did I do wrong?

343
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:33.774
[Jehyuk] His mother

344
00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.614
I'm in jail

345
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.491
I committed a sin

346
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.663
If you do something wrong, there
I could spend the rest of my life

347
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.085
lifetime

348
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.713
I can't even see the child once

349
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:57.715
[Music that heightens tension]

350
00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:05.139
Anyway, before

351
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.727
That woman acted hastily
I don't think you will

352
00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:13.564
I was a bad girl

353
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.150
I wasn't a stupid girl.

354
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.916
My mom said that
Unless you're a stupid woman

355
00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.962
You should be even more prepared

356
00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.300
Otherwise, the child might be taken away.

357
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.348
Yoo Jeong Ah

358
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.559
[Yuna] Since we are friends, I sincerely
I'm giving you advice.

359
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.228
and

360
00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:58.734
marriage

361
00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:01.987
Congratulations

362
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.989
Mr. Song Jehyuk

363
00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:12.581
- [Yoojeong] Yuna…
- [Jay] Yoojeong!

364
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.147
[Rough breathing]

365
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:41.443
[Crying sound]

366
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:52.204
[Rough breathing]

367
00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:58.752
[coughing sound]

368
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.437
[Yuna’s coughing sound]

369
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.149
[sniffling sound]

370
00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:22.568
[Kanghu] Yuna?

371
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:30.951
[dark music]

372
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.079
You…

373
00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:35.914
It’s Yuna, right?

374
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.131
[Dark sound effect]

375
00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.885
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Door lock operating sound]

376
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.429
[Sound of door closing]

377
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.140
- [Door lock operating sound]
- [Haemi’s sigh]

378
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.981
[Jay] Jehyuk and Leo
Did you both go?

379
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:04.109
- [Yoojeong] Uh
- [Haemi] Ah, Go Yoo-na, this saengtto-rae.

380
00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:05.986
Why the sudden acceleration?

381
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.530
[Yoojeong] The way you looked at me was strange

382
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.115
To Jehyuk too

383
00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:12.034
Why?

384
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.661
Just for you and Jehyuk
It's not like that

385
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:16.121
You did that to Leo too.

386
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:19.875
[Haemi] Looking at me in a bad mood
Like something teasing

387
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:22.961
Anyway, I wasn't calling.
That idiot

388
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.880
Hey, Yoojeong.

389
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:28.133
- [Jay] Yoo Yoo-na
- Oh, I'm sorry, Jay.

390
00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:31.553
[Yoojeong] Yuna
I called you without even telling you

391
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.640
[Yujeong sighs] But

392
00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.391
It's because of the land.

393
00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:37.935
Yuna's Land

394
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.020
Land?

395
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.607
Yujeong and I

396
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.817
Actually, I went to see Yuna.

397
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.320
[Haemi] Somehow
To get that land

398
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:50.781
But Yuna said that.

399
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.867
At a gathering where all husbands gather
I need you to call me

400
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.410
I will give you that land

401
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.746
Do you believe in Goyuna?

402
00:24:58.455 --> 00:24:59.790
While I was deceived like that

403
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:01.250
I don't believe it

404
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:04.503
[Yujeong sighs] But I was desperate

405
00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:06.338
no land

406
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.591
We're having a hard time, Jay.

407
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:13.720
[heavy music]

408
00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.138
you

409
00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:16.848
[Jay] With Jehyuk

410
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.767
Do you have to get married?

411
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:20.644
why?

412
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:24.564
You too, Jehyuk
Do you think I'm not good enough?

413
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.442
[Yoojeong] Working under me
Because he’s a widower with a child?

414
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.403
No, it's not like that.

415
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.570
Do you remember?

416
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:34.116
my mom and dad
died in an accident

417
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:35.867
what happened to me

418
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:39.746
[sigh]

419
00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:41.164
Since that day

420
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.710
I want to build a happy family
Throw away your dreams

421
00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:47.004
I lived only for Youngun

422
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:49.589
Then I met Jehyuk.

423
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.717
I have a pretty daughter like me.

424
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:54.636
I'm Jehyuk

425
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:58.348
My mom and dad are in the sky
It's like a gift you sent me

426
00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.601
[Yoojeong] So, it’s Jae.

427
00:26:02.477 --> 00:26:03.895
about my marriage

428
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:08.317
negative words
I wish you wouldn't do that, huh?

429
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.986
Well then, Yoojung.

430
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:14.906
Can’t we delay the wedding just a little bit?

431
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.075
[Jay] Just like Yoo Yoo-na said

432
00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:19.369
Find out more about Jehyuk

433
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:22.998
Then it's not too late to think about it

434
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.207
[sigh]

435
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.879
Even to Mr. Jehyuk
Even if you have a secret you can't tell

436
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.340
Would you do more than me?

437
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.386
[Yoojeong] I am a prayer-like man
have a child

438
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.889
I had a miscarriage and then became infertile.

439
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.016
Jehyuk doesn’t know.

440
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:46.271
As a woman, until the end
It's my pride that I want to protect

441
00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.148
I am like that

442
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.692
Even if they say Jehyuk has flaws,

443
00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:53.528
Is it worthy of consideration?

444
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.615
So it's Jay

445
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.992
Just give me a blessing

446
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:01.495
me

447
00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:04.956
Now without Jehyuk
I don't think I can survive even a day

448
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:07.751
I love you that much

449
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.337
i am that person

450
00:27:17.094 --> 00:27:18.553
[Jehyuk] I met Yoo Yoo-na

451
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.180
[Secretary Choi] Did anything happen?

452
00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:24.142
[Jehyuk] Go Yoo-na
It seems like there is a Dok2 that you trust?

453
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.560
[Secretary Choi] Do you believe in Dok2?

454
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.647
As if there was something prepared
I'm talking

455
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.191
What you can do as a wanted criminal
What could there be?

456
00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.734
There must be someone

457
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:33.902
[Secretary Choi snorts]

458
00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:35.570
[Secretary Choi] Dok2, whom Yoo Yoo-na believes in

459
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:37.906
I also know Song Je-hyuk.

460
00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:42.661
No way

461
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.080
[laughter]

462
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:48.041
- [Jehyuk’s mean laugh]
- [Heavy sound effect]

463
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.046
[Call connection tone]

464
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.596
[Voice guidance] Can't connect
After the beep...

465
00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:03.682
[Kanghu’s light sigh]

466
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:29.207
[Kanghu] Drink it, I heard it’s cold

467
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:33.211
[Yuna] Thank you

468
00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:35.547
For being with me

469
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:45.432
Should I wake up after drinking that?

470
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.019
why?

471
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:50.896
Are you going to Jay?

472
00:28:51.354 --> 00:28:52.355
[sigh]

473
00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:59.362
I lied to Jay

474
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.449
[Yuna] Before going to America
I met Mr. Kang-hoo.

475
00:29:06.953 --> 00:29:08.455
But it seemed like he believed it.

476
00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.792
Do you think there is still no trust between the two?

477
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:12.918
[sigh]

478
00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:14.920
Why did you lie like that?

479
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.174
[dark music]

480
00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.509
Because I don’t want it taken away

481
00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.223
[Yuna] What’s precious is
Because everything was taken away

482
00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:35.315
If I tell Mr. Kang-hoo
Come back then

483
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.068
What are you going to do?

484
00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:45.951
- [Kanghu] Wait a minute
- [Yuna’s angry breathing]

485
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.285
- [Sound of door closing]
- That's it!

486
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.287
You heard the answer

487
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:54.876
[Yuna’s sigh]

488
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:56.795
[Cell phone operation sound]

489
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:01.758
contact me

490
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:04.219
[Kanghu] When it’s so hard like before

491
00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:05.595
But

492
00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:07.472
When there's no one to help

493
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.768
Do you feel sorry for me? Are you a virgin?

494
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.478
[light sigh]

495
00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:15.772
Because Jay is my friend

496
00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:20.569
[absurd gasping sound]

497
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:24.948
[Kanghu’s sigh]

498
00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:38.169
[cell phone vibrates]

499
00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:45.385
[cell phone vibrates]

500
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:48.138
[Kanghu] The phone still doesn’t work?

501
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.391
{\an8}On the way to Mr. Yujeong’s
Something happened for a moment

502
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.809
{\an8} Nothing bad, right?

503
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:10.702
[knock knock sound]

504
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.290
[Sound of door closing]

505
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.543
[Yuncheol] No
He said it's not good for places like this.

506
00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:21.212
- How are we here?
- [Ilgu] I came here because of Rep.

507
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:24.341
If you're stressed
You said you were looking for me

508
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.885
Am I stressed?

509
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.013
[Yuncheol] These days, my body
I think it'll fly away

510
00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:34.935
[Ilgu] My son passed away recently.
Isn’t that what you remember?

511
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:36.853
Because of Go Yoona

512
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:38.730
[heavy music]

513
00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:41.483
The reason I leave Go Yoona as is is

514
00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:45.987
Before something important
This is to avoid making noise.

515
00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:47.906
But

516
00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:49.699
in front of that noise

517
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:53.578
The congressman turned the speaker
I guess you decided to let it go?

518
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:56.998
Are you prying on me?

519
00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.292
[Yuncheol] Are you trying to protect your daughter?

520
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.128
[Ilgu] No matter what Go Yoo-na does

521
00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:05.715
What lawmakers do together
I hope it doesn't exist

522
00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:13.098
[Sigh] This is after all

523
00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:15.767
It doesn't suit me

524
00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:17.560
Then

525
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.149
[Sound of door opening and closing]

526
00:32:25.402 --> 00:32:26.736
[Rhythmic music]

527
00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:40.375
[Leo's tired breathing]

528
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:50.385
[Leo’s pouting exclamation]

529
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:54.055
[Leo's sigh]

530
00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.598
Couldn't you sleep at all?

531
00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:58.309
[Haemi] How can I sleep?
Nothing is happening

532
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.103
[Leo] Why?

533
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.567
Building a Hanok hotel in Tongju

534
00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.360
Isn't that resolved yet?

535
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:10.488
I think that was played on Yoo Yoo-na.

536
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.121
But why did you do that yesterday?

537
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:20.415
[Leo] Huh?

538
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:23.668
[Awkwardly] What? what?

539
00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:26.546
Ever since Yuna came
You didn't say a word

540
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.550
[Haemi] Caught in the wolf’s den
I was scared like a rabbit

541
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.389
[Embarrassed] Oh my, when will I?

542
00:33:36.473 --> 00:33:37.515
When did I?

543
00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:42.562
- [Meaningful music]
- [Sound of putting down cosmetics]

544
00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:45.523
[Haemi] Where did you work?
Yuna takes care of it?

545
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:48.568
But what is that?

546
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:51.071
When have I ever embarrassed you?

547
00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.615
No, there is no such thing

548
00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.703
[Haemi] Ever since I was young, people

549
00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:00.705
Also about my mom
Because they were whispering

550
00:34:01.915 --> 00:34:04.542
People's eyes like that
It's as natural as the air

551
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:12.550
So you too are confident, huh?

552
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.347
No matter what anyone says, you

553
00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:20.058
Mariela Hotel Vice President

554
00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.104
This is Yoon Hae-mi’s husband.

555
00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:27.065
- Got it?
- [Leo] Yes

556
00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.608
[Haemi’s light smile]

557
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:31.694
[Haemi] I’m going to work

558
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.780
- [Leo] Yes [laughter]
- [Haemi’s laughter]

559
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.830
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Door lock operating sound]

560
00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.249
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Door lock operating sound]

561
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:51.381
[rattling sound]

562
00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:58.513
[clunking sound]

563
00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:01.850
[dark music]

564
00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.229
[Leo sighs] It has begun

565
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.654
[Yongpil] Opening in 3 days
Location of event venues

566
00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:20.201
[Bomi] What club should I join?
I heard they give it to you?

567
00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:25.081
Oh, it's a club that closed 10 years ago.

568
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.375
Did you say it was reopening?

569
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.210
- If you want Ace here,
- [Nervous music]

570
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:32.630
I met Jeong Ki-ho
It's a membership club.

571
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.300
[Jay] A guy like Jeong Ki-ho
If you go to a club

572
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.677
I'm sure they also deal in drugs.

573
00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:41.598
enough secret club
It could be

574
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:44.684
But

575
00:35:44.893 --> 00:35:47.729
before that day
Because Yujeong has to go to the wedding

576
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:50.398
[Yongpil’s light sigh]

577
00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.442
[Yongpil] Are you getting married here?

578
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:55.403
Fortunately, it is located in the Gunggok district.

579
00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.449
[Jay] Then, on the wedding day

580
00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:02.493
If there is anything special
Please contact me right away

581
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.037
[Yongpil] Yes, I understand.

582
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.497
[Jay] Then I
I'm going to go see Jehyuk and come back.

583
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:15.924
[Kanghu] I’m not even answering the phone
There was no answer to my text

584
00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.178
[Jay] I was a little busy

585
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.222
I'm sorry

586
00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:27.185
[Sound of a glass being clattered]

587
00:36:30.146 --> 00:36:31.356
[Sound of a glass being set down]

588
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:35.735
yesterday

589
00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:38.947
At Yoojeong’s house

590
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:40.990
I saw Yuna

591
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:46.120
No, actually what
It's not the first time I've seen it

592
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.166
Not long ago, Yuna
Because he appeared in front of us

593
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.421
I'm sorry for not talking to you all this time.

594
00:36:57.382 --> 00:36:58.508
Actually, we ran into each other yesterday

595
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.886
On the way to Yujeong's house

596
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.055
[Calm music]

597
00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:05.640
Oh, really?

598
00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.519
[Embarrassed gasp] It must have been nice to meet you.
It's been a while

599
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.815
[Jay hesitates] Uh
Did you talk a lot?

600
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:17.277
What did Yuna say? Are you talking about me too?

601
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:20.446
Can I ask you a favor?

602
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:24.951
trust me

603
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.536
no matter what anyone says

604
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.955
I mean

605
00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:35.461
[Kanghu’s light smile]

606
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:40.758
- [after exhaling]
- [People applauding and cheering]

607
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:42.010
[Director laughs]

608
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:46.055
[Director] You became the chairman of the board.
Sincere congratulations

609
00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:48.474
Not team leader Song Je-hyuk, but the chairman!

610
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:49.684
[Jehyuk smiles awkwardly] Not yet

611
00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:50.935
- [Director, Jehyuk’s laughter]
- [Applause]

612
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.812
[Teacher] Our children
What should I do because I’m sad?

613
00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.355
What if the team leader goes?

614
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:56.733
Hey, more than kids
Do you think the team leader will be more disappointed?

615
00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:58.568
Because I will come visit often

616
00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.361
Please talk to your children carefully.

617
00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.865
Oh, and the wedding too
It will be held here in the auditorium.

618
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:04.991
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]
- [light laughter]

619
00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:07.201
[Jehyuk] Oh, wait a minute.

620
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:11.205
Yes, are you here?

621
00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:35.688
[Jay] Excuse me?

622
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:36.814
[Director] Yes

623
00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.859
I came to see team leader Song Je-hyuk.

624
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:44.113
Oh, the company came
You will be in the auditorium.

625
00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:45.698
[Director] Please go there.

626
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:47.200
thank you

627
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:54.040
[Birdsong]

628
00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:07.011
[Jehyuk] Mr. Jae-i!

629
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.440
But without any contact
What brought us here?

630
00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:21.818
[Jay's sigh] Mr. Jehyuk

631
00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:25.613
I know

632
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.824
Who is Nana’s biological mother?

633
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.618
[Meaningful music]

634
00:39:37.417 --> 00:39:38.668
It seemed like it would be

635
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.754
[Jehyuk] You came in with me at that time.
Look at you

636
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.298
Those words are

637
00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:47.260
Yujeong and Yuna are friends

638
00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.429
Are you saying you knew this in advance?

639
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:51.597
no

640
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.059
Yuna is Yujeong’s friend.
If only I knew

641
00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:58.020
How can I be with Yoojeong?
Have you ever thought about getting married?

642
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.565
I was surprised to know too

643
00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.651
[Jehyuk] How
I wonder if there is such a coincidence?

644
00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:07.405
Then when did you find out?

645
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.241
About a month ago

646
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.076
I'm organizing my desk

647
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:16.080
By chance, Yujeong was with her friends.
I saw a picture taken together

648
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:18.374
[Jehyuk] But there

649
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.543
There was Yuna.

650
00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:23.045
[sigh]

651
00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.423
Tell Yu-jeong about Yuna.
I didn't want to do it

652
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:26.591
So

653
00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:30.052
Yoo-jeong suddenly
With the excuse of feeling burdened

654
00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:31.929
I was going to break up

655
00:40:34.307 --> 00:40:35.433
Mr. Yoo-jeong then

656
00:40:36.184 --> 00:40:37.643
He said he could die

657
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.190
me

658
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.485
Now without Jehyuk
I don't think I can survive even a day

659
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.278
I love you that much

660
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:50.114
i am that person

661
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.373
I know he's a killer

662
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:03.211
Finally took the child
It's true that I left Yuna.

663
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:07.340
But repeated lies and
promiscuous male relationship

664
00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:10.384
Living with a woman named Go Yoo Na is
It was like hell

665
00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:12.136
[Jehyuk] And then

666
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:14.514
Having to grow up with a mother like that

667
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:17.099
Even Nana looked pitiful.

668
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:21.771
Mr. Jay

669
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:25.525
If you just pretend not to notice
Why not?

670
00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.985
Deceived Mr. Yoo-jeong
I think I will pay for my sins

671
00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:30.071
To Mr. Yujeong
I will live well for the rest of my life.

672
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.490
Without Yoo-jeong, I too

673
00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:36.577
I don't think I can survive

674
00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:41.374
But

675
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.502
Goyeonaga
I don't think I'll stay still

676
00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:47.338
[Jay] He risked his life
I came from Korea

677
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.173
I'm looking for my child.

678
00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:51.717
[sigh]

679
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:54.887
Then

680
00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.515
Can’t it just be until the wedding?

681
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.850
[Jehyuk] To Yoojeong
I didn't do anything for you

682
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:02.603
At least for a wedding
I want to do it perfectly

683
00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:06.566
[sigh]

684
00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:11.862
[Jay] Then let’s do it like this

685
00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:13.823
Until the wedding

686
00:42:13.906 --> 00:42:16.617
What should I do with Yuna?
I will try to stop you from doing so.

687
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:19.704
After that, make an agreement with Yoo Yoo-na.

688
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:22.707
[Jay] Don’t make it too hard for Yuna.

689
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.627
Still, she's the child's mother.

690
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.172
thank you

691
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.383
[Jehyuk] Thank you, Mr. Jae-i

692
00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:37.597
What I came here today is

693
00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:39.724
It's a secret from Yujeong.

694
00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.642
yes, i understand

695
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.487
[dark music]

696
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.245
[Car remote control operation sound]

697
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:13.507
[Sound of fastening seat belt]

698
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:20.097
[Sound of clattering mobile phone]

699
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.851
[Cell phone operation sound]

700
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.481
[Call connection tone]

701
00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:30.983
Jeong Ki-ho, let’s meet up.

702
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.110
[Birdsong]

703
00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:35.071
[Symbol] My dad died too

704
00:43:35.821 --> 00:43:37.239
Do we two need to see something?

705
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.702
Yeah, like you said
My father passed away

706
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.663
- My mother was arrested.
- [Sigh of symbol]

707
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:44.997
But I'm still taking drugs

708
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.582
- Because I'm losing my mind.
- [Sound of Kiho sniffling]

709
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:48.292
Even my rice bowl is taken away.

710
00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:50.961
My rice bowl?

711
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.047
Emily Goinji

712
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.840
It was stolen by my dad’s mistress.
Are you talking about the land?

713
00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:57.760
[Kiho] But before my father died
What I already gave away

714
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:58.928
What should I do?

715
00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:05.518
stamp it

716
00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.269
I'll find the land

717
00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:09.772
- [Symbol] Really?
- [Nervous music]

718
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.506
[cell phone vibrates]

719
00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:41.595
Yes, manager.

720
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.722
[Yongpil] Right now
Ace Bar is being monitored.

721
00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:45.558
Someone you know came in, Mr. Lawyer.

722
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:47.476
Who?

723
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.019
[Yongpil] I just sent you a photo.

724
00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:57.486
yes

725
00:44:57.987 --> 00:45:00.030
Let’s find out what we found?

726
00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:02.491
[Jay pauses] Uh, no.

727
00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:04.869
Right now, Goyeonna land is more urgent.

728
00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:08.205
I'm going to get land now.

729
00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:11.167
[Sound of cell phone closing]

730
00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:13.669
[Leo] You’re my brother, right?

731
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.088
[Exciting music plays]

732
00:45:16.172 --> 00:45:17.882
Ah, really, Mr. Lee.

733
00:45:19.008 --> 00:45:20.801
What kind of call center am I?

734
00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:23.053
[President Jeong] Why is everyone
Come to me and file a complaint?

735
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:26.599
Oh, and

736
00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:29.185
I really want your sister
You say you've never sold drugs like that?

737
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.436
[absurd gasping sound]

738
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:35.441
[Leo] Then what is this? uh?

739
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.401
It's not something I dealt with

740
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.028
Didn’t your brother bring in a new one?

741
00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:40.738
Ha, Mr.

742
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.868
[Leo] Don’t think about sticking out your flippers.

743
00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:47.786
Quickly give me everything you have

744
00:45:50.456 --> 00:45:52.374
I also need to know to sell it.

745
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.755
[Yuna] More than I thought
Do you think you made a decision quickly?

746
00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:02.635
So whose side will you be on?

747
00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:05.554
Song Jehyuk? Or me?

748
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:15.606
I'm not on your side or on Jehyuk's side.

749
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:17.983
I'm on Yoojeong's side

750
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:21.153
Yujeong is happy
I won't let you ruin it

751
00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:25.032
Have you forgotten what I'm holding?

752
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.285
I'm holding the land

753
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.872
You, Yujeong, and Haemi
Risking your life like that

754
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:33.541
Land in Gonggok District, Tongzhou City

755
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:36.794
Don’t you need that land?

756
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:39.797
no, i need it

757
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:41.590
I'm desperate

758
00:46:42.508 --> 00:46:44.385
[Jay] So
I've been quiet this whole time

759
00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:47.346
[Sigh] What is a lawsuit?

760
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.057
Once you start
Because I don’t know when it will end

761
00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:52.560
Lawsuit?

762
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:56.730
[Jay] Ah, the name of the land is
Because it’s Emily Go, not Go Yoo-na.

763
00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:59.233
- I guess the notification went to the US?
- [Secret Music]

764
00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:01.318
What should I do?

765
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:04.405
The land was provisionally seized.

766
00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:07.116
Today Jeong Ki-ho

767
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.493
I also filed a lawsuit for the return of fuel.

768
00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:12.830
A man tells his girlfriend
Even if it was donated before death

769
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:16.917
Inheritance rights within one year
I can claim fuel

770
00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:18.919
It doesn't end there

771
00:47:20.087 --> 00:47:22.840
I'm going to tell you to meet Lee Hwa-ryeon and file a lawsuit.

772
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.258
adulterous woman lawsuit

773
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:27.595
What should I do?

774
00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:29.221
Rather than your daughter

775
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:31.974
First, a competent lawyer
Should I find it?

776
00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:34.143
[snort]

777
00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:37.396
As expected, Dojae

778
00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.565
He's a lawyer.

779
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:41.692
[Yuna] But as you said

780
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:44.194
If a lawsuit takes that long

781
00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:45.487
Are you okay?

782
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.741
While litigation is underway
You can’t even build a tent on that land?

783
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:50.826
you guys hope so

784
00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:52.786
The culture and arts complex is
Where are you going to build it?

785
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.913
Is it time for you to worry about us?

786
00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:57.166
[Jay] You should worry about yourself

787
00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.419
No matter how much you
Even if I pretend to be Emily Go

788
00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:02.212
you are unique

789
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.798
Someday your identity will be revealed

790
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:07.593
Do you mind if I go to jail again?

791
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.553
As Jehyuk said

792
00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:13.807
Instead of looking for the child
I may never see your daughter again.

793
00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:14.933
[Yuna] Dojae!

794
00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:17.478
[Jay] So
Give up the land and leave quietly

795
00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.855
Then, persuade Mr. Jehyuk.

796
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.399
I'll let the child show me sometimes.

797
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.070
That's what Yujeong thinks.

798
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.113
Let me marry Song Je-hyuk?

799
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:30.324
Do you know what kind of bastard he is?

800
00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:31.325
I know

801
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:35.245
[Jay] To the point where I want to kill you
That he was a bad man

802
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:36.372
But

803
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.083
Good people, bad people
It's all relative

804
00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:41.377
Even if it was the worst for you

805
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.797
Yoojeong is the best
I believe it could be a man

806
00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.590
[Excited breathing]

807
00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:48.425
[laughter]

808
00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:51.053
that said

809
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:53.430
you will regret it

810
00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:00.562
Sooner or later, it will be your land or your daughter.

811
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:01.939
Make your decision and contact me

812
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:06.026
[Jay] And until the wedding
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

813
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.986
Well then, it's just iron chains.

814
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.253
- [shaking breathing]
- [Mobile phone operation sound]

815
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:26.130
[Call connection tone]

816
00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:30.634
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol?

817
00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:33.011
This is Go Yoo-na.

818
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:37.766
Now, use your card.
I think it's time to write

819
00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:45.023
[Sparkling sound effect]

820
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:48.068
[Haemi’s surprised gasp]

821
00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:51.363
- [Meaningful sound effects]
- [Haemi’s resonating voice] Yoo Jeong-ah

822
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.499
[Voice ringing] So pretty

823
00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.795
[Sounding voice] It’s pretty

824
00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:11.383
So pretty, our Yujeong

825
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:19.016
[Haemi laughs] If anyone sees
Is this your first marriage?

826
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.895
Why, it might be confusing

827
00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:26.064
And you wore a dress

828
00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:27.900
[Nana] Hello

829
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:31.904
[Yujeong] Oh, that’s Nana
Jehyuk's daughter

830
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.655
no, my daughter

831
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.575
It's me! Come here

832
00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.662
- Oh, you're pretty, my daughter [laughter]
- [Calm music]

833
00:50:42.247 --> 00:50:44.082
Did you have a good time at kindergarten today?

834
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.502
- [Nana] Yes!
-What did you play? today?

835
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:48.504
[Nana] I drew and played

836
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:49.922
[Yoojeong] Did you draw a picture?

837
00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:51.715
- [Yujeong] What did you draw?
- [Jehyuk] Two people

838
00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:52.883
[Jehyuk] We are already very close.

839
00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:56.970
To Mr. Yujeong
Ever since I introduced myself

840
00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:58.347
We met often

841
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:00.849
[Haemi] It’s not a secret relationship

842
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.227
We had secret parenting, our Yujeong

843
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:08.649
- [Haemi] Hello? You are me
- [Nana] Hello

844
00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:11.401
[Haemi] Hello? I'm Aunt Haemi
mom friend

845
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:13.153
- Call me aunt.
- [Nana] Yes

846
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:14.613
[Haemi] I’m a rich and pretty aunt.

847
00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:16.615
- [Yujeong’s laughter]
- It looks like that just by looking at it, right?

848
00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:17.741
thank you

849
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:21.161
[Jay] Yoojeong
promise to make you happy

850
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:23.288
Are you going to protect it?

851
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:24.915
lifetime

852
00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.043
I will try to keep that promise.

853
00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:30.045
Okay, then

854
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.257
[Haemi and Yujeong’s laughter]

855
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.634
[Sound of door closing]

856
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:40.806
[Staff] Prospective groom, bride, flower girl
I'll take a picture for you three.

857
00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:42.266
- [Jehyuk] Yes
- [Employee] Would you like to come this way?

858
00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:48.230
[Jehyuk] Shall we see you in front? huh?
There, there

859
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:49.898
[Photographer] I’ll take a picture.

860
00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:51.650
- [Calm music]
- [Camera shutter sound]

861
00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:53.777
I don't have a good sense of humor

862
00:51:54.278 --> 00:51:57.155
[Sound of intake of breath] How can I do this?
I feel anxious and anxious.

863
00:51:57.406 --> 00:51:58.490
[camera shutter sound]

864
00:51:58.574 --> 00:52:00.409
It looks perfect

865
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:04.329
Something a little strong?

866
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:10.043
you? Are you okay?

867
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:12.087
Me what?

868
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.715
[Meaningful sound effects]

869
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.176
[camera shutter sound]

870
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:19.595
no, just

871
00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:22.848
Are you happy with Leo?

872
00:52:23.348 --> 00:52:25.434
[Laughing] We love it, Chi.

873
00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:29.479
[Jay] Yes

874
00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:34.109
Then, now only the land of Goyeonna
You can solve it

875
00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:37.738
But don't worry too much

876
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:39.573
Even if it takes some time

877
00:52:39.781 --> 00:52:41.658
land, goyina

878
00:52:43.076 --> 00:52:44.578
Everything will be resolved

879
00:52:45.412 --> 00:52:46.496
no

880
00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.082
I'll solve everything

881
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:51.960
Is there something possible?

882
00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.129
[Haemi] Huh?

883
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.132
[Jehyuk] Ah, Mr. Jae-i, Mr. Hae-mi.
Come here

884
00:52:57.215 --> 00:52:58.342
- Take a picture with us.
- [Bright music]

885
00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:00.552
[Yujeong] Uh, okay, guys.
Let's take a picture, come here

886
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.847
[Photographer] Now, look at the camera.

887
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:07.392
Now, one, two, three

888
