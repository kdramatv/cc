00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.150
- [Hae-mi] Yoo-jeong, come to your senses!
- [Jay] Yoojeong!

354
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.360
[Yuna] Yoojeong!

355
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.028
[Yuna’s grumbling sound]

356
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:59.198
You know it’s not! You guys know!

357
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.909
It's not me!

358
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.328
Let go, let go!

359
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.116
[Jay] Did you wear a mask?

360
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:45.119
[Eun-ok] Yes, I wrote it.

361
00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:48.205
mask

362
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.208
When the boss rapes me

363
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:54.586
What mask?

364
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.505
What about color?

365
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.173
Maybe

366
00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.260
Something like a sign in English
Wasn't it there?

367
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.060
[Meaningful music]

368
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.688
[Eun-ok] I’m Attorney Do Jae-i.
You did it, right?

369
00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.734
This famous person

370
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:20.612
That you will represent me
Thanks but

371
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.199
I'm not appealing.

372
00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:27.244
Then there is no need to say it.

373
00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:29.872
Having the courage to die

374
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.249
Don't you have the courage to fight?

375
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:34.918
So what should I do?

376
00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.379
No one listens to me

377
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.840
[Eun-ok] No one believes me

378
00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.300
[Eun-ok’s trembling breathing]

379
00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.054
It's better to die

380
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.772
[Sound of pills rattling]

381
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:57.232
[Jay] That’s foolish.

382
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.530
I'm dying
The truth won't be resolved

383
00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.458
Maybe

384
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:16.877
If you believe me

385
00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:19.922
Do you have the courage to speak up?

386
00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:21.715
The lawyer

387
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:23.967
Why do you trust me?

388
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:25.719
Because I can see it

389
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.723
Kim Eun-ok’s eyes are filled with
It's unfair

390
00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.103
[Jay’s light sigh]

391
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.147
[light sigh]

392
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.318
The guy who did that to you

393
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.571
Just like a normal person
Are you going to let me live?

394
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:50.077
i can do it

395
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:53.372
[Jay] That guy
What an ugly guy.

396
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:56.333
To the people of the world
I will expose everything

397
00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:01.380
- I can do it.

Daesoon Apparel

402
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:30.075
I'm Kim Man-bok's secretary.

403
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.871
That day

404
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.748
The boss gave me coffee

405
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.878
I knew it as soon as I drank it.

406
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.548
something is wrong

407
00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.092
[Dosik’s evil laughter]

408
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.230
I lost my mind

409
00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.150
When I open my eyes again

410
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.905
The boss wears an ugly mask

411
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.075
It was on top of me.

412
00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.248
Then

413
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:20.209
Finally, me...

[Eun-ok’s crying sound]

419
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.568

421
00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:51.365

[Eunok] I’m so scared

429
00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:14.972
I had my eyes closed tight.

430
00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:20.227
[Sniffling] But lawyer.

431
00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:24.773
That other thing
I remember it so vividly

432
00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:27.901

434
00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.572

[sniffling sound]

439
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.128
But the boss

440
00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.047
It's because I like it.

441
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.134
Rather, they accused me of being a flower snake.

442
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:54.886
I even filed charges of blackmail and false accusation.

443
00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:59.266
[Sniffling] No, oh my god.
Where is this law?

444

[Jay] Your wife?

451
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.873
[Yongpil] The wife used to travel well.
I got it from the membership bar

452
00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:25.250
Kim Man-bok was interviewed by the police.
I heard you said that?

453
00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:29.254
[Jay] I have to go find it right away.

[Heungsik] Hey, team leader Song Jehyeok.

465
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:38.782
This is not a welfare foundation
It's a cultural foundation.

466
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.993
In that damn orphanage
The money I brought

467
00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.704
Rather than spending money on cultural events
What if there are more?

468
00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:46.123
[Jehyuk] In the cultural blind spot
To children

469
00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:48.083
What fosters artistry

Rather, our foundation’s
If you think about the future...

Is there one?

What is the director’s intention?
I understand enough

479
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.771
I'll come to a conclusion soon

After joining our foundation

I will always be the team leader
It can't be a shield.

495

You decided not to do this.

Yeah, I'll have to check the time with Jay too.

519
00:31:31.932 --> 00:31:33.475
[Haemi] Yes, because Jay is the busiest.

520
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.809
Jay, I have to be on time.

After Jae-yi’s trial ended on the 13th

Come and have a hangover

- If you see my mask stolen,
- [Full laughter]

665
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:47.802

666
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:49.762
Kim Eun-ok too

667
00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:52.098

to sexual intercourse
The fact that I did not agree

[Prosecutor] How do I do this?
I don't know if it was recorded or not

684
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.889
This is clearly
without permission from the party

685
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.098

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.618
If you didn't borrow it

707
00:41:35.952 --> 00:41:37.828
Why is your wife
Do you have my watch?

708
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:40.122
[Jay] Maybe

709
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.333
Did you steal it?

710
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:44.669
[Bomi] Uh, ah, ah, ah, no!

711
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:46.337
Boy, are you stealing?

712
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.630
What do you think of people?

713
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.590
[Presiding Judge] Choi Bomi

714
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.261
This recording has no evidence
Whether it exists or not

715
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.637
Madam, it depends on your answer.

716
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:56.722
please be clear

717
00:41:57.306 --> 00:42:00.643
Bomi Choi herself
A conversation with Mr. Kim Man-bok

718
00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:01.727
Did you record it?

719
00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:03.938
[Manbok] Hey

720
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.775
Say you stole it and go to jail

721
00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:11.279
Otherwise, I have a store.
You thief, Mr. Lee.

722
00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:14.407
[Bomi] Do you, a thief?

723
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:17.535
Who did I become like this?
Mr.

724
00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:18.703
- [Manbok] Well, Mr. Lee.
- [Bomi]

725
00:42:18.786 --> 00:42:20.371
[Bomi's angry breathing] Judge!

726
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:22.373
That file is

727
00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:24.292
I told Attorney Do Jae-i
borrow a watch

728
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.668
It's true that I recorded it myself.

729
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.211
[Sound of people chatting]

730
00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:29.130
Fuck you rapist.

731
00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:31.048
[Bomi’s angry breathing] Chi

732
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:40.266
[light sigh]

733
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.475
- [Noisy camera shutter sound]
- [Sang-guk] He won the case today.

734
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.185
You are continuing the undefeated legend.

735
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.979
Well, if you take charge of it,
The secret to winning

736
00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.105
Are you separate?

737
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.149
Is there a secret to advocacy?

738
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:52.737
I'm just a helpless and unfair person.
Just listen to the truth

739
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.238
[Reporter] Uh, now on social media

740
00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:56.449
‘Attorney Do Jae-i
‘Send it to the National Assembly’

741
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:59.869
These posts were plastered all over the place.
Are you interested in politics?

742
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.329
[Continued camera shutter sound]

743
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:03.456
[car horn]

744
00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:06.500
- [Guest] Wow, Mr.
- [Calm music plays]

745
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.294
- [Guests’ exclamations]
- Wow, look at the smell.

746
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:11.881
[Kanghu] I have 13 generations.
There are ribs

747
00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:16.510
Among them, these ribs you see now
No. 6, No. 7, No. 8

748
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.846
The meat that covers this is flower rib meat.

749
00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:22.600
Write, we take these ribs
The reason it is said to be the most delicious

750
00:43:23.225 --> 00:43:26.937
If you don't let the cow stretch,
It never moves

751
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:28.939
Because it's very soft

752
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.567
- [Guests’ laughter]
- I think people are like that too.

753
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:34.737
I was so nervous
Rather than living too busy

754
00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:38.407
Sometimes like this
Like the 6th, 7th, and 8th ribs of a cow

755
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:40.326
Living a little lazy

756
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.412
I think it's a good way to live

757
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:44.580
[Guests applause and exclamation]

758
00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.469
I'm in, my friends are in

759
00:43:59.095 --> 00:44:00.429
Uh [laughter]

760
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:04.767
[Haemi] Member of the National Assembly
For Dojae!

761
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.477
- [Haemi’s cheers]
- [Yujeong] For!

762
00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:08.813
No, what kind of champagne?

763
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.981
Because it hasn't been decided yet

764
00:44:11.232 --> 00:44:13.109
Hey, not just any member of Congress.

765
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.985
Nomination Management Chairman
If you asked to see me

766
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:16.320
[Haemi] That’s for sure

767
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.948
Is it because the area is Tongju Gap?
where you live

768
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:21.158
[Yoojeong] Every time there is a general election
I was so looking forward to it

769
00:44:21.242 --> 00:44:23.202
I finally achieved my dream, our Jay

770
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:25.579
[Laughing] It’s really amazing.

771
00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:29.792
What I called you today is
This is not a place to congratulate

772
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:34.505
[Jay] If I get nominated,
At that time, I really need help.

773
00:44:35.297 --> 00:44:39.468
I must seize this opportunity

774
00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:43.180
[Yoojeong] Of course
If it's your business, it's our business.

775
00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:46.517
Hey, after becoming a member of the National Assembly, I will continue to live forever.

776
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:47.893
- [Yujeong’s laughter]
- [Haemi] Your success

777
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:49.145
Do we also have shares?

778
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:50.604
Oh my, of course

779
00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:53.107
[Laugh together]

780
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:54.984
- Is there anything else you need?
- [Sound of putting down a plate]

781
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:57.319
Oh, I like it now, Mr. Kang-hoo.

782
00:44:57.778 --> 00:45:00.573
[Kanghu] Well, I won’t charge you for the drinks.
Order some snacks

783
00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:01.991
This is a business house.

784
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:10.499
- [Sound of door opening and closing]
- [Haemi] Oh, I can see the inside, I can see the inside

785
00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:12.543
Do you think I don't know what's going on?

786
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:14.253
What are you talking about?

787
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:18.591
If it's a business, you have to charge money for drinks.

788
00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:20.217
How much does this cost?

789
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.720
Jay, I'm telling you to eat some snacks.

790
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.513
Think about your health

791
00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:27.141
Wow, what

792
00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:28.684
[Haemi] Oh, stop it now

793
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:31.103
If the flirting lasts too long
It's a boring law, Mr.

794
00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:33.230
Hey, what do you mean some?

795
00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:35.858
[Yoojeong] Hey, Mr. Kanghoo
He's Yuna's old boyfriend.

796
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.152
How could our Jae-yi be with a man like that?

797
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.987
[Haemi] What does that matter?
When did this ever happen?

798
00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:42.198
[Yoojeong] Ah, still
Yuna is different, no way

799
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:44.742
Yuna, ah, not Goyeonna.

800
00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:50.289
[heavy music]

801
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.500
[Haemi] I found it today while packing up my luggage.

802
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.463
Hey, ah, throw it away, it’s filthy.

803
00:45:57.838 --> 00:46:00.591
Why throw it away? If only Yuna was cut out
It's our memories

804
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:02.760
[Yujeong’s sigh]

805
00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.678
[Haemi] For 10 years since that day

806
00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:07.389
We do this
Have you ever laughed comfortably?

807
00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:12.603
Yujeong also remembers the day her parents died.
I went to work at the foundation

808
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:15.814
I'm full of that royal family
at the hotel

809
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.817
Until I became vice president
I couldn't rest even for a single day

810
00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:21.403
Especially you, Jay

811
00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:25.533
Oh, hey, I like it, he's a lawyer.
It's just a struggle, a fret.

812
00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:28.953
Why did we live like that?

813
00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:30.246
uh?

814
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.916
- [Tap sound]
- I will forget about it only if I succeed.

815
00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:35.793
From that terrible memory

816
00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:39.588
[Jay's trembling breathing]

817
00:46:42.258 --> 00:46:44.635
After I met Leo
I'm barely healed

818
00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:47.263
Yoo-jeong also got better after meeting Je-hyuk.

819
00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:53.227
Janey's wounds
If Mr. Kang-hoo can help, catch him.

820
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.604
Mr. Kang-hoo, forget about your ex-girlfriend.

821
00:47:03.737 --> 00:47:05.781
[Jay] Me too, like this
I can smile brightly

822
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:09.243
If I become a member of the National Assembly this time,

823
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:11.453
So

824
00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:14.415
Until then, please take care of yourself.

825
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:18.168
[sigh]

826
00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:20.087
[bitter laughter]

827
00:47:38.772 --> 00:47:40.357
[Music that heightens the mood]

828
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.055
We're almost there now

829
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:13.182
[sniffling sound]

830
00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:14.808
almost everything

831
00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:17.770
[light sigh]

832
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:24.902
[bird chirping]

833
00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:26.654
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

834
00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:29.615
[Ancient music plays]

835
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.256
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Senior speaks softly] Come in.

836
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.135
Dobyeon, greetings.

837
00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:54.598
Jeonghan Party Nomination Management Chairman
Rep. Kim Joong-ho

838
00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.768
[Jay] Hello
It's called Dojae.

839
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:01.355
[Laughing] Welcome, nice to meet you.

840
00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.439
- [Joongho’s laughter]
- [Senior’s sound of strength]

841
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:04.900
[Clicking sound of falling]

842
00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:06.652
[Senior] Oh, by the way, this

843
00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:07.861
Oh, how am I doing this?

844
00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:11.031
Baby, have a seat

845
00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:14.243
Sit over there, dobyeon

846
00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:16.078
To the chair next to you

847
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:19.373
[Sound of senior sitting down]

848
00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:20.958
[Meaningful laughter]

849
00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:23.127
[Meaningful music]

850
00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:33.053
[Jungho’s strange elasticity]

851
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:37.266
I like things I knit.

852
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:38.517
[panicked breathing]

853
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:40.894
You asked to see me?

854
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.313
From what I heard from my senior, this general election

855
00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.941
It’s because of Tongju Gap’s nomination.
You said you were doing it?

856
00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:47.067
[Disapproving exclamation]

857
00:49:47.735 --> 00:49:49.236
Oh my, I'm so in a hurry

858
00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.113
[Senior] As soon as we sit down, we talk about something.

859
00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:52.781
Rep.

860
00:49:53.115 --> 00:49:55.868
Ever since he was in school
He was so arrogant and a bit harsh.

861
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:57.661
- [Joongho’s laughter]
- Oh, what are you doing?

862
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.538
Pour me a drink first

863
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.623
[Jungho's gulping sound] Then
us

864
00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:05.502
To arrogant lawyer Do Jae-i
Shall we get a drink?

865
00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:08.964
[light laughter]

866
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:15.262
[Sound of clinking glasses]

867
00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:18.098
[Meaningful laughter]

868
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.434
[surprised exclamation] Oh my, this is it

869
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:22.478
- [Jungho] What are you doing now? huh?
- [Sound of a kettle being put down]

870
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:23.687
I'm trying to upset the situation.

871
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.399
[Jungho] Huh, let’s see.
Are you crazy?

872
00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:29.318
- If you cut the enemy's head with the given knife,
- [Nervous music]

873
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.402
I become a hero

874
00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:32.988
[Jay] If you hit the pig’s neck
I become a butcher

875
00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:35.282
the power you have

876
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:37.993
If you use it in such a shallow way

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.486
[Jay] The mayor is criticizing me
I was managing everything

1056
01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:40.238
Until now

1057
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.991
I've never had a problem before

1058
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.410
Maybe

1059
01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.289
Are you having any other problems?

1060
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.876
Can’t you abandon Tongju City?

1061
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.796
Oh, something like that
Where is that?

1062
01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.299
[Jay] Then take it, the minister’s position.

1063
01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.759
Otherwise

1064
01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:04.179
I reported the mayor’s corruption to the opposition party.
I'll pass it all over

1065
01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.892
Even in this poor market place
You'll be kicked out

1066
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.519
[Sound of intake of breath]

1067
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.271
[frustrated sigh]

1068
01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:16.941
[Takes a deep breath]

1069
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:22.030
[Outdated] Do-byeon

1070
01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.658
Why does it keep happening?
Are you trying to make me minister?

1071
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.951
uh?

1072
01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.954
I am a minister
What's good about poop?

1073
01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.708
If you become mayor or minister

1074
01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:36.920
I'm going to do it

1075
01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:39.214
Tongju Market

1076
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.591
- [Heavy sound effect]
- [Old] What, what?

1077
01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.302
[Elegant music plays]

1078
01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:46.888
[Haemi] Tongju Market?

1079
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.474
No, wait, I mean

1080
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:52.268
Mayor Jeong Gu-tae
Instead of making a minister

1081
01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:55.480
In the vacant position of Tongju Mayor
You asked me to push you?

1082
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.066
- [light laughter]
- [Haemi’s Elasticity]

1083
01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.485
One time fee
You asked hotly, didn't you?

1084
01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:05.114
But Mayor Jeong Gu-tae

1085
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.158
Will it pass the confirmation hearing?

1086
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.410
- [Sound of intake of breath]
- [Yoojeong] It’s private life

1087
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:10.912
Even if you manage it

1088
01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:16.292
The reason there is so much land in Tongju is
I think it might be a bit of a problem.

1089
01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:19.420
[Easy breathing] Over there

1090
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.464
Could you please make room for me?

1091
01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.137
Jeong Gu-tae from 5 years ago

1092
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.639
- Lands in Gonggok District, Tongzhou City
- [Meaningful music]

1093
01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:31.349
[Jay] I was buying metallurgy.

1094
01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.893
But Yoojeong did as you said.
There's a problem

1095
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.271
What is a support group?

1096
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.273
I bought it with slush funds that were siphoned off.

1097
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:41.526
But I did this before the confirmation hearing.

1098
01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.319
Yoojung to your foundation
You will donate

1099
01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:47.615
No, well, all my property is gone.
How could it be controversial?

1100
01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:51.411
This is from the opposition party members
Questions that may arise

1101
01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.829
It's like an answer sheet.

1102
01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:57.083
So that we can all get out legally.
Because I did it

1103
01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.960
Just answer like this

1104
01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.838
Thank you for making me a minister.

1105
01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.423
And keep your promise

1106
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.843
That land, while I was away
Are you taking good care of it?

1107
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:09.929
[Surprise gasp] Then
I went to that land...

1108
01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.264
Let's create a culture and arts complex

1109
01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:13.600
[Jay] When I become mayor

1110
01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:16.686
The culture and arts complex
We are trying to raise it to a global level.

1111
01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:18.813
[Excited] Jay

1112
01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.316
- It's so cool.
- [Noisy camera shutter sound]

1113
01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.693
[Haemi] Oh, wait a minute.

1114
01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:25.904
Jay you become mayor

1115
01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:27.447
If Yujeong builds an art complex

1116
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:28.865
What am I?

1117
01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.199
Am I an outcast?

1118
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.870
For Tongzhou City to become a cultural and arts complex

1119
01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:35.747
What do you need?

1120
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.416
Accommodation?

1121
01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:40.209
To Hanok Hotel
How about building something nice?

1122
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:41.753
- [Surprise gasp] Hanok hotel
- [Music that heightens the mood]

1123

for construction

1127
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.186
Establishing a promotion committee
A donation agreement has been signed

1128

- [Yujeong’s laughter]
- Let’s have fun breaking things apart!

[Haemi and Yujeong cheer]

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.381
[Haemi and Yujeong’s laughter]

1140
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:30.426
But to do that
You too have to make some sacrifices

1141
01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:37.809
[Soft music plays]

1142
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:43.898

- [Yujeong’s laughter]

1145
01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:59.872
It's been a while since I was doing a dress fitting.
I must have had a good time with my friends

1146
01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.290
[laughter]

1147
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.168
That’s right, a bridal shower?

1148
01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.337
[Jehyuk] Things like that these days
I heard they do it a lot

1149
01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:07.922
- [Jehyuk] If you need something like that...
- [Yoojeong] No

1150
01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:09.549
I don't do that.

1151

[panicked breathing]

1152
01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:18.057
Married late and all that

1153

Ah, more than that

1154
01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.192
I have something to tell you

1155
01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.819
What is it?

1156
01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:36.492
Our orphanage in Tongju City

1157
01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.495
I think it will probably have to close.

1158
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.463
With Jae-yi and Hae-mi
Culture and arts complex to be built in Tongzhou City

1159
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.300
There is a nursery there
It's in the Gunggok district.

1160
01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:57.805
Mayor Jeong Gu-tae said the land
I donated to our foundation.

1161
01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:01.225
How can I stay still?

1162

- [Sound of dishes being set down]
- [Uneasy music]

1163
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.568
Eliminating daycare centers?

1164
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.653
To build a culture and arts complex?

1165
01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:15.948
[sigh]

1166
01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.158
I know

1167
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:20.411
you are the nursery
How much do you love

1168
01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.039
[Yoojeong] But

1169
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.375
I really need to do that project

1170
01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.837
Only then will our foundation's finances improve.

1171
01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.426
[disgusted breathing]

1172
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.304
Then do that

1173
01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.599
The daycare is yours anyway.

1174
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.271
When the foundation's finances improve

1175
01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:51.943
Better daycare elsewhere
I will definitely build it for you

1176
01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:53.945
I promise, okay?

1177
01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.572
[Jehyuk’s light smile]

[Leo] More? Are you still weak?

[Sound of strength]

1183
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.299

- [Meaningful music]
- [Leo’s sound of strength]

1186
01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.476
How much donation do you need?

1187
01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:29.063
I think it will be around 10 billion won.

1188
01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:32.191
I decided to build it in Gyeongju
Hanok hotel closed

1189
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.068
I'm investing there

1190
01:08:34.735 --> 01:08:37.238
[Chang-gil] If this fails, you know?

1191
01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:39.323
[Leo’s spirit]

1192
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.534
[Sound of strength]

1193
01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:42.660
- [Haemi’s painful exclamation]
- [Leo’s surprised exclamation]

1194
01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.746
- [Painful groan]
- [Leo] I’m surprised.

1195
01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:47.874
No, if you count, they say count.

1196
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.459
Because my sister doesn't answer
I thought I was weak, so I kept going

1197
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:51.961
[Looking embarrassed] Sorry

1198
01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:53.337
Just thinking about it

1199
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:56.257
[Sighs] What are you thinking?

1200
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.301
Is the chairman putting a burden on you?

1201
01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.137
New project this time
If that fails, do it yourself?

1202
01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:04.765
Is my head at my feet?

1203
01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:08.269
If you massage my feet
Are you reading my thoughts?

1204
01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:09.395
[Laughing] Sister

1205
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:11.439
[Leo] Sister
Whenever I feel stressed at work

1206
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.523
I came looking for you

1207
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:16.527
me now
I know it all just by looking at your face.

1208
01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.822
That's right, you were my only resting place

1209
01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:21.490
But this time

1210
01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:23.993
I get comfort from you
It's not a size that can be solved

1211
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.703
[sigh]

1212
01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:28.664
If something goes wrong this time
I might get fired from my job

1213
01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.292
[sigh]

1214
01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:36.214
When I become poor
What should you do?

1215
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.050
Oh, what do you mean?

1216
01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:40.927
When poverty comes through the door

1217
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.678
- They say love goes out the window.
- [Humorous music]

1218
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.099
It's obvious, if I get fired from my job
what will happen to us

1219
01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:55.441
Well, so suddenly
Are you saying that with a straight face?

1220
01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.653
[Haemi] Hey, don’t worry
I'll take care of it.

1221
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.488
[Leo's sigh]

1222
01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:01.906
Do you trust me?

1223
01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.284
uh? Don't you answer?

1224
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.454
I trust my sister
