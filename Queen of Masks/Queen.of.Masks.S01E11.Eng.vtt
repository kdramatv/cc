44
00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.510

[Secretary Choi] After that incident,
go to America

48
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.491
Is this your first time in Korea?

49
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.244
Because the old man finally called me

50
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.297

[Yoojeong] You also studied in the United States.

56
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.235
Did you also run a large business?

57
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.321
But

58
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.241
A person with such a great career

59
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.661
why in our daycare
Are you trying to work...

60
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.332
My parents died when I was young

61
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.501
I also grew up in an orphanage.

62
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.545
- [Jehyuk] Maybe that’s why
- [Heavy music]

63
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.256
Definitely in my home country

64
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.092
young children
So that your dreams can come true

65
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.886
Anything that helps a little bit
It's my wish

66
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:42.889
[light laughter]

67
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.937
Uh, why isn't the coffee coming?

68
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.655
[nervous music]

69
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.930

- [Camera shutter sound]
- [Sang-guk] Rep. Do Jae-i

72
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:41.323
That 10 years ago
This is my first time seeing you since the video scandal.

73
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.075
I haven't even campaigned for a while.
What did you do?

74
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.288
I've been pretty busy.

75
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.665
For worrying you

76
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:51.750
sorry

77
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.546
[Sangkook] Could it be today?
Why did you decide to hold a press conference?

78
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.630
Is it because of that video?

79
00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.927
[Jay] No
The reason I gathered you today is

80
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.764
Since this time

81
00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:09.267
He is not a candidate for Tongju mayor.
I want to tell you something.

82
00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.020
I will resign

83
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.480
- [Reporters muttering]
- [Nervous music]

84
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.857
[Jay] I’m going to let it all go for now

85
00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.528
In the eyes of the media and public
Because I need to be free

86
00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.447
[Haemi] Put everything down

87
00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.240
What next?

88
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:25.867
Then

89
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:27.494
I guess I should set a trap

90
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.287
[Jay] So

91
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.499
to where we are
I have to make them come to me

92
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.753
What if I come to you?

93
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.463
Just kill me?

94
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.548
You can't just kill him.

95
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.134
Ace Bar Manager
It's not Leo, it's him

96
00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.803
I need to get confirmed and then kill him.

97
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.388
[Yuna] I am your biological mother
I need to get the papers called Emily Gora.

98
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.683
That way, for Nana
You can donate your liver

99
00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:52.685
[Jay] Just

100
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.938
Until we get what we want

101
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.898
I plan on making you unable to move.

102
00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.692
If you're just going to keep it for a few days

103
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.111
Is that punishment?

104
00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.491
I want to kill him

105
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.828
Our children's lifelong
So that I can't be a father

106
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.246
I'll kill you

107
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:12.914
[Jay] But

108
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:17.127
That dirty blood on our hands
It means you shouldn't be buried directly.

109
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:18.795
[camera shutter sound]

110
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.547
[Sang-guk] What is the reason?

111
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.633
It fell after the video scandal.
Is it because of approval ratings?

112
00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:24.717
no

113
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.469
I

114
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.721
Because I have work to do

115
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.766
[Jehyuk] Where the hell are you?

116
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.520
Even if I search the whole country
Didn’t I tell you to find Dojae?

117
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.774
I have to find Do Jae-i, save him or kill him.
You're not going to do it, you bastard!

118
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.443
[Gwangcheol] Yes, I found it.

119
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.069
- [Gwangcheol] That’s…
- okay?

120
00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:44.904
Where are you?

[Gwangcheol] A breaking news just came out.

122
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.492
What?

123
00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.286
[Gwangcheol] Dojae is live
I'm having a press conference

124
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.454

{\an8}- [Heavy music]
- Well, if the candidate resigns.

128

Liberty Korea Party candidate Song Je-hyeok
It will be a solo drink.

What does it mean?

142

[Reporter 2] If the candidate resigns,

Yes, Senator.

What are you going to do now?

153
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.660
Resignation?

154

Let’s take that guy to Tongju Market
Are you going to make it for me?

155
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.415
To make a market for him
I didn't resign.

156

I was trying to end it.

157

Rep. too
If you want to end him

158
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.341
There's something I need to let go of like me.

[Jehyuk] As Dosik goes to the end

161

[In a child’s tone] ‘Dad, Dad’

[Yongpil] Is it okay?

171
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.586
The lawyer is talking to that guy now.
It's like declaring war.

172
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.671
Before the lawyer hits him

173
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.880
That guy is definitely

174
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.425
I will attack the lawyer first.

175
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.678
That's what I'm trying to take advantage of.

176
00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:19.309

He's probably in a hurry.

177
00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.812
[Jay] No matter how thorough
Even Song Je-hyuk

178
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.981
Mistakes are bound to happen

179
00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.525
So don't worry too much

180
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.612
The office manager
Please do what I ask.

181
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.363
[Yongpil] What if something goes wrong?

182
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.282
Then this time, lawyer.

183
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.284
It could be a really big problem

184
00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.910
[Jay] Anyway, one of the two

185
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.871
It's a fight that ends only in death

186
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.831
[intense music]

187
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.541
Still

188
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.294
I'm not lonely this time

189
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.880
'Cause you're not alone

190
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.322
Hey

191
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.282
Is it a new face today?

192
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.911
Am I not the girl you called?

193
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:24.457
Then who is it?

194
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.834
your father's mistress

195
00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:28.503
Emily Goya

196
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:37.553
[laughter]

197
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.638
[Yuna clicks her tongue]

198
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.682
My father is dead and my mother is dead.

199
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.893
Now there are no parents to stop me

200
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.937
Are you still doing this?

201
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.647
Why did you come here?
Mr. [clicking his tongue]

202
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:51.150
My dead father’s mistress
Do you have something to do with me?

203
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.402
[Symbol] Unlucky, Mr.

204
00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.237
you

205
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.697
your dad gave it to me
On the land of Tongju City

206
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.449
You filed a lawsuit requesting the return of fuel.

207
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.785
- Withdraw that.
- [Symbol] Why me?

208
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.703
Dojae said that

209
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.123
If you sue, you can get some money.

210
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.582
[Yuna] If you withdraw

211
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.376
I'll give it to you

212
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.836
all that land

213
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:10.920
[nervous music]

214
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.505
Really?

215
00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.426
why?

216
00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.429
Instead, for land price
I'm going to ask you for something else

217
00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.140
What is that?

218
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.310
[Yuna] Separately find the culprit
Are you trying to make something?

219
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:27.728
10 years ago

220
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:29.480
Like what happened to me?

221
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.109
an innocent person
You can't make him a criminal

222
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.862
[Jay] So

223
00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:38.406
I need to find a way

224
00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.871
I heard this while digging behind Song Je-hyuk.

225
00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.123
That guy

226
00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.751
10 years ago in the entertainment district of Tongju City
He supplied drugs.

227
00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:53.546
[Yuna] Among them
There were also violent gangs.

228
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.049
Song Je-hyuk only receives the medicine in advance.
I guess he ran away to America

229
00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.218
Did the gangster steal the money?

230
00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:01.095
[Laughing absurdly] He’s got a big liver, that guy.

231
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.639
You should be a speaker

232
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:05.850
Speaker?

233
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.103
An organization where I sell drugs
I'll connect you so go

234
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:11.939
[Yuna] Show me this picture

235
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.071
Who is this?

236
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.365
Currently, he is the Chairman of the Youngwoon Foundation.
Tongju mayoral candidate

237
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.826
- [Yuna] Song Je-hyuk
- [Heavy music]

238
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.911
But this guy

239
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.580
10 years ago
I sold drugs at Ace Bar

240
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.500
Then the gangsters lost their money too.

241
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.378
Is this really Song Je-hyuk?

242
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.466
AC, this is ridiculous.
Who believes that?

243
00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.801
Are you not hungry yet?

244
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.347
you just

245
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.808
Go to the boss of that organization
Just show me this picture

246
00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:49.894
[Yuna] 10 years ago

247
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.521
That guy is back

248
00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.648
So it's the lottery?

249
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.110
okay?

250
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.781
But isn't that a bit dangerous?

251
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.159
The gangsters are the ones who stole their money
Should I just leave it alone?

252
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.119
You're probably going to kill me without any hesitation?

253
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.039
It would be better if you said yes

254
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:12.959
Wow

255
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.340
[siren sound]

256
00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.013
[Nurse] The guardian didn’t come.
Do you mind if I leave the hospital alone?

257
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:29.267
my husband

258
00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.060
I think you'll be busy

259
00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.104
[Yujeong] Ah, more than that, teacher

260
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:37.358
I went out without permission
Do you have to keep it a secret?

261
00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:38.734
Did you know?

262
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.362
[Haemi] Why don’t you come out of the house?

263
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:44.532
Get away from such a dangerous guy right away.
Fall, you

264
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:45.867
[secret music]

265
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.951
no

266
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.161
[Yoojeong] I’ll just pretend not to know

267
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.373
When I leave the house

268
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.209
He planned our plan
You might notice

269
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:58.379
[Haemi] Are you okay?

270
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.008
Are you treating me like a weak kid again?

271
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.176
[Yoojeong] Honestly

272
00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:07.263
To that guy now
who can access

273
00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:08.973
There's only me

274
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:15.187
Obviously next to him
There must be something I can do.

275
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.233
let me do it

276
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.402
[Yoojeong] Ah, over there

277
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:28.117
Nana Song, a child in the pediatric ward on the 7th floor.

278
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:35.041
To my Nana
Could you please pass this on to me?

279
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.626
It's a love blanket

280
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.628
I need this to sleep well

281
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.463
Give it to me directly, why?

282
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:41.923
You're my daughter

283
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.093
My husband is worried that I might be stressed.

284
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.471
I also hid my child’s hospitalization.

285
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.390
I'm deliberately trying to pretend not to know

286
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.810
Joo Yoo-jeong, I hope you really like it.

287
00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:58.022
My wife is so considerate
Leave it to your husband

288
00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.106
[Nurse's light laughter]

289
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.191
yes

290
00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:01.692
I'm happy

291
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.405
Because I have a good husband like Jehyuk.

292
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.801
[Ilgu] If you keep calling me like this
What are you going to do?

293
00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:28.636
That guy

294
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.097
Have you thought about how to kill him?

295
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.184
I don't think you've eaten.
Eat it first...

296
00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.394
This is not mine

297
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.439
- [Sound of door opening]
- [Heavy music]

298
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:01.419
[Ilgu] It’s getting cold, eat it.

299
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.215
Since when do I eat like that?
I heard you were interested.

300
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.971
There is no rice in it.

301
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.974
Not once since I was born

302
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.060
With the existence of a father
I've never had a meal

303
00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.774
What do you want to say?

304
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:29.739
I know

305
00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:31.532
That you came to the hospital

306
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.785
What is that mask?

307
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:36.704
[ECG meter beeping sound]

308
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:37.788
live

309
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.707
By all means

310
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.007
[Sound of door opening]

311
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:50.551
But I'm not thankful at all

312
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.262
[Jay] You did that, right?

313
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.182
What if you go like that?

314
00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.810
How can you say something like that?

315
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.730
That to me
How humiliating it was

316
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:04.982
Because of that, I

317
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.234
I even thought about death

318
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.073
How to get revenge on someone

319
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:13.949
It's not just punishment

320
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.119
[Ilgu] Sometimes, forgetting and living
It could be revenge

321
00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.830
I hoped you would

322
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.082
If so

323
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.750
the relationship between you and me

324
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.835
It could have been better than now

325
00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.714
I'm sorry if you wanted silence.

326
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.633
You did that, right?

327
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:32.635
To live

328
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:34.512
[Jay] I survived

329
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:36.472
I definitely

330
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.933
- I will punish him.
- [Heavy music]

331
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.185
Maybe

332
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.063
Do you want me to kill him?

333
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.238
What I want from you...

334
00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.199
What is that?

335
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.479
[President Jeong] Oh, I’m sorry about Leo.

336
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.981
But

337
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.067
Leo is also the representative here.
It wasn't me who reported it.

338
00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:31.318
It's true

339
00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:34.155
I'm not here to discuss Leo's business, am I?

340
00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:37.908
[Haemi] That’s it!
I think they sent in the military, whatever.

341
00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.702
Then why did you come to me?

342
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.413
Do you need any medicine?

343
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:43.873
No, the medicine worked.

344
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.709
Give me the data

345
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.004
who is your real boss
with me

346
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.881
Ace Bar's Real Data

347
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.342
Hey, who
Do you think I'm a fool? [laughter]

348
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.262
[President Jeong] If you give me that,
Are you going to get Leo out with that?

349
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.390
If that happens, my boss
What will happen to my life?

350
00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.267
[Laughing absurdly] You
Your boss is so trembling

351
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.685
It ends in two days

352
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.229
[Haemi] To that mayfly
What do you do with loyalty?

353
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.690
My boss is quitting in two days?

354
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:11.525
What does that mean?

355
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.777
- [light laughter]
- [Secret Music]

356
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:14.904
Dojae said that

[Exclamation]

361
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.086
Dojae is so amazing

362
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.131
That kind of kid

363
00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.010
[Haemi] What can’t I do?

364
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.266
[Haemi] On purpose
Are you saying I have to shed it?

365
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.185
The date we hit him

366
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.561
[nervous music]

367
00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:48.771
Then he

368
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.565
[Jay] He’s going to try to hit me first

369
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.525
then we

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.236
Setting a trap

371
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.284
Who should I give it to?
There's a guy that comes to mind

372
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.245
leave that to me

373
00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:07.373
[Jehyuk] Two days later?

374
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:11.502
I can't believe I'll be done in two days
What do you mean?

375
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.380
[President Jeong] Just now
I heard that Hae-mi Yoon came to visit.

376
00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.174

I'm going to finish the chairman off.

It's clear they're planning it

I am Rep. Jae-i Do and Yun-cheol Ki.
I overheard you talking on the phone

Do Jae-i to Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
instructed to do something

380
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:27.768
[President Jeong] Perhaps

381
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.688
The Angels Club data
Should I explode it?

382
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.024
[Jehyuk] That data
That it can't hurt me at all

383
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.150
Dojae knows better

384
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:38.862
If it was going to explode
They must have burst it at the press conference.

385
00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:42.157
Oh, then what?
How do you hit it?

386
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:43.742
[President Jeong] I’m dying of anxiety

388
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.080
You said it was two days later, right?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.127
before I did that
Just get rid of Dojae.

390
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:56.588
Get rid of it?

391
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.757
[Secretary Choi] No
Then it's tomorrow

392
00:20:58.841 --> 00:20:59.967

If I decided to go to you

maybe around that time

408
00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.098
They're going to try to kill me.

409
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.894
You'll use it as an alibi

410
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.688
Did you say that Hae-mi would get the medicine?

411

[nervous music]

412
00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:16.710

no

430
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.589
A thought like this suddenly occurred to me?

431
00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.718
Why do I have to kill just Dojae?

I'm going to wander around here.

538
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:47.233
Someone who will replace my body
It must be hard to find

What about CCTV?

545

{\an8}[Kanghu] The CCTV at the front door was saved.

546

I broke the CCTV at the back door.

Maybe no one will know

It's for the child

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.565
[Jehyuk] What I obtained illegally
That everything is invalid

706

We detained you illegally
Where is the evidence?

708
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:28.953
[Ilgu] Maybe

709
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:32.581
Do you want me to kill him?

711
00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:38.295
What is that?

712
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.549
On the date and time I request

Please stop the CCTV

00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.430
[secret music]

715
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.891
When is that day?

716
00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:53.852
[Jay] We are at this time

717
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:55.312
I've never met you

718
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.566
[Yuna] You are here
I came here to cheat

719
00:47:00.568 --> 00:47:02.486
And with me, your wife’s friend.

720
00:47:04.405 --> 00:47:05.990
I gave you the keys

721
00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:08.450
Suddenly a wise blow came

722
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.744
So I went to a party to avoid you

723
00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.496
[Jehyuk sighs]

724
00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:17.710
[Haemi] You were rejected by Yuna
I took drugs because I was angry

725
00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:19.295
With sleeping pills

726
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.256
I probably won't wake up for 2 days and 1 night?

727
00:47:24.717 --> 00:47:26.760
[Yoojeong] When you wake up and come out

728
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:28.262
Home too

729
00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:29.972
Foundation too

730
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.267
Even as a candidate for mayor of Tongju,
Everything will disappear

731
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:34.810
broke

732
00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:37.104
Just like the original you

733
00:47:39.231 --> 00:47:40.441
Is the scenario solid?

734
00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:41.900
that scenario

735
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:43.152
[Jay] It’s not over yet

736
00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:45.446
you woke up

737
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:47.114
When I leave this hotel

738
00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:50.618
The real hell starts from then

739
00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:52.953
- [Boss] Give it to me
- [Dark Music]

740
00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:00.711
[Boss laughs]

741
00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:04.715
[Boss laughs] This guy is right, huh?

742
00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:06.050
Where is this guy now?

743
00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:08.302
I'm in Korea now.

744
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:10.137
Ah, you bastard

745
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.930
- [Laughs]
- [Jay] 10 years ago, that organization

746
00:48:12.514 --> 00:48:13.932
I won't leave you alone

747
00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:17.686
Then when and where did you
No matter how you die

748
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.146
Wouldn't it be strange?

749
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.149
How about in your own words?

750
00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:23.817
Do you like it?

751
00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.908
[Jehyuk] Properly
Let's try a deal

752
00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:36.580
Mr. Yoo-jeong, the Youngwoon Foundation is on the verge of bankruptcy.

753
00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:39.375
If it's my slush fund
The Youngwoon Foundation can be saved.

754
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:42.169
Don't put my foundation in that dirty mouth.

755
00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.462
[absurd gasping sound]

756
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.131
Haemi Yoon

757
00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:49.802
[Jehyuk] If I die, I’ll be with your mom
What are you going to do with the Daeseonakak?

758
00:48:50.302 --> 00:48:51.970
We've been together for 10 years

759
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:54.348
Where is this Operation Water Ghost?

760
00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.684
Why is my mom here?

761
00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:01.730
Yuna, what about you?

762
00:49:02.356 --> 00:49:03.941
What would you do without me?

763
00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:07.027
You mean there is no Nana?

764
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:08.821
What does that mean?

765
00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:10.906
[laughter]

766
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:12.032
I was discharged from the hospital today.

767
00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:13.867
[Jehyuk] If I die

768
00:49:14.243 --> 00:49:15.828
You don’t know where I am, right?

769
00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.413
maybe

770
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:19.873
Maybe not in Korea

771
00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:21.875
[dark music]

772
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:24.378
Hey!

773
00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:26.880
- [groan]
- [Yuna’s heavy breathing] Tell me

774
00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:28.674
Where did you send me?

775
00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:30.092
Where did you send it?

776
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:32.678
[Yuna’s heavy breathing]

777
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:33.846
I know where I am

778
00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:35.556
How do you know?

779
00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:38.642
[Yoojeong] Jae-i gave me a location tracker.

780
00:49:39.017 --> 00:49:41.979
I put it on a blanket
I passed it on to Nana.

781
00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:45.315
[Yoojeong] To my Nana
Could you please pass this on to me?

782
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.276
It's a love blanket

783
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:52.865
Why are you talking about that now? person surprised

784
00:49:52.948 --> 00:49:55.242
- [Haemi] You flew away first.
- [Tense sound effect]

785
00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:56.326
I thought I was a bullet

- [Heavy music]
-Are you done now? You struggle

791
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.596
There's one left

792
00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:18.724
You, Dojae

793
00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:21.351
Aren't you curious?

794
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.145
the truth of that day

795
00:50:32.112 --> 00:50:34.531
The truth about the incident 10 years ago

796
00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:38.702
[Jehyuk] If you let me go
I'll tell you what the truth is then

797
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.455
[Jay] The truth has already been revealed

798
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:43.624
that day

799
00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.042
you raped me

800
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.795
And you killed the prayer ceremony

801
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:50.130
Poor, poor, Dojae

802
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:52.049

It's you who's pitiful

804

You are in your dirty desires

805

- They used us
- [Nervous music]

806
00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:58.806
[Jay] In the end, it’s in our hands
It happened like this

807
00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:01.183
You touched me wrong

808
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:05.437
You'll find out soon

809
00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:08.690
The meaning of my pity

810
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.029
[Haemi] Ah, I’m a talkative guy
It was so unattractive

811
00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:16.740
There's nothing more to say now, right?

812
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.121
sleep well then

813
00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:40.138
[Jay] You erased all traces of us, right?

814
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.015
[Yuna] It doesn’t matter if I stay

815
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.685
This is my room anyway

816
00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:47.145
That toxic guy

817
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:49.106
[Haemi] The reason medicine doesn’t work
Probably not?

818
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:52.192
Are you sure the CCTV has been resolved?

819
00:51:53.026 --> 00:51:54.486
It'll be off until tomorrow morning.

820
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:56.780
[Jay] Still
Better get out quickly

[Haemi] Yes

I'm going to blow up the Angel's Club

I have to go to Nana.

829
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.612
Now I'm confident as a mother

[Yoojeong] From the foundation and the mayoral candidate
I'll pull you down

832

To become an empty shell again

I'm our Leo

834
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:49.750
I need to get him out of the detention center.

835

Just survive for one night, Chareo.

836
00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:55.839
Yeah, everyone does their own thing.

Let's meet again here

And you go to my house

839
00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:02.638
You can't go to the hotel.

840
00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:05.349
But

841
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:06.934
I have a question

[Yuna] Hotel CCTV

843
00:53:09.811 --> 00:53:10.938
Who turned it off?

844
00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:14.274
That was the biggest role.

845
00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:16.234
Thanks

846
00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:21.323

[Yuncheol] No, that’s already
I got caught because of you.

I'd rather go to Angel's Club
help me break it

883
00:55:13.393 --> 00:55:16.104

00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:53.725
{\an8}I was planning to investigate, but
Candidate Song’s disappearance…

894
00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:03.068
[Junghyun] Because it’s a serious incident

895
00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.612
I myself
I decided to attend the investigation.

896
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.698
Ms. Lee Yuna’s lawyer has also arrived.

897
00:56:09.574 --> 00:56:10.659
Let’s start with the statement, shall we?

898
00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:14.955
Yeonya

899
00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:17.457
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say

900
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:20.961
[Jai] And for the difficult questions
You can refuse to make a statement

901
00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:24.589
no, you can

902
00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:28.718
Because you have a lawyer.

903
00:56:36.977 --> 00:56:38.478
once a week

904
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:41.606
I was trapped
In that underground warehouse

905
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.235
It's called Angel's Club.
There was a party

906
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.362
- [Nervous music]
- [Yuna] There

907
00:56:48.697 --> 00:56:51.241
Customers wearing masks came to visit us.

908
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:54.536
Because of the mask
I can't recognize the face, but...

909
00:56:54.619 --> 00:56:55.829
- [President Jeong] We have guests with reservations today.
- [Sound of approaching footsteps]

910
00:56:58.331 --> 00:56:59.541
- [President Jeong] What happened?
- [Detective] A search and seizure was conducted.

911
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.001
[Detective] Go in

912
00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:03.044
[President Jeong] No, investigation…

913
00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:06.798
no

914
00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.260
Ah, Mr.

915
00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:12.679
[Cell phone operation sound]

916
00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:15.640
[Call connection tone]

917
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:18.935
[Haemi] Give it a try, see if you get a call

918
00:57:19.686 --> 00:57:20.687
[Cell phone operation sound]

919
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:24.774
[President Jeong] In one day
What on earth happened?

920
00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:30.822
Do you know anything?

921
00:57:31.656 --> 00:57:32.657
[Haemi] Don’t you know?

922
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.618
Because I failed to kill Jay.

923
00:57:34.701 --> 00:57:37.037
I don't know, judge and judge
It jumped out

924
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.040
you were stubborn

925
00:57:43.835 --> 00:57:46.463
Just cooperate with the investigation.
Receive leniency

926
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:48.548
Even if it's just for one day
Would you eat less beans and rice?

927
00:57:50.926 --> 00:57:53.053
Then what should I do?

928
00:57:58.225 --> 00:58:01.645
That guy is from Ace Bar
Data showing that the real person is in charge

929
00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:05.440
Give it to me

930
00:58:11.947 --> 00:58:12.948
[Leo] Sister!

931
00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:20.914
[Interesting music]

932
00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:23.500
I missed you

933
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:25.919
Did you have a hard time?

934
00:58:26.753 --> 00:58:27.837
[Haemi] What did I say?

935
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.214
I told you to just trust your sister, right?

936
00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:30.465
Well, I believed it.

937
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:31.800
[Leo] I believed it

938
00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:34.678
[Haemi] Let’s go quickly
Let's go and eat something delicious

939
00:58:36.429 --> 00:58:38.974
But something like tofu
Shouldn’t I buy it?

940
00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.268
You sound like tofu
Go home

941
00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:44.813
[Haemi] When I go home
Whiter than tofu

942
00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:46.690
Something soft and sweet

943
00:58:46.773 --> 00:58:47.983
I'll give you that

944
00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.277
What is that? if?

945
00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:52.612
What are you thinking?

946
00:58:52.988 --> 00:58:54.573
Whipped cream cake, whipped cream

947
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:56.616
Fresh cream? [surprised gasp]

948
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.911
Where are you going to upload it?
Where do I think? Wow

949
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:02.080
- As soon as this comes out very suddenly.
- [Leo’s surprised sound]

950
00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:03.290
- [Haemi] Are you out of your mind?
- [Leo’s laughter]

951
00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.374
Follow me

952

- [shoes stomping]
- [Nurse] Nana Song, the patient’s guardian

953
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:10.088
I'll come in

954
00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:15.927
[Doctor] To Song Nana’s child
Do you want to donate your liver?

955
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.849
I am Nana’s biological mother.

956
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.643
You can check paternity.

957
00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:27.063
Oh, by the way, Ms. Song Nana’s
The legal guardian is

958
00:59:27.147 --> 00:59:28.940
His name is Song Je-hyuk.

959
00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:31.651
[Doctor] So
Without Song Je-hyuk’s consent…

960
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:32.736
here

961
00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:34.821
Mr. Song Jehyuk told me

962
00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:38.783
I have full authority over the surgery.
This is a power of attorney to delegate.

963
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:40.994
[Yuna] Check it out

964
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:46.249

[Reporter is surprised] Huh? Did I come too?

[Jehyuk] I
Born in an orphanage with angels

975
01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:17.280
child abuse, unlawful confinement

976
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.158
Illegal structures inside the orphanage, etc.

977
01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.494
To something unpleasant
With a responsible mind...

978
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.578
[Sang-guk] Let’s go

Because of my husband
We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

983
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.677
[Sang-guk] Sent by candidate Song Je-hyuk
When I look at the email

984
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.261
They said they would come down from all positions.

985
01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:43.682
That means daycare routine
Candidate Song Je-hyuk is related.

986
01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.100
Are you saying you admit it?

987
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.436
[Reporter] In the illegal building of the orphanage
What did you do?

988
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.397
To Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong,
Did you receive an email?

989
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.148
Well, was there anything else?

990
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.234
- [Reporter] Please tell me something.
- Wait a minute, reporter.

991
01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.612
I am

992

993
01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.535
In foundation and orphanage work
I'm staying back

994
01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:05.537
I am now

995
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.039
what is going on

996
01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.625
I'm not sure yet

997
01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.086
[Sangkuk] Then now
Where is candidate Song Je-hyuk?

998
01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.796
According to a police official,

999
01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:16.589
An incident occurred
They say his whereabouts are unknown.

where are you now

1002
01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.308
I don't know either

1003
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.519
[Yoojeong] It’s just me
What I want to say is

1004
01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:30.520
[secret music]

1005

wherever you are

1007
01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:38.361
I'm sure it's holding up well.

1008
01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:40.905
That's it.

[Haemi] Good job everyone

1016
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.173
Today's plans were all successful
Right? [light laughter]

1017
01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:44.135
It's been a while for me today
I sat in the chairman's chair

1018
01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.805
[Yoojeong] I felt like I found my place

1019
01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.098
I'll never leave again

1020
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.767
I am today

1021
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.520
I confidently went to the hospital as a mother or me.

1022
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.898
[Yuna] I will never again
I won't let go of your hand

1023

Jay, aren’t you happy?

1024
01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:07.784
We are also looking for orphanage children.

1025
01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.786
You also revealed the Angels Club.

1026
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:11.830
[light laughter]

1027
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.790
Of course it's good

1028
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.543
What is Jay?
An anime that says it’s okay to like it?

1029
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.631
Hey, but now he
Isn't it time to wake up?

1030
01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.967
Has anyone contacted you?

1031
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:27.679
uh

1032
01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.722
I will also leave evidence that I am looking for a husband.

1033
01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.891
[Yoojeong] I keep calling you.

1034
01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.686
When we left yesterday
It's like it's turned off

1035
01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:35.895
I didn't turn it on

1036
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.022
[Haemi] You sleep this long?

1037
01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.275
I think I got the right treatment.

1038
01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:44.779

1039

{\an8}[Employee] Covered with sheets
There is something hideous like that.

1046

{\an8}- [Camera shutter sound effect]
- I feel like it's a human based on my intuition.

1047
01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.191
I just reported it

1048
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.569
I didn’t know you were a real person, right?

1049
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.654
[shaking breath] Really
I was so scared

They said he was dead

1055
01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.308
[Haemi] Dead?

1056
01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:57.852
Oh, how?

1057
01:04:58.811 --> 01:04:59.771

[Yujeong’s cough]

1063

Are you okay?

1064
01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:17.246
I'll go out and get some water.

1065

By any chance

1066
01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.050
After we left the hotel together

1067
01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:32.220
Has anyone gone back to the hotel?

1068
01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.736
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]
- [Haemi] I’m surprised.

1074
01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.099
Uh, mom

1075
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.351
I just arrived at the hotel

1076
01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.354
Go in now

1077
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.773

[secret music]

1090
01:08:27.311 --> 01:08:28.604
[Yoojeong] Autopsy?

1091
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:29.814
[Haemi] Murder?

1092
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.859
[Haemi] Hey, we each other
There was an uproar that they were going to kill Song Je-hyuk.

1093
01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:33.943
Don't you remember?

1094
01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:35.903
Whoever killed it, just died.

1095
01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.240
[Yoojeong] All that night
was in a restaurant

1096
01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:40.783
{\an8}With my friends

1097
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.743
{\an8}[Haemi] I told you

1098
01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.621
{\an8}That day with my friends
You were at the party?

1099
01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.248
{\an8}Ask my friends

1100

{\an8}[Haemi’s sigh]

1101
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:50.710
{\an8}[Jay] You must not leave a record

1102
01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:53.588
{\an8}[Junghyeon] Why are you nauseous?
Have you left the hotel?

1103
01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:55.423
{\an8}[Yuna] CCTV

1104
01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.550
{\an8}Do you have it?

1105
01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:00.052
{\an8}[Yuna] Answer me
Has anyone gone back to the hotel?

1106
01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.639
{\an8}I killed it and I didn't kill it either.
Being falsely accused is a different matter!

1107
01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:04.724
{\an8}[Jay] It’s not me

1108
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.976
{\an8}It's true that I took them to the hotel, but

1109
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.436
{\an8}I didn't kill you

1110
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.855
{\an8}[Ilgu] The truth is not important

1111
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.190
{\an8}The important thing is

1112
01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.483
{\an8}You are not involved.

1113
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.110
{\an8} Let’s all survive individually

1114
01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.070
{\an8}- [Sound of banging table]

Immediately arrested on suspicion of murder

1117
01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:23.910
{\an8}[Yuna] I did that, right?

1118
01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.245
It'll be the same as it was 10 years ago
