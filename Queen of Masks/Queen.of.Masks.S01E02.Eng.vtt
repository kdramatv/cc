Maybe

36
00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.455
At the scene of the incident on the day

37
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.667
Was the prayer ceremony wearing a mask?

38
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.044
Or

39
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.547

[Junghyun] I got involved in something like this.
I may be out of my mind right now

I completed the on-site verification.

the culprit was caught
What more is there to say?

58
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.198
[Jay] That day

59
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.493
I also experienced something very terrible.

60
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.371
I went in and told the police

61
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.831
I need to talk to you

- [Heavy music]

68
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.897
[Jay] Why?

69
00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.316
Why do you look at it that way?

70
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.860
what i say

71
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.196
You don’t believe me either?

72
00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.241
I trust you and I don't trust you
What's important?

73
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.661
[Ilgu] The important thing is
Are you involved in this ugly incident?

74
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.830
You shouldn't be involved.

75
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.667

To Kang Il-gu, Vice Chairman of Daegangbo Group

77
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:17.424
There are people like me who are out of wedlock.
Because I don't want it to be known to the world

78
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.013
This is the last time I help you

79
00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.432
So increase your strength

80
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.934
[Ilgu] So you can protect yourself

81
00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.521
The strength is

82
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.606
stronger than the law

Its glory is like the flower of grass

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.391
It withers and dries up
Do you know that it exists?

91
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.770
Only after that life leaves
Standing in front

92
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.855
I can't help feeling sad

93
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:18.902

take a look at ourselves
there is a need

98
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.590
[Yuna] It’s a shame

99
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.218

- [Dark Music]
- Should we go somewhere and talk?

112
00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.650
To avoid the rain

113
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.416
[Yuna] Still don’t believe it?

114
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.044
Actually

115
00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:01.754
10 years have passed

116
00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.382
[Haemi] You

[Haemi] It’s been 15 years.

120
00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.727
I guess I'll be blessed if I live a good life

121
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.897
[Yuna] I was paroled, as a model prisoner

122
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.442
[Haemi] This is why prison
Rehabilitation is not possible

Hey, you’re a good sleeper…

124
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.236
What did you do when you came out?

125
00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.364
I went to America

126
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.909
It was my dream to go to America

Was it your dream?

[Yoojeong] Are you

With Mayor Jeong Gu-tae…

132
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.673
Is that what they call it in Korea?

[Haemi’s laughter] Indeed

139
00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.112
No, but you are like that too.

140
00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.700
No, no matter what

141
00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.870
How can I get to a place I’ve never been to before?
Are you coming? On the subject of my lover

142
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.331
[Jay] You

143
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.626
Do you have children?

[heavy music]

145
00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.674
Did you also give birth to Jeong Gu-tae?

[snort]

147
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.303
No? You didn't give birth?

148
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.640
Just in case, from that far away

149
00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:38.101
Will something fall?
If you came with expectations, wake up

150
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:40.436
[Jay] If my husband dies

151
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.648
To my legal wife
Although the property is inherited

152
00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.401
My lover doesn't have a penny

153
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:48.987
The string fell off, you

154
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.572
The string fell off

155
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.199
I'm sure it's not just me, right?

156
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.076
[nervous music]

157
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:00.707
[Yuna] I’ll go first

158
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.501
It’s been a while since I came to Korea
There's a lot to do, huh?

159
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.255
Oh, and

160
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.924
I didn’t come to see Jung Gu-tae today.

161
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.844
I came to see you guys

162
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.929
Still, we once

163
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.558
We were friends

164
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.616
[dark music]

165
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.451
[Yujeong] Why did Yuna come?

166
00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.786
Did they really come to see us?

167
00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.747
[Haemi] Then you’re really crazy.

168
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.041
What did you do to us?

169
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.500
On the theme of the bar madam

170
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.753
I lied about being a fashion designer
Let's take second place

171
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.215
You got me hooked up with a prayer boy
I did drugs because

172
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.718
And Jay…

173
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.057
- [Haemi’s sigh]
- [Yoojeong] What if it shows up again?

174
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.934
I didn't even give my contact information.
What and how do you appear

175
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.271
If you have a map head
Would you like to meet us again?

176
00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:09.651
Jay, are you okay?

177
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.861
I'll go first

178
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.571
[Haemi] Are you going?

179
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.448
[Yoojeong] Jay, why?

180
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.492
[Haemi] Where are you going?

181
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.749
[tire rubbing sound]

182
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:32.840
[Yuna] What are you doing?

183
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.885
Why are you really here?

184
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.304
When I looked for it like that, I pretended not to notice

185
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.806
Uh, I heard.

186
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.058
- [Uneasy music]
- The fact that you looked for me a lot means

187
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.228
[Yuna] But the reason you’re looking for me is
It's so absurd

188
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.523
That day to me

189
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.943
Was there another man there?
You said you asked me to ask?

190
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:53.820
you know

191
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.697
- Because I went to the prayer room.
- [Yuna] No

192
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.991
I didn't go to that room that day?

193
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.536
[Laughs] Lies

194
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.747
[Jay] How can you be like this?
Has nothing changed?

195
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.668
lie?

196
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.711
[laughter]

197
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.588
[Yuna] It’s a lie…

198
00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.049
yes

199
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.135
I lied to you

200
00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.221
A bar girl and a college student.

201
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:22.932
I was just curious

202
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.601
Noblemen like you,
how do you play

203
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.022
But now I see it
You're no different from me, right?

204
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.066
liars

205
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.573
that day

206
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.743
The last time I entered that room was
It was you

207
00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:47.790
you

208
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.334
You don’t want me here, do you?

209
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.004
No, isn't it scary?

210
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.089
[laughter]

211
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.384
But what?

212
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.304
Like it or not

213
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.140
you'll have to come to me

214
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.061
I

215
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.105
You?

216
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:17.987
go

217
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.532
Now we're in the rain
You're not at a romantic age, are you?

218
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.422
[Yoojeong] Jay

219
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.841
Didn't you look a little anxious?

220
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.344
It's the same as going first

221
00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.304
It must be awkward

222
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.556
I have to go to the next election.

223
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.642
Yuna's case
If you go around talking here and there

224
00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.809
What good could there be?

225
00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:52.230
[Haemi] Infidelity, drugs, rape, murder

226
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.525
The world's dirty things
It was a connected incident, that incident

227
00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.194
[sigh]

228
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.363
What about us?

229
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.324
What do we do?

230
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.826
We too

231
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.079
If Yuna is busy with work that day...

232
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.330
Hey, be careful what you say

233
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.749
[Haemi] Anyway, even in front of Jae-i

234
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.169
[Yoojeong] I understand

235
00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.554
- [Meaningful music]
- [Jay’s trembling breathing]

236
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.808
[sigh]

237
00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:35.565
[Junghyun sighs]

238
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:38.359
[Junghyun] You’re doing this again, lawyer Lee.

239
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.153
[Sighing] That day too
I told you

240
00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:44.448
The on-site verification was completed completely.

241
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.617
In that hotel room that day

242
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.287
In addition to Mr. Gido-sik
There was no trace of the other man.

243
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:51.873
[Sighing] But

244
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:56.419
On what basis does another man keep
Are you saying there was one?

245
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.006
[Junghyun sighs]

246
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.189
[sigh]

247
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.279
[Junghyun] Child

248
00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.116
No, what is this?

249
00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.285
that night

250
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.079
I am…

251
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.334
I was raped

252
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.668
[Jay's trembling breathing]

253
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.421
- [Junghyeon’s sigh]
- This is the proof.

254
00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:41.505
[Junghyun] We

255
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.258
Did you do a prayer-style autopsy?

256
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.511
There were no signs of sexual intercourse.

257
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.930
It's not a prayer style.

258
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.265
I heard you didn't wear a prayer mask.

259
00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:54.852
[Jay] That day, that day, clearly
There was a person wearing a mask…

260
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.104
- Again, again, again, that mask is Taryeong.
- [Sound of hitting desk]

261
00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.815
- [Heavy breathing]
- [Junghyun] What kind of ghost possesses you?

262
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.067
Are you a ghost?

263
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:02.944
Hey

264
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.488
[Jay] Maybe

265
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.950
Because of Kangbo Group Vice Chairman Kang Il-gu
Are you doing this?

266
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:10.868
Is that him?

267
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.412
The culprit has been caught so let’s close the case.

268
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:14.830
Really?

269
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.044
I even brought evidence like this

270
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.213
I

271
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:27.343
How do I feel?
I brought this

272
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.012
You can't do this.

273
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.681
Hey, Mr. Dojae!

274
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.558
[Junghyun] Let’s see, let’s see.

275
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.186
Did you eat the shame?

276
00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:40.773
- [Sigh]
- [Junghyun] You

277
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.068
That hotel that day
Did you drink at the underground bar?

278
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.028
with several hosts

279
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.699
in the bar bathroom

280
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.411
Ecstasy and condoms
I heard there were that many?

281
00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.122
Could it be that you were under the influence of drugs and misunderstood?

282
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.082
Did you mess around with the host?

283
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.668
- [Junghyeon’s sigh]
- [Heavy music]

284
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.088
If word gets out that you played so promiscuously

285
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.091
What? [absurd gasping sound]

286
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.010
Lawyer?

287
00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.888
You're done on this floor, huh?

288
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.391
me

289
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.518
an event that is over

290
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.062
Because I don’t want it to be noisy again
Because I'm holding back

291
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.318
Take this and go quickly, okay?

292
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:28.571
Don't mess with busy people!

293
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.704
[Jay] Kangbo Group Kang Il-gu
Are you doing this because of the vice president?

294
00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.330
Is that him?

295
00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.125
The culprit has been caught so let’s close the case.

296
00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:42.752
[Junghyun] Hey, Dojae!

297
00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.962
Did you eat the shame?

298
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.257
Could it be that you were under the influence of drugs and misunderstood?

299
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.134
Did you mess around with the host?

300
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.317
[sniffling sound]

301
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:13.616
[cell phone vibrates]

302
00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.454
[cell phone vibrates]

303
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.831
- [Sniffling sound]
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]

304
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.584
[cell phone vibrates]

305
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.759
[Coroner] Please, lawyer.
I did it for you, but

306
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.428
This private request
You know that won’t work, right?

307
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.638
I

308
00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.307
I will never forget this grace

309
00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:41.811
So

310
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.687
What are the results?

311
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.400
[rustling sound]

312
00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.904
[Coroner] Attorney
DNA from underwear

313
00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:53.239
The DNA of prayer style is

314
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.075
It came out as mismatched.

315
00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.913
[Jay] I was right.

316
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:02.998
clearly

317
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.543
That day in that room

318
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.296
There was another man wearing a mask.

319
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.716
[Coroner] What do you do now?
Is it a thought?

320
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.051
[shaking breathing]

321
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.303
I have to find it

322
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.390
- I myself
- [Meaningful music]

323
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.643
[Jay] This

324
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.311
Acceptance number 6247

325
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.355
Please tell this to Go Yoo-na.

326
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:27.940
Refusing to even meet

327
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.484
I have even tried mail and internet correspondence.

328
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.902
Because there is no answer

329
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.696
Even if I give it, I won't take it.

330
00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:36.198
As you probably know, the lawyer

331
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.450
Let us receive it from the inmate.
You can't force it.

332
00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:39.535
Then

333
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.496
Just this one
Can you please ask?

334
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:45.374
that day

335
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.877
Is there anything in that room?
Was there another man?

336
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.005
[Crackling keyboard sound]

337
00:18:57.052 --> 00:19:00.139
Is there a mask that looks like this?

338
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.724
[dark music]

339
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:23.996
on a white background
Is there a patterned mask?

340
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.790
[Jay] A mask that looks like this
Is there one?

341
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.544
[Employee] Is this by any chance?

342
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.191
[sigh]

343
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.109
[Rough breathing]

344
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.071
[After exhaling]

345
00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:58.906
[Jay's labored breathing]

346
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.659
[Rough breathing]

347
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.789
[urgent groan]

348
00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:07.998
[Jay's sigh]

349
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.920
[deep breath]

350
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.297
[Exhausted elasticity]

351
00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:17.883
[Heavy breathing]

352
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.404
[Sighing] It’s been a while.

353
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.949
Uh, has it been about 5 years?

354
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.785
You were the manager at that time.

355
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.538
The story about being promoted to chief
I heard

356
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.833
[Sighing] So

357
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.627
Well, is there any problem?

358
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.171
No, not yet.

359
00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.842
[Jay] But from now on
I think it might be a problem

360
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.719
I'm here to tell you

361
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.598
Not long ago, the chief was at the police station.

362
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.685
affiliated with a large entertainment company

Illegal purchase of fentanyl

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:13.981
You were booked, right?

365
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:16.817
But the indictment was deferred?

366
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.905
With the representative of the agency
The day after we had a big meeting.

367
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.241
- [Meaningful music]
- Just in case.

368
00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.910
I did some digging behind the chief.

369
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.038
From the representative of the agency

370
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.373
You received money regularly.

371
00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:32.541
[sigh]

372
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.168
To your son's account

373
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.795
[Laughs] What do you want to say?

374
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.214
Are you planning to file a complaint?

375
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:40.883
Oh no, no way

376
00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:44.678
[Jay] Then I am very
You're missing out on important information.

377
00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.430
Me, informant?

378
00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:51.226
Any crime in the future

379
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.687
If there is an incident involving a mask

380
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:55.647
contact me

381
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.150
Every single one

382
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.944
Did you understand?

383
00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.574
[tire rubbing sound]

384
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.785
[Junghyun] What kind of guy
I heard a report that he was doing drugs.

385
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.203
I raided the hotel.

386
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.164
wearing a mask with a woman
He was rolling around?

387
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:13.957
But

388
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.461
It seems like that mask is looking for Taoist.

389
00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:26.095
[Jay] This is [shaking breathing]

390
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.555
It's your father's?

391
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.891
[Sighing] How many times should I say that?

392
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.603
I took a sneak peek from my dad’s study.

393
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:38.899
[Symbol] What kind of membership club
I said it was a souvenir.

[Heavy breathing]

395
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:43.612

[Meaningful music]

398
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.575
[Yongpil] This is Tongju Mayor Jeong Gu-tae.

399
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.703
Is this man the criminal you are looking for?

400
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:52.913
[sigh]

401
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.331
no

402
00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:55.707
No

403
00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.793
[Jay] He was a young person.

404
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.714
[Sigh] But as Jeong Ki-ho said,

405
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:06.176
Jung Gu-tae is at a certain membership club.
If it's a souvenir you received

406
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.137
That guy too

407
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.931
of the membership club
Maybe you're a member

408
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.809
in Tongju city
I searched all the membership clubs, but

409
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:15.978
Where those masks were made
There was no

410
00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:20.816
not revealed to the outside
It could be a secret club.

411
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.361
Go to Jeong Gu-tae
How about asking directly?

412
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:26.947
what did i say

413
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.075
Jeong Gu-tae told such a secret story.
Can you do it?

414
00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:32.202
[Yongpil] Then how?

415
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.664
To catch a tiger

416
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:39.293
[Jay] I have to go into the tiger’s den.

417
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.253
[Old school] Politics

418
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:45.007
Want to do politics?

419
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.803
[Jay] I want to get help from the mayor

420
00:23:50.053 --> 00:23:51.889
I also moved to Tongju City.

421
00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:56.101
Please help me, Mayor.

422
00:24:00.731 --> 00:24:01.732
[light laughter]

423
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:04.067
[Outdated] Somehow

424
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.069
I quit being a public defender.

425
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.531
A bastard like my son
When I said I would take care of it

426
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:11.950
I thought it was a bit strange

427
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.243
[snapping sound]

428
00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:15.412
- [snapping sound]
- [Outdated] Yes

429
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.624
Why do you want to do politics?

430
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.251
The strength is

431
00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.171
Because it's stronger than the law

432
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:26.506
[laughter]

433
00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:29.801
Clever, huh? [laughter]

434
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:33.347
What if you do it?

435
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.432
The mayor's housework

436
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.852
The mayor's political life
so as not to be a threat

437
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.147
I did my best
We'll take care of it

440
00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:00.249
ok

441
00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:02.793
[Old] Then I

Our lawyer Do Jae-i is stable.
To enter the political world

443
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.426
From now on, we will take a special politics class.
Let me start

444
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.684
[Old] First of all

445
00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:21.436
Raise star quality

446
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:27.567
Politicians are like celebrities after all
They are a tribe that lives off of popularity.

blows cool air
As a significant event

450
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.952
This ruling has been somewhat ambiguous so far.

451
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:39.162
Regarding the gender sensitivity of our legal profession,

452
00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:41.540
I hope this will be of great help to you
This is my wish.

453
00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:43.792
[Old] What the right hand did

454
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:47.170
Let your whole body know, not just your left hand

455
00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:51.425
How proud I am.
They're just advertising.

456
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.399
But

457
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.028
The more famous you become
There is something you need to be especially careful about.

458
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:14.614
Do you have a past?

459
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:19.745
Had a big accident
Or involved in a serious accident.

460
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:20.912
Anyway

When it was robbed, people were in the room.

A detonator that can explode
Pay close attention in advance

463
00:26:29.212 --> 00:26:30.672
When did the bomb explode?

464
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:34.426
I don't know if I can hold back the ankles.

465
00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:45.520

[Prison Guard] No. 6247 Go Yoo-na
I was paroled a month ago.

From the Ministry of Justice announcement:
I've never heard of it?

468
00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:53.987
We didn't know that either.

469
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:56.239
Suddenly, I became an additional target.

470
00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.786
And go to America

471
00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:03.789
She became Jeong Gu-tae's mistress?

[absurd gasping sound]

473
00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:08.210
That's why I couldn't find it

474
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.588
But why did it appear again?

475
00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:15.467

What do you eat like this?

Well, I guess I'm busy

Are you doing politics?

488
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.623

There's one reason I don't embarrass you

495
00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:57.611
Could it be that our Jae-yi
If something happens

I need help

I really need that land.

[Jay] With that money, you’ll be better off
I can buy a nice place

525
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.856
Why in the Gunggok district where there is no money?
Are you obsessed?

526

[An old-fashioned, faint laugh]

527
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:04.362
We too are part of my family
I'm thinking about it and telling you

528

Oh, how many times?

539
00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:39.481
I took a sneak peek from my dad’s study.

540
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:44.069
what a membership club
I said it was a souvenir.

00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:13.090
But who is that bastard?
It hit me hard

723
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.597
[sound of water falling]

724
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:22.808
[light laughter]

725
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.269
wait, my daughter

726
00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:27.438
[Yuna] I can see you soon

727
00:43:30.232 --> 00:43:31.567
[sniffling sound]

728
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:36.989
[Crying breathing]

729
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:38.532
[sigh]

730
00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:47.958
[Haemi] That’s ridiculous.

731
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.170
No, how come that land belongs to Yuna?
how?

732
00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:53.923
[Yujeong sighs] Jeong Gu’s attitude is also true.

733
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.758
- [Haemi’s sigh]
- How do you hide your wife?

734
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:57.677
Would you give such a large piece of land to your mistress?

735
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.554
I guess it was baked or boiled.
He specializes in that.

736
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:02.014
- [Sigh]
- [Haemi] IC

737
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:03.724
Now is not the time to argue about that.

738
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:07.895
So how? What should I do?

739
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:09.855
Is it Yuna? Is it Emily Go?

740
00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:11.565
give him that land
How are you going to take it?

741
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.442
I have to accept it

742
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.361
Go find it

743
00:44:15.444 --> 00:44:17.279
I know where he is
Go and find it?

744
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:19.657
[Haemi] I don’t even know their contact information.

745
00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:22.535
[Meaningful music]

746
00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.838
[Haemi] Why do you come here?

747
00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:35.965
Go Yoo-na

748
00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:37.883
stay here

749
00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:40.886
How did you know Yuna was here?

750
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.763
- [Sigh]
- [Jay] The address you wrote when entering the country

751
00:44:43.055 --> 00:44:44.473
- I recognized it.
- [Haemi] Go Yoo-na

752
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.016
He's a complete psychopath

753
00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:48.477
No, how did you get here? he?

754
00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.438
You'll find out when you go in.

755
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.857
[Jay] The reason you called us here

756
00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:02.366
[telephone ringing sound]

757
00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:07.079
[nervous music]

758
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:10.708
[telephone ringing sound]

759
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.002
yes

760
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:18.466
Ask them to come up

761
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:22.344
[Sound of putting down the receiver]

762
00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:29.560
[Doorbell sounds]

763
00:45:34.315 --> 00:45:35.357
Are you here?

764
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:37.234
[Cool sound effect]

765
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.111
[Sound of door closing]

766
00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:43.282
[Yuna] Do you remember? here

767
00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:46.952
In the club down here

768
00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:50.789
Yujeong had a bridal shower.
Wear a mask

769
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.509
- [Secret Music]
- [Yuna’s light smile]

770
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.135
It was really fun back then

771
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.805
[Sigh] Here

772
00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:09.850
They said it was remodeled, but the structure is the same.

773
00:46:16.398 --> 00:46:17.441
Where were you around this time?

774
00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.444
prayer dead place

775
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.287
Don't talk nonsense
Get to the point

776
00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.582
[Jay] The land we need
If you give me that

777
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.584
I'll do what you want

778
00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:37.753
What I want

779
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:40.297
Anything?

780
00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:45.553
the land price

781
00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:48.639
[Yoojeong] Than a cigar
I can hit it well

782
00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.183
Wouldn't that work?

783
00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.643
[laughter]

784
00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:56.230
[Yuna] I still
I had no money or support

785
00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.065
It looks like Go Yoo-na from 10 years ago.

786
00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:00.651
I don't need money anymore?

787
00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:03.279
[Haemi] Then what do you want other than money?

788
00:47:05.864 --> 00:47:07.199
kill someone

789
00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:22.631
my ex husband

790
00:47:23.882 --> 00:47:25.259
I want you to kill him

791
00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:27.928
10 years ago

792
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.972
right here

793
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.266
Just like they killed the prayer ceremony

794
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.976
[Intense sound effect]

795
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.813
[nervous music]

796
00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:44.862
[Haemi’s laughter]

797
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:48.490
[Haemi] Killing my husband these days
Is it trendy?

798
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:52.828
No, Lee Hwa-ryeon also has her husband, Jeong Gu-tae.
Killed it, then what?

799
00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:59.001
No, your ex-husband
I don't know what I did

800
00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:00.711
Are you confident?

801
00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:04.089
You also met a married man, Jeong Gu-tae.

802
00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:08.886
Hey, if Lee Hwa-ryun knew
You're dead too, you know?

803
00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:11.889
[Jay] Who is your ex-husband?

804
00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:14.933
Who are we to kill?

805
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:17.269
I'll tell you if you say you'll kill me

806
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.480
who is my ex husband

807
00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:21.482
[Yuna] What do you think?

808
00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.359
Can you kill me?

809
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.569
Are you crazy?

810
00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:27.071
why? no?

811
00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:30.199
Because I tried it once
I think the second time will be easy.

812
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:31.367
Then you should do it

813
00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:34.286
Killing the prayer ceremony

814
00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:36.497
- It's you.
- [Yuna] You

815
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:39.375
I heard you were raped here?

816
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:41.335
[Tense sound effect]

817
00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:44.755
To the masked man

818
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.549
[Meaningful music]

819
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.310
That masked man

820
00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:00.688
It could be a prayer ceremony.

821
00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:02.940
So I killed it

822
00:49:05.818 --> 00:49:07.111
[Yuna] But they say people are like that

823
00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:10.823
They say they forget the terrible memories

824
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.034
So you forgot too?

825
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.620
the fact that you killed

826
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:20.207
[Jay] You

827
00:49:21.834 --> 00:49:23.836
Do you really want to die?

828
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:25.504
If it's not you

829
00:49:27.172 --> 00:49:28.257
Who is it?

830
00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:31.427
Is it you guys?

831
00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:35.639

[Yuna] Actually

834
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:45.607
My mouth is itching to die

835
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:48.444
I want to expose all the old things

836
00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:53.323
Then your hypocrisy

837
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:55.200
Denial

838
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.202
It will be revealed to the world, right?

839
00:49:58.704 --> 00:50:01.039
You guys carry your face too
So much so that I can't

840
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:03.834
[laughter]

841
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.964
Don't like it, would you please listen to my request?

842
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.634
Then nothing happens

843
00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:15.846
[nervous music]

844
00:50:17.389 --> 00:50:19.558
[Jay] Guys, let’s go

845
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.437
It's not worth dealing with

846
00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:29.485
[Yuna] Then can I do it?

847
00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:37.075
Killing him

848
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.662
[Jay] It’s up to you.

849
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.499
It's your ex-husband.

[Sound of door slamming]

852
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.241
What if I just go?
Are you going to give up that land?

853
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:18.867
[Jay] Then are you going to kill people?

854
00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:20.661
I should try something

855
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.789
That's really messed up
If you go around worrying about old things,

856
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:26.667
Why? Are there things you shouldn't pick?

857
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:31.463
[dark music]

858
00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:35.592
[Jay] Yoo Yoo-na, she’s not stupid.

859
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:38.345
us for over 10 years
To the extent that I fooled myself

860
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:39.721
He's a smart kid

861
00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:43.600
But we are really ex-husbands
Do you think I'm going to kill you?

862
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:46.937
Because the situation is that desperate
A gesture asking for help

863
00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:48.397
Or

864
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:53.402
[Sigh] They say they will harm us
It must be a declaration of war.

865
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:00.993
me

866
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.619
I didn't give up the land.

867
00:52:03.537 --> 00:52:06.582
However, in your own hands
You can't play around

868
00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:10.460
So trust me and wait

869
00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:12.671
I'll go first

870
00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:15.883
you

871
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.138
Are you okay?

872
00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:24.933
[Haemi] Yuna’s incident 10 years ago
Is it okay if it hurts?

873
00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:29.563
I'll go first

874
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:35.319
[Haemi] You should talk to me

875
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:42.659
[sigh]

876
00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:45.203

Very nice but handsome

880
00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.965
Why on earth are you doing that? To Jay

881
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:58.508
You're too opinionated

882
00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:01.303
[Haemi] Yuna revealed everything about our past
They say it will break it

883
00:53:01.386 --> 00:53:02.554
I pretend to be proud by myself

884
00:53:03.889 --> 00:53:05.724
See if there's anything stabbing you, Yuna.

885
00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:07.225
No, I rather

886
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.145
I got stabbed again
I think you're shouting loudly

887
00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:11.813
[Yoojeong] Stabbed?

888
00:53:12.648 --> 00:53:13.732
Jay?

889
00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:17.527
Never before
I never thought about it like that.

890
00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:20.197
[Haemi] Because I listened to Yuna today

891
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:22.574
What really killed the prayer ceremony?

892
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.952
I think it might be Jay

893
00:53:25.494 --> 00:53:27.871
Even if it’s me, he’s the one who sexually assaulted me
I want to kill you

894
00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:32.751
Jae-i is not a prayer ceremony.

895
00:53:33.418 --> 00:53:35.170
You said you were assaulted by another man.

896
00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:37.214
There was no other man, the police said.

897

I can't even think anymore

899
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:43.887
I'm just so scared

Yuna

901
00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:50.602
If that incident
If you wander around again

- We…
- [Haemi] It’s the end.

903
00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:53.772
- [eerie music]
- We went to the prayer ceremony and

904
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.065
It doesn't matter what you did

905
00:53:57.985 --> 00:53:59.152
I did drugs

906
00:54:00.112 --> 00:54:02.698
Because you played with that guy
I even had a baby and had a miscarriage.

907
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.408
- [Haemi] What if the world finds out?
- [Yujeong] Fish oil, hey

908
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:06.910
Don't say anything

909
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.579
[Yoojeong] What Jehyuk finds out is

910
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:11.581
[Sighing] I don’t even want to imagine

911
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:15.877
So I only trust Jay.
It's not possible

912
00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:18.588
You have to find your own way to live

913
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.884
That means

914
00:54:23.885 --> 00:54:26.847
Separately from Yuna
Are you trying to contact me?

915
00:54:33.562 --> 00:54:34.646
[sigh]

916
00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:37.232
So if I live

[laughter]

918
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.620
[Jay] Who is your ex-husband?

919
00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:52.247
[sigh]

920
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:54.541
fools

921
00:54:56.168 --> 00:54:57.544
Without knowing anything

922
00:55:10.932 --> 00:55:13.185
[Sound of door opening and closing]

923
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.908

[Cool breathing sound]

926
00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:12.786
Why is he like this? today

927
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:15.539
Like a person who takes out their anger on food

928
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.209
[Kanghu] Why?

929
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:20.919
Do you have something to say to me?

930
00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:28.260
Maybe

931
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:30.971
Yuna News

932
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:33.265
[Jay] Are you curious?

933
00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.685
When Yuna was in prison

934
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.062
He said he didn't even meet Kang-hoo.

935
00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:42.441
Even after being released on parole, there was no contact.

936
00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:44.818
So

937
00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:47.946
Are you curious about Yuna’s news?

938
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.747
Eat it, it will blow.

939
00:57:12.804 --> 00:57:14.389

947
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:32.324
[Jay's sigh]

948
00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:33.450

[sigh]

951
00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:50.425
[Kanghu] Listen to the answer and go

952
00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.764
I asked, are you curious about Yuna?

953
00:57:58.225 --> 00:57:59.809
Aren’t you curious about Yuna’s news?

954
00:58:00.602 --> 00:58:01.603
But

955
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.230
I'm curious about you

956
00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:05.774
What should I do?

957
00:58:06.399 --> 00:58:08.235
To get you out of that hell

958
00:58:18.954 --> 00:58:20.080

Please find out who I am

969

[Embarrassed laughter]

974
00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:25.979
It was in the media.

975

I can't keep up with you
I also have special abilities

1010

How do you do it?

I don't stay still then

In this life that I live just looking at

1080
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:19.999
i am satisfied

1081
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.377
[Snort] Yeah

1082
01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.838
Well, if that’s what you mean.

1083
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.131
[Leo] Yes

1084
01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:31.761
But

1085
01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.472
Doesn’t your wife know that too?

1086
01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.183
[President Jeong] What did you do?

1087
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.352
[nervous music]

1088
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.655
[absurd gasping sound]

1089
01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:56.995
[Atmospheric music plays]

1090
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:07.880
[Yoojeong] I’m sorry

1091
01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.091
I said I would do it

1092
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.176
[Yujeong’s sigh]

1093
01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.096
I guess I'm not good at cooking.

1094
01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.889
It's okay

1095
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.725
If you get married anyway

1096
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.685
Because I will cook all the food for you.

1097
01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:21.769
[laughter]

1098
01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:23.563

[heavy music]

1100
01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:38.202
[Heungsik] You

1101
01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:41.789
About your future groom
How much do you know?

1102
01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:43.958
What do you mean by that?

1103
01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.044
Written by team leader Song Je-hyuk over the past year

1104
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.755
[Heungsik] Money of unknown origin
Do you know how much it is?

1105
01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:51.174
It's like 1.9 billion

1106
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.928
Do you know where the money is?

1107
01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.475
Mr. Jehyuk

1108
01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:06.439
[Yoojeong] About me

1109
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.317
Even if it's a little uncomfortable

1110
01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:13.571
About each other's secrets before marriage
I think everything should be said

1111
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.117
So after marriage
There are no other misunderstandings

1112
01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.543
Do you think I have a secret?
To Mr. Yoo-jeong?

1113
01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.761
[Sound of a knife being put down]

1114
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:39.639
Mr. Yujeong

1115
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.644
[Jehyuk] Could you come with me tomorrow?
Can I go to daycare?

1116
01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.524
[Noisy sounds of children]

1117
01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:59.408
[Jehyuk] I went to this orphanage
I came in as an English teacher

1118
01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.953
Maybe it was a year ago?

1119
01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:08.376
[Yoojeong] It’s too much for children.
Seeing how much effort you put into it

1120
01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.089
What in the world is like that
I wondered if there were all good people.

1121
01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:15.758
[Embarrassed laughter]

1122
01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.678
[Yeji] Angel

1123
01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.224
Angel, are you here?

1124
01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:24.475
[Yoojeong] Angel?

1125
01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:26.352
Yes, angel.

1126
01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:30.398
[Director] Team leader Song Je-hyuk’s nickname is

1127
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:34.235
This is an angel here at the orphanage.

1128
01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.279
- [Yujeong’s enlightened elasticity]
- [Laugh together]

1129

[Soft music]

1131
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.622
[Jehyuk] I think there were rumors.

1132
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.085
I had surgery on Yeji’s leg.

1133
01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:56.382
So at another daycare center
I received an inquiry about sick children.

1134
01:08:57.592 --> 01:08:59.260
My child also wants to ask for something.

1135
01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:05.516
I can't bear to say that the child from our orphanage
I couldn’t say no.

1136
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.561
So I had no choice but to do it.

1137
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.983
[Yoojeong] That’s our company
I couldn't put it in the accounting ledger.

1138
01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.819
Because it's not our daycare job.

1139
01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.532
[Jehyuk] I’m sorry

1140
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.786
Foundation funds that must be transparent
I made this mistake

1141
01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:27.955
But

1142
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:31.792
Whenever I see sick children
I can't pretend not to know

1143
01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:35.421
Just like you

1144
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.260
[Yoojeong] Branch manager

1145
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.554
Sorry for being late at night

1146
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.266
I have something urgent to tell you.

1147
01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:51.812
have to do it by tomorrow
Loan repayment

1148
01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.233
You have 10 billion won from Mariela, right?

1149
01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:58.653
Please stop it with that

1150
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.323
Yes, I know, it can't be done.

1151
01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:05.326
But soon in Tongju City

1152
01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:07.328
Construction begins
When investment money comes in

1153
01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.913
I can fill it with that.

1154
01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:12.041
I'll bet my credibility

What are you going to do, Yuna?

[City Noise]

1162
01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:57.670
[Jay] Right over there

1163
01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.423
Land where we will build a cultural arts complex

1164
01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.884
But now
land owned by Goyuna

1165
01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:08.514
I called you guys to show you over there.

1166
01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.518
[Haemi] Anyway, Yoo Yoo-na
It's a special talent

1167
01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:15.896
Give that kind of land to a man
If you look at what I took,

1168
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:17.815
us

1169
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.985
Except that land
Where to build a cultural arts complex

1170
01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:22.695
It's harder to find, right?

1171
01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.947
It has to be that land.

1172
01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:27.658
There's a gem in there

1173
01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.453
What jewel?

1174
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:33.080
Is there a gold mine? Oil coming out?

1175
01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:37.418
Yoojeong, in there
You said you had a daycare center, right?

1176
01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.212
uh

1177
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.965
[Yoojeong] Less than 2,000 pyeong
Although it is a small piece of land

1178
01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:46.135
me two days later

1179
01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.596
[Jay] Can I declare my candidacy there?

1180
01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.514
are you okay?

1181
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.893
In the middle of Yuna's land
Are you declaring your candidacy?

1182
01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.228
Is this a provocation?

1183
01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:01.233
[Yujeong] That’s why Yuna
Are you going to give us land?

1184
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.738
don't worry about that
Because I have thoughts on everything.

1185
01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.032
Rather than that

1186
01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.701
I want to hear your answer first

1187
01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:13.496
I officially
After declaring candidacy

1188
01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.041
I'll be more focused on the media

[Yujeong’s sigh]

1192

If you are not confident, quit now.

1193
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.521
[Jay] You disband the promotion committee

1194
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:42.483
You are the donation made to Yujeong’s foundation.
Once you retrieve it, it's over.

1195
01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.027
What are you talking about?

1196
01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.529
Of course we should be together

1197
01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.323
Of course

1198
01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.118
I'm definitely there too
We need to build a hanok hotel

- Okay

thank you for coming out

1205
01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.993
[Yuna] I contacted you
Did you feel uncomfortable?

1206
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.371

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.465
I killed your son
What if it's not the real culprit?

1210
01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.757
Then

1211
01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:50.926
[Yuncheol] Who do you mean?

1212
01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.637

1214
01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:34.970
[Sang-guk] Well, the lawyer’s
This Tongju mayoral candidacy is

1215
01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.138
It's pretty sudden.

Well, do you have a special occasion?

1217
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.976
[Jay] Yes, former Mayor Jeong Gu-tae

1218
01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.145
Gunggok district was donated to the Youngun Foundation.

1219
01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.356
It will become a landmark of Tongju City on this land.

1220

Culture and Arts Complex
He wanted it to be made

1221

Now former Mayor Jeong Gu-tae
Although he passed away

1222
01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:52.947
Inherit that meaning

1223
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:57.701
It's not enough, but it's enough for the Tongju mayoral election.
I decided to run for office.

Is it starting?

Yes, as soon as possible
so that construction can begin
