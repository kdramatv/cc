{\an8}Nice and discreet like Yujeong
He gave me a daughter

12
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.956

Would that be enough?

What do you do after the wedding?
I think it's natural

32
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.348

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:36.020
how do you get that mask
Do you have it?

92
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.233
What he left behind in America
I brought it with me

93
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.822
Are you sure about Jehyuk?

94
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:47.782
[Jay] Someone else’s girl

95
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.702
That day you were in that room
Maybe he brought it out with him.

96
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.203
[Awesome breathing sound]

97
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.581
You trust Song Je-hyuk more than me?

98
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.208
Who to trust and not trust
It's not a problem

99
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.044
[Jay sighs] I

100
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.173
What matters is who owns the mask.

101
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.884
So we have no choice but to be cautious.

102
00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.181
Then let me ask you one question too.

103
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.602
What is the blood on that mask?

104
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.481
[shaking breathing]

105
00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.565
[nervous music]

106
00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:24.903
that day

107
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.115
When he does something mean to me

108
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.786
I [shaking breath]

109
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:38.041
I swung the knife and ran away.

110
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:44.964
[breathing sound]

111
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.382
Because now I know

112
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.134
Give me that mask

113
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.678
[Jay] If you test the blood on there,

114
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:54.349
The real owner of that mask is
I can tell if it's Song Je-hyuk or not.

115
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:58.728
If you give it to me?

116
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.442
If you give it

117
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.821
You betrayed him and Yujeong.
Are you going to find my daughter?

118
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.616
[Soaring music]

119

The mask owner
Is it really Song Je-hyuk or not?

122
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:30.885
I

123
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.388
To find out the owner of the mask

124
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.099
I poured 10 years of my life into it

125
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.310
such an important thing

126
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.397
I can't be dragged around by you

127
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:48.570
ok

128
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.740
Then I take the mask
Whoever you hand it over to

129
00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.243
It doesn't matter, right?

130

I mean Yujeong.

139
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.829
Wouldn't it be a waste?

140
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.041
Your son
I wish I didn't have to do something like that

141
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:47.420

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.138
[Haemi] Wedding day
A nice word of thanks is awesome

177
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.183
[Leo] Look at me

178
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.894
Because Jehyuk is dressed like that.
You seem like a completely different person

179
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.771
Honestly, that's enough
Ace in our industry too, ace

180
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.106
That's right

181
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.525
Yoojung needs to be a little nervous.

182
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.861
[Haemi] Jehyuk, you look like a celebrity today

183
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.947
[Leo] Oh, wait a minute, I’ll do it.

184
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.159
thank you

185
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.416
[Yoojeong] Guys

186
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.584
- [Haemi welcomes you] Yoo Jeong-ah

187
00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.503
- [Haemi] Congratulations
- [Jehyuk] Yes

188
00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:34.795
[Jehyuk] Did you enjoy your meal?

189

192
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.718
Bravo!

193
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.637
[Haemi is surprised] What are you doing?
To the groom?

194
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.514
[Leo] Hey, if you go to the club
To the main character

195
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.098
champagne shower
They make me work hard and do that.

196
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.433
- [Haemi] Is this a club?
- [Yoojeong] Mr. Jehyuk

197
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.643
[Haemi] Where did I get my old habits from?

198
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.984
[painful breathing]

199
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.663
- [Haemi] Oh, everything is wet.
- It's okay, yes.

200
00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:09.747
[Haemi] What should I do? Take off your jacket first.

201
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.541
- [Haemi] What should I do?
- Baby, yes, it's okay.

202
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.209
[Yoojeong] No, I have a cold.
Mr. Jehyuk

203
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.585
- Take it off quickly, you'd better take it off.
- [Hae-mi’s embarrassed breathing]

204
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.296
[Jehyuk] Oh, no
I'll go over there and change.

205
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.258
[Haemi] Oh, just take it off.
Don't worry about the bride.

206
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.510
yes

207
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.071
That

208
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.323
I'll go change my clothes and come back.

209
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.827
[Yoojeong] Let’s go together, Mr. Jehyuk.

210
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.290
[Meaningful music]

211
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:58.838
[annoyed breathing]

212
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.593
[sigh]

213
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:08.598
[Jehyuk] Did you find this?

214
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.106
[Yoojeong] What about Kanghu and Leo?

215
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.566
[Haemi] To get the car

216
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.028
I was sorry about the champagne earlier.

217
00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.989
Our Leo is still a bit immature.

218
00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:26.657
[Light laughter] No.

219
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.242
Rather, it worked out well.

220
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.288
In that wind, I
I didn’t have to go there earlier.

221
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.957
I really didn't want to run into you

222
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.127
[Haemi] Ki Yun-cheol, that human being
Aren't you a pervert?

223
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.211
no, how

224
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.255
The woman who was his son's fiancee
Are you coming to the wedding?

225
00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:42.590
without notice

226
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.051
I think I know Jehyuk.

227
00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.054
[Yoojeong] I can’t ask because I’m scared.

228
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.556
What are you afraid of?
Even after registering the marriage,

229
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.141
[Haemi] I know a little bit about the past, right?

230
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.352
Have you already registered your marriage?

231
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.480
[Jay] No, why are you doing it already?
What's the rush?

232
00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.106
- [light laughter]
- [Calm music]

233
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.191
Jay

234
00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.360
I saw it earlier

235
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.862
[Yoojeong] The way you look at Jehyuk

236
00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:09.867
You must be worried

237
00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.079
I am the wrong man again
I guess I chose it

238
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.463
But Jay, don’t worry.

239
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.217
I'm really confident that I'll live well this time

240
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.180
Our Mr. Jehyuk
I'm sure he's a good guy

241
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.393
[Jehyuk] Today’s precious time
thank you for mine

242
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.104
[laughter]

243
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.399
Now, all of Yeongwoon’s assets are

244
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.567
Is this going to happen to Chairman Song?

245
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.903
We need to manage it well in the future.

246
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.739
[Jehyuk] These precious people
You're watching.

247
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:49.824
[laughter]

248
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.076
Congratulations on your marriage once again

249
00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.495
Only good things ahead
Hope you have it

250
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.541
[Manok] Then
Have a nice trip

251
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:02.545
Jewelry with care
You know you have to deal with it, right?

252
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.046
[laughter]

253
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.260
[Jehyuk] Ah, then
I'll go first.

254
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.428
- [Yuncheol] That’s right.
- Yes

255
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.016
[Sound of approaching footsteps]

256
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.270
[Yujeong] Uh, Nana
I joined the camp with my aunt.

257
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.690
Only the luggage here
Please bring some home

258
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.692
- [Driver] Yes, I understand.
- [Yoojeong] Yes

259
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.197
[Haemi] Are you going on your honeymoon right away?

260
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.074
Uh [light laughter]

261
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.743
I'm kinda excited

262
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:35.995
[Yoojeong] Mr. Jehyuk
He said he would surprise me

263
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.371
I prepared it alone

264
00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.874
[Haemi is surprised] Mr. Jehyuk
Is it romantic?

265
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.584
Where do you want to go?

266
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.836
[Meaningful music]

267
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.089
[Jay] Jehyuk, have you moved?

268
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.052
Uh, to my house two days ago.

269
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.180
- [Haemi and Yujeong’s laughter]
- Uh, over there.

270
00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:55.514
[Jay] I’ll go first

271
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:59.351
When Kang-hoo asks me
Tell them I went first because of urgent business.

272
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.771
And Yoo Jeong-ah

273
00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:02.855
you

274
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.068
If anything happens, you must contact me

275
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.028
Huh? Okay?

276
00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.364
Uh, yeah

277
00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:13.949
I'll go first

278
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.423
[Jay takes a breath] Driver
hello

279
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.550
You know me, right?

280
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.761
Of course I know
You are a friend of the chairman.

281
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.888
But for what reason?

282
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.350
Ah, that oil well is a burden
I'll bring it to you

283
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.936
I also have a surprise for you.

284
00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.981
Then give it to me.
I'll bring it with you

285
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:50.027
Oh, that requires some setting.
I really have to go

286
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.447
[Jay] Well, because it’s a surprise gift

287
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.742
I went to the chairman and his wife.
Do you have to keep it a secret?

288
00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:58.327
yes, i understand

289
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.581
Well, what is the password for the front door?

290
00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.011
Dojae that day

291
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:21.016
Sexual assault by a masked man
It's true that it happened...

292
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.101
- [Dark Music]
- [Jay] That guy told me

293
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.352
When you do something bad

294
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:28.190
I swung the knife and ran away.

295
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.569
If Jay ran away

296
00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.363
Who killed the prayer ceremony?

297
00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:38.409
[sigh]

298
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.167
Could it be…

299
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.044
[Soaring music]

300
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:57.928
[absurd gasping sound]

301
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.236
[Yoojeong] Mr. Jehyuk

302
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.071
[Jehyuk] Yes?

303
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.115
Now tell me

304
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.118
A honeymoon destination prepared as a ‘surprise’

305
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:22.745
Ah

306
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.872
Where is it?

307
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:26.207
[Car engine sound]

308
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.276
I need to find some clue

309
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.528
[sigh]

310
00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.992
- [Nervous music]
- [clattering sound]

311
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:40.906
[rattling sound]

312
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.329
[Sound of strong breathing]

313
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.500
[Soaring music]

314
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.384
[Sound of rustling]

315
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.704
[Jay’s slight elasticity]

316
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:33.417
[clattering sound]

317
00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.422
- [Car engine sound]
- [Yujeong’s breathing mixed with laughter]

318
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:42.551
[Yoojeong] I can’t believe I’m doing this
You're not going to the honeymoon destination, are you?

319
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.804
[Jehyuk] I just arrived

320
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:51.852
where we will spend our first night

321
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:55.147
[Yujeong’s surprised gasp] Already
Is it the airport?

322
00:21:56.857 --> 00:22:00.110
the most beautiful in the world
peaceful place

323
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:01.403
right away

324
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.906
[Jehyuk] This is where

325
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:11.830
- [Door lock operation sound]
- [Meaningful music]

326
00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:13.957
- [Door lock operating sound]
- [Sound of door opening]

327
00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.126
- [Sound of door closing]
- [Sharp sound effect]

328
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:18.462
[Yoojeong] Chi

329
00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.255
- [Yoojeong] I kept people’s expectations high.
- [Sound of shuffling feet]

330
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:22.466
Your honeymoon destination is home?

331
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.593
- [Nervous music]
- [Jehyuk] Come in first.

332
00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.179
[Yoojeong] Oh, wait a minute

333
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.099
- Please wear those corrective slippers.
- [Jehyuk] Ah

334
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.060
[Yoojeong] Oh my, Mr. Jehyuk, oh my

335
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.311
[Jehyuk] There’s no need for that.

336
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:36.188
[Yujeong's panicked breathing] No.

337
00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:38.482
[Yujeong’s laughter]

338
00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:57.709
At best it’s a ‘surprise’
A honeymoon destination prepared

339
00:22:58.252 --> 00:22:59.503
Are you disappointed because it’s home?

340
00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:07.136
It's only once in a lifetime
A house is a bit like that.

341
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:12.141
A once-in-a-lifetime first night
I wanted to spend it here

342
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.768
This is the oil well

343
00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:18.188
me in the world
It's the world of the woman I love the most.

344
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.732
[light laughter]

345
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.902
[Jehyuk] Let’s wait and see.

346
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.322
I'm alone with you
This world I was protecting

Pain, sadness, loneliness
Don't let me come back again

351
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:50.929
So

I'm in your world
To commemorate coming in

I'm sorry

354
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.775
I don't know how deep you are

355
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:06.320
Then

356
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.505

- [Laughs]
- [Jehyuk] I can’t do this with this body.

362
00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:09.758
I don't think I can hug you

363
00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.301
[laughter]

364
00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:13.011
I'll take a shower too.

365
00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:14.429
Then

[eerie sound effect]

380
00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:51.777
Were you watching everything?

381
00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:54.488
me?

382
00:26:57.532 --> 00:26:58.533
sometimes at home

383
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:00.285
[Laughing] A rat comes in.

384
00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:06.583
[Jay] What should I do?

385
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.544
To that rat

386
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.089
I found out your identity

387
00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:14.674
- Is that you?
- [Soaring music]

388
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.093

390
00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:19.429
If you go?

391
00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.015
What mask?

392
00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:24.893
I have no evidence
Do you think it's like this?

393
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:28.105
What kind of evidence?
I don't know if I have it

394
00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:31.274
[Jehyuk] Stealing my traces
Want to compare?

395
00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:34.986
I haven't used that toothbrush a few times.

396
00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:38.115
Something more certain
How about taking it?

397
00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:43.286
What is there?

398
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.913
[Jehyuk’s thinking]

399
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:49.584
Should I kiss you like Yujeong?

400
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:51.586
Or

401
00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:55.924
my hair?

402
00:27:57.634 --> 00:27:58.635
Or

403
00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:05.350
And the proof that you have

404
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.271
Same traces?

405
00:28:10.313 --> 00:28:11.440

406
00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:15.485
[In a trembling voice] Just wait and see

407

You

408
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:19.740
[Jay] That night

409
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:21.742
That guy

410
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:24.911
I'll definitely reveal it

411
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.961
[sarcastically] Why?
You can check it now

412
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.589
me that night

413
00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:37.966
Is he a masked man or not?

414
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.765
[nervous music]

415
00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:48.769

416
00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.524
[In a trembling voice] You
Isn't it scary?

417
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.360
Your identity is revealed

418
00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.238
I'm scared, I'm scared to death

419
00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:01.823
I'm afraid Yujeong will find out.

420
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.745
That you and I did it together

421
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:08.622
[uneasy music]

422
00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:11.833
What?

423
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:14.753
But the traces you have

424
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.131
I unilaterally told you
I did something bad

425
00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:20.217
It's not evidence

426
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.221
[Jehyuk] Because I like you and me
It could have been

427
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.976
But if possible
That you and I did it together

428
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.645
Please keep it a secret from Yujeong.

429
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.065
[Laughing] Even though it was 10 years ago

430
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.567
With that neat personality

431
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.486
How much will it hurt?

432
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:44.157
What should I do?

433
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.703
I told you
There is no evidence that he did anything bad.

434
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.375
There's only proof that it was you and me

435
00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:57.712
[Soaring music]

436
00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:04.261

[Jehyuk] What should I do?

457
00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:57.767
I did something bad to you
There is no evidence

458
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:01.771
There's only proof that it was you and me

459

But the traces you have

460

I told you
I did something bad unilaterally

You said you were looking for me for no reason
You worked hard for 10 years

Why do you keep calling me mom like that?

531
00:37:57.692 --> 00:37:58.943
Because it’s pretty

532
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:01.446
[Yujeong's surprised gasp] Mom
Are you that pretty?

533
00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:03.823
The prettiest in the world

534
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.492
[Laughing] Is your mom that pretty?

535
00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:11.414
Mom is also my Nana
You are the prettiest in the world

536
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:12.498
[Yujeong’s laughter]

537
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.417
- [Nana] But mom
- [Yujeong] Huh?

538
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.628
Now it's me or mom
Where are you going again?

539
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.298
[Nana] Are you still living with Nana?

540
00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:24.344
[Laughing] Of course

541
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.388
My mom is Nana Mom.

542
00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:29.432
Where should I go now?

543
00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:33.519
mom always
My Nana will be by your side

544
00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:35.521
[Yujeong’s light smile]

545
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:40.818
[Oncoming car engine sound]

546
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:42.153
[Yujeong is surprised] The car is coming

547
00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:50.536
hello, mother

548
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.121
[Yoojeong] Yes, hello, teacher

549
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:53.748
[Teacher] Hello, Nana?

550
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.166
[Nana] Hello

551
00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:56.584
[Teacher] Shall we ride in the car with you?

552
00:38:57.794 --> 00:38:59.754
[Yoojeong] Oh, it’s okay
Hold your teacher's hand

553
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.256
[Yujeong’s breathing mixed with laughter]

554
00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.427
Thank you, sir.

555
00:39:06.969 --> 00:39:08.137
Yes, don't worry

556
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:10.223
[Teacher] It’s Nana.
Let's say hello to mom

557
00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:11.599
[Nana] I’ll be back!

558
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.352
Okay, have a nice trip, Nana.

559
00:39:15.812 --> 00:39:16.896
[Teacher] Please go in.

560
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.404
[Car starting sound]

561
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:35.998
[Car engine sound receding]

562
00:39:36.332 --> 00:39:37.708
[Sharp sound effect]

563
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:44.298
[Yujeong is embarrassed] What, all of a sudden?

564
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:45.675
Thank goodness

565
00:39:46.592 --> 00:39:47.844
I feel like I take good care of my child.

566
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.389
Were you watching me?

567
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:53.558
[Yoojeong] Why?

568
00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:58.813
To be precise
I wasn't watching you

569
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:03.317
[Making a yuck sound] That’s it.

570
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.445
Do you know where Dojae is?

571
00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:08.030
I don't know

572
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:11.075
I don't answer phone calls and text messages.

573
00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:14.495
do you know

574
00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.456
If I knew, would I have asked you?

575
00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:18.541
Because I can't contact you either
That's what I asked

576
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.084
[absurd gasping sound]

577
00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:22.545
But you are

578
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:26.340
You could ask me over the phone
What did you come here for?

579
00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:29.469
Don't you?

580
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.346
You are the biggest obstacle

581
00:40:33.473 --> 00:40:34.474
What?

582
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:36.976
[Sigh] That’s it.

583
00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.438
If you contact Jay
contact me yeah

584
00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.065
Because I have something to ask

585
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.361
[Sound of Yuna’s footsteps moving away]

586
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:48.946
You're a coward

587
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:51.699
Are you going to run away just because I scared you once?

588
00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:54.785
[Secretary Choi] It’s already been a week
I'm not coming home

589
00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:57.246
I don't even go to the office

590
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.539
What the heck

591
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.833
Why did you scare Dojae?

592
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:02.335
Even if you got caught...

593
00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:03.586
I got caught

594
00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:06.297
Tongju Market and all
I'm afraid I'll wander around

595
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.965
I ordered it cut in advance.

596
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:10.009
[Secretary Choi] Now then
Because there is nothing to worry about

597
00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:12.136
Is Angels Club the beginning?

598
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.431
Tell it to members

599
00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:17.099
now

600
00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:20.186
The devil's time is back

601
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:23.022
[Meaningful music]

602
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.529
[Call connection tone]

603
00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:31.364
{\an8}[English]

604
00:41:32.114 --> 00:41:38.913

{\an8}[English]

608
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:54.428
[Korean] Now the problem is
Not Dojae

609
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:56.430
It's me, it's me

610
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:02.186
[Jehyuk’s light sigh]

611
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:07.984
[Jehyuk] That mask
I know you have it.

612
00:42:08.317 --> 00:42:09.735
Don't do anything hasty

613
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:11.862
Do you know who's behind me?

614
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:13.281
[Meaningful music]

615
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.201
You know who's behind you

616
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:21.372
[thinking breath]

617
00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:23.499
There's a lot of room to expand on this.

618
00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:32.216
[Yuna] I’m Yoo Yoo-na, look at me.

619
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.344
If the wind blows again this time
I'm going to the National Assembly

620
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:36.679
[Message sending sound]

621
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.472
[Haemi] Someone came to visit?

622
00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.600
- [Sound of a cup being put down]
- Yuna?

623
00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.852
- [Haemi] In front of the house?
- [Yoojeong] Uh

624
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:46.063
[Yoojeong] Nana Kindergarten Bus
They give me a ride

625
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.858
I'm asking if I can contact Jay.

626
00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:53.362
Me and him suddenly
I'm so scared of showing up

627
00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:54.989
Me too, from the wind in the morning

628
00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:57.199
It comes so suddenly like this
I'm scared

629
00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.243
[Haemi] Oh, what are you doing on the phone?

630
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:01.787
[Yoojeong] At Jehyuk’s house

631
00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:05.249
When I talk to you
I need to talk about Yuna.

632
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:07.501
I have a friend like Yuna

633
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.795
I'm so embarrassed for Jehyuk.

634
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:14.091
Speaking of Jehyuk,

635
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:17.803
You are on the promotion committee
You decided to donate land for an orphanage.

636
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.388
Why don't you do that?

637
00:43:22.642 --> 00:43:23.893
Mr. Jehyuk

638
00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.437
I have a lot of attachment to the orphanage.

639
00:43:26.812 --> 00:43:29.899
Then our hotel donated
At least give me the money back

640
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.069
I really want to tell our president
I can't even lift my face

641
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:35.905
Oh, okay.

642
00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:37.615
When Jay contacts me

643
00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:40.159
What happens to Yuna’s land?
I'll check and return it to you.

644
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.080
So you to me
Don't waste money anymore

645
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:52.046
[Haemi] Oh, by the way, this is Jae-i.

646
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.589
Where on earth have you disappeared to?

647
00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:57.968
I couldn't contact Kang-hoo either.

648
00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:00.304
Maybe

649
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.100
Aren't you two together?

650
00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:06.227
[Birdsong]

651
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.898
[Calm music]

652
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.327
[Jay] Thank you

653
00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:28.290
[Sighing] It feels like it’s been 10 years

654
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:31.419
Resting and doing nothing like this

655
00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:36.215
Okay, just relax and do nothing.

656
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:38.634
[Jay's light smile]

657
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.638
Mr. Kanghu has become my shelter again.

658
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:44.932
You know?

659
00:44:46.142 --> 00:44:49.437
Mr. Kanghu
That it has always been my shelter

660
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:51.939
[Kanghu’s sigh]

661
00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:57.611
[Sigh] Jay

662
00:44:58.988 --> 00:44:59.989
[Jay] Huh?

663
00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:05.911
You won't stop this war, right?

664
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:13.502
I know

665
00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:17.339
I get tired just by looking at it from the side.

666
00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:20.801
So, Mr. Kang-hoo

667
00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.219
No, that's what I meant.

668
00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.931
I just need to check

669
00:45:29.018 --> 00:45:30.978
[Kanghu sighs] So, it’s Jae.

670
00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:34.106
don't ever shrink

671
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:36.484
If you're having a hard time

672
00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:39.445
You can rest at any time
Because I have it

673
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.281
Okay?

674
00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:44.825
[Jay's light smile]

675
00:45:57.755 --> 00:46:00.090
[Yuna] Imported directly from the United States
It's a Napa Valley wine.

676
00:46:02.218 --> 00:46:03.219
Enjoy

677
00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.722
[Yuncheol] Why is this place the best?

678
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.391
Right here…

679
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:10.476
I know

680
00:46:11.352 --> 00:46:12.520
Congressman's only son

681
00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.688
The very room where the prayer ceremony died

682
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.359
[Yuna] Rep.
The reason I called you here

683
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.362
That son's death
Just to talk

684
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:23.697
my son?

685
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:27.660
[Meaningful music]

686
00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:38.837
No, what is this?

687
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.047
10 years ago

688
00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:41.966
The day your son died

689
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.218
[Yuna] Right in this room

690
00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:47.846
To the man wearing this mask
Dojae was sexually assaulted

691
00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:50.266
This blood

692
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:53.102
Dojae said to the man
I jumped out swinging my knife

693
00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:55.688
who is my son
I didn't rape you!

694
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:56.855
[snort]

695
00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:58.440
Oh, who said your son did that?

696
00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.652
Song Je-hyuk said that.

697
00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:04.947
Song Jehyuk?

698
00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:09.618
I looked at this mask and thought about it.

699
00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:14.290
The culprit who killed your son
Doesn't look like Dojae

700
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.418
[Yuna] A woman had a knife

701
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.003
It's hard to deal with two men

702
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:22.089
Then the real culprit is

703
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:26.927
Could it be Song Je-hyuk?

704
00:47:28.887 --> 00:47:30.222
[Sharp sound effect]

705
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:34.393
[laughter]

706
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.812
- Ha, really.
- [Interesting Music]

707
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.607
Oh, you didn't even know that.

708
00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:42.610
The murderer who killed his son
I was watching your back

711
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:50.451
How about changing?

712
00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.580
From the boat behind Song Je-hyuk to the boat behind me

713
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:01.003
[Yuncheol] If what you say is false

714
00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:04.214
You will definitely have to take responsibility

715
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:07.635
Keep in mind

716
00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:11.555
I could get you out of jail

717
00:48:12.681 --> 00:48:15.017

Do you know that Yoo-jeong is married?

723
00:49:07.986 --> 00:49:09.571
[Ilgu] I went to the wedding

724
00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.075
You went to see Jay.

725
00:49:14.243 --> 00:49:17.913
Just watch it like that
Because she’s your daughter.

726
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.498
[Ilgu’s mouth sounds]

727
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.417
Nothing's wrong with Jae-yi, right?

728
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:24.878
Well, I couldn't contact you for a week.

729
00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:26.839
[Sim-ok] I got a call a little while ago.

730
00:49:29.341 --> 00:49:31.260
in a very strong voice

731
00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:35.514
Get out of the loop now
Did you find a way?

732
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.141
- [Heartstone’s Sigh]
- [Dark Music]

733
00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:40.602
From the bondage I was trapped in for those 10 years

734
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.149
a way to escape
I don't know how I found it

735
00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:48.193
That's a relief

736
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:54.032
dead jay aemiga
It's protected from heaven

737
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:18.432

739
00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.354
I also had a great vacation for the first time in a while.

740
00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:26.523
Oh, it must be a vacation?

741
00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:28.942
I must have had so many calls looking for me.

742
00:50:30.277 --> 00:50:31.278
don't even talk

743
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.906
With Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong
Vice President Haemi Yoon

744
00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:35.199
How many times have you been calling?

745
00:50:36.992 --> 00:50:40.037
I'll contact you when I'm ready.

746
00:50:40.913 --> 00:50:42.372
[Jay] First of all, listen to Song Je-hyuk’s ears.

747
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:45.167
When my actions begin
Absolutely not

748
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:47.044
[Yongpil] That’s right

749
00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:49.713
Lawyer alone
How are you going to fight that guy?

750
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:53.550
So I'm going to bring in a mercenary.

751
00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:55.803
As someone who knows the enemy very well

752
00:50:57.513 --> 00:50:58.514
[Interesting music]

let's see

757
00:51:13.195 --> 00:51:14.196
It's pretty, right?

758
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:15.739
Okay

759
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.659
[Leo] My head is filled with sisters

760
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.453
My sister is a flower

761
00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:24.832
[President Jeong] I do a lot of things.

762
00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.127
It’s really hard to make a living, isn’t it?

763
00:51:30.546 --> 00:51:32.214
Follow me, let's talk

764
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.886
[Message sending sound]

765
00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:43.725
[Leo] I will never do that

766
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.186
me

767
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:49.481
As promised
We're just taking care of medications here, huh?

768
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.899
Never take care of customers

769
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.401
[President Jeong] Uh huh

770
00:51:53.318 --> 00:51:55.153
Because I'm not just a customer

771
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:57.573
- [Leo] I won’t.
- [President Jeong] Write, Leo.

772
00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:00.534
- [Sigh]
- [President Jeong] Truly the best

773
00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:03.287
Only VVIPs gathered
Do you have a secret club?

774
00:52:03.871 --> 00:52:06.415
- Manage those members.
- [Leo’s sigh]

775
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:10.794
You're a bit of a hit with VVIPs.

776
00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:12.838
That's why I seduced your sister too.

777
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.048
It's not flirting, it's love!

778
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.300
yes love

779
00:52:17.509 --> 00:52:18.969
[President Jeong] But your love

780
00:52:19.052 --> 00:52:20.637
It seems like it's been a bit difficult these days

781
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.724
[Clicks tongue] Take some medicine
It seems like he's looking for it

782
00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:25.309
Huh?

783
00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:27.185
[uneasy music]

784
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:29.396
[Leo] So you gave it to me?

785
00:52:29.688 --> 00:52:30.731
[President Jeong] No, not yet

786
00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:33.734
But you don't know

787
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.653
You keep doing this
When it comes out

788
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:40.449
fish oil, seeds

789
00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:45.537
[President Jeong] So
Let's do it just once, just once

790
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.372
I won't do it anymore

791
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.801
It's really just this one time

792
00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:02.429
Instead, if you sell drugs to my sister, I

793
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:05.265
Let's just set it on fire here.

794
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:06.850
Got it?

795
00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:10.729

{\an8}[Jehyuk] Well done

801
00:53:24.743 --> 00:53:28.038

I think I can even catch Yoon Hae-mi.

00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:31.667
- [Mobile phone button sound]
- [Secretary] You can't go in.

Be polite.

809
00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:48.725
Are you the one who killed my son?

810
00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:53.105
Go Yoo-na came to visit me
They showed me a bloody mask.

811
00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:56.024
[Yuncheol] You sexually assaulted Dojae
That's what happened?

812
00:53:57.818 --> 00:54:00.487
Please hide your words.

813
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.531
[Shouting] Answer me, is it you?

814
00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:05.617
[heavy music]

815
00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.913
It's true that that's what happened with Dojae.

816
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.624
I wasn't the one who killed Do-shik.

817
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.210
Dojae is holding the knife.

818
00:54:15.544 --> 00:54:17.087
How do I kill Do-shik?

819
00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.134
I got stabbed by Do Jae Yi.
ran away

820
00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:25.178
So after that
I don't know what happened

821
00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:29.558
If it was you who killed my son

822
00:54:30.142 --> 00:54:33.395
you are more miserable than my son
you will face death

823
00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:35.147
Either do that

824
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.449
[Yuncheol] Still, that mask

825
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:47.826
Anything you have in your hands is dangerous.

826
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:50.787
To Chairman Kang Il-gu

827
00:54:52.372 --> 00:54:54.875
What you did to Dojae
Because I won't say anything

828
00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:58.128
If you go quickly, come back

829
00:54:58.837 --> 00:54:59.880
Got it?

830
00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:08.638
[Leo] My head is filled with sisters

831
00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.474
My sister is a flower

832
00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:16.146
Now your sweetness too
It seems useless

833
00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.990
[Haemi] One hour later
See you at the Grand Gangbo Hotel.

834
00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:29.201

how have you been doing? What about mom?

843
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:08.824

- [Haemi] I asked for a drink
- [Ancient music plays]

845

846
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.384
[Manok] It’s a bar
I'm not giving alcohol to just anyone.

847
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:29.636
What's going on?

848
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:33.473
I'm scared of people's eyes
A kid who doesn't even come close to here

849
00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:36.685
[Haemi] I’m scared of people’s eyes
It's not that it's not coming

850
00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:40.105
My mom is mistreating Leo
I'm not coming because I'm annoyed.

851
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.774
I raised it hard

852
00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:46.903
[Man-ok] The one I chose for some reason
Ugh, ugh!

853
00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:49.781
Oh, it's starting again, again, again

854
00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.451
[Haemi] I’m a fool who came here

855
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:54.995
[Man-ok] Yoon Hae-mi, sit down

856
00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:58.081
Because something happened
After coming and leaving

857
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:06.339
What is it?

858
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:08.925

Take the land from Yuna and share it with me.
You decided to include Yujeong too?

862
00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:26.651
It's already been over a week
I can't contact Jay.

863
00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.029
How should I interpret this?

[absurd laughter]

865
00:57:31.072 --> 00:57:32.365

I got stabbed in the back

867

- [Meaningful music]
- Me? To Jay?

868

870
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.586

Would you like to share it between the three of you?

[Haemi's amazing breathing]

872
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.217
[Haemi] That’s ridiculous.

873
00:57:50.717 --> 00:57:52.177
Should I see Jay for a day or two?

[Hae-mi's absurd breathing]

875
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.055
Jay will never
We're not the ones to betray you

876
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:59.059
[Manok] In front of money
It is human to betray even blood.

877
00:57:59.768 --> 00:58:01.436
But what, buddy?

878
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.230
Well, it's nothing

879
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.856
Do you think you and Yujeong won’t do that?

00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:14.282
Just like mom said

883
00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:17.786
What if Jay betrayed me?

884
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:20.247
What should I do? What should I do?

885
00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:23.667
I'll give you a weapon

886
00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:27.128
Dojae pierces the solar plexus.

887
00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:29.130
weapon?

888
00:58:30.882 --> 00:58:31.883
No way

889
00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.970
Does Jay Chibu know?

890
00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.871
[Jay] Yoo Yoo-na, let’s meet

891
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:03.790
Give me that mask

892
00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:06.042
Then I'll find your daughter.

893
00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:14.509
[Soaring music]

894
00:59:28.023 --> 00:59:29.941
[Jehyuk] Give me the mask, and I’ll give it to you.

895
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.401
I'm going to the hotel now

896
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.000
Is it Dojae?

897
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.878
Is it Song Je-hyuk?

898
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.885
[Yoojeong] You left work early?

899
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.974
This is our orphanage land.

900
01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:05.644
That's to the promotion committee.
You decided to donate.

901
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.729
I think we need to do that quickly.

902
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.025
There is still no land to build a cultural arts complex.
It's not like I came in.

903
01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:16.279
[Easy breathing] Haemi
Take that first

904
01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.697
[Yoojeong] He wanted me to do it.

905
01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.325
- [Yoojeong] Let’s donate that first.
- No.

906
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:21.868
[Jehyuk] I can’t donate

907
01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.913
If I can't do it, it won't work.

908
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.123
Chairman of the Youngun Foundation Isn't it me?

909
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.125
Is he just the chairman in name?

910
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.921
no, that's not it

911
01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.383
solve that problem
I can't even contact Jay.

912
01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.802
Haemi keeps urging me

913
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.845
Why do you keep
Are you being dragged around by your friends?

914
01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.098
- [Jehyuk] Are you Mojiri?
- [Meaningful music]

915
01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.146
Mo, mojiri?

916
01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:53.650
[Schematic] You are your family
If you don't want to embarrass

917
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.069
Go home and do well in prenatal care.

918
01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.614
A mojiri like you
Hoping to never be born

919
01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.577
How can you say that...

920
01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.040
[Embarrassed exclamation]

921
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.920
[Jehyuk sighs]

922
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.758
I'm sorry

923
01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.636
I'm so angry
I made a mistake

924
01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.557
[Jehyuk’s light sigh]

925
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.602
[Jehyuk] You go forward
I am the person you have to trust and rely on.

926
01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:34.190
You're still just my friends
I think I'm thinking too much

927
01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.026
Please listen to me from now on

928
01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.780
I cherish you the most in the world

929
01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.824
the person who loves you

930
01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.035
your husband

931
01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.163
Because it’s me

932
01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:54.669
yes

933
01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.049
[Jehyuk] I’ll leave for a moment and come back

934
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.761
Don't sleep and wait.

935
01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.388
We're still newlyweds

936
01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:10.935
[Sound of kissing]

937
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.812
[light laughter]

938
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.833
don't worry yeah
If I go, I'll make sure to secure it.

939
01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:39.547
[nervous music]

940
01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.308
[Nervous breathing]

941
01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.609
[Elevator arrival sound]

942
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.736
[Sound of door opening]

943
01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.351
[Jay] Did you come to get this?

944
01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:34.477
[Meaningful sound effects]

945
01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:38.690
[secret music]

946
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.573
What should I do?

947
01:03:47.448 --> 01:03:48.867
I played first

948
01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.288
[Jehyuk] 10 years ago
Are you sitting there?

949
01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.499
I thought you got scared and ran away.

950
01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.668
Do you think you've grown your liver a bit in the meantime?

951
01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:01.713
[rustling sound]

952
01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:04.883
[Jay] That’s right

953
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:09.554
But I'm not scared of you now

954
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.973
To be honest

955
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.767
I'm afraid this mask will fall into my hands

956
01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.312
I feel a bit sorry for him when he looks scared.

957
01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:19.606
[Scoffing] Are you saying I'm scared of you?

958
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.107
It can't be

959
01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.525
Did you forget?

960
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.235
- The statute of limitations has expired.
- [Jay] That's

961
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.655
The owner of this mask
When you didn't know

962
01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:31.451
[Jay] If there is the criminal’s DNA
The statute of limitations has been extended

963
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.078
During the time you ran away abroad

964
01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.831
The statute of limitations is not suspended, i.e.

965
01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:41.002
Your statute of limitations is valid.
quite enough

966
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.090
Let’s say the statute of limitations has been extended

967
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.260
[Laughing] That’s right
What can you do?

968
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.721
[Jehyuk] I told you

969
01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.264
This mask

970
01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:57.644
I did something bad to you
It's not evidence

971
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.730
I know

972
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:03.942
[Jay] So

973
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:05.902
What I will do from now on

974
01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:09.364
That Song Je-hyuk you are writing about
Taking off the mask

975
01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.324
So

976
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:12.992
10 years ago

977
01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.703
That you're the one who raped me

978
01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:17.705
again

979
01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.834
What happened in this room that day
all things

980
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.670
I'll find out everything

981
01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.509
[Laughing] 10 years ago
Are you going to reveal everything?

982
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.512
Then

983
01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.889
You can't touch it

984
01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:36.641
[Jehyuk] Can I touch you?

985
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:38.935
[absurd gasping sound]

986
01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:40.853
That's it

987
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.772
Is this the Angels Club?

988
01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:45.525
[Jay] He wears that mask

989
01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:47.485
Hey [laughter]

990
01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:49.195
You chased me a lot?

991
01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.030
In the meantime

992
01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:53.825
wait

993
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.995
I became the mayor of Tongju
When you hold the tongju in your hand

994
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.748
[Jay] Where is your home base?
what are you doing

995
01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:02.291
Even what the purpose is

996
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.378
I'll expose you all

997
01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.172
Are you looking forward to this?

998
01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.593
You won't disappoint, right? huh?

999
01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.146
Yoo Jeong Ah

1000
01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.692
I think Jay betrayed us.

1001
01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.360
[nervous music]

1002
01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.895
[Elevator arrival sound]

1003
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.271
[Guidance voice] The door opens

1004
01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:06.981
[Soaring music]

1005
01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.492
Did you finish your conversation with Jay?

1006
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.454
So do you want to talk to me now?

1007
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.091
[Sound of people talking]

1008
01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:43.226
- [Sound of clinking dishes]
- [Exciting music]

1009
01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.239
[sudden breathing]

1010
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:00.159
[laughter]

1011
01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.205
Do you like seeing it that way?

1012
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.082
Do you want to get married?

1013
01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:10.002
I like you so much

1014
01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:14.048
[laughter]

1015
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.386
We saw each other for the first time yesterday

1016
01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.721
What do you know about me?

1017
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.557
You can figure it out from now on.

1018
01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.934
I'm curious

1019
01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:27.687
The world of women called Goyunara

1020
01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:38.156
[light laughter]

1021
01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.574
I met you

1022
01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.412
in my life
I think it's the biggest luck

1023
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:49.834
[secret music]

1024
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:06.934
[Yoojeong] You saw Jae-yi?

1025
01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:08.352
where?

1026
01:09:08.436 --> 01:09:09.729
[Haemi] In front of Yuna Hotel

1027
01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.315
- [Jay] Let’s do our best
- [Yuna] Do well, Dojae.

1028
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.360
[Yoojeong] If Jae-yi betrayed us

1029
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.154
What should I do then?

1030
01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:19.822
{\an8}What do you plan to do?

1031
01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.491
{\an8}[Haemi] I’m threatening Dojae with this.

1032
01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:25.203
{\an8}Or I'll hand it over to Song Je-hyuk.

1033
01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.248
{\an8}[Jay] Now that guy is the culprit
It became clear

1034
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:30.917
{\an8}Is this okay?

1035
01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:34.212
{\an8}You're just perfect here

1036
01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.922
{\an8}bottom

1037
01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:37.798
{\an8}[Jehyuk gets angry] Jae-i
Jay, Jay!

1038
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.383
{\an8}Do I look that funny?

1039
01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:40.968
{\an8}[Jehyuk] Sometimes Nana looks for you

1040
01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.638
{\an8}Me, you, our daughter

1041
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.265
{\an8}We had a good time in America

1042
01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.684
{\an8}Tell me

1043
01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:52.688
{\an8}What are Dojae’s future plans?

1044
01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.733
{\an8}[Jay] No matter how much
Even if you wear a perfect mask

1045
01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.527
{\an8}The bare face is revealed
