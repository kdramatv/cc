00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.445
Because my house is close
I think I can just go.

183
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:37.697
Where is your home?

184
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.334
[sigh]

185
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:51.919
[dark music]

186
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.133
[Yuna] Do you know who this person is?

187
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.801
[Nana] Aunt

188
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:02.889
[Yuna] Then

189
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.391
Who is this pretty baby?

190
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.524
I don't know

191
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:14.817
Who are you?

192
00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.656
- [Sigh]
- [Mobile phone vibrating sound]

193
00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.076
[cell phone vibrates]

194
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.086
[Jehyuk] Thank you, Go Yoo-na

195
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.131
Thanks to Dojae
I could have taken a hit

196
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.382
What do you mean?

197
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.718
You punched Jae-yi.

198
00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.803
[Jehyuk] I want to see Nana
He asked me to meet him

199
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.764
Your purpose is ultimately

200
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.432
Were you looking for my club?

201
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.434
[uneasy music]

202
00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:49.644
If it's a business

203
00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.980
Is it a club or something?

204
00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.274
Don't go to Ace Bar.

205
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.069
Because I don’t want you to get hurt either.

206
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.074
You are clearly mistaken
There is

207
00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.577
Dojae to Nana
Do you think you'd be interested?

208
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.497
[Jehyuk] Dojae’s interest is

209
00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:12.500
Just looking for that club with me

210
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.127
- Hey, you're being taken advantage of.
- [Yuna’s angry breathing]

211
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.755
I’m not interested in Dojae either.

212
00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:19.966
My only interest is
I'm looking for Nana

213
00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.676
Because I’m Nana’s real mother!

214
00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.804
I think it'll be hard to find me

215
00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.223
[Jehyuk] Already to Nana

216
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.475
I have a very good mom

217
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.352
What?

218
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.771
Don't even think about seeing me in the future.

219
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.191
Now you and me

220
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.026
It's over

221
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.946
- [Call end sound]
- Song Jehyuk

222
00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:43.364
Song Jehyuk!

223
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:45.908
[Rough breathing]

224
00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:49.912
[Crying breathing]

225
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.419
[Start-up sound]

226
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.429
[tire rubbing sound]

227
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.032
Yuna, go in first.

228
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.201
[Kanghu] Go in carefully

229
00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:39.003
thank you

230
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.546
For taking care of my child

231
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.966
[Jehyuk] Why?
Have you come this far?

232
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.220
There's someone I need to know

233
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.642
10 years ago here
I am a person who did volunteer work.

234
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:55.603
It's a prayer ceremony

235
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:56.687
[nervous music]

236
00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.023
Do you remember?

237
00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.068
[Sound of intake of breath]

238
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.861
If it's a prayer ceremony

239
00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:08.366
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol's deceased son
Are you talking about this?

240
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.409
[Jehyuk] But

241
00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.828
Since I came to the orphanage
It's only been a year

242
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.289
I've never actually seen it either

243
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.002
I guess so.

244
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.379
[Sound of Ganghu taking a deep breath]

245
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.298
[Kanghu] Oh, did I take a wrong step?

246
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.217
prayer ceremony

247
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.344
Why do you recognize that person?

248
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.555
A brother I know
Are you interested in politics?

249
00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.101
With Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
He said he wanted to build friendships.

250
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.603
[Kanghu] So
Son of Rep. Ki Yun-cheol

251
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.647
If you know a little about Mr. Gido-sik’s story,

252
00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:41.899
I'm buying the congressman's heart.

253
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.319
I think it would be helpful
He asked me to look into it.

254
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:47.405
Me too once

255
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.115
I'll ask the employees

256
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.368
I know you must be busy with a lot of work, but thank you.

257
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.328
Well then, that's it

258
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.002
[Sound of car door opening]

259
00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:12.346
[Kanghu] This number belongs to you.

260
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.265
As the uncle said earlier

261
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.268
If anything happens, be sure to contact me
Okay?

262
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.983
- [Sound of fastening seat belt]
- [Start-up sound]

263
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.048
unlucky bastard

264
00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:54.388
[Yuna] Do you know who this person is?

265
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.432
[Nana] Aunt

266
00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.684
[Yuna] Then

267
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.644
Who is this pretty baby?

268
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.272
- [Woman] Now
- [Nana] Mom

269
00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.983
[Nana] I took a bath

270
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:17.828
[Yujeong] Yes, good job, my daughter.

271
00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.123
[Woman] Madam

272
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.418
I'll leave work then

273
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.007
Please talk to me for a moment.

274
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:31.884
[nervous music]

275
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.096
[Sound of dishes rattling]

276
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.064
[sigh]

277
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.907
[Leo] Ugh
What did you drink so much yesterday?

278
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.338
Just a blank expression, huh?

279
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.465
He came in like a cake, ugh.

280
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.928
[Jihee] I saw your groom at the hotel

281
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.471
I heard you were going up to your room?

282
00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.058
It is also the highest presidential floor.

283
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.563
Oh, your groom
You said you were a host before you got married, right?

284
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.232
Isn’t that a mutt who can’t stop pooping?

285
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.072
You said you were going to a ‘cooking class’, right?

286
00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.493
But there is no progress in cooking

287
00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:41.620
It's the same every time

288
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.876
Uh, my sister always eats hangover fish.
That's because I'm looking for kimchi bean sprout soup.

289
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.630
[Leo] Next time, I’ll go with the 9-cheop class.
I'll prepare it for you in a flashy way

290
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.716
Today, sleep

291
00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:01.140
Hey Leo

292
00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:03.434
Are you anxious?

293
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.645
huh? Oh, are you anxious? What is it?

294
00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.983
Hanok hotel crossing the water
I'm in a bad mood at work.

295
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.904
Just in case, I am you
Are you worried that you won’t be able to feed yourself?

296
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.572
Oh my, my sister too

297
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.073
If anyone hears it, I'll be like, huh?

298
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.242
Because of my sister's money
I think you like it

299
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.286
[Leo] You know

300
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:24.038
I like my sister because she’s pretty

301
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.249
It's pretty
When you go out, there are tons of pretty girls.

302
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.459
[Leo] What are you talking about?

303
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:33.255
I was born as pretty as my sister
i have never seen

304
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:38.302
older sister

305
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.888
Whenever I get the chance, I tell my sister
Do you know why you're texting?

306
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.225
It's so pretty that I'm afraid someone else will steal it

307
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.770
[heavy music]

308
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:52.733
Chareo

309
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:56.528
me somehow
Just feed yourself

310
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.281
So you only trust your sister

311
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.699
Got it?

312
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:02.993
Don't do anything else

313
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.412
Yes, I understand.

314
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:08.582
Can you give me some water?

315
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.959
[Leo] Yes

316
00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:12.086
water

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.677
[Sound of refrigerator opening and closing]

318
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.058
[Haemi] President Jeong

319
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:27.184
meet me

320
00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.560
[Message sending sound]

321
00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.357
[Leo] Okay, here’s the water.

322
00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.318
thank you

323
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:50.207
[blender button sound]

324
00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.001
[Blender operating sound]

325
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.801
[Yoojeong] Our Nana
I have to wash my face nicely and go to kindergarten.

326
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.928
[Yujeong’s surprised gasp] It’s so pretty.

327
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:05.097
[Yujeong’s yin mouth sound]

328
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.861
[Jehyuk] What about your aunt?

329
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.156
-Are you resting today?
- [Yoojeong] Don’t come anymore

330
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:23.741
[Yoojeong] I sent it out.

331
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:25.868
[Jehyuk] Why?

332
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.706
[Yoojeong] I will hand over the foundation to you.

333
00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.001
Because the culture and arts complex is also gone.

334
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.839
Now all that's left for me is
It's just this assumption

335
00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:41.717
Now I'm going to do it all

336
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:43.635
with my own hands

337
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.888
Without a single gap

338
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.392
[Jehyuk] Don’t overdo it.

339
00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:52.227
Okay?

340
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:58.442
I mean your ex-wife.

341
00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:00.569
- [Nervous music]
- [Yoojeong] Perhaps

342
00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.154
Do you know where it is?

343
00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:06.116
You said you were in prison in America.

344
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.160
Maybe he's out of jail

345
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.746
You may have come to Korea

346
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.457
[Embarrassed gasp] Why are you curious?
Something like that

347
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.003
[Yoojeong] You’re running for mayoral election.

348
00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:21.256
Then your private life will be revealed.

349
00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:25.177
Suddenly my ex-wife appears

350
00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:27.513
Because if you say something strange, you'll be in trouble

351
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.267
I don't think that will happen much.

352
00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:34.561
How are you so sure?

353
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.316
[Yoojeong] Do you know anything about your ex-wife?

354
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:41.902
No, not at all

355
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.905
I have no idea

356
00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:48.325
[Jehyuk] Nice to meet you.

357
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:52.037
To Mr. Yujeong
I didn't know you had a friend like this

358
00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:54.123
You didn't know me

359
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:55.916
I feel sorry

360
00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.461
We were pretty close friends

361
00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:02.881
I guess there’s still a lot we don’t know about each other?

362
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.639
- [Meaningful music]
- Then

363
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:13.308
me

364
00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:16.770
You don't have to worry about her?

365
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.359
[Jehyuk] Yes, don’t worry about it.
you

366
00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:32.119
cool

367
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:33.912
my husband

368
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:38.041
Then with this wonderful husband

369
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.252
Should we go somewhere?

370
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.089
[Sound of people talking]

371
00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:56.059
[Yuncheol’s laughter] Oh my
How are you?

372
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.020
Oh my, Chairman.

373
00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.063
[Yuncheol’s laughter] Oh, you must be busy.

374
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.150
Thank you for accepting this invitation
thank you

375
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:07.696
I thought it was a quiet event, but
It's pretty noisy

376
00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:09.740
[laughter]

377
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.785
On this occasion, Chairman Kang
Whose side are you on?

378
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.371
[Yuncheol] Oh my god
It clearly shows

379
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.415
Doesn’t that make sense?

380
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:20.584
Whose side should I be on?

381
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.130
[Yuncheol] Oh, you’re there at the right time.

382
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:28.300
- [Dark Music]
- Chairman Kang

383
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:30.594
People who should definitely be on your side

384
00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:40.395
[Yoojeong] Why are you putting me in this place?
Did you bring it with you?

385
00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.815
here

386
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:45.943
Is there anyone who feels uncomfortable?

387
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.947
No, it's not like that.

388
00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:54.493
I'm a bit shy, so...

389
00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:57.788
Then let me say hello.

390
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:01.208
supporting me
Because they are very grateful people

391
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:15.847
[Yuncheol] Welcome

392
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.474
Candidate Jehyuk Song

393
00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:18.767
Congratulations on the establishment of the foundation

394
00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:22.813
Hello, congressman

395
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.482
Oh my, Chairman Joo Yu-jeong.

396
00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:27.484
thank you for coming

397
00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:31.238
[Yuncheol] Married life
You seem to be very nice.

398
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:34.157
The face is just
It bloomed, it bloomed [laughter]

399
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:43.583
Hello! Chairman

400
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:02.519
- [Elegant music plays]
- [Yuna] If you have anything to do, come to the hotel.

401
00:26:02.853 --> 00:26:03.854
What restaurant?

402
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.898
[Jay] Let’s just have brunch.

403
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:10.110
Have brunch with friends
Isn't it like that?

404
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.327
[Yuna] I went to Ace Bar

405
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.370
Are you saying it didn't go well?

406
00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:22.998
Is Song Je-hyuk like that?

407
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.208
I got hit

408
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.502
[sigh]

409
00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.629
I never thought you would fool me too

410
00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:31.798
[Yuna] No matter what
I'm his mother

411
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:38.972
[Yuna’s sigh]

412
00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:42.225
It's a secret club and all.

413
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.311
First of all, starting with Song Je-hyuk
Can't we solve it?

414
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:47.272
I'm looking for Nana
One o'clock is urgent

415
00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.107
I am Song Je-hyuk

416
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.401
I want to kill you right now

417
00:26:51.902 --> 00:26:52.944
But

418
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.654
[Jay] There is no evidence of sexual assault

419
00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:56.114
The statute of limitations has expired

420
00:26:56.907 --> 00:26:58.200
The way to catch Song Je-hyuk is

421
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:00.702
I think it's the only secret club

422
00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:07.376
[Yuna’s sigh]

423
00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:09.961
I have somewhere to eat and go

424
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.881
Do you want to go together?

425
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:14.716
[camera shutter sound]

426
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.178
Because all the important people came

427
00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:20.722
press conference
Let's get started

428
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.433
my article

429
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:27.729
On the front page of the newspaper
You have to give it to me

430
00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:29.815
[Reporters, Yun Cheol’s laughter]

431
00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:31.608
[Reporter 1] Rep.

432
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.611
In your son's name
established a scholarship foundation

433
00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:37.072
-Tell me why.
- [Yuncheol] Ah

434
00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:38.615
10 years ago

435
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:41.410
-My son.
- [Continued camera shutter sound]

436
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:43.870
was unfairly killed

437
00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:46.206
- [Yuncheol] He’s so smart.
- [Dark Music]

438
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.667
I was a righteous child

439
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:52.295
To such a child
Why did such a terrible thing happen?

440
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.508
[sniffling sound]

441
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.593
When a child dies

442
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:01.138
There is a saying that you should ask your heart

443
00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:03.515
I'm not a heart

444
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.351
I wanted to engrave it in the world

445
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:08.770
That's it

446
00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.772
In my son's name

447
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.775
This is why we created the scholarship foundation

448
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:18.238
[Reporter 2] To the conference room today
Why did you choose this daycare center?

449
00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:20.991
Running for Tongju mayoral election
To Candidate Jehyuk Song

450
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.659
Is it to empower you?

451
00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.372
[laughter]

452
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.876
I guess that's the way it is
There is no such thing.

453
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.380
Candidate Song Je-hyuk is a newcomer to politics.

454
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.675
[Yuncheol] I still need my help
I need a lot

455
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:39.760
I

456
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:43.305
Can I tell you something?

457
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.224
Oh, if you have anything to say
Later…

458
00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:47.809
[Reporter 3] Please say something.
Candidate

459
00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:49.311
[Reporter 4] Candidate Song, please ask me a favor.

460
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.604
[Reporters talking]

461
00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:59.237
I have my own daycare
Why was it allowed as a conference venue?

462
00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.324
It's all because of our children

463
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.579
[Jehyuk] Many people from Tongju City

464
00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:09.915
You should pay more attention

465
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.792
A lot of donations are coming in.

466
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.251
our children

467
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:15.587
You can grow up more prosperous.

468
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.923
So what I need now is

469
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.716
Tongju citizens

470
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.178
You support my dreams

471
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:25.055
Everyone

472
00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:27.098
Not that Song Je-hyuk

473
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:29.893
please support my dream

474
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:33.480
thank you

475
00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.323
[applause]

476
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.118
[Sangkuk] Then this time
You are the spouse of candidate Song Je-hyuk.

477
00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.371
I would like to ask Chairman Joo Yoo-jeong.

478
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.706
Just a little while ago, right here

479
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.292
Candidate Do Jae-i
He declared his candidacy for mayor of Tongju.

480
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.420
At that time, the provincial candidate
You said you supported it.

481
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:58.505
But

482
00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:00.549
The candidate has changed.

483
00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:03.593
With a very honest heart

484
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:06.888
If candidate Song Je-hyuk
Even if it's not my husband

485
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:09.474
Would you support candidate Song Je-hyuk?

486
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:12.310
[uneasy music]

487
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.398
tell me

488
00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:18.108
I'm curious too

489
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:19.901
[Jehyuk] Your heart

490
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.871
[Yujeong] As an old friend

491
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:34.207
I am candidate Do Jae-i.
I am sincerely rooting for you

492
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.501
But

493
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:39.796
As you heard a moment ago

494
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:43.592
Candidate Song Je-hyuk is more interested in

495
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:46.136
by making others happy

496
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.722
feeling happier
That's the kind of person

497
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.434
So, I believe that candidate Song Je-hyuk is

498
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.061
Even if it's not my husband

499
00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:57.480
For the sake of the citizens of Tongju City

500
00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:01.234
I would have supported candidate Song Je-hyuk.

501
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.783
[Jehyuk] I
I think I got a good wife.

502
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.452
[Jehyuk, reporters laugh]

503
00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.078
[Yuna] You brought me here
Why?

504
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.623
Because this is the Angels Club

505
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.251
This is Angels Club?

506
00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:20.337
He said he wasted it.

507
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.463
Watch

508
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.256
I

509
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.800
This is the Angels Club

510
00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:27.510
I'll prove it

511
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.890
- [Secret Music]
- [Reporter 5] Huh? Candidate Do Jae-i

512
00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:34.476
[camera shutter sound]

513
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:40.899
[Sang-guk] Candidate Do Jae-i

514
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.692
No, how come here…

515
00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.032
[Jay] The day of my candidacy declaration ceremony

516
00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:52.035
Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
You graced the occasion

517
00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:55.997
But I went to the congressman’s event
You can't miss it, right?

518
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.082
[Yuncheol] As expected

519
00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.708
Our candidate Do Jae-i is

520
00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:02.712
He is a very polite person [laughter]

521
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:05.632
[Jay] Hello, candidate Song Je-hyuk.

522
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:09.260
Maybe I came
You're not in the way, are you?

523
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.971
Is that possible?

524
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.640
Welcome, candidate Do Jae-i.

525
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:17.811
[Continued camera shutter sound]

526
00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.315
Don't mind me

527
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.150
[Jay] Let’s proceed.

528
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.445
All this time
Let me take a look around the orphanage here.

529
00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:31.199
Heck, Rep. Ki Yun-cheol too
Candidate Song Je-hyuk also

530
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.785
Why am I so attached to this place?

531
00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:35.328
I want to know something

532
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.094
[Jehyuk] Are you going to stay still?

533
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:53.138
Shouldn’t you at least step on the back?

534
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.557
[Yuncheol] To me now
Are you giving instructions?

535
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:58.309
[Jehyuk] I can go
There isn't one, right?

536
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:00.854
[Reporter 6] Candidate Song
Let’s finish the interview.

537
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:03.106
[Reporters talking]

538
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.316
[Jehyuk] Yes [laughter]

539
00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:09.612
[Birdsong]

540
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:22.208
[nervous music]

541
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:42.228
[Sound of door opening]

542
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:03.750
[Sound of door opening]

543
00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:07.420
[Child 1] Yeji, come quickly

544
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.478
[Sound of door closing]

545
00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:28.108
[Child 1] Hurry up and give it to me, what you got

546
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.069
I hate it
Why are you giving what I received to you?

547
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:33.738
[Child 1] Because you are still young
I received a lot

548
00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:35.532
- That’s because they don’t give it to me just because I’m all grown up.
- [Meaningful music]

549
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:38.743
[Child 3] Hey
Yeji is better than him

550
00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:41.454
Because it hurts
Angels give more

551
00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:44.374
[Child 1] Good, your legs hurt.

552
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:48.169
If I get sick too
The angels will give you more

553
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.798
- [Child 1] Ah, ah, please share some.
- [Child 3] Please share some.

554
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.050
- [Child 2] Huh? Yejiya
- [Child 3] Please

555
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:57.679
- [Nervous music]
- [Jay] Guys, I'm sorry, were you surprised?

556
00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.140
What are you giving away?

557
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:03.059
And who are the angels?

558
00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:05.812
[Children’s embarrassed exclamations]

559
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.440
- Wait.
- [Sound of door opening]

560
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.109
- [Jay] Wait a minute
- [Child 1] Come quickly

561
00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:16.072
[Jay] Yeji

562
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:17.866
Wait a minute

563
00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:19.826
Wait a minute

564
00:35:20.743 --> 00:35:21.744
It's okay

565
00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:25.748
Aunt
I'm friends with the chairman here.

566
00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:26.916
You can talk

567
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:29.752
Who are those angels?

568
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.172
Those people told Yeji
What did you give me a lot?

569
00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:35.300
That

570
00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:36.718
[Yeji] That’s it

571
00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:38.094
- Yes
- [Ilgu] Jay

572
00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.311
[uneasy music]

573
00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.193
[Jay] Why did you call me?

574
00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:55.236
What are you going to do if someone sees it?

575
00:35:57.363 --> 00:35:59.532
[Ilgu] Still, the greetings
I felt like I had to do it.

576
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.328
Aren’t you worried?

577
00:36:04.913 --> 00:36:06.581
[Jay] Just in case I go to the election

578
00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:10.084
my father
Kang Il-gu is the chairman of Kangbo Group.

579
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.794
Should we at least talk?

580
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.383
Then I said hello and that's it.

581
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.722
How can I get on Song Je-hyuk’s side?
Can you stand?

582
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:26.100
- [Dark Music]
- I don't even know what kind of guy he is.

583
00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:50.625
[Sound of door closing]

584
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:55.505
[nervous music]

585
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:56.839
[Yuna] I try my best

586
00:36:58.299 --> 00:36:59.968
I'm going to create a market for my husband.

587
00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.512
To my old fiancé’s father
I have to say hello too

588
00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:05.014
[Yujeong’s sigh]

589
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.225
It must be hard for you too

590
00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:09.602
the child he gave birth to

591
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.813
I can't even look proudly

592
00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:16.234
[Soaring music]

593
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.652
[Yuna] You

594
00:37:18.987 --> 00:37:20.488
What do you know and are you fussing about?

595
00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:22.407
no

596
00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:24.575
I don't know, nothing

597
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:29.497
What I know is

598
00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:32.041
The past is just the past

599
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.751
[Yoojeong] So I

600
00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.920
Because of that past

601
00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:38.172
My precious family now

602
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:39.924
There will be no waking up

603
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.301
no matter what happens

604
00:37:42.176 --> 00:37:44.971
Seeing it come out this strong
I feel like I know something

605
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:47.932
[Yuna] Then you don’t know that?

606
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:51.185
your husband is pure to you
I didn't approach it

607
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.021
- [Meaningful music]
- What?

608
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.063
[Yuna] The prayer ceremony was like that too.

609
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.691
More about what you have than about you
I got greedy

610
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:00.987
Let me give you some advice.

611
00:38:03.156 --> 00:38:05.199
You just keep what you got

612
00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:07.327
abandon the man

613
00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:10.580
What did that guy say?

614
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:13.124
[Yoojeong] What I want to protect is

615
00:38:13.499 --> 00:38:15.251
That's not just one guy

616
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:18.129
my husband

617
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.757
It's the perfect family with my child

618
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.633
I

619
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.053
no matter what happens

620
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:26.679
I will protect it

621
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:28.598
my husband

622
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:31.434
And my child too

623
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:34.020
[Soaring music]

624
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:40.693
Is it Jane?

625
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.862
I'll go first, I have an appointment.

626
00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:45.823
[sigh]

627
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:06.302
[Yuncheol] Oh my!
It’s been a while, Go Yoo-na.

628
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:10.431
We are so happy together
I don't think so

629
00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:11.599
[laughter]

630
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.644
I think there's some misunderstanding.

631
00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:18.731
That Song Je-hyuk
I'm not the person who looks after you

632
00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:21.317
[Yuncheol] He’s a person who behaves like a dog.

633
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.361
[Yooncheol’s bitter intake of breath]

634
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:24.612
But

635
00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.864
Is it because I didn't wear a leash?

636
00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:29.409
It seems like I'm being a bit picky.

637
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.495
That's what I'm saying

638
00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:34.622
Our Yoo Yoo-na

639
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.166
I'll give it to Song Jehyuk.

640
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.585
Could you please get me a leash?

641
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.631
[Kanghu’s sigh]

642
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.686
[Kangjun] What’s going on?
You made all the contact

643
00:39:57.937 --> 00:39:59.981
I thought you broke up your family register.

644
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:02.984
I have a favor to ask you

645
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:04.694
[Kangjun] Please?

646
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:07.155
Are we doing each other a favor?

647
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.366
When others see
Although they are blood brothers, in reality

648
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.535
We are worse than others.

649
00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.748
Okay, let's hear it, what are you asking for?

650
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.042
[sigh]

651
00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.920
February 18, 2013

652
00:40:23.463 --> 00:40:25.131
- At Grand Gangbo Hotel
- [Meaningful music]

653
00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.593
Son of National Assembly member Ki Yun-cheol
A man named Ki Do-sik was murdered.

654
00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.220
[Kanghu] That incident
I want to take a look

655
00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:33.347
Media articles at the time also
A lot has been deleted

656
00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:36.058
There's no way to find out

657
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:38.811
So

658
00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.647
Could you please get me some information on that case?

659
00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:43.566
Why do you do that?

660
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.278
Just save me, bro.

661
00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.114
what am i doing
You're not interested

662
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.284
Oh, you cocky bastard

663
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.286
If you save me

664
00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:57.538
What will you do for me?

665
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.083
I'll give up my inheritance

666
00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.795
This is the answer you want

667
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:15.515
[sigh]

668
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.272
[Closing sound]

669
00:41:37.078 --> 00:41:39.705
[President] Ah, that
You are talking about foresight.

670
00:41:39.789 --> 00:41:40.957
I know it well

671
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:44.168
Among the children at Angelang Orphanage
A child with impaired legs

672
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.253
Because I have wisdom

673
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.090
[Jay] Then that kid came and
When buying things

674
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.802
This is a free gift
Could you please give me some?

675
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:59.475
Ah, Yeji, this is the child I am sponsoring.

676
00:42:00.142 --> 00:42:02.311
But to just give it to that child,

677
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.438
[Laughing] To other kids
I'm a bit sorry

678
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:05.982
[light laughter]

679
00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:09.652
Yes, even those kids.
It's a bit difficult to take care of everything.

680
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:13.489
[President] I secretly
I will only give it to Yeji.

681
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:14.865
Pretend it's a free gift

682
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.618
- thank you
- [President’s light smile]

683
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:25.334
[Jay’s cool breathing]

684
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.005
[Sim-ok] Sundae soup that I ate every day when I was young

685
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.798
Don't you get bitten?

686
00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:34.010
[Jay] No, I like it so much

687
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.261
[laughter]

688
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:39.056
That's why they say you can't fake blood

689
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:44.437
Your dad too
How much do you like sundae soup?

690
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.188
[Sim-ok’s surprised gasp] Child
I'm surprised

691
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:49.317
Is he still here?
You told me not to let you come.

692
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.277
Grandma, why don't you listen to me?

693
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.613
[Sim-ok] No matter what
It's him!

694
00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:55.698
- [Dark Music]
- Then you can't use it.

695
00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:56.949
Still, he's your dad

696
00:42:58.451 --> 00:42:59.452
grandmother

697
00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:01.078
Did I see him today?

698
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.330
[Jay] But do you know where I saw it?

699
00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.832
At my mayoral rivalry event

700
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:06.709
that person

701
00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:08.294
not me

702
00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:11.547
the guy I want to kill
I was next to you

703
00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:25.144
[Sound of a bag being put down]

704
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:36.614
What is this?

705
00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:39.075
[Sim-ok] Your election funds

706
00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:40.993
Kang Il-gu

707
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:43.120
Your dad sent it to you

708
00:43:43.913 --> 00:43:44.914
That person

709
00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:46.248
My campaign finances?

710
00:43:48.918 --> 00:43:51.087
I'm not sure

711
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:56.175
Your dad is the person you want to kill
If you were next to me

712
00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:58.302
That's probably

713
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.429
There must be a reason

[Yoojeong] Huh? But my Nana
You don’t look good?

724
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.305
What happened at kindergarten?

725
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:47.393
That's not because I'm jealous of the local area.

726
00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:49.895
Why are you jealous of the local area?

727
00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:54.900
The local mom
He said he plays with Hyunji at the playground every day.

Is there any cider?

I'm not looking for cider

755
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.834
You need to quit sweet potatoes

756
00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:37.586
Sweet potatoes?

757
00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:39.338
I didn't eat sweet potatoes

758
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:42.800
Because there's something that stings me
It's not frustrating!

759
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:47.263

Vice President Hae-mi Yoon
Didn't you start over again?

Well, the couple has a secret
It's okay if you hit me, okay?

766
00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:09.702
I will never do drugs again

767
00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:13.706
[Haemi] So, Leo
Don't make me work again

768

Do you look like a madam?

That's the vice president of the hotel.
What's so great?

774
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.683
Should I bow to your words?

[laughter]

776
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:38.147

[Man-ok] What’s going on?

780
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.667
If you came because you wanted to have a drink...

781
00:47:58.751 --> 00:47:59.835
I'm done drinking

782
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.420
just

783
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:03.422
I came to see you

[laughter]

785
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:07.885
It's my sister

786
00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.929
[Man-ok] When I see you doing old tricks,

787
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.390
He said he had a favor to ask of me.

788
00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.309
What is it?

789
00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.728
Actually

790
00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.230
[Jehyuk] Because of Rep. Ki Yun-cheol
came

791
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.191
[Man-ok] Rep. Ki?

792
00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:23.776
why?

793
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.321
Rep. Ki and Chairman Song
Aren’t you in the same boat?

794
00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.073
I've already boarded one boat.

795
00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:31.575
But still
Because he thought you were the captain.

796
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:34.745
[Jehyuk] You decided to push me.

797
00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:37.331
Give me the captain's seat
You have to give it to me

798
00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:38.832
[Manok] So

799
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:42.419
Could you please give Chairman Song some power?

[Man-ok’s intake of breath]

801
00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:45.297
By the way

We have to sink the external enemy

If Chairman Song becomes mayor of Tongju,

In Tongju City

814
00:49:23.168 --> 00:49:25.462

I still

824

You become the mayor of Tongju.
I'm not sure

825
00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:57.953
It could be Jay

842
00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:18.992
[Yoojeong] Why is it like that?

843
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.829
I told you I sent your aunt away.

844
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.958
[Jehyuk] Without you, aunt
I don't think I can do well on my own.

I played with Nana for a day
While having such a hard time

846

Do you know what your aunt did?

He said he entrusted Nana to me.

848

[Yoojeong] To that kind of aunt
How can I entrust Nana to you?

849
00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:41.682
What should I do if something big happens?

850
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.642
A strange woman?

851
00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:45.143
yes

Oh my

854
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:57.197
[Jehyuk] Is Nana really your aunt?
It would be a big deal if you left it to a stranger.

855
00:51:58.282 --> 00:51:59.283
But

856
00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:01.285
Do you know what's bigger than that?

857
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:05.289
because of you
I will lose to Dojae.

858
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.542
Are you losing to Jae-yi because of me?

[Jehyuk] Youngwoon Foundation
Do you know why it has become difficult?

00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:15.424
It's Dojae
In the cultural arts complex project

861
00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:17.175
Because I pushed you

862

But

For your noble pride
Are you afraid it will get scratched?

No way

874
00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:51.251

Isn’t it more important than our family?

protecting our home
The most important way is

Never again, never contact that girl again

Don't worry about that girl anymore.

Is there any other reason?

922

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.145
[Jay] Move anywhere

1077
01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:49.190
Because I will run right away

1078
01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:50.817
[cell phone vibrates]

1079
01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.989
{\an8}[Yuna] Why do you need a mask?
I'll tell you

1080
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:58.950
- Come to my hotel.
- [Meaningful music]

1081
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.171
[Doorbell sounds]

1082
01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.781
[Heavy breathing]

1083
01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:43.744
[sigh]

1084
01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:54.589
[Sound of door opening]

1085
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.799
[Sound of door closing]

1086
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.481
Have you been drinking?

1087
01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.984
[Sigh] I think I'm going to die

1088
01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:18.613
take me to the hotel

1089
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:24.994
wait a moment

1090
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.579
I'll come back after tidying up.

1091
01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.313
[Yuna] Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Kanghoo.

1092
01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.609
I want to sit here for a moment

1093
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.611
[Yuna’s labored breathing]

1094
01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:00.988
[Yuna’s deep sigh]

1095
01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:27.932
[Kanghu] Go up quickly
How about taking a break?

1096
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:37.483
[Yuna] Oh

1097
01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.694
I can go up now

1098
01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.404
[Yuna’s labored breathing]

1099
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.325
[Sound of elevator closing]

1100
01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.850
[rattling sound]

1101
01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.568
[Sound of door opening and closing]

1102
01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:03.778
- [Secret Music]
- [cough]

1103
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.156
[shaking breathing]

1104
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.326
[Doshik’s strong breathing] Dad

1105
01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.661
[in a difficult voice] Dad

1106
01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.024
[Meaningful music]

1107
01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:00.918
[Jehyuk] Do Jae-i

1108
01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:03.129
- [Camera shutter sound]
- Go Yoo-na

1109
01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:04.964
Following the oil well

1110
01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:07.174
Are you the only one left?

1111
01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.551
Mr. Haemi

1112
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.928
{\an8}[Haemi] There’s a saying like that in gambling circles.

1113
01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.597
{\an8}'What the hell is going on in this gambling table?
'Who is Hogu?'

1114
01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:14.765
{\an8}Seeker

1115
01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.642
{\an8}They say that person is a bigot.

1116
01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:17.685
{\an8}What do you mean?

1117
01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:19.854
{\an8}[Shouting] You are the bastard!

1118
01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.106
{\an8}What's wrong with you, sister?

1119
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:23.983
{\an8}- [Shouting] Please go!
- [Leo] Sister!

1120
01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:26.360
{\an8}- [Jay] Song Jehyuk, that guy
- [Jehyuk’s laughter]

1121
01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:28.028
{\an8}Playing with all four of us

1122
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:30.948
{\an8}The way for us to survive now is

1123
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.533
{\an8}That's the only way

1124
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.662
{\an8}To catch Song Je-hyuk's corruption
